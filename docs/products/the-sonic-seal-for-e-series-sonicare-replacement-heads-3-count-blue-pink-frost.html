            <li>This is an incredibly brilliant idea!</li>
            <li>Great idea!</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s brush gets incredibly funky because of how she rinses it when finished.</li>
            <li>This is a great add-on to a superb Sonic product!  </li>
            <li>but once it is on you are good to go!</li>
            <li>She is delighted, as well!</li>
            <li>I am happy to say they work as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I thought this would be a great product, but I guess I didn&#x27;t think it through.  </li>
            <li>The Sonic Seals works great.  </li>
            <li>This seal work great at keeping the moisture out of brush innards - once you manage to get it on.  </li>
            <li>These are great.  </li>
            <li>Been a couple of months now and still working great.  </li>
            <li>This is a great idea, and a product that works well.  </li>
            <li>they are a great time-saver.  </li>
            <li>Great compliment to any Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>This product has been great for my sonicare toothbrush except for one thing.  </li>
            <li>The product that is on my brush now has been great and has been serving its purpose to keep the water out.</li>
            <li>It was a great idea when you have two people sharing a sonic and need to know who&#x27;s replacement head is who&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>so this 3 packed worked great</li>
            <li>These seals are a great patch for a design flaw.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Once done though, it works great.</li>
            <li>This product works great -</li>
            <li>These are a great solution to the issue of water getting through the connection points.</li>
            <li>The concept is great, but if you cannot get them on, what&#x27;s the use?</li>
            <li>These silicone based seals are of great value when you have any of the E-series Sonicare toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Once they are on they do a great job of keeping all the gunk out of the inside of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>These have worked great and have kept the yuck out of our toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>These work great.</li>
            <li>These seals for the Sonicare heads are great.  </li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>It would be great if they would make the connection waterproof but they probably won&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s nice that you can wash and reuse the covers!</li>
            <li>With it worked, good idea in theory</li>
            <li>Now we each have our own handle and I am so happy with this.  </li>
            <li>though, I will say they LOOK good, but that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li>Although it was a good idea.</li>
            <li>The purpose of the seal may be good</li>
            <li>What a good idea for the sonicare heads.</li>
            <li>stars for a product that does what it says and looks good doing it.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>but once it&#x27;s on, it&#x27;s on for good.  </li>
            <li>this is good solution.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use and works great - just as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve experienced they slimy goo that builds up inside the head.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m happy :)</li>
            <li>OK I&#x27;m a color-monster (for lack of the ability to post a stronger word), and thought these colors were the coolest!</li>
            <li>I LOVE these!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>You will love it, I promise!</li>
            <li>I love this item!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love these things, just wish they were cheaper!</li>
            <li>best bet is to buy these when you first purchase your toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>Will buy more again soon!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say how glad I am that someone came up with these!</li>
            <li>I will always try to fix something on my own first; and I try my best to end with quality results.</li>
            <li>It works great although just one would&#x27;ve been fine.</li>
            <li>FYI, I keep my sonicare in the shower at all timesâ€¦.pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>This effectively solves the problem.</li>
            <li>Its so nice not having the nastyness build up in the brush.</li>
            <li>and I would have liked to have known that before purchasing.  </li>
            <li>Nice try</li>
            <li>This rubber accessory solves that problem nicely.</li>
            <li>My husband and I each wanted our own toothbrush, and didn&#x27;t want to have to swap out heads.</li>
            <li>Because we each have our own handle</li>
            <li>I get it these colors are great for your kids, but a clear or whote one for adults would be ideal.</li>
            <li>but it would be nice if the seal was a 1/4\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice because it helps my husband</li>
            <li>AFTER purchasing these covers, I realized they have their own website...</li>
            <li>these covers are definitely effective.  </li>
            <li>I liked the concept of them...</li>
            <li>These are a nice idea.  </li>
            <li>One day while cleaning my toothbrush I thought about how nice it would be if there was a cover that would prevent all this build up.</li>
            <li>&amp; then when they tear up, I&#x27;m making my own.</li>
            <li>If you own a Sonicare E-Series, the Sonic Seal is a must-have item.</li>
            <li>so they grip nicely in hand and are quite snug on the brush head so no water or crud gets under them.</li>
            <li>I have a nice nightlight as well as a cover for my Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re kind of a pain to get on.</li>
            <li>Colors are nice too.</li>
            <li>maybe it&#x27;s a good idea to take better care of your $100 toothbrush.</li>
            <li>super easy to put on..works perfect.</li>
            <li>It is actually incredible just how much stuff gets INSIDE!  </li>
            <li>They tear very easily.</li>
            <li>These seals break very easily</li>
            <li>The bottom part of the seal ripped very easily as I tugged it onto my brush cover.  </li>
            <li>I love not having to worry about what kind of gunk it building up inside my toothbrush.</li>
            <li>But this silicone sleeve is working nicely and we can practice safe brushing.</li>
            <li>Works great and the price was right.</li>
            <li>So easy!</li>
            <li>So ideally you&#x27;d want something looking decent and sturdy that will survive reusing and that&#x27;s where this comes in.</li>
            <li>If someone has any feedback please feel very free to email me with the information.</li>
            <li>No grey slime and seals working perfectly.</li>
            <li>No ripping, no tearing, and looks just as good as the first time I put it on my Sonicare!</li>
            <li>Ok so I tried the glove finger thing and it works ok.</li>
            <li>It was more of a hassle than a solution for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel the cost of the brush heads are much more overpriced than these.</li>
            <li>They help identify Sonicaire toothbrushes which is helpful if your bathroom has more than one.  </li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>I do think hydrogen peroxide cleans better than alcohol/</li>
            <li>if more than one person uses the brush handle.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I figured it out before I went on for who knows how many years of ineffective teeth cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I have used a Sonicare brush for many years.</li>
            <li>We love our Philips Sonicare tooth brushes.</li>
            <li>These seals are better used if you are not sharing a Sonic Care unit.</li>
            <li>Better off using a manual brush if you want to use these.  </li>
            <li>Should be a better description of how to do.</li>
            <li>Feb2013*****Having ordered these, what? more than 2 years ago?</li>
            <li>I honestly thought the seal would reduce the sound level, but to my surprise, it make it even louder.  </li>
            <li>Sure does keep the insides from gunking up.  </li>
            <li>They couldn&#x27;t figure out that water might be able to get inside?  </li>
            <li>And more every six or so applications and</li>
            <li>Make sure plastic cap is off of toothbrush head and take care not to over stretch cover</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made of sturdy silicone that feels like it will survive, aesthetically it&#x27;s ok looking</li>
            <li>after many attempts.  </li>
            <li>also, I agree with some reviewers, they should come up with a better color selection.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure glad that I did.  </li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>, then it would be much much better.</li>
            <li>OK - a lot clearer.</li>
            <li>Price is ok.</li>
            <li>I would not use most models of sonicare without this seal.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These work as advertised and immediately make you feel better about no longer</li>
            <li>I love these.  </li>
            <li>There is some quite of difficulty fitting it in</li>
            <li>they should be more durable for this price.</li>
            <li>I love my brush cover.</li>
            <li>Brush head goes into dish washer periodically for more thorough cleaning and sanitizing.</li>
            <li>I tried one more week</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>OK.  </li>
            <li>These have kept our toothbrushes gunk free!</li>
            <li>I am so glad this was suggested to me by Amazon.</li>
            <li>If you can find them cheaper elsewhere, or where you don&#x27;t pay shipping, you&#x27;d be better off.</li>
            <li>If you have ever opened your Sonicare toothbrush and seen the goo and gunk that builds up inside, you will love these.</li>
            <li>Even better, I&#x27;ve been able to reuse these.</li>
            <li>It tore along the top as I pulled it over the brush head.</li>
            <li>When I saw these were a great price here on Amazon, I bought them for stocking stuffers for the whole</li>
            <li>Does not seal the head therefore it now traps more gunk than before.</li>
            <li>I love this and will continue to purchase this product because it keeps the water out.</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed !!</li>
            <li>It makes it very easy to keep the toothbrush clean and is fairly easy to put on the brush!</li>
            <li>but they are nice and it help kids keep handle clean ...</li>
            <li>stays nice and clean - no residual gunk.</li>
            <li>clean which is nice.  </li>
            <li>Found that flipping the bottom inside out once it was over the brush and then rolling it over the nut worked pretty good.</li>
            <li>I saw these recommended on Amazon, they are totally worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>Still clean as a whistle!</li>
            <li>I never need to clean the gunk out of my sonicare again!  </li>
            <li>, I change my toothbrush - completely clean on the inside!  </li>
            <li>I have always had to clean around my brush head and handle!  </li>
            <li>I think Amazon overcharges some people to make up for those purchasing more and getting free shipping.</li>
            <li>The idea is fantastic but the material needs to be more durable.</li>
            <li>Product came quickly and was very easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Our toothbrushes are easy to keep clean!</li>
            <li>A nice bonus about the bright colors is that my wife and I no longer get our toothbrushes mixed up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product works as described and makes cleaning Sonic head easy / non- existent.  </li>
            <li>and if you put a bit of cornstarch in it before sliding it, it will be easy as a breeze..</li>
            <li>but thought I&#x27;d let people know, they are easy to get on.  </li>
            <li>I love the cover idea because all you have to do it rinse off the toothbrush each time after use and it stays clean.</li>
            <li>On the one hand, I love my toothbrush to be clean in a hassle-free way.</li>
            <li>They went on fairly easily, but as I tried to tug all the way to the bottom, they tore.</li>
            <li>These are a bit of a challenge to install, but they work perfectly and they do help keep the underside of the brush head clean and dry.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re swapping out heads all the time, it&#x27;s just as easy to rise it off with soap and water.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes for easy rinsing off and cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I strongly advise against using this product.</li>
            <li>So I took it off, and I couldn&#x27;t believe how strong the vibrations were.</li>
            <li>Of course I just got them so they have not been used for the full 3 months yet, but what a fantastic idea!</li>
            <li>It slipped right on very easy.  </li>
            <li>6 months later all 3 covers are still holding strong and none of us have slimy gooey heads!!!</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s more important to me that my teeth are clean</li>
            <li>I took my time and was fine.  </li>
            <li>For the DIYers, yes I think you could make your own, but I really didn&#x27;t want to and the gloves idea was cool but looked like it would require more trial and error than I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the idea of having these colorful seals for two reasons; 1) it would prevent filtration of toothpaste and water into the Sonicare toothbrush and 2) the colorful seals would make it easy to identify among family members.</li>
            <li>These little seals do an awesome job of keeping the head and handle clean--no need to detach every time you brush!  </li>
            <li>The idea is great because my last sonicare burned out from it getting damp all the time.  </li>
            <li>These cheap covers solve that problem.</li>
            <li>It is also easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The seal covers the brush head nut and doesn&#x27;t allow it to spin freely.</li>
            <li>Really a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>These things are cheap and ripped when I tried to put them on my SonicCare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Great for differentiating between two different identical brushes, though.  </li>
            <li>Amazingly simple, yet works great.</li>
            <li>The second one is working great, but I am not looking forward to having to change the brush head.</li>
            <li>way more I would say than worth the cost.</li>
            <li>and it stays mold free between changing heads.</li>
            <li>If I could do it again, I would have just paid the $80 for the Easy Clean model, which does have the gunk issue.</li>
            <li>Brush heads are also cheaper with the Easy Clean, as you get four heads for the price of three Essence heads here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>My electric toothbrush is free of all the toothpaste &#x27;gunk&#x27; that ends up inside, and all over it.  </li>
            <li>These are such a great buy if you have any type of electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Over all a very great and thoughtful product, just really wish they weren&#x27;t necessary because of a crappy design flaw.</li>
            <li>It works perfectly for the Sonicare toothbrush, although I don&#x27;t really like the colors, a personal taste.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like many others, I love my Sonicare for how it cleans my teeth, but I don&#x27;t like how the air vents encourage muck to grow between the handle and brush assembly, which is much closer to my mouth than I want muck growing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And although it&#x27;s true that this works wonderfully, there is a down side.</li>
            <li>and I must say I&#x27;m absolutely amazed!!!</li>
            <li>These covers really do seal the gap, so the inside of the toothbrush stays nice and clean.</li>
            <li>Quick, easy and inexpensive.</li>
            <li>It makes cleaning very easy and fast, in seconds.</li>
            <li>The fact that they glow in the dark is kind of fun too :o)</li>
            <li>The first time I took my toothbrush head off and saw the gunk inside it grossed me out, so I was so glad to discover the sonic seals on Amazon.</li>
            <li>and they are worth the investment!</li>
            <li>If you have a Sonicare brush, these are SO worth it!</li>
            <li>It takes some work to wiggle it on your toothbrush, but I am still using my original one from two years ago.  </li>
            <li>Lower quality than original.  </li>
            <li>I think this product is so simple, yet so effective!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy to have found this little device, and I feel so much better about using this toothbrush now.  </li>
            <li>Instead of cleaning my toothbrush every 2 days, I clean every 10 days AND replace another finger.</li>
            <li>We have been using them for 3+ weeks, and the brushes seem clean and \\&quot;sealed\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>My wife used to bug me to clean it all the time.</li>
            <li>Was having to clean with alcohol and tips before.</li>
            <li>(Did you ever try to clean that stuff out?</li>
            <li>Keeps the holder clean.</li>
            <li>This will keep it clean inside from day 1.</li>
            <li>My husband found these so he wouldn&#x27;t have to keep removeing his toothbrush head to clean his ultra-sonic handle.  </li>
            <li>Great idea to keep the brush head dry to avoid mold.  </li>
            <li>It was a very snug fit and challenging to get on, but it keeps the water out.</li>
            <li>Now i no longer have to clean my tooth brush after every use.</li>
            <li>Even though I would clean it often, it continued growing mold.  </li>
            <li>I was able to make the third one work, and it will do a fine job I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>so maybe that helped - but WOW this thing is amazing.</li>
            <li>It took about 5 full minutes to put this seal on my sonicare replacement head, but it didn&#x27;t rip or get damaged.</li>
            <li>I have read a review on here that says you can&#x27;t use these when switching heads (sharing), and that is true.</li>
            <li>how much she loves her sonic seal, and how much better it makes her feel about her toothbrush, cleanliness, etc.</li>
            <li>As others have stated however, it&#x27;s only good for those with a dedicated brush -- changing brush heads would be a pain with these.</li>
            <li>Also, this is very over-priced, probably better and cheaper ones will emerge sometime.</li>
            <li>But it does provide full cover and does not impede use of the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>not that I brush my teeth with the lights off, but for the kids that is cool.</li>
            <li>I do wish they came in just clear, but the colors are nice if you have 2 toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>First off, let me start by saying I purchased these directly from Sonic Seal (may not seem fair to Amazon sellers, but it was way cheaper).</li>
            <li>love the different colors too-makes it easy to keep the hubs and mine seperated!</li>
            <li>It is not difficult to put on, and if you roll it like a condom, it is actually easy.</li>
            <li>These are a great product for keep the gunk out of the toothbrush, but they have gotten extremely expensve.  </li>
            <li>This product works perfectly and solves a serious hygiene problem with the Sonicare brush head.</li>
            <li>I did it with vinegar, a small brush and a Q-tip, and it wasn&#x27;t pleasant!)</li>
            <li>To keep it cleaner, protected and color coded to quickly identify your toothbrush.</li>
            <li>but luckily I discovered these Sonic Seal covers.</li>
            <li>Then I tug it over the brush head and smooth it over the brush head until it covers the groove (I attach the brush head to the base/charger first).  </li>
            <li>So, overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>This is a good item and it will be use for a long time to come.  </li>
            <li>Does not make sense considering I live with my wife :) and hers does not have mold.  </li>
            <li>They constrict the brush so it makes so much noise while you brush your teeth!!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>great little invention</li>
            <li>They work great, but $15.99 for three little membrane&#x27;s made of plastic is overpriced.  </li>
            <li>A little pricey, but it does great to keep the bacteria and mold at bay and accumulates in the cracks.</li>
            <li>It is very much like using a rubber, but that is not bad, is it?</li>
            <li>but you have to REALLY hold it up to the light...</li>
            <li>I love it, and have actually seen a huge improvement in the condition of my gums.  </li>
            <li>these sleeves are great,well worth the money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a good product and once I figure out how many brush heads it can be used on, before it wears out, Ill buy more</li>
            <li>It was entirely worth it, though, because I no longer had to worry about brush handle gunk.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it for me.</li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>I have two electric toothbrushes and would have liked to have ordered an even four, but I suppose this is a marketing scheme to get you to buy a second order of them.</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;ve gotten surprised by the gunk that builds up inside of the toothbrush head like many others then this is what you want.</li>
            <li>and it was always getting gross crud in the cracks from spit, toothpaste, that kind of stuff.</li>
            <li>Was very impressed with these seals, altho it is a bit to thin.  </li>
            <li>Pros  Effectively keeps gunk out of the inner workings of the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I found that Sonic Seal has their own website &amp; sells the 3 pack for only $9.99.</li>
            <li>only suggestion I would have for improvement is more colors, as the pink cover, which now resides on my toothbrush, was none too popular in my household, and, in my experience, is studiously avoided by boys, of whom some households have more than two.&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money to save yourself the time cleaning and germs that build up without it.</li>
            <li>should be worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price</li>
            <li>and I was surprised at how great this simple idea worked.  </li>
            <li>The Sonic Seal prevents this effectively and one Sonic Seal lasts the entire life of the replaceable toothbrush head.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, just changed toothbrush after 3 months; no mess or gook using this seal.  </li>
            <li>Oh, they also do a great job of keeping water and other junk out of the inner compartment where the magnets do their magic.</li>
            <li>I used corn starch on the sleeves and they went right on the heads.  </li>
            <li>Product delivery was right on time, too.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the company to see that their product is being offered at a reasonable price, &amp; I&#x27;ll know where to order when I need Sonic Seals in the future.</li>
            <li>Sonic Seal really keeps your toothbrush handle clean.</li>
            <li>This is a great little product!  </li>
            <li>But once you get the hang of it, it becomes very easy for future times.  </li>
            <li>Great product, it helps with keeping the bacteria out of all the small spaces that the brush has.  </li>
            <li>I have had no trouble at all with mine and have found they are quite easy to put on and remove.</li>
            <li>When it comes time to replace the brush it is nice and dry inside the unit.</li>
            <li>More options and better pricing missing needed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the only one using the brush, so maybe that makes it more useful and logical for me.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be a great way to not only help keep them clean, but to tell them apart from each other.</li>
            <li>They are a little tricky to put on, but they fit tight and work perfectly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s truly remarkable to finally remove the cover and find absolutely NO presence of mold or any of the brown gunk that otherwise seeps into the nooks and crannies of the original brush handle and head.    </li>
            <li>Our toothbrushes remain dry and CLEAN!!  </li>
            <li>and get a new clean tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>But they keep the gunk out of my toothbrush and keep it clean and running like new.</li>
            <li>As soon as I tried to put the first one on, it ripped.  </li>
            <li>Now if you never disassemble your brush, use the heads for a year or so before changing, and are willing to take the time to get the seal positioned correctly, you may find this very helpful and the price worth it.    </li>
            <li>I think it actually looks better in there than before I put it on -</li>
            <li>I tore my first cover that way, until I figured out how to put it on correctly.</li>
            <li>I love my Sonicare and use it daily</li>
            <li>I ripped one on first try.  </li>
            <li>Happened upon these and was willing to try anything.</li>
            <li>They perform exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>After purchasing my first electric toothbrush, I saw the reviews about cleaning issues the brush had.</li>
            <li>I fought with first one and then had an idea.</li>
            <li>(Keep the glove on hand in case you have to make more protectors later on.)    </li>
            <li>My wife and I both have the sonicare toothbrush and were amazed at how well the sonic seal does exactly what it advertises.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and think it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li>love this because it keeps the water out of the sonic care casing which is moldy and gross.</li>
            <li>This product works really well!</li>
            <li>I pour a bit of rubbing alcohol inside the seal first</li>
            <li>The first one that I tried to put on ripped</li>
            <li>First these are not heads, but covers.</li>
            <li>For a while I tried the rubber glove finger method but it proved unsustainable; I either don&#x27;t have the skill or patience to consistently make that approach work.</li>
            <li>Some people said it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>(I can just rinse the toothbrush more carefully and more frequently).</li>
            <li>Glows in the dark, which is kind of fun.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Would work better if you are the only one using it.</li>
            <li>I guess they work alright, but why doesn&#x27;t Sonicare provide a free fix for their mold producing tooth brush heads or replace the germ infested item with better technology either free to those of use that bought these brushes or at least at a discounted amount.  </li>
            <li>After replacing head after head, I decided someone must have addressed this problem by now and sure enough I found these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>first one ripped (and was therefore useless)when</li>
            <li>I found that it is easiest to first get the sleeve over the brush, and then turn the sleeve inside out.</li>
            <li>After 3+ years of use, I came back to buy replacements and it doesn&#x27;t look like they&#x27;re sold on Amazon any more.  </li>
            <li>They also help to differentiate our different toothbrushes :-)</li>
            <li>Love it, no problems at all, product is exactly as explained by the sellers with the exact final result mentioned.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>It would be nice if they sold them separately and had purple or a darker pink.</li>
            <li>It would be nice to have a 3 pack with no colors (e.g., pink).</li>
            <li>But the first one I put on my toothbrush tore as I pulled it onto the brush.  </li>
            <li>Glad i finally found a product that can do this.  </li>
            <li>This product totally solved the problem and now I love my toothbrush again.  </li>
            <li>After the most recent head replacement (about 3 months ago), I decided to do an experiment</li>
            <li>I had one tear on me as I put it on the first toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Wish these seals were around years ago when I first began using Sonicare brushes.</li>
            <li>A very cleaver invention!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I only wish they came in more colors.</li>
            <li>Did exactly what I wanted and kept water, etc.</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t inexpensive but it&#x27;s exactly what it represents itself to be</li>
            <li>Using these eliminates the extra removal and cleaning that prevents mold from growing when junk does get inside the threading or the top connection of the brush head</li>
            <li>On my first year of use, I realized that there was always a build-up of molds that happen right within the very neck of the brush head (where you screw in the brush replacement).  </li>
            <li>I purchased these in December 2013 for around $16, which is pretty pricy for 3 little rubbery protectors for my toothbrush, but at the time I felt it was worth the money not to have to cut my own out of latex gloves to protect my hundred-buck-toothbrush.</li>
            <li>white seal is almost invisible when installed, but the blue and red do a good job of indentifying the brushes if you have more than one around the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li>I purchased these some time ago and amazingly, i have only used one so far.</li>
            <li>And these would not be very practical if two or more people share the same handle -</li>
            <li>When you look at the item, your first thought might be &amp;#34;a condom for my toothbrush?!?&amp;#34;  It certainly does look like that.  </li>
            <li>It offers a nice tight fit around anywhere moisture could get into the sonicare.</li>
            <li>This pretty much prevents you from disassembling the brush/base for traveling.</li>
            <li>They are TIGHT, which makes them effective, so you should be aware of that.</li>
            <li>When I first received them I thought there was NO WAY they would fit over the toothbrush, and I actually came back to this site to look at other reviews to make sure I would be able to get them on.  </li>
            <li>only problem with them is that they prevent the easy removal of the brush head if you travel a lot.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather make sure I wash and dry out the inside of the brush then listen to the horrid noise these things create.</li>
            <li>I found them easy to put onto the toothbrush, though I don&#x27;t think they could be put on and off multiple times without breaking.  </li>
            <li>Instant Order Update says I purchased these in Jan of 2011, so it has lasted over a year and still going strong.  </li>
            <li>I would have preferred that the product could be ordered singly, but I suppose I have spares for when the cover wears out and needs replacing :)</li>
            <li>Can certainly see why some reviewers are saying it ripped during the process.</li>
            <li>Loved the retro pink and pretty blue.</li>
            <li>One caveat, these sleeves are very difficult to get over the brush head and the body of the brush, but once you figure out how to get it in the right position it won&#x27;t move, and it seals the brush head perfectly.</li>
            <li>but I believe it needs to be that tight to keep the water and moisture out effectively.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little challenging to put them on (try rolling them on like a sock) but it is worth the time.</li>
            <li>The Sonic Seal is hard to get on and it probably takes a good five minutes to coax and persuade it to do so.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to just slip over the bristles and tug down over the neck of the brush head.</li>
            <li>Good concept, but much too hard to use.  </li>
            <li>I have only had the Sonicare for a few days and it works great</li>
            <li>Would I have bought them if I knew what they really looked like?</li>
            <li>Thanks anyway.</li>
            <li>This defeats the whole purpose of the product.  </li>
            <li>I did use some powder, but it didn&#x27;t seem to help all that much.</li>
            <li>Basically muffles so much vibration it defeats the point of the brush.</li>
            <li>It makes keeping your toothbrush handle so much cleaner.</li>
            <li>I made a point to watch the video on the sonic seal website to see the proper way to fit the seal over your toothbrush, and had no problems.   </li>
            <li>It really protects the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The idea is great but the execution is poor.</li>
            <li>However it takes to much time to change out these heads with this seal on it.</li>
            <li>The colors leave a LOT to be desired...other color options would be much appreciated.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Remember that this isn&#x27;t designed to be removed very often so don&#x27;t get it if you share a toothbrush with somebody or unscrew the head every week for travel.&lt;br</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t mind that it completely mutes the vibrations of your brush rendering it basically about as powerful as a cheapy grocery store knock-off.</li>
            <li>Really a shame.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Once on, it does its job very well.</li>
            <li>Now, I have not ordered any, so I do not know how much the shipping is</li>
            <li>WAY TOO MUCH for what it is.</li>
            <li>These are absolute junk.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money in my opinion, the time it has saved us cleaning the base and heads alone is well worth it to this happy family!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t really matter to</li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I was really looking for an answer to the mold growth in the toothbrush</li>
            <li>and I took the toothbrush apart and then gently tried to remove the &#x27;Sonic Seal.</li>
            <li>and it would get so much mold in it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much nicer</li>
            <li>Very functional.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>thing there are three in the pack as two of them tore pulling as gently as I could.</li>
            <li>My husband  rinses his whole handle and brush and probably doesn&#x27;t wipe it off very well.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this to all Sonic-care users!  </li>
            <li>Really, they glow.</li>
            <li>would love nicer colors or all clear, will try to remember to try the cornstarch next time to make application easier, but..</li>
            <li>Since they are fragile, maybe adding an extra one in case of tearing would be a nice step?</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve had them for more than a year now, and even with having taken them off and put them back on each time we switch to a new toothbrush head, they&#x27;re still in new condition.</li>
            <li>My first attempt on new order broke one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not easily removed so you need to have your own handle and brush.  </li>
            <li>After I received them, I became concerned that the material was too thin, but it proved to be very, very, very strong and stretches for an air-tight fit.</li>
            <li>These seals seem to do a pretty good job at keeping the water out - its only been a few weeks</li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these for anyone who has a Sonicare e series brush, it&#x27;ll save you money (from replacing brush heads more frequently due to mold)</li>
            <li>My dog and every other dog I have encountered with these love them.  </li>
            <li>The upside is that three months later, when it is time to replace the brush, everything is clean and muck-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had to clean it every time I brushed my teeth.</li>
            <li>Until I bought these, I was constantly having to clean yucky stuff out of the inside of the head.  </li>
            <li>I was thinking of buying these to solve the ridiculous design problem of the otherwise good Sonicare brushes...</li>
            <li>As stated in the ad, these are NOT for people who share a single brush handleâ€”there is no way you are going to easily switch heads once this is on.</li>
            <li>They were strong, sturdy and a single pack lasted over a year tearing even with reuse.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions very precisely -- did not use a tool to put one of these seals on my Sonicare toothbrush, but the seal ripped as soon as I gave it a slight tug.</li>
            <li>but it would be nice to have a single or double pack offer as well.</li>
            <li>I agree the price is high, but it saves time not having to clean the inside of the brush head regularly!</li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW - this thing really works!</li>
            <li>And the glow in the dark colors are a cute idea.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t give it a full 5 stars since I can&#x27;t vouch for the product as it was actually intended.</li>
            <li>Not easy to get on and the material will tear very easily.  </li>
            <li>If the price came down it would get a lot, it would get a better review.</li>
            <li>I decided I needed a whole new Sonicare despite the price.</li>
            <li>..keeps moisture out leaving dry and rust free...</li>
            <li>I have an older model Sonicare toothbrush and never had a mold problem until I replaced it with the newer style head.</li>
            <li>It is necessary to pull the sonic seal completely up and over the brush itself so that screw on part of the head is free to rotate.  </li>
            <li>Luckily my GF has a similar Sonicare</li>
            <li>I really appreciate knowing my toothbrush is clean inside and that I don&#x27;t have to take the brush head apart every time I use my toothbrush to dry everything.</li>
            <li>so this isn&#x27;t very useful in my house, in other words I will not recommend or be able to use what I spent my money on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommended and pretty easy to put on with a little water to help.</li>
            <li>These are very soft and much thicker/durable than latex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but if you remove your brush head and look inside you&#x27;ll gladly pay the price to prevent that gooey mess.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Purchased to keep our expensive brushes clean... goes on super easy (if you follow the instructions).  </li>
            <li>They are kind of hard to put on (very tight-fitting), but completely keep the moisture out of the handle for months!  </li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>1) out of the package feels a little bit sticky (like most silicone)</li>
            <li>The packaging was flimsey (thats ok in todays over packaged world) but offered little instruction.</li>
            <li>Very much worth it to not have to clean out the handle every few days.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to pull them down below where the toothbrush unscrews!</li>
            <li>It stays clean and gets bone dry.</li>
            <li>This is a real necessity because the toothbrush head lets liquid get inside but this product completely seals this opening.</li>
            <li>Great idea but useless</li>
            <li>I noticed another review which suggested a light dusting of corn starch inside the cover to facilitate slipping on the device.</li>
            <li>After having purchased the Sonicare because of recommendations from my dentist, I did not want to risk my 15 year old skipping brushing his teeth because it is to much of a chore, so I took them off.  </li>
            <li>Perfectly dry and clean \\&quot;guts\\&quot; of my toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine now for over a year and all is clean and dry inside my toothbrush.</li>
            <li>but since you can take the brush head apart and clean and dry</li>
            <li>Clean and dry toothbrush&lt;</li>
            <li>I bought these even though I read many reviews saying they were a waste of money.  </li>
            <li>Actually they are quite worth the price if you are concerned at all about germs and fungus growing inside your toothbrush.</li>
            <li>When I finally got it on and used it, oh, it was so worth it.  </li>
            <li>I normally would go to.</li>
            <li>I would say if you feel unsure use your least favorite color first to do a test run... or do the cornstarch trick.  </li>
            <li>Not hard.  </li>
            <li>3) make sure your brush is completely dry both inside &amp; out for the obvious reasons you don&#x27;t want to trap gunk under the seal.    </li>
            <li>They are slightly tricky to install, but that&#x27;s because they fit quite snugly and really keep the tooth brushing residue from seeping into the chamber and threads under the brush head.</li>
            <li>Tears easily, one of the seals tore while pulling it down over the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I put it on my brand new sonicare</li>
            <li>Once you put on the Sonic Seal, it&#x27;s meant to stay on until you change your head for a new one.    </li>
            <li>I just replaced my brush head and put on a new seal.</li>
            <li>Started using this with a new sonicare brush about 7 months ago.</li>
            <li>These seals keep all moisture out of the head and the inside of the head looks as new when taking it off to replace it.  </li>
            <li>Used baby powder to make putting on a new one on a new brush.  </li>
            <li>I did not have any ripping issues as others have mentioned and I replaced it onto my new head with no issues.</li>
            <li>These covers have kept my toothbrush (not the brush itself) looking new.  </li>
            <li>I put a new one on every time I replace the toothbrush head.</li>
            <li>Now with my new neck cover I don&#x27;t have that problem anymore.</li>
            <li>The only down size is it not being very easy to put on and o have torn one before in process.  </li>
            <li>It is a very tight fitting silicone-like sleeve that fits over the brush head.  </li>
            <li>Previous versions of this product were thicker and did not break as easily.</li>
            <li>will say it makes taking it apart for travel a bit less easy</li>
            <li>/&gt;These silicone sonicare seals keep the area between the body and the head dry, so it&#x27;s always clean (clear of said</li>
            <li>but the Seals make it more difficult to secure the brush to the handle.  </li>
            <li>These are a really good idea, but much too expensive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try this next time but sounds like a stellar suggestion.</li>
            <li>Many past reviewers stated that theirs tore while they were trying to put them on.  </li>
            <li>When I had my first sonic toothbrush, I was cleaning the inside of my toothbrush every third day or so.  </li>
            <li>It does make it a bit more difficult to unscrew the head to pop in in the UV sanitizer, but still well worth it!  </li>
            <li>It seals out water moisture and gunk, and (wow!)</li>
            <li>I ended up getting my first cavity in several years.</li>
            <li>As for durability, I&#x27;m on the same seal as when I first bought my pack in 2010, so that must say something.</li>
            <li>4 of us in the family and each with the same exact toothbrush....</li>
            <li>They are not difficult to put on and by using one you&#x27;ll save a fortune by making your toothbrush heads last longer.</li>
            <li>The order includes a package of three covers, but in trying to get them onto the sonicare, the first two actually ripped apart.</li>
            <li>Then you can smooth it down the rest of the way by rubbing/pushing your finger over the silicon in the direction</li>
            <li>Keeps the interior of my Sonicare clean and dry, and with a small puff of cornstarch or baby powder, I find it easy to to put onto my toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Time will tell but I would advise getting the seals for your brushes, old or new.</li>
            <li>They are a little hard to get on at first, but I suspect that&#x27;s why it can keep a good seal and keep the water and toothpaste out of the working parts.</li>
            <li>I have struggled for the last several years with how to keep the inside of the toothbrush head clean and this completely solves this issue.</li>
            <li>I\\&quot;m tired of having to buy more parts just to make a product work the way it should in the first place.</li>
            <li>Even with the little tear, it protects the inside of the toothbrush just fine.</li>
            <li>but then if you want it to be waterproof it should fit tight.</li>
            <li>But I bought a Sonicare two-pack at a certain Seattle-based big box mart, and now my wife and I can brush mold-free.  </li>
            <li>If the product description or the manufacturer&#x27;s website noted this significant limitation, I would not have purchased it and it would have received one less 1-star review.</li>
            <li>This little boot covers the toothbrush head and handle enough so the liquids don&#x27;t seep into the handle pocket, proving a more sanitary toothbrush.</li>
            <li>If you have a Sonic tooth brush then you are familiar with the black goo that seems to accumulate under the brush cover-</li>
            <li>A complete waste of money and a huge source of frustration.</li>
            <li>I do wish they made a three-pack of all clear covers though.  </li>
            <li>Suggestion to makers: offer a package of all clear.  </li>
            <li>I would prefer to have a pack of all clear.</li>
            <li>Also, there was a clear one in my package.</li>
            <li>But now that I&#x27;ve done both, I am grateful for the complete functionality of these seals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for several years, and it works very well.</li>
            <li>It shouldn&#x27;t tear for a long while, though, as they&#x27;re fitted pretty tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Used these on my old Sonicare.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These soft silicone seals go over the two areas of leakage and look as though they will not allow leakage.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are a couple ways this could be fixed.  </li>
            <li>This product solves the problem completely.</li>
            <li>I bought the 3 pack directly from the manufacturer&#x27;s website which saved me a couple bucks.</li>
            <li>longer because the material clearly starts thinning out when you stretch it that far.  </li>
            <li>it stays trouble free</li>
            <li>After much tugging and pulling, I finally got these on my and my husband&#x27;s toothbrush heads.  </li>
            <li>Keeps water &amp; saliva &amp; toothpaste out of the head, yet doesn&#x27;t change the effecitveness of the sonic action.    </li>
            <li>but wow.  </li>
            <li>I purchased my whole family sonicares by philips, only to find out about the mold issue.</li>
            <li>There is no way I&#x27;ll pay that much for an item that probably only costs pennies to manufacture.</li>
            <li>but I bought it directly from the company that sells it.</li>
            <li>Not to mention the fact that the goo had a direct route to my mouth.</li>
            <li>Periodically taking it apart and cleaning it with baking soda/vinegar and an old toothbrush wouldn&#x27;t always kill the smell/goop accumulation on the inside--and frankly, it was a pain.     </li>
            <li>The first time I tried to get this on, it took me a long time.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t looking forward to replacing heads, but it was much easier to get on the second time.  </li>
            <li>The seals seem to work so far.</li>
            <li>With the Sonic Seal, you completely negate the chances of any mold build-up.  </li>
            <li>would not waste your money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve reused these over 6 times each so far.</li>
            <li>I tried a different toothbrush, the Oral B, and really didn&#x27;t like the results compared to my Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>It completely seals off that area where the blackness assembles.</li>
            <li>This thing complete eliminates all that.  </li>
            <li>By following the instructions other reviewers gave (a dusting of corn starch on the inside) and taking care when pulling over the brush head, I found the Sonic Seal to be the ONLY solution to remaining a Sonicare afficionado, and to keeping my brush more sterile.</li>
            <li>only issue is that the first time I tried to slide on toothbrush the seal ripped (thank goodness you get 3 in a pack)...be very careful putting on and don&#x27;t stretch too much at first....</li>
            <li>The product is expensive and strong enough to put on the toothbrush without easily coming apart.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not completely easy to get on, but once it&#x27;s on properly, it keeps your toothbrush crevices clean for so much longer.  </li>
            <li>If you want to chage heads, simply roll it up to the top of the shoulder of the brush, and then roll it back down when reinstalling it on the handle.</li>
            <li>problem with the sonicare design is that the constant dribble of water back down the brush head can enter the space at the top of the handle.  </li>
            <li>The material is quite strong, and can withstand being stretched a lot without tearing....unless you happen to gouge it by mistake with your fingernails, or if you use tweezers or other tools to put it on.</li>
            <li>Instead of the expense and trouble of purchasing and applying these seals, isn&#x27;t it simpler, quicker, and ultimately just as effective to occasionally remove the Sonicare screw-on brush head and clean out accumulated gunk with small (manual) toothbrush and household cleaner (Windex, alcohol, etc.)?  </li>
            <li>As long as you can leave your head on your brush handle, these will keep your brush head clean and dry inside.</li>
            <li>I checked the head after the first week and it was bone dry!</li>
            <li>No water gets through these puppies, so no black mold stuff growing within your toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I have five people in my family, so after I practiced on the first one then next four were no big deal.  </li>
            <li>Just 1 tiny spot recently started to get a little moldy, but still works 100 times better than not using 1.</li>
            <li>At first glance, I thought this was priced a little too high...</li>
            <li>I am still on my first seal, the pink and blue one are still brand new in the package.</li>
            <li>I very rarely in my reviews disagree with others openly, but come on people, its designed to keep water out of a crack and it has to be tight.  </li>
            <li>Recently I ordered new replacement.</li>
            <li>It was much, much easier than last time and only took a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>They have a bit of a chew yet are soft enough for my dentally challenged old girl.</li>
            <li>I love my sonicare toothbrush, but the gross filth and scum that builds up under the head was a major turn-off for me, but now that is resolved.</li>
            <li>have no regrets!</li>
            <li>like many of the reviews have said, it is very hard to get one</li>
            <li>so it is wet and slides down easily.  </li>
            <li>Saving the extra 10 minutes fiddling with the DIY every other week is well worth $17.</li>
            <li>A little cumbersome to screw the head on and off the sonicare, but well worth the effort.</li>
            <li>However, it holds the brush so tight it does not vibrate right.  </li>
            <li>I remember hearing about these when they came out several years ago, but the high cost and especially the attitude of the business owner toward customers made me decide against it.</li>
            <li>I clearly didn&#x27;t read the product description properly.  </li>
            <li>They do rip if you are not careful.</li>
            <li>and THEY WILL RIP IF YOU ARE NOT CAREFUL PUTTING THEM ON.  </li>
            <li>but apparently he&#x27;s a dentist</li>
            <li>Considering buying these seal covers for Sonicare but completely turned off by statement on site: &amp;#34;Removing it daily will be a pain in the</li>
            <li>At first, I thought it was user error, then I realized this product just does not fit on the head without bending the laws of physics and nearly breaking the replaceable head.</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy the product again realizing now that you have to be pretty careful when stretching the product over the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>There are grooves that the seal contours into providing a much better seal than any thin latex can.</li>
            <li>They are not cheap but are worth it.</li>
            <li>These undoubtedly work, but they are expensive, so I tried making my own, as follows.  </li>
            <li>(3) Slip the glove finger down over the brush head, leaving the tip end above the top gasket of the brush head, and pulling the rest of the latex down to where the brush head joins the handle.</li>
            <li>Leave it loose at the point where the brush shaft comes out of the main body so that you don&#x27;t dampen the vibrations of the toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not a single spore!</li>
            <li>was careful to follow others&#x27; suggestions regarding the cornstarch, and it didn&#x27;t tear, although I had to be super careful</li>
            <li>I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend taking it on and off regularly, like trying to share the same handle between separate heads, but pulling it on and off every few months with the head replacement has worked fine for me.  </li>
            <li>I have had this on for over 2 months and did notice (as someone else had mentioned) that it had shifted slightly and was no longer seated exactly into the groove of the brush.</li>
            <li>The Sonic Seal works really well for those who are not sharing the handle with other family or friends.</li>
            <li>and it was hard to clean.</li>
            <li>Before I purchased the Sonic Seal, I had to dismantle and clean at least once a week to prevent a build up of mold where the brush head attached to the battery portion.  </li>
            <li>simple product fills such a clear need that I have to give it five stars.</li>
            <li>Cover slipped down the neck just fine, no tearing, and was in place in less than 20 seconds.    </li>
            <li>Just apply a little baby powder when you put it on the first time and you&#x27;ll never have a problem.</li>
            <li>The first time I put these on mine and my husband&#x27;s toothbrushes, I did tear these a little.</li>
            <li>If you own a Sonicare E-series toothbrush and have replaced the head at least once, you probably found a gross mess under the head.  </li>
            <li>Time can only tell if these will be worth the cost, which, at $16.99 is a little over a third of what I paid for the Sonicare Essence.</li>
            <li>I was a bit afraid after reading some reviews here, but I am very pleased with the product, it keeps the toothbrush gunk-free.</li>
            <li>First of all it&#x27;s a struggle to force the brush head thru the narrow portion of the cover and once having done</li>
            <li>It is worth the small effort (maybe a minute each) to put on.</li>
            <li>I really have a hard time cleaning it because the inside neck seems tight for your fingers to reach and clean.  </li>
            <li>It has definitely helped keep the \\&quot;ick\\&quot; areas that others have complained about clean.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Stuff\\&quot; still runs down the handle, but this can&#x27;t really be blamed on the seal.</li>
            <li>I was upset and should have returned them immediately for a refund, but I was able to get the other two on without tearing them and since I don&#x27;t take the heads off frequently, I figured it would be tough to damage them.</li>
            <li>(okay, I was a little lazy)</li>
            <li>After I first tried this with cornstarch, I actually couldn&#x27;t get the bottom of the seal to stay below the bottom of the replaceable head -- I would pull it down, and it kept rising up -- which left the entire bottom exposed to moisture entry.</li>
            <li>I agree with other reviewers that this seems quite high to fix a design flaw with the entry level Sonicare Essence.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care for the glow in the dark effect, and finally it works.</li>
            <li>The packaging is a bit juvenile, making the product look like a novelty item (who needs glow-in-the-dark toothbrush covers?), and three guesses as to what we are calling these in my adult household, but they really work, and that is what it is all about, anyway.</li>
            <li>They seemed a bit thin and easily ripped.</li>
            <li>I loved my Sonicare, until the fight against the black goo got to difficult.</li>
            <li>My only \\&quot;complaint\\&quot; is that they seem pretty expensive for what clearly did not cost much to produce.  </li>
            <li>They are hard to get onto the brush, but they are well worth it.  </li>
            <li>We recently ordered new Sonicare tooth brushes and the sonic seal popped up as one of those things that other people bought at the same time.  </li>

            <li> This seal work great at keeping the moisture out of brush innards - once you manage to get it on.  </li>
            <li> These are great.  </li>
            <li> Been a couple of months now and still working great.  </li>
            <li> This is a great idea, and a product that works well.  </li>
            <li> they are a great time-saver.  </li>
            <li> Great compliment to any Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> This product has been great for my sonicare toothbrush except for one thing.  </li>
            <li> The product that is on my brush now has been great and has been serving its purpose to keep the water out.</li>
            <li> It was a great idea when you have two people sharing a sonic and need to know who&#x27;s replacement head is who&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> so this 3 packed worked great</li>
            <li> These seals are a great patch for a design flaw.  </li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Once done though, it works great.</li>
            <li> This product works great -</li>
            <li> These are a great solution to the issue of water getting through the connection points.</li>
            <li> The concept is great, but if you cannot get them on, what&#x27;s the use?</li>
            <li> These silicone based seals are of great value when you have any of the E-series Sonicare toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Once they are on they do a great job of keeping all the gunk out of the inside of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> These have worked great and have kept the yuck out of our toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> These work great.</li>
            <li> These seals for the Sonicare heads are great.  </li>
            <li> Works great.  </li>
            <li> It would be great if they would make the connection waterproof but they probably won&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s nice that you can wash and reuse the covers!</li>
            <li> With it worked, good idea in theory</li>
            <li> Now we each have our own handle and I am so happy with this.  </li>
            <li> though, I will say they LOOK good, but that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> Although it was a good idea.</li>
            <li> The purpose of the seal may be good</li>
            <li> What a good idea for the sonicare heads.</li>
            <li> stars for a product that does what it says and looks good doing it.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> but once it&#x27;s on, it&#x27;s on for good.  </li>
            <li> this is good solution.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use and works great - just as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve experienced they slimy goo that builds up inside the head.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m happy :)</li>
            <li> OK I&#x27;m a color-monster (for lack of the ability to post a stronger word), and thought these colors were the coolest!</li>
            <li> I LOVE these!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> You will love it, I promise!</li>
            <li> I love this item!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love these things, just wish they were cheaper!</li>
            <li> best bet is to buy these when you first purchase your toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> Will buy more again soon!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how glad I am that someone came up with these!</li>
            <li> I will always try to fix something on my own first; and I try my best to end with quality results.</li>
            <li> It works great although just one would&#x27;ve been fine.</li>
            <li> FYI, I keep my sonicare in the shower at all timesâ€¦.pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> This effectively solves the problem.</li>
            <li> Its so nice not having the nastyness build up in the brush.</li>
            <li> and I would have liked to have known that before purchasing.  </li>
            <li> Nice try</li>
            <li> This rubber accessory solves that problem nicely.</li>
            <li> My husband and I each wanted our own toothbrush, and didn&#x27;t want to have to swap out heads.</li>
            <li> Because we each have our own handle</li>
            <li> I get it these colors are great for your kids, but a clear or whote one for adults would be ideal.</li>
            <li> but it would be nice if the seal was a 1/4\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nice because it helps my husband</li>
            <li> AFTER purchasing these covers, I realized they have their own website...</li>
            <li> these covers are definitely effective.  </li>
            <li> I liked the concept of them...</li>
            <li> These are a nice idea.  </li>
            <li> One day while cleaning my toothbrush I thought about how nice it would be if there was a cover that would prevent all this build up.</li>
            <li> &amp; then when they tear up, I&#x27;m making my own.</li>
            <li> If you own a Sonicare E-Series, the Sonic Seal is a must-have item.</li>
            <li> so they grip nicely in hand and are quite snug on the brush head so no water or crud gets under them.</li>
            <li> I have a nice nightlight as well as a cover for my Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re kind of a pain to get on.</li>
            <li> Colors are nice too.</li>
            <li> maybe it&#x27;s a good idea to take better care of your $100 toothbrush.</li>
            <li> super easy to put on..works perfect.</li>
            <li> It is actually incredible just how much stuff gets INSIDE!  </li>
            <li> They tear very easily.</li>
            <li> These seals break very easily</li>
            <li> The bottom part of the seal ripped very easily as I tugged it onto my brush cover.  </li>
            <li> I love not having to worry about what kind of gunk it building up inside my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> But this silicone sleeve is working nicely and we can practice safe brushing.</li>
            <li> Works great and the price was right.</li>
            <li> So easy!</li>
            <li> So ideally you&#x27;d want something looking decent and sturdy that will survive reusing and that&#x27;s where this comes in.</li>
            <li> If someone has any feedback please feel very free to email me with the information.</li>
            <li> No grey slime and seals working perfectly.</li>
            <li> No ripping, no tearing, and looks just as good as the first time I put it on my Sonicare!</li>
            <li> Ok so I tried the glove finger thing and it works ok.</li>
            <li> It was more of a hassle than a solution for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel the cost of the brush heads are much more overpriced than these.</li>
            <li> They help identify Sonicaire toothbrushes which is helpful if your bathroom has more than one.  </li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> I do think hydrogen peroxide cleans better than alcohol/</li>
            <li> if more than one person uses the brush handle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I figured it out before I went on for who knows how many years of ineffective teeth cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I have used a Sonicare brush for many years.</li>
            <li> We love our Philips Sonicare tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> These seals are better used if you are not sharing a Sonic Care unit.</li>
            <li> Better off using a manual brush if you want to use these.  </li>
            <li> Should be a better description of how to do.</li>
            <li> Feb2013*****Having ordered these, what? more than 2 years ago?</li>
            <li> I honestly thought the seal would reduce the sound level, but to my surprise, it make it even louder.  </li>
            <li> Sure does keep the insides from gunking up.  </li>
            <li> They couldn&#x27;t figure out that water might be able to get inside?  </li>
            <li> And more every six or so applications and</li>
            <li> Make sure plastic cap is off of toothbrush head and take care not to over stretch cover</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of sturdy silicone that feels like it will survive, aesthetically it&#x27;s ok looking</li>
            <li> after many attempts.  </li>
            <li> also, I agree with some reviewers, they should come up with a better color selection.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure glad that I did.  </li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> , then it would be much much better.</li>
            <li> OK - a lot clearer.</li>
            <li> Price is ok.</li>
            <li> I would not use most models of sonicare without this seal.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These work as advertised and immediately make you feel better about no longer</li>
            <li> I love these.  </li>
            <li> There is some quite of difficulty fitting it in</li>
            <li> they should be more durable for this price.</li>
            <li> I love my brush cover.</li>
            <li> Brush head goes into dish washer periodically for more thorough cleaning and sanitizing.</li>
            <li> I tried one more week</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> OK.  </li>
            <li> These have kept our toothbrushes gunk free!</li>
            <li> I am so glad this was suggested to me by Amazon.</li>
            <li> If you can find them cheaper elsewhere, or where you don&#x27;t pay shipping, you&#x27;d be better off.</li>
            <li> If you have ever opened your Sonicare toothbrush and seen the goo and gunk that builds up inside, you will love these.</li>
            <li> Even better, I&#x27;ve been able to reuse these.</li>
            <li> It tore along the top as I pulled it over the brush head.</li>
            <li> When I saw these were a great price here on Amazon, I bought them for stocking stuffers for the whole</li>
            <li> Does not seal the head therefore it now traps more gunk than before.</li>
            <li> I love this and will continue to purchase this product because it keeps the water out.</li>
            <li> I am not disappointed !!</li>
            <li> It makes it very easy to keep the toothbrush clean and is fairly easy to put on the brush!</li>
            <li> but they are nice and it help kids keep handle clean ...</li>
            <li> stays nice and clean - no residual gunk.</li>
            <li> clean which is nice.  </li>
            <li> Found that flipping the bottom inside out once it was over the brush and then rolling it over the nut worked pretty good.</li>
            <li> I saw these recommended on Amazon, they are totally worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> Still clean as a whistle!</li>
            <li> I never need to clean the gunk out of my sonicare again!  </li>
            <li> , I change my toothbrush - completely clean on the inside!  </li>
            <li> I have always had to clean around my brush head and handle!  </li>
            <li> I think Amazon overcharges some people to make up for those purchasing more and getting free shipping.</li>
            <li> The idea is fantastic but the material needs to be more durable.</li>
            <li> Product came quickly and was very easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Our toothbrushes are easy to keep clean!</li>
            <li> A nice bonus about the bright colors is that my wife and I no longer get our toothbrushes mixed up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Product works as described and makes cleaning Sonic head easy / non- existent.  </li>
            <li> and if you put a bit of cornstarch in it before sliding it, it will be easy as a breeze..</li>
            <li> but thought I&#x27;d let people know, they are easy to get on.  </li>
            <li> I love the cover idea because all you have to do it rinse off the toothbrush each time after use and it stays clean.</li>
            <li> On the one hand, I love my toothbrush to be clean in a hassle-free way.</li>
            <li> They went on fairly easily, but as I tried to tug all the way to the bottom, they tore.</li>
            <li> These are a bit of a challenge to install, but they work perfectly and they do help keep the underside of the brush head clean and dry.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re swapping out heads all the time, it&#x27;s just as easy to rise it off with soap and water.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes for easy rinsing off and cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I strongly advise against using this product.</li>
            <li> So I took it off, and I couldn&#x27;t believe how strong the vibrations were.</li>
            <li> Of course I just got them so they have not been used for the full 3 months yet, but what a fantastic idea!</li>
            <li> It slipped right on very easy.  </li>
            <li> 6 months later all 3 covers are still holding strong and none of us have slimy gooey heads!!!</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s more important to me that my teeth are clean</li>
            <li> I took my time and was fine.  </li>
            <li> For the DIYers, yes I think you could make your own, but I really didn&#x27;t want to and the gloves idea was cool but looked like it would require more trial and error than I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I really liked the idea of having these colorful seals for two reasons; 1) it would prevent filtration of toothpaste and water into the Sonicare toothbrush and 2) the colorful seals would make it easy to identify among family members.</li>
            <li> These little seals do an awesome job of keeping the head and handle clean--no need to detach every time you brush!  </li>
            <li> The idea is great because my last sonicare burned out from it getting damp all the time.  </li>
            <li> These cheap covers solve that problem.</li>
            <li> It is also easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The seal covers the brush head nut and doesn&#x27;t allow it to spin freely.</li>
            <li> Really a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> These things are cheap and ripped when I tried to put them on my SonicCare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Great for differentiating between two different identical brushes, though.  </li>
            <li> Amazingly simple, yet works great.</li>
            <li> The second one is working great, but I am not looking forward to having to change the brush head.</li>
            <li> way more I would say than worth the cost.</li>
            <li> and it stays mold free between changing heads.</li>
            <li> If I could do it again, I would have just paid the $80 for the Easy Clean model, which does have the gunk issue.</li>
            <li> Brush heads are also cheaper with the Easy Clean, as you get four heads for the price of three Essence heads here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My electric toothbrush is free of all the toothpaste &#x27;gunk&#x27; that ends up inside, and all over it.  </li>
            <li> These are such a great buy if you have any type of electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Over all a very great and thoughtful product, just really wish they weren&#x27;t necessary because of a crappy design flaw.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly for the Sonicare toothbrush, although I don&#x27;t really like the colors, a personal taste.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like many others, I love my Sonicare for how it cleans my teeth, but I don&#x27;t like how the air vents encourage muck to grow between the handle and brush assembly, which is much closer to my mouth than I want muck growing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And although it&#x27;s true that this works wonderfully, there is a down side.</li>
            <li> and I must say I&#x27;m absolutely amazed!!!</li>
            <li> These covers really do seal the gap, so the inside of the toothbrush stays nice and clean.</li>
            <li> Quick, easy and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> It makes cleaning very easy and fast, in seconds.</li>
            <li> The fact that they glow in the dark is kind of fun too :o)</li>
            <li> The first time I took my toothbrush head off and saw the gunk inside it grossed me out, so I was so glad to discover the sonic seals on Amazon.</li>
            <li> and they are worth the investment!</li>
            <li> If you have a Sonicare brush, these are SO worth it!</li>
            <li> It takes some work to wiggle it on your toothbrush, but I am still using my original one from two years ago.  </li>
            <li> Lower quality than original.  </li>
            <li> I think this product is so simple, yet so effective!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to have found this little device, and I feel so much better about using this toothbrush now.  </li>
            <li> Instead of cleaning my toothbrush every 2 days, I clean every 10 days AND replace another finger.</li>
            <li> We have been using them for 3+ weeks, and the brushes seem clean and \\&quot;sealed\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> My wife used to bug me to clean it all the time.</li>
            <li> Was having to clean with alcohol and tips before.</li>
            <li> (Did you ever try to clean that stuff out?</li>
            <li> Keeps the holder clean.</li>
            <li> This will keep it clean inside from day 1.</li>
            <li> My husband found these so he wouldn&#x27;t have to keep removeing his toothbrush head to clean his ultra-sonic handle.  </li>
            <li> Great idea to keep the brush head dry to avoid mold.  </li>
            <li> It was a very snug fit and challenging to get on, but it keeps the water out.</li>
            <li> Now i no longer have to clean my tooth brush after every use.</li>
            <li> Even though I would clean it often, it continued growing mold.  </li>
            <li> I was able to make the third one work, and it will do a fine job I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> so maybe that helped - but WOW this thing is amazing.</li>
            <li> It took about 5 full minutes to put this seal on my sonicare replacement head, but it didn&#x27;t rip or get damaged.</li>
            <li> I have read a review on here that says you can&#x27;t use these when switching heads (sharing), and that is true.</li>
            <li> how much she loves her sonic seal, and how much better it makes her feel about her toothbrush, cleanliness, etc.</li>
            <li> As others have stated however, it&#x27;s only good for those with a dedicated brush -- changing brush heads would be a pain with these.</li>
            <li> Also, this is very over-priced, probably better and cheaper ones will emerge sometime.</li>
            <li> But it does provide full cover and does not impede use of the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> not that I brush my teeth with the lights off, but for the kids that is cool.</li>
            <li> I do wish they came in just clear, but the colors are nice if you have 2 toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> First off, let me start by saying I purchased these directly from Sonic Seal (may not seem fair to Amazon sellers, but it was way cheaper).</li>
            <li> love the different colors too-makes it easy to keep the hubs and mine seperated!</li>
            <li> It is not difficult to put on, and if you roll it like a condom, it is actually easy.</li>
            <li> These are a great product for keep the gunk out of the toothbrush, but they have gotten extremely expensve.  </li>
            <li> This product works perfectly and solves a serious hygiene problem with the Sonicare brush head.</li>
            <li> I did it with vinegar, a small brush and a Q-tip, and it wasn&#x27;t pleasant!)</li>
            <li> To keep it cleaner, protected and color coded to quickly identify your toothbrush.</li>
            <li> but luckily I discovered these Sonic Seal covers.</li>
            <li> Then I tug it over the brush head and smooth it over the brush head until it covers the groove (I attach the brush head to the base/charger first).  </li>
            <li> So, overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is a good item and it will be use for a long time to come.  </li>
            <li> Does not make sense considering I live with my wife :) and hers does not have mold.  </li>
            <li> They constrict the brush so it makes so much noise while you brush your teeth!!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> great little invention</li>
            <li> They work great, but $15.99 for three little membrane&#x27;s made of plastic is overpriced.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey, but it does great to keep the bacteria and mold at bay and accumulates in the cracks.</li>
            <li> It is very much like using a rubber, but that is not bad, is it?</li>
            <li> but you have to REALLY hold it up to the light...</li>
            <li> I love it, and have actually seen a huge improvement in the condition of my gums.  </li>
            <li> these sleeves are great,well worth the money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a good product and once I figure out how many brush heads it can be used on, before it wears out, Ill buy more</li>
            <li> It was entirely worth it, though, because I no longer had to worry about brush handle gunk.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it for me.</li>
            <li> but well worth it.</li>
            <li> I have two electric toothbrushes and would have liked to have ordered an even four, but I suppose this is a marketing scheme to get you to buy a second order of them.</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;ve gotten surprised by the gunk that builds up inside of the toothbrush head like many others then this is what you want.</li>
            <li> and it was always getting gross crud in the cracks from spit, toothpaste, that kind of stuff.</li>
            <li> Was very impressed with these seals, altho it is a bit to thin.  </li>
            <li> Pros  Effectively keeps gunk out of the inner workings of the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I found that Sonic Seal has their own website &amp; sells the 3 pack for only $9.99.</li>
            <li> only suggestion I would have for improvement is more colors, as the pink cover, which now resides on my toothbrush, was none too popular in my household, and, in my experience, is studiously avoided by boys, of whom some households have more than two.&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money to save yourself the time cleaning and germs that build up without it.</li>
            <li> should be worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price</li>
            <li> and I was surprised at how great this simple idea worked.  </li>
            <li> The Sonic Seal prevents this effectively and one Sonic Seal lasts the entire life of the replaceable toothbrush head.  </li>
            <li> Love this product, just changed toothbrush after 3 months; no mess or gook using this seal.  </li>
            <li> Oh, they also do a great job of keeping water and other junk out of the inner compartment where the magnets do their magic.</li>
            <li> I used corn starch on the sleeves and they went right on the heads.  </li>
            <li> Product delivery was right on time, too.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the company to see that their product is being offered at a reasonable price, &amp; I&#x27;ll know where to order when I need Sonic Seals in the future.</li>
            <li> Sonic Seal really keeps your toothbrush handle clean.</li>
            <li> This is a great little product!  </li>
            <li> But once you get the hang of it, it becomes very easy for future times.  </li>
            <li> Great product, it helps with keeping the bacteria out of all the small spaces that the brush has.  </li>
            <li> I have had no trouble at all with mine and have found they are quite easy to put on and remove.</li>
            <li> When it comes time to replace the brush it is nice and dry inside the unit.</li>
            <li> More options and better pricing missing needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the only one using the brush, so maybe that makes it more useful and logical for me.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a great way to not only help keep them clean, but to tell them apart from each other.</li>
            <li> They are a little tricky to put on, but they fit tight and work perfectly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly remarkable to finally remove the cover and find absolutely NO presence of mold or any of the brown gunk that otherwise seeps into the nooks and crannies of the original brush handle and head.    </li>
            <li> Our toothbrushes remain dry and CLEAN!!  </li>
            <li> and get a new clean tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> But they keep the gunk out of my toothbrush and keep it clean and running like new.</li>
            <li> As soon as I tried to put the first one on, it ripped.  </li>
            <li> Now if you never disassemble your brush, use the heads for a year or so before changing, and are willing to take the time to get the seal positioned correctly, you may find this very helpful and the price worth it.    </li>
            <li> I think it actually looks better in there than before I put it on -</li>
            <li> I tore my first cover that way, until I figured out how to put it on correctly.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare and use it daily</li>
            <li> I ripped one on first try.  </li>
            <li> Happened upon these and was willing to try anything.</li>
            <li> They perform exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> After purchasing my first electric toothbrush, I saw the reviews about cleaning issues the brush had.</li>
            <li> I fought with first one and then had an idea.</li>
            <li> (Keep the glove on hand in case you have to make more protectors later on.)    </li>
            <li> My wife and I both have the sonicare toothbrush and were amazed at how well the sonic seal does exactly what it advertises.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and think it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> love this because it keeps the water out of the sonic care casing which is moldy and gross.</li>
            <li> This product works really well!</li>
            <li> I pour a bit of rubbing alcohol inside the seal first</li>
            <li> The first one that I tried to put on ripped</li>
            <li> First these are not heads, but covers.</li>
            <li> For a while I tried the rubber glove finger method but it proved unsustainable; I either don&#x27;t have the skill or patience to consistently make that approach work.</li>
            <li> Some people said it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> (I can just rinse the toothbrush more carefully and more frequently).</li>
            <li> Glows in the dark, which is kind of fun.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Would work better if you are the only one using it.</li>
            <li> I guess they work alright, but why doesn&#x27;t Sonicare provide a free fix for their mold producing tooth brush heads or replace the germ infested item with better technology either free to those of use that bought these brushes or at least at a discounted amount.  </li>
            <li> After replacing head after head, I decided someone must have addressed this problem by now and sure enough I found these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> first one ripped (and was therefore useless)when</li>
            <li> I found that it is easiest to first get the sleeve over the brush, and then turn the sleeve inside out.</li>
            <li> After 3+ years of use, I came back to buy replacements and it doesn&#x27;t look like they&#x27;re sold on Amazon any more.  </li>
            <li> They also help to differentiate our different toothbrushes :-)</li>
            <li> Love it, no problems at all, product is exactly as explained by the sellers with the exact final result mentioned.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> It would be nice if they sold them separately and had purple or a darker pink.</li>
            <li> It would be nice to have a 3 pack with no colors (e.g., pink).</li>
            <li> But the first one I put on my toothbrush tore as I pulled it onto the brush.  </li>
            <li> Glad i finally found a product that can do this.  </li>
            <li> This product totally solved the problem and now I love my toothbrush again.  </li>
            <li> After the most recent head replacement (about 3 months ago), I decided to do an experiment</li>
            <li> I had one tear on me as I put it on the first toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Wish these seals were around years ago when I first began using Sonicare brushes.</li>
            <li> A very cleaver invention!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I only wish they came in more colors.</li>
            <li> Did exactly what I wanted and kept water, etc.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t inexpensive but it&#x27;s exactly what it represents itself to be</li>
            <li> Using these eliminates the extra removal and cleaning that prevents mold from growing when junk does get inside the threading or the top connection of the brush head</li>
            <li> On my first year of use, I realized that there was always a build-up of molds that happen right within the very neck of the brush head (where you screw in the brush replacement).  </li>
            <li> I purchased these in December 2013 for around $16, which is pretty pricy for 3 little rubbery protectors for my toothbrush, but at the time I felt it was worth the money not to have to cut my own out of latex gloves to protect my hundred-buck-toothbrush.</li>
            <li> white seal is almost invisible when installed, but the blue and red do a good job of indentifying the brushes if you have more than one around the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> I purchased these some time ago and amazingly, i have only used one so far.</li>
            <li> And these would not be very practical if two or more people share the same handle -</li>
            <li> When you look at the item, your first thought might be &amp;#34;a condom for my toothbrush?!?&amp;#34;  It certainly does look like that.  </li>
            <li> It offers a nice tight fit around anywhere moisture could get into the sonicare.</li>
            <li> This pretty much prevents you from disassembling the brush/base for traveling.</li>
            <li> They are TIGHT, which makes them effective, so you should be aware of that.</li>
            <li> When I first received them I thought there was NO WAY they would fit over the toothbrush, and I actually came back to this site to look at other reviews to make sure I would be able to get them on.  </li>
            <li> only problem with them is that they prevent the easy removal of the brush head if you travel a lot.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather make sure I wash and dry out the inside of the brush then listen to the horrid noise these things create.</li>
            <li> I found them easy to put onto the toothbrush, though I don&#x27;t think they could be put on and off multiple times without breaking.  </li>
            <li> Instant Order Update says I purchased these in Jan of 2011, so it has lasted over a year and still going strong.  </li>
            <li> I would have preferred that the product could be ordered singly, but I suppose I have spares for when the cover wears out and needs replacing :)</li>
            <li> Can certainly see why some reviewers are saying it ripped during the process.</li>
            <li> Loved the retro pink and pretty blue.</li>
            <li> One caveat, these sleeves are very difficult to get over the brush head and the body of the brush, but once you figure out how to get it in the right position it won&#x27;t move, and it seals the brush head perfectly.</li>
            <li> but I believe it needs to be that tight to keep the water and moisture out effectively.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little challenging to put them on (try rolling them on like a sock) but it is worth the time.</li>
            <li> The Sonic Seal is hard to get on and it probably takes a good five minutes to coax and persuade it to do so.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to just slip over the bristles and tug down over the neck of the brush head.</li>
            <li> Good concept, but much too hard to use.  </li>
            <li> I have only had the Sonicare for a few days and it works great</li>
            <li> Would I have bought them if I knew what they really looked like?</li>
            <li> Thanks anyway.</li>
            <li> This defeats the whole purpose of the product.  </li>
            <li> I did use some powder, but it didn&#x27;t seem to help all that much.</li>
            <li> Basically muffles so much vibration it defeats the point of the brush.</li>
            <li> It makes keeping your toothbrush handle so much cleaner.</li>
            <li> I made a point to watch the video on the sonic seal website to see the proper way to fit the seal over your toothbrush, and had no problems.   </li>
            <li> It really protects the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The idea is great but the execution is poor.</li>
            <li> However it takes to much time to change out these heads with this seal on it.</li>
            <li> The colors leave a LOT to be desired...other color options would be much appreciated.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Remember that this isn&#x27;t designed to be removed very often so don&#x27;t get it if you share a toothbrush with somebody or unscrew the head every week for travel.&lt;br</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t mind that it completely mutes the vibrations of your brush rendering it basically about as powerful as a cheapy grocery store knock-off.</li>
            <li> Really a shame.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li> Once on, it does its job very well.</li>
            <li> Now, I have not ordered any, so I do not know how much the shipping is</li>
            <li> WAY TOO MUCH for what it is.</li>
            <li> These are absolute junk.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money in my opinion, the time it has saved us cleaning the base and heads alone is well worth it to this happy family!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t really matter to</li>
            <li> highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I was really looking for an answer to the mold growth in the toothbrush</li>
            <li> and I took the toothbrush apart and then gently tried to remove the &#x27;Sonic Seal.</li>
            <li> and it would get so much mold in it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much nicer</li>
            <li> Very functional.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> thing there are three in the pack as two of them tore pulling as gently as I could.</li>
            <li> My husband  rinses his whole handle and brush and probably doesn&#x27;t wipe it off very well.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this to all Sonic-care users!  </li>
            <li> Really, they glow.</li>
            <li> would love nicer colors or all clear, will try to remember to try the cornstarch next time to make application easier, but..</li>
            <li> Since they are fragile, maybe adding an extra one in case of tearing would be a nice step?</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had them for more than a year now, and even with having taken them off and put them back on each time we switch to a new toothbrush head, they&#x27;re still in new condition.</li>
            <li> My first attempt on new order broke one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easily removed so you need to have your own handle and brush.  </li>
            <li> After I received them, I became concerned that the material was too thin, but it proved to be very, very, very strong and stretches for an air-tight fit.</li>
            <li> These seals seem to do a pretty good job at keeping the water out - its only been a few weeks</li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these for anyone who has a Sonicare e series brush, it&#x27;ll save you money (from replacing brush heads more frequently due to mold)</li>
            <li> My dog and every other dog I have encountered with these love them.  </li>
            <li> The upside is that three months later, when it is time to replace the brush, everything is clean and muck-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to clean it every time I brushed my teeth.</li>
            <li> Until I bought these, I was constantly having to clean yucky stuff out of the inside of the head.  </li>
            <li> I was thinking of buying these to solve the ridiculous design problem of the otherwise good Sonicare brushes...</li>
            <li> As stated in the ad, these are NOT for people who share a single brush handleâ€”there is no way you are going to easily switch heads once this is on.</li>
            <li> They were strong, sturdy and a single pack lasted over a year tearing even with reuse.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions very precisely -- did not use a tool to put one of these seals on my Sonicare toothbrush, but the seal ripped as soon as I gave it a slight tug.</li>
            <li> but it would be nice to have a single or double pack offer as well.</li>
            <li> I agree the price is high, but it saves time not having to clean the inside of the brush head regularly!</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW - this thing really works!</li>
            <li> And the glow in the dark colors are a cute idea.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t give it a full 5 stars since I can&#x27;t vouch for the product as it was actually intended.</li>
            <li> Not easy to get on and the material will tear very easily.  </li>
            <li> If the price came down it would get a lot, it would get a better review.</li>
            <li> I decided I needed a whole new Sonicare despite the price.</li>
            <li> ..keeps moisture out leaving dry and rust free...</li>
            <li> I have an older model Sonicare toothbrush and never had a mold problem until I replaced it with the newer style head.</li>
            <li> It is necessary to pull the sonic seal completely up and over the brush itself so that screw on part of the head is free to rotate.  </li>
            <li> Luckily my GF has a similar Sonicare</li>
            <li> I really appreciate knowing my toothbrush is clean inside and that I don&#x27;t have to take the brush head apart every time I use my toothbrush to dry everything.</li>
            <li> so this isn&#x27;t very useful in my house, in other words I will not recommend or be able to use what I spent my money on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommended and pretty easy to put on with a little water to help.</li>
            <li> These are very soft and much thicker/durable than latex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but if you remove your brush head and look inside you&#x27;ll gladly pay the price to prevent that gooey mess.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Purchased to keep our expensive brushes clean... goes on super easy (if you follow the instructions).  </li>
            <li> They are kind of hard to put on (very tight-fitting), but completely keep the moisture out of the handle for months!  </li>
            <li> WOW!!</li>
            <li> 1) out of the package feels a little bit sticky (like most silicone)</li>
            <li> The packaging was flimsey (thats ok in todays over packaged world) but offered little instruction.</li>
            <li> Very much worth it to not have to clean out the handle every few days.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to pull them down below where the toothbrush unscrews!</li>
            <li> It stays clean and gets bone dry.</li>
            <li> This is a real necessity because the toothbrush head lets liquid get inside but this product completely seals this opening.</li>
            <li> Great idea but useless</li>
            <li> I noticed another review which suggested a light dusting of corn starch inside the cover to facilitate slipping on the device.</li>
            <li> After having purchased the Sonicare because of recommendations from my dentist, I did not want to risk my 15 year old skipping brushing his teeth because it is to much of a chore, so I took them off.  </li>
            <li> Perfectly dry and clean \\&quot;guts\\&quot; of my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine now for over a year and all is clean and dry inside my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> but since you can take the brush head apart and clean and dry</li>
            <li> Clean and dry toothbrush&lt;</li>
            <li> I bought these even though I read many reviews saying they were a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Actually they are quite worth the price if you are concerned at all about germs and fungus growing inside your toothbrush.</li>
            <li> When I finally got it on and used it, oh, it was so worth it.  </li>
            <li> I normally would go to.</li>
            <li> I would say if you feel unsure use your least favorite color first to do a test run... or do the cornstarch trick.  </li>
            <li> Not hard.  </li>
            <li> 3) make sure your brush is completely dry both inside &amp; out for the obvious reasons you don&#x27;t want to trap gunk under the seal.    </li>
            <li> They are slightly tricky to install, but that&#x27;s because they fit quite snugly and really keep the tooth brushing residue from seeping into the chamber and threads under the brush head.</li>
            <li> Tears easily, one of the seals tore while pulling it down over the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I put it on my brand new sonicare</li>
            <li> Once you put on the Sonic Seal, it&#x27;s meant to stay on until you change your head for a new one.    </li>
            <li> I just replaced my brush head and put on a new seal.</li>
            <li> Started using this with a new sonicare brush about 7 months ago.</li>
            <li> These seals keep all moisture out of the head and the inside of the head looks as new when taking it off to replace it.  </li>
            <li> Used baby powder to make putting on a new one on a new brush.  </li>
            <li> I did not have any ripping issues as others have mentioned and I replaced it onto my new head with no issues.</li>
            <li> These covers have kept my toothbrush (not the brush itself) looking new.  </li>
            <li> I put a new one on every time I replace the toothbrush head.</li>
            <li> Now with my new neck cover I don&#x27;t have that problem anymore.</li>
            <li> The only down size is it not being very easy to put on and o have torn one before in process.  </li>
            <li> It is a very tight fitting silicone-like sleeve that fits over the brush head.  </li>
            <li> Previous versions of this product were thicker and did not break as easily.</li>
            <li> will say it makes taking it apart for travel a bit less easy</li>
            <li> /&gt;These silicone sonicare seals keep the area between the body and the head dry, so it&#x27;s always clean (clear of said</li>
            <li> but the Seals make it more difficult to secure the brush to the handle.  </li>
            <li> These are a really good idea, but much too expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try this next time but sounds like a stellar suggestion.</li>
            <li> Many past reviewers stated that theirs tore while they were trying to put them on.  </li>
            <li> When I had my first sonic toothbrush, I was cleaning the inside of my toothbrush every third day or so.  </li>
            <li> It does make it a bit more difficult to unscrew the head to pop in in the UV sanitizer, but still well worth it!  </li>
            <li> It seals out water moisture and gunk, and (wow!)</li>
            <li> I ended up getting my first cavity in several years.</li>
            <li> As for durability, I&#x27;m on the same seal as when I first bought my pack in 2010, so that must say something.</li>
            <li> 4 of us in the family and each with the same exact toothbrush....</li>
            <li> They are not difficult to put on and by using one you&#x27;ll save a fortune by making your toothbrush heads last longer.</li>
            <li> The order includes a package of three covers, but in trying to get them onto the sonicare, the first two actually ripped apart.</li>
            <li> Then you can smooth it down the rest of the way by rubbing/pushing your finger over the silicon in the direction</li>
            <li> Keeps the interior of my Sonicare clean and dry, and with a small puff of cornstarch or baby powder, I find it easy to to put onto my toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Time will tell but I would advise getting the seals for your brushes, old or new.</li>
            <li> They are a little hard to get on at first, but I suspect that&#x27;s why it can keep a good seal and keep the water and toothpaste out of the working parts.</li>
            <li> I have struggled for the last several years with how to keep the inside of the toothbrush head clean and this completely solves this issue.</li>
            <li> I\\&quot;m tired of having to buy more parts just to make a product work the way it should in the first place.</li>
            <li> Even with the little tear, it protects the inside of the toothbrush just fine.</li>
            <li> but then if you want it to be waterproof it should fit tight.</li>
            <li> But I bought a Sonicare two-pack at a certain Seattle-based big box mart, and now my wife and I can brush mold-free.  </li>
            <li> If the product description or the manufacturer&#x27;s website noted this significant limitation, I would not have purchased it and it would have received one less 1-star review.</li>
            <li> This little boot covers the toothbrush head and handle enough so the liquids don&#x27;t seep into the handle pocket, proving a more sanitary toothbrush.</li>
            <li> If you have a Sonic tooth brush then you are familiar with the black goo that seems to accumulate under the brush cover-</li>
            <li> A complete waste of money and a huge source of frustration.</li>
            <li> I do wish they made a three-pack of all clear covers though.  </li>
            <li> Suggestion to makers: offer a package of all clear.  </li>
            <li> I would prefer to have a pack of all clear.</li>
            <li> Also, there was a clear one in my package.</li>
            <li> But now that I&#x27;ve done both, I am grateful for the complete functionality of these seals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years, and it works very well.</li>
            <li> It shouldn&#x27;t tear for a long while, though, as they&#x27;re fitted pretty tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used these on my old Sonicare.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These soft silicone seals go over the two areas of leakage and look as though they will not allow leakage.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a couple ways this could be fixed.  </li>
            <li> This product solves the problem completely.</li>
            <li> I bought the 3 pack directly from the manufacturer&#x27;s website which saved me a couple bucks.</li>
            <li> longer because the material clearly starts thinning out when you stretch it that far.  </li>
            <li> it stays trouble free</li>
            <li> After much tugging and pulling, I finally got these on my and my husband&#x27;s toothbrush heads.  </li>
            <li> Keeps water &amp; saliva &amp; toothpaste out of the head, yet doesn&#x27;t change the effecitveness of the sonic action.    </li>
            <li> but wow.  </li>
            <li> I purchased my whole family sonicares by philips, only to find out about the mold issue.</li>
            <li> There is no way I&#x27;ll pay that much for an item that probably only costs pennies to manufacture.</li>
            <li> but I bought it directly from the company that sells it.</li>
            <li> Not to mention the fact that the goo had a direct route to my mouth.</li>
            <li> Periodically taking it apart and cleaning it with baking soda/vinegar and an old toothbrush wouldn&#x27;t always kill the smell/goop accumulation on the inside--and frankly, it was a pain.     </li>
            <li> The first time I tried to get this on, it took me a long time.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t looking forward to replacing heads, but it was much easier to get on the second time.  </li>
            <li> The seals seem to work so far.</li>
            <li> With the Sonic Seal, you completely negate the chances of any mold build-up.  </li>
            <li> would not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve reused these over 6 times each so far.</li>
            <li> I tried a different toothbrush, the Oral B, and really didn&#x27;t like the results compared to my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> It completely seals off that area where the blackness assembles.</li>
            <li> This thing complete eliminates all that.  </li>
            <li> By following the instructions other reviewers gave (a dusting of corn starch on the inside) and taking care when pulling over the brush head, I found the Sonic Seal to be the ONLY solution to remaining a Sonicare afficionado, and to keeping my brush more sterile.</li>
            <li> only issue is that the first time I tried to slide on toothbrush the seal ripped (thank goodness you get 3 in a pack)...be very careful putting on and don&#x27;t stretch too much at first....</li>
            <li> The product is expensive and strong enough to put on the toothbrush without easily coming apart.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not completely easy to get on, but once it&#x27;s on properly, it keeps your toothbrush crevices clean for so much longer.  </li>
            <li> If you want to chage heads, simply roll it up to the top of the shoulder of the brush, and then roll it back down when reinstalling it on the handle.</li>
            <li> problem with the sonicare design is that the constant dribble of water back down the brush head can enter the space at the top of the handle.  </li>
            <li> The material is quite strong, and can withstand being stretched a lot without tearing....unless you happen to gouge it by mistake with your fingernails, or if you use tweezers or other tools to put it on.</li>
            <li> Instead of the expense and trouble of purchasing and applying these seals, isn&#x27;t it simpler, quicker, and ultimately just as effective to occasionally remove the Sonicare screw-on brush head and clean out accumulated gunk with small (manual) toothbrush and household cleaner (Windex, alcohol, etc.)?  </li>
            <li> As long as you can leave your head on your brush handle, these will keep your brush head clean and dry inside.</li>
            <li> I checked the head after the first week and it was bone dry!</li>
            <li> No water gets through these puppies, so no black mold stuff growing within your toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I have five people in my family, so after I practiced on the first one then next four were no big deal.  </li>
            <li> Just 1 tiny spot recently started to get a little moldy, but still works 100 times better than not using 1.</li>
            <li> At first glance, I thought this was priced a little too high...</li>
            <li> I am still on my first seal, the pink and blue one are still brand new in the package.</li>
            <li> I very rarely in my reviews disagree with others openly, but come on people, its designed to keep water out of a crack and it has to be tight.  </li>
            <li> Recently I ordered new replacement.</li>
            <li> It was much, much easier than last time and only took a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> They have a bit of a chew yet are soft enough for my dentally challenged old girl.</li>
            <li> I love my sonicare toothbrush, but the gross filth and scum that builds up under the head was a major turn-off for me, but now that is resolved.</li>
            <li> have no regrets!</li>
            <li> like many of the reviews have said, it is very hard to get one</li>
            <li> so it is wet and slides down easily.  </li>
            <li> Saving the extra 10 minutes fiddling with the DIY every other week is well worth $17.</li>
            <li> A little cumbersome to screw the head on and off the sonicare, but well worth the effort.</li>
            <li> However, it holds the brush so tight it does not vibrate right.  </li>
            <li> I remember hearing about these when they came out several years ago, but the high cost and especially the attitude of the business owner toward customers made me decide against it.</li>
            <li> I clearly didn&#x27;t read the product description properly.  </li>
            <li> They do rip if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> and THEY WILL RIP IF YOU ARE NOT CAREFUL PUTTING THEM ON.  </li>
            <li> but apparently he&#x27;s a dentist</li>
            <li> Considering buying these seal covers for Sonicare but completely turned off by statement on site: &amp;#34;Removing it daily will be a pain in the</li>
            <li> At first, I thought it was user error, then I realized this product just does not fit on the head without bending the laws of physics and nearly breaking the replaceable head.</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy the product again realizing now that you have to be pretty careful when stretching the product over the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> There are grooves that the seal contours into providing a much better seal than any thin latex can.</li>
            <li> They are not cheap but are worth it.</li>
            <li> These undoubtedly work, but they are expensive, so I tried making my own, as follows.  </li>
            <li> (3) Slip the glove finger down over the brush head, leaving the tip end above the top gasket of the brush head, and pulling the rest of the latex down to where the brush head joins the handle.</li>
            <li> Leave it loose at the point where the brush shaft comes out of the main body so that you don&#x27;t dampen the vibrations of the toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not a single spore!</li>
            <li> was careful to follow others&#x27; suggestions regarding the cornstarch, and it didn&#x27;t tear, although I had to be super careful</li>
            <li> I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend taking it on and off regularly, like trying to share the same handle between separate heads, but pulling it on and off every few months with the head replacement has worked fine for me.  </li>
            <li> I have had this on for over 2 months and did notice (as someone else had mentioned) that it had shifted slightly and was no longer seated exactly into the groove of the brush.</li>
            <li> The Sonic Seal works really well for those who are not sharing the handle with other family or friends.</li>
            <li> and it was hard to clean.</li>
            <li> Before I purchased the Sonic Seal, I had to dismantle and clean at least once a week to prevent a build up of mold where the brush head attached to the battery portion.  </li>
            <li> simple product fills such a clear need that I have to give it five stars.</li>
            <li> Cover slipped down the neck just fine, no tearing, and was in place in less than 20 seconds.    </li>
            <li> Just apply a little baby powder when you put it on the first time and you&#x27;ll never have a problem.</li>
            <li> The first time I put these on mine and my husband&#x27;s toothbrushes, I did tear these a little.</li>
            <li> If you own a Sonicare E-series toothbrush and have replaced the head at least once, you probably found a gross mess under the head.  </li>
            <li> Time can only tell if these will be worth the cost, which, at $16.99 is a little over a third of what I paid for the Sonicare Essence.</li>
            <li> I was a bit afraid after reading some reviews here, but I am very pleased with the product, it keeps the toothbrush gunk-free.</li>
            <li> First of all it&#x27;s a struggle to force the brush head thru the narrow portion of the cover and once having done</li>
            <li> It is worth the small effort (maybe a minute each) to put on.</li>
            <li> I really have a hard time cleaning it because the inside neck seems tight for your fingers to reach and clean.  </li>
            <li> It has definitely helped keep the \\&quot;ick\\&quot; areas that others have complained about clean.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Stuff\\&quot; still runs down the handle, but this can&#x27;t really be blamed on the seal.</li>
            <li> I was upset and should have returned them immediately for a refund, but I was able to get the other two on without tearing them and since I don&#x27;t take the heads off frequently, I figured it would be tough to damage them.</li>
            <li> (okay, I was a little lazy)</li>
            <li> After I first tried this with cornstarch, I actually couldn&#x27;t get the bottom of the seal to stay below the bottom of the replaceable head -- I would pull it down, and it kept rising up -- which left the entire bottom exposed to moisture entry.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers that this seems quite high to fix a design flaw with the entry level Sonicare Essence.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for the glow in the dark effect, and finally it works.</li>
            <li> The packaging is a bit juvenile, making the product look like a novelty item (who needs glow-in-the-dark toothbrush covers?), and three guesses as to what we are calling these in my adult household, but they really work, and that is what it is all about, anyway.</li>
            <li> They seemed a bit thin and easily ripped.</li>
            <li> I loved my Sonicare, until the fight against the black goo got to difficult.</li>
            <li> My only \\&quot;complaint\\&quot; is that they seem pretty expensive for what clearly did not cost much to produce.  </li>
            <li> They are hard to get onto the brush, but they are well worth it.  </li>
            <li> We recently ordered new Sonicare tooth brushes and the sonic seal popped up as one of those things that other people bought at the same time.  </li>
            <li> When I was trying to put on the first one, it ripped, so had to take another new one and try to work it on the brush slowly and carefully.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t have a tight seal like the older model.</li>
            <li> Other reviews warned of this but its worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> Although it serves its purpose (of keeping water out of the place where the top and bottom pieces of the Sonicare are connected), the rubber is very thin.</li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t had any of the problems other reviews have mentioned with ripping or with putting them on the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> They fit very snug and I found very difficult to apply, but with my wife&#x27;s help we made it.</li>
            <li> Only time will tell how long these seals will last.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend, although I wish they would just make plain white ones.</li>
            <li> One star missing just for the high price.</li>
            <li> Very disapointed in them, waste of money!</li>
            <li> I just wiggled, jiggled, stretched and pulled until I finally got it into position.</li>
            <li> I imagine they will last a really long time, so I have two back ups for a really, really long time since they come in a 3 pack.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using the ones I already have for as long as they last</li>
            <li> But, I gave this 4 stars because you get 3 in one package and as long as you take your time putting it on, it will likely not break.</li>
            <li> I recommend getting the seal wet after washing it with soap &amp; water first and leaving it a little wet to help slid it into proper position.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;To apply the Sonic Seal, I washed the brush handle, dried it thoroughly, and put on a new brush head</li>
            <li> I will just have to take off my toothbrush head after each use to ensure it gets enough air to dry before mold forms.    </li>
            <li> It does work and keeps the inner parts of the toothbrush dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are sold in packs of three on Amazon in white, pink and blue.</li>
            <li> However, I already had the Essence, and a few extra brush heads, but stopped using it because I was put off by the idea of putting mold anywhere near my mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what she does different than I do, as I don&#x27;t have the leaking problem, and the problem for her carried over to new heads for the toothbrush too.</li>
            <li> We replaced our brush heads every 6 months or so, and would always be subject to a large amount of black mold when taking the head off.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s just not realistic to spend 10 minutes removing and replacing the seal every time a different user needs to use the handle.    </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for every sonicare toothbrush owner, you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re missing!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absurd that a special product should be needed to correct what&#x27;s obviously a design flaw in the Sonicare Essence line.  </li>
            <li> The product is difficult to get in place, but once there, it is secure and seems to keep the cap sealed off from all liquid.  </li>
            <li> My biggest disappointment is that you can&#x27;t leave it on permanently unless you have more than toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It seems strange that this hasn&#x27;t been solved or has it??</li>
            <li> I put the blue one on my husbands toothbrush, and the pink one on mine.</li>
            <li> so it was a problem with water getting in and grey gunk growing.  </li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t seen any grey gunk developing since I started using them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of either the pink or the blue.</li>
            <li> it would have just trapped bacteria because I couldn&#x27;t completely get it on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Sonicare user for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> so hopefully I won&#x27;t have to re order for a long time.</li>
            <li> Not much thicker than a condom which is basically what it is, only for your Sonic tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Strangely, the guy who shares a bathroom with one of us, with identical (but separate) toothbrush, toothpaste, soap, and vanity, did not have any problems with mold growing on his toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I put the pink on mine and the blue on my husbands.  </li>
            <li> As others have said, it is necessary to roll them on firmly but carefully so as not to rip the material.</li>
            <li> Still, a good idea for one brush head that does not get removed from base unit.</li>
            <li> Maybe I am not smart enough.</li>
            <li> After getting gross black mold in my Sonicare for years, I finally found a solution.  </li>
            <li> This might be a good option for a single user who puts the seal onto the head once the head is already attached to the base.  </li>
            <li> a little expensive but does the trick :)</li>
            <li> Incidentally, Philips Customer Care gave me the run-around and kept telling me that the mold was due to varying humidity in various homes.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4-stars was due to the price.</li>
            <li> Will buy as long as I&#x27;m using my Sonic Care toothbrush!</li>
            <li> the other 2 went on the brushes easily enough.</li>
            <li> The seals a a very tight fit, a little difficult to get on, but they really, really do the job they are supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> If you are VERY careful installing and removing these, you can make one of the Sonic Seals last for three or four Sonicare brush heads.</li>
            <li> I just checked inside my Sonicare after using this for a month and it is bone dry in there and no signs of mold.  </li>
            <li> The inside of my toothbrush has been bone dry since July.</li>
            <li> and I no longer need to disassemble the toothbrush after each use, rinse out and air dry the pieces.  </li>
            <li> They wanted me to take off and dry my brush head every day.  </li>
            <li> Over time this area grows mold and who knows what else, that needs to be cleaned out(a place that is difficult to get to to clean).</li>
            <li> Then, after rinsing, allow to dry overnight, wrapped in dry napkin or paper towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it was still dry</li>
            <li> it let it dry so that gook wouldn&#x27;t return.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still dry underneath and</li>
            <li> After brushing, I  rinse the brush and dry it with a paper towel.  </li>
            <li> They are thin and need to be put on carefully, but worth the effort.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s easier to tear than a single piece of paper.</li>
            <li> But these covers do have a limited lifespan.</li>
            <li> As long as you are careful, the seal will not rip and you can keep re-using it.  </li>
            <li> And it is ABSOLUTELY frustrating that this product needs to be purchased and used in the first place.  </li>
            <li> But it seems to be made more flimsily now, and is very difficult to get onto the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I could have just used ceram wrap, but that can come loose and looks....</li>
            <li> Plus, they actually keep out the \\&quot;plaque-gouk\\&quot; from seeping down into the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> We ended up having to pull it up, attach the brush, and then pull it back down.  </li>
            <li> However, I read the comments by Sonic Seal in response to less than positive reviews, and Sonic Seal is so rude and unreceptive to customer feedback that there is no way I would give them business.</li>
            <li> and it was perfectly dry!  </li>
            <li> and it was still dry and spotless inside!</li>
            <li> (2) Cut off a very tiny section at the end of the detached fingertip (the resulting small hole will stretch temporarily in the next step).</li>
            <li> Too expensive since you will be lucky to get one of the three on.</li>
            <li> Quite simply, follow the instructions on their website, but at the last step you can pull the cover lower by squeezing it between your thumb and fingers and coaxing it down a few times.</li>
            <li> So far it has kept my Sonicare toothbrush clean on the inside, but I am a bit disappointed at the quality.</li>
            <li> It was like flushing money down the toilet.</li>
            <li> I was exceptionally disappointed that the new version is so flimsy that it is all too easy to destroy it while trying to put it on the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> These last so long that I clean them when changing brush heads and use them over and over until I get sick of the color.  </li>
            <li> When we replace our heads now, we see absolutely no mold.  </li>
            <li> Especially after reading these reviews this looks like a waste of money.    </li>
            <li> If you do, it will fall apart at that spot as is to be expected.    </li>
            <li> after taking the plunge, I will never go back to putting mold an inch away from my mouth everyday.  </li>
            <li> I had no problem slipping this on over the damp brush head.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re worried about gunk buildup, learn to brush with your lips closed around the post of the unit.</li>
            <li> Philips left a narrow space there to allow the brush arm to vibrate.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful and you can do it without a problem.  </li>
            <li> How are you supposed to possibly install without destroying bristles?  </li>
            <li> so I gave her the pink one.</li>
            <li> Once you get the cover on the brush head, you cannot change brush heads without partially removing it.</li>
            <li> you need to be careful turning the brush on and off with the silicone unit in use.</li>
            <li> It took me all of five minutes to carefully put two of them on.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews really carefully.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful putting them o not to tear them.</li>
            <li> Getting it over the threaded nut was harder.</li>
            <li> If you wet the brush end of the toothbrush before pulling it over, it will be easier.  </li>
            <li> well spent.</li>
            <li> I of course wanted the pink one.</li>
            <li> but once you do, it will save you all the trouble of removing any mold build-up in the future.</li>
            <li> They take some finessing to get on... but just be careful.</li>
            <li> I spent a while cleaning with paper towels, clorox wipes and a toothpick around the crevices - UGH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hate spending so much $$ on these, but they last for years, and I much prefer using these than cleaning out a gunky toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is not going to damage the brush but can result in a rather nasty pile of goo accumulating in the top of the handle and its hard to clean</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how well it works, but I certainly do not look forward to swapping the brush in three months.</li>
            <li> Cleaning them was just plain Gross!!</li>
            <li> It is difficult to put it on and ripped right the way.  </li>
            <li> It is worth its weight in gold because when you remove it and unscrew the brush head, the inside of your toothbrush base will still be pristine, new, and dry.</li>
            <li> Getting the seal back in place is not easy.  </li>
            <li> (it is a very tight fit and difficult to put on).  </li>
            <li> A waste of money and difficult to use and clean around too.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve had a sonicare, you undoubtedly know that changing heads for the first time can be a fright of moldy slime from water that&#x27;s crept between the body and the head, which may lead one to constantly clean and dry that area for fear of a nasty moldy/slimy surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sharp fingernails or rough skin or anything that would cut into the seal.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re in the habit of handling things very heavily, then you&#x27;ll want to be extra careful.</li>
            <li> but I am so glad I don&#x27;t have to live with that awful build up and stink!</li>
            <li> I just have to spend extra time cleaning the inside almost everyday to prevent the yucky black stuff from making a comeback.</li>
            <li> The only moderately annoying thing is that you can&#x27;t change brush heads easily.</li>
            <li> I would take time to use wood screws instead of nails, deburr sharp edges, etc.</li>
            <li> Yes, I know we should be cleaning the brushes regularly, but we were lazy about</li>
            <li> seal was slightly difficult to put on the first time.  </li>
            <li> Also, I was wondering if other people are put off from the yucky blackstuff inside the Sonicare tooth brush??</li>
            <li> First one I applied to the unit seemed really  tedious to get on.</li>
            <li> As other reviews have mentioned, it&#x27;s a pain to put the thing on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit that it was extremely difficult to put on the first time.</li>
            <li> My mom was just telling me the other day</li>
            <li> Seals out moisture and other crud.</li>
            <li> They were pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> Ewwwwww--defeated the purpose of the expensive brush in the first place.</li>
            <li> The narrow neck ripped when I stretched it on.</li>
            <li> I had stopped using my sonicare due to the grossness that kept growing under the head.  </li>
            <li> [...]  Only $9.99 for three plus small S&amp;H  --    </li>
            <li> They were a little hard to put on, but once I got the cover on I noticed an immediate difference in the toothbrush and realized I wont need to be replacing the brush heads nearly as frequently</li>
            <li> The cover keeps the Sonicare toothbrush totally dry in the little spots where mildew and mold like to grow.</li>
            <li> I broke down and spent the $17.</li>
            <li> Move the sleeve as far down on the brush head shaft and then slowly pull the sleeve down onto the body of the brush head.</li>
            <li> Yes, I can see where they could rip, but ours didn&#x27;t, I was very very careful after reading the review that said he ripped his.</li>
            <li> I was getting so frustrated with trying to keep the inside of my toothbrush clean and dry</li>
            <li> I use to have to take the head off everyday and leave it to dry on the counter.  </li>
            <li> so perhaps he just lacks social skills, and isn&#x27;t as dishonest as he presents himself to be.</li>
            <li> So, instead of easily swapping out different brushes, I guess the designers of this terrible product think I should have several sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> It feels like silicon, but it&#x27;s nowhere near as tough.</li>
            <li> Some people have complained that this is hard to put on, and it is or it has to be a little difficult or it wouldn&#x27;t fit tightly enough to keep the water out.  </li>
            <li> I have to occasionally reseat the little lip that is supposed to fit into the groove between the brush head and the base.</li>
            <li> The Sonic Seal is tough, durable, and I have not had any trouble with it ripping because it is made of a material that is not designed to slide, so as long as you are careful with the application and don&#x27;t try to slide it, it should survive multiple brush head changings.</li>
            <li> Without the Sonic Seal, the damp seeped in under the brush head, and it was impossible to keep clean and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They glow in the dark, I don&#x27;t know why.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But yes, they do glow in the dark.    </li>
            <li> It has shown no signs of becoming dirty or icky.</li>
            <li> Not worth the $.  </li>
            <li> I did not want to chance my expensive Sonicare head bristles by forcing this seal over them, it wants to pull them all off</li>
            <li> For the price, really not worth it.</li>
            <li> even glows in the dark.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the colors.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical if they would really work or change the performance of the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they do glow in the dark...</li>
            <li> They even glow in the dark....</li>
            <li> The glow in the dark catches me off guard once in a while still.</li>
            <li> Kids like the glow in the dark.</li>
            <li> These things are the consistancy of your average condom, hence the difficulty putting them on the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Works ok, but my husband and I share a toothbrush base, so we have to take our brushes on and off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These things seal the top neck area AND the area where the toothbrush head gets put onto the base.  </li>
            <li> Good idea but terrible design!!</li>
            <li> Then pull it down all the way around past the groove at the bottom of the toothbrush screw-on part before letting it retract to the groove or not since as long as it covers the groove it doesn&#x27;t matter.  </li>
            <li> One hint is to roll down the neck of the seal to get it over the bristles.</li>
            <li> I pulled it down over that joint</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s another struggle to pull the fat portion of the cover down and over the fat portion of the brush head.</li>
            <li> so I was down to 2 sonic seals from the start.  </li>
            <li> the price has gone down.</li>
            <li> He always has a lot of toothpaste flowing down the brush handle when he brushes, seeping into the pocket of the handle.</li>
            <li> I always had a problem with toothpaste traveling down the handle and getting into the &amp;#34;neck&amp;#34; of my toothbrush</li>
            <li> I was on the fence about giving this 5 stars, due to the difficulty in getting it on, but I figured since it does prevent an otherwise hopeless problem, then it deserves 5!</li>
            <li> After my Sonic toothbrush started smelling skanky, I replaced the head, then after using it in the miorning I disassemble it and let it dry -- no more mold.</li>
            <li> They are very thin and it won&#x27;t take much effort to puncture one of them somewhere down the line.</li>
            <li> I agree they are a little difficult to put on, they are very snug.</li>
            <li> Be sure to line the little ridge up with the seam between the head and the base.</li>
            <li> I googled the black mold issue and learned about these Sonic Seals.  </li>
            <li> you are trying to fix the black mold issue,</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my two kids and myself hoping to put an end to the&lt;br /&gt;problem with the yucky black stuff that accumulates inside all three of our Sonicare tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> Do we know of anything else to keep the yucky black stuff away???</li>
            <li> Luckily, I&#x27;ve never had a problem with them.  </li>
            <li> Since using these seals, I haven&#x27;t found one speck of black mould inside my toothbrush handle.</li>
            <li> These are pretty expensive per piece, so that&#x27;s not OK.</li>
            <li> Inside would build up the black moldy looking stuff.  </li>
            <li> When I read a previous review and their satisfaction--I just had to try them.  </li>
            <li> I too have the black gunk problem, didn&#x27;t realize it until changing the brush head.</li>
            <li> and it is AIR TIGHT.</li>
            <li> You have to get a tight seal in order to keep the yuck from getting in the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But there&#x27;s a reason for that, they are tight so they can \\&quot;seal\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It fits way too tightly to put on and take off each time - and that would defeat the intended purpose anyhow.</li>
            <li> If sonicare or the sonic seal people would provide a case that does not require disassembly of the sonicare for travel the tight seal would not be an issue.  </li>
            <li> I understand that they have to be tight...</li>
            <li> Now that I know how to put it on and that you don&#x27;t need to yank tightly at the bottom</li>
            <li> TIGHT on the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> At about $5 a pop they seemed expensive, but I splurged when I bought some new brush heads.</li>
            <li> I live in a very damp maritime climate and before I got the Sonic Seal I had to deal with disgusting mold and mildew colonies inside my toothbrush when it came time to change the brush head, even though I dry it off after each use.</li>
            <li> They are a bit difficult to put on, but nowhere near as hard as I expected from other reviews.</li>
            <li> I remember the base on the first Sonicare unit I used was so big</li>
            <li> What I do is spray a little isopropyl alcohol inside the cover and then slide it on the brush.  </li>
            <li> I took another reviewers advice and sprinkled just a little corn starch inside the sonic seal and tapped out the excess.  </li>
            <li> Use a little bit of baby powder on the inside and out, before you try to put it on.  </li>
            <li> so I held the cover over a bottle of cornstarch powder and squeezed (let the little puff of power land on the inside of the cover but did not sprinkle any powder on it).  </li>
            <li> needed a little bit of stretching to get the ring in place, but again, no problems and now snugly in place.  </li>
            <li> Of course these little covers are snug - If they weren&#x27;t they would not keep the water out.  </li>
            <li> There were no instructions on the bag they came in, just a couple little drawings.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was a little on the pricey side.</li>
            <li> These are a little tricky to get on, but probably because they WORK.  </li>
            <li> I think the product advertising could have been a little clearer.</li>
            <li> Not excited about at all.</li>
            <li> Cons  Requires a little patience to put on.  </li>
            <li> So $8 bucks a piece for what is essentially 3 little toothbrush condoms.</li>
            <li> Plus they glow in the dark!</li>
            <li> used a little cornstarch and</li>
            <li> It is a little tricky to maneuver the Sonic Seal because the silicone is clingy and does not slide.</li>
            <li> You just need to be patient and work with it a little</li>
            <li> little plastic thing creates an air-tight seal between handle and brush, and prevents the muck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is vulgar and completely out of place especially in business advertising!</li>
            <li> it took a few mins to get on toothbrushes</li>
            <li> Also, they are not cheap.</li>
            <li> The tooth brushes get really messy if you don&#x27;t wash them out every day....</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve wasted your money on the seals already, try removing it, and you&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> After getting the seal in the correct spot, there&#x27;s no way to remove the cornstarch trapped under.</li>
            <li> I change it every few months when I dump my toothbrush head.  </li>
            <li> and I did not want to destroy the toothbrush head.  </li>
            <li> kind of terrible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap but it does come in a 3 pack value to offset the cost a bit.</li>
            <li> I knew my husband wouldn&#x27;t like anything but the clear, so I was stuck with the blue (I hate pink)</li>
            <li> She had some trouble with liquids getting inside her toothbrush beneath the head, and some bacterial growth was going on.  </li>
            <li> I tore one putting it on my toothbrush within a few minutes of receiving it in the mail.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s nice to use my sonicare and not feel disgusted about what&#x27;s growing inside it for a change!</li>
            <li> I am a messy brusher</li>
            <li> After a few months I was suspicious and took it off to check.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I am a messy tooth-brusher and my Sonicare would often mold.</li>
            <li> Waste of your money.</li>
            <li> Way to waste your money.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed that the Sonic Seal is made of a material that tears very easily.  </li>
            <li> While you have the seal on it, it is pretty much impossible to screw and unscrew the head onto the toothbrush handle.</li>
            <li> On this unit - the last head got super nasty with black mold (like the horror stories you read).  </li>
            <li> I ended up soaking my brush body upside down in a small amount of hydrogen peroxide to clean the crap from the cavity.</li>
            <li> Man, I definitely DO NOT miss  having to clean that disgusting stuff out of there!</li>
            <li> No more mess.</li>
            <li> It was a little tricky to put on but took no more than a few minutes per toothbrush.</li>
            <li> They are not easy to put on, but they work.</li>
            <li> They are not easy to put on, but I have yet to try the cornstarch trick mentioned by another reviewer.  </li>
            <li> These are not easy to get on, but once it&#x27;s on and covering both seams where gunk leaks into the chamber in the handle, I can leave it on until it&#x27;s time to change the head.  </li>
            <li> I found Amazon to be much less expensive than the local stores</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why there have been other complaints about this product ripping or being hard to put on.</li>
            <li> Too bad Philips won&#x27;t resolve this known issue since the brushes are very pricey up to $200!</li>
            <li> No more twice a month going through the trouble of Ultrasonic cleaning and scrubbing with Bleach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The seal is very tight.  </li>
            <li> A real pain to do this, infact almost impossible</li>
            <li> Really protects our expensive Rechargeable Toothbrush from unnecessary cleaning and corrosion.</li>
            <li> My toothbrush no longer has that icky black grime growing inside where the parts screw together.</li>
            <li> They are very tight, so a little hard to put on, but again that&#x27;s the point.</li>
            <li> I will warn you the seal is a little rough to install without ripping the silicone material, but if your patient and careful &amp; take your time it&#x27;s really not too bad.  </li>
            <li> It is not entirely clear if the seal is intended to go down below the threaded joint between the bristlehead and the base; It just barely reaches there.</li>
            <li> This product is keeping our tooth brushes from getting slimy, they are a little bit hard to get used to</li>
            <li> A little hard to srew on because of the grip the sleeve has on the brush</li>
            <li> They are a little hard to put on</li>
            <li> A little hard to put on</li>
            <li> Little hard to put it onto the brush head.</li>
            <li> Me, I conditioned myself to take an extra 10 seconds to simply unscrew the head and rinse both it and the base before placing the head in the little holder that came with the set.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare toothbrush, but was disgusted by the tendency for mold to grow IN it!!</li>
            <li> To my disappointment, though, the colors were nowhere near what it looked like in this photo.</li>
            <li> They are just about impossible to put on is the main problem.</li>
            <li> As for the glow-in-the-dark feature.....I am not sure of the purpose for that.</li>
            <li> Voila, no more slime build-up.  </li>
            <li> Just get a bag of small colored rubberbands to mark each person&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Even so, worth it to get rid of the disgusting grey ooze.  </li>
            <li> Definitely wasted money for our family, hopefully I have prevented it from happening to yours!</li>
            <li> No more &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Received these just this past week.</li>
            <li> Now there is no more confusion when we&#x27;re rushing off in the morning.</li>
            <li> If they rip, or otherwise fail to work, I&#x27;ll log back in and let everyone know.</li>
            <li> This package of 3 should cost no more than $3.</li>
            <li> Difficult to remove head (for travel) and replace same.  </li>
            <li> With all the complaints in reviews, I took extra care and nudging it in place is not that difficult, except it takes some patience.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, it&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve been doing with ours for the past 10-15 years.</li>
            <li> Each member of my germ-a-phobic family has their own base so we don&#x27;t have to change the heads out daily and share one base.</li>
            <li> I did not apply excessive force.</li>
            <li> no more gunk.  </li>
            <li> No more gunk in my brush.</li>
            <li> These are terrific, but one tore as I was putting it on, which made me sad.  </li>
            <li> I reuse them a few times but give them a few hours soak in a weak bleach solution to sanitize them between uses.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really get it--how the little line at the base should go in the seam between the brush head and the body.  </li>
            <li> I was disgusted with the black gunk growing in the toothbrush, so I was excited to see a solution.</li>
            <li> They are thin, so be very careful putting them on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Sonicare toothbrush for over 5 years now and always hated having to remove the brush head to clean the gook out of the insides and the threads.  </li>
            <li> Hated the way I had to clean out the toothbrush heads every couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> And they&#x27;re not very good covers.</li>
            <li> iam not sure if I would buy again just because its hard to get on toothbrush</li>
            <li> No more icky mold.</li>
            <li> I sort of just carefully worked it down the neck of the toothbrush and GENTLY stretched it over the base.  </li>
            <li> Glowing in the dark is a little useless though ?</li>
            <li> they are hard to put on and ripped if you pull on them too hard.  </li>
            <li> Yes, they are hard to get on, but it seems to me that they need to be.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to get it screwed on</li>
            <li> Really hard to get these on the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Keeps all the gunk out of the toothbrush but its really hard to put on the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The seals are hard to put on, but they work well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to put on.</li>
            <li> You shouldn&#x27;t brush your teeth in the dark !!!</li>
            <li> of all, these glow in the dark!!!</li>
            <li> So, were stuck on cleaning out the toothbrush at least once a week.</li>
            <li> Now, since the narrow portion of the brush head doesn&#x27;t rotate when you attach the brush head assembly to the charger, the narrow portion of the cover gets twisted around the brush.</li>
            <li> this negative review cause</li>
            <li> I had noticed lately that his side of the toothbrush stand was a lot &#x27;gunkier&#x27;, but I just dismissed it...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve learned my lesson and will remember to keep these suckers on.  </li>
            <li> other commenters have mentioned, these covers will definitely be annoying to use if you share/swap heads daily, or even often.  </li>
            <li> I would always be grossed out knowing that I was brushing my teeth with the nasty gunk right behind the plastic head but never wanted to change brushes as the Sonicare gets my teeth cleaner than any other product I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Point being, I&#x27;ve been using the unit at a fraction of its effectiveness due to this silly product.  </li>
            <li> I agree with other reviews that the seal is difficult to get on</li>
            <li> No more problem!  </li>
            <li> No more yuk!</li>
            <li> (Just check the responses to the reviews, if you want to know what I mean.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d finally found a cure for the nasty stuff that&#x27;s been happening in my sonic are for the past ten years.</li>
            <li> No more!  </li>
            <li> But if you flip the seal up while pulling it over the bristles, pull it all the way to the base of the shaft, and then roll the body down over the base of the toothbrush head, it gets you most of the way there.  </li>
            <li> Last year my base started growing black mold inside.</li>
            <li> Putting one on is a bit tedious but just use a little baby powder,be patient/gentle,apply slowly until you get the sleeve over the crack that collects all the yuck.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but these things were next to impossible to put on.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous price for 3 pieces of silicon but</li>
            <li> Very thin material and totally not worth the price.</li>
            <li> These are a little tough to get on, but once they are on it is a DREAM!</li>
            <li> My only gripe has been the way the handle collects water and the disgusting black and green slime that forms inside the handle.  </li>
            <li> but I did a little rinse with alcohol inside before I put this sonic seal on, since the actual handle still had a little nasty in the crevices</li>
            <li> only gripe is the ugly colors.</li>
            <li> Not good.  </li>
            <li> It was somewhat difficult to put it on, required persistence and firm massaging to get it to cover the place where the handle and the brush head meet.</li>
            <li> They completely seal off the space between the brush head and the base.</li>
            <li> They are hard to screw on with the seal on, I just got them so we&#x27;ll see if they serve their purpose!</li>
            <li> It seals up the weak points of the toothbrush heads and prevents gunk from building up.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was disgusted to see what was lurking below the head when I went to clean it.</li>
            <li> they were very hard to use, had to throw them away.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve brushed with a Sonicare for years, and was always disgusted at the black goo that seeps out of the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This did what it said, but it is tough to get on.</li>
            <li> Tough to get on...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to a normal toothbrush after using a sonicare for years, but the fact is that sonicare heads are terribly designed and will turn disgusting inside no matter how careful you are about taking care of them.</li>
            <li> Also, if you travel and had to take apart head and base of unit, you would struggle to put the seal back on each time.</li>
            <li> we have 3 people using same base.</li>
            <li> Not happy that I purchased them on AMAZON!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You must remove it each time you screw on the brush, so for families where multiple people share a brush base, this is not a product for you.  </li>
            <li> Regardless, this purchase addresses a need that Sonicare&#x27;s poor design doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how much I was grossed out by my Sonicare E-Series toothbrush&#x27;s disgusting smell.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the sense that he would stand behind the product.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t difficult to put on, you just have to take your time and slowly work it into place.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems to get worse and worse over time, collecting mold faster and faster.</li>
            <li> I just changed my brush head after one year (!), and the inside of the base was pristine.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Ridiculous!</li>
            <li> The only complaint that I&#x27;ve ever had is how nasty the inside of the head gets from water getting in through the cracks.  </li>
            <li> After being horrified at the disgusting black gunk in my sonicare toothbrush, I found these little seals and figured they couldn&#x27;t make the problem any worse.</li>
            <li> These are very delicate items; and expensive for what you get.</li>
            <li> It has COMPLETELY solved the problem of the nasty mold and gunk that has plagued the inside of my Sonicare for years.</li>
            <li> One of us had stopped using her Sonicare toothbrush, having noticed some nasty black mold growing within the handle, and another was still using hers, but disgusted at having to clean it so often.</li>
            <li> I hated that losing battle against the black scum buildup inside Sonicare brushes.</li>
            <li> I would recommend that you roll the Sonic Seal before trying to slide down the base of the toothbrush head.  </li>
            <li> , I ripped one, couldn&#x27;t get it down all the way to the bottom of the base.  </li>
            <li> I randomly ran across this product and immediately decided to purchase it because I did dislike all the grossness that grows in the underside of the cap despite removing the cap after every use and rinsing it.</li>
            <li> While they were expensive, we decided to purchase them about a year ago.  </li>
            <li> Will be purchasing again if this one ever fails.</li>
            <li> They are rather difficult to place on the brush and to get into place, which is needed in order to provide the seal.</li>
            <li> It was shocking, actually, and uncomfortable...</li>
            <li> Yes, they were difficult to get on.</li>
            <li> Do I think they are a bit expensive?</li>
            <li> After getting fed up with how gross my Sonicare gets, I googled \\&quot;nasty sonicare,\\&quot; and discovered these.   </li>
            <li> The only bad part about the Sonicare toothbrush is cleaning out the inside, yuck!!  </li>
            <li> They are a bit difficult to get on.  </li>
            <li> Once I did get one on, it got even worse!</li>
            <li> *Sorry.  </li>
            <li> but it was too difficult to get on</li>
            <li> I found getting them over the brush head not all that difficult.</li>
            <li> If you purchase these after the fact, you have some tedious cleaning on your hands to get the brush spotless before you install these.</li>
            <li> Sonic Seals were difficult to put on the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This was the wrong move.</li>
            <li> Difficult to put on the toothbrush head and flimsy - ripped while trying to put it on</li>
            <li> Difficult to put on or take off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit difficult to put on and take off</li>
            <li> scary surprises).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found these covers before, but the price was RIDICULOUS!!</li>
            <li> This seals are crazy expensive for what they are but they do work and they keep the gunk out of the inside of the toothbrush head.</li>
            <li> I was sick and tired of soaking our two Sonicares in bleach periodically to remove the mold that forms in the inside.  </li>
            <li> No more ugly residue build-up!</li>
            <li> so I wont ever have to deal with a nasty mess in my sonicare handle again.</li>
            <li> I was sick of periodically cleaning disgusting black grunge out of my brush heads--very difficult to do because of their construction.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I remove brush and clean/dry attachment areas of it and &#x27;handle&#x27; after every use--not inconvenient to me.  </li>
            <li> No more nasty residue inside the handle.</li>
            <li> Yes, the seal is very difficult to get in place.</li>
            <li> The seals made it difficult to change heads and screw the brush head into the base.  </li>
            <li> Please note, it is very difficult to put on and take off.  </li>
            <li> however, it is very, very difficult to get on.</li>
            <li> These were impossible to get on.</li>
            <li> After unscrewing the cap yesterday, I was APPALLED at all of the smelly, nasty, black, gunky goo on the inside!  </li>
            <li> It takes a couple of minutes to put them on, but it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
            <li> The Philips brush head is simply a bad design that lets spittle and toothpaste seep into the interior of the device.</li>
            <li> I feel really bad.</li>
            <li> For this price, ripping is a bad situation.</li>
            <li> I was sick of the inside of my Sonicare Essence getting tons of bacteria on the inside of it from water leaking in.</li>
            <li> and I am sick of the water</li>
            <li> where they are cheaper! :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed in this</li>
            <li> My husband and I used to share a handle and it was annoying because he was messier than me.  </li>
            <li> I share the base with my husband and son.</li>
            <li> However, you&#x27;ll find that water and toothpaste finds it&#x27;s way into the gap at the base of the brush arm.</li>
            <li> My husband and I share one brush base and use two heads that we remove after each use.</li>
            <li> Totally annoying.  </li>
            <li> Also a bit annoying to put on.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is annoying that this product has to exist as an aftermarket item</li>
            <li> These keep water from collecting between the toothbrush head and base, which in  turn prevents mold from growing in that area.</li>
            <li> They do the job keeping water out of the base area.</li>
            <li> Why doesn&#x27;t Sonicare create something like this to keep the crap out of your tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li> I hate cleaning the brush heads, so this is a must-have for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned my Sonicare Elite toothbrush for years and hated the gunk that built up between the head and body.</li>
            <li> Sonicare should have these as part of the purchase of the toothbrush as they keep the nasty grungy stuff from getting into the toothbrush base.  </li>
            <li> I have hated my Sonicare E-series toothbrush because it leaks around the opening where the brush comes through, causing me to require taking it apart and cleaning it out each time I used it.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how much I hated taking apart my toothbrush and scrubbing it with soap</li>
            <li> I hated how yucky our Sonic toothbrushes would get.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> This virtually eliminated the disgusting, gunky, build-up on the inside of my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> But the bottom line is that there is NOTHING on the market that comes even close to this product when it comes to eliminating that DISGUSTING sludge on your toothbrush.</li>
            <li> However, once the seal was on, the head would no longer twist onto the motor base!  </li>
            <li> It looked nasty and smelled.</li>
            <li> And the quality is too bad!!</li>
            <li> Prevents the seeping of water into the brush head that causes the awful mold growing inside.  </li>
            <li> Hate when the inside of the toothbrush has alll the moldy gunk!  </li>
            <li> Terrible attitude,</li>
            <li> I almost gagged, it was so disgusting.  </li>
            <li> But if I didn&#x27;t it got smelly with disgusting slime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This makes things worst than advertised.</li>
            <li> This purchase was for a family member who also was disgusted by the nastiness of the handles.  </li>
            <li> I had noticed an awful odor before then and was getting sore throats.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It solved the mold problem of my brush. Glowing in the dark is a little useless though ? You shouldn&#x27;t brush your teeth in the dark !!!</li>
            <li> The idea is great because my last sonicare burned out from it getting damp all the time.  I feel like this will protect that from happening. It offers a nice tight fit around anywhere moisture could get into the sonicare.</li>
            <li> Ok so I tried the glove finger thing and it works ok. Instead of cleaning my toothbrush every 2 days, I clean every 10 days AND replace another finger. It was more of a hassle than a solution for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I broke down and spent the $17. I&#x27;ve had it for a week and it is AIR TIGHT. There are grooves that the seal contours into providing a much better seal than any thin latex can. These are very soft and much thicker/durable than latex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no regrets! Saving the extra 10 minutes fiddling with the DIY every other week is well worth $17. I feel the cost of the brush heads are much more overpriced than these. I just wished I thought of it first!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might have rated these 4 stars if I didn&#x27;t try the glove finger alternative. But now that I&#x27;ve done both, I am grateful for the complete functionality of these seals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also appreciate the DIY idea. I will always try to fix something on my own first; and I try my best to end with quality results. I would take time to use wood screws instead of nails, deburr sharp edges, etc. That being said, I still prefer to use these with peace of mind vs the latex.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t even put the product on my Sonicare - it tears apart.  Do not order this product.  With it worked, good idea in theory</li>
            <li> These sleeves were not too durable.  As soon as I tried to put the first one on, it ripped.  The second one also ripped as I was trying to put it on.  The third one went on with no problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years, and it works very well. It is not difficult to put on, and if you roll it like a condom, it is actually easy. If you want to chage heads, simply roll it up to the top of the shoulder of the brush, and then roll it back down when reinstalling it on the handle. I highly recommend, although I wish they would just make plain white ones.</li>
            <li> My toothbrush, since I am the on;y one using it, was getting gross and mildewy from water seeping in between the head and the handle.  These cheap covers solve that problem.</li>
            <li> I have a sonic toothbrush and cannot believe I didn&#x27;t know about this product sooner!  Whoever dreamed this up is a genious!!  I could not stand the thought of that yucky bacteria possibly getting in my mouth now.</li>
            <li> it took a few mins to get on toothbrushes but they are nice and it help kids keep handle clean ...iam not sure if I would buy again just because its hard to get on toothbrush</li>
            <li> They help identify Sonicaire toothbrushes which is helpful if your bathroom has more than one.  Plus, they actually keep out the \\&quot;plaque-gouk\\&quot; from seeping down into the toothbrush.  If you don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m talking about and you have had the sonicaire for 6+ years, that means you never replaced the brush.  DO NOT UNSCREW and OPEN because you&#x27;ll gross yourself out.  Maybe incinerate the toothbrush.  and get a new clean tooth brush.  You&#x27;re gross.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare toothbrush, but was disgusted by the tendency for mold to grow IN it!! This effectively solves the problem. They are not easy to put on, but they work.</li>
            <li> I randomly ran across this product and immediately decided to purchase it because I did dislike all the grossness that grows in the underside of the cap despite removing the cap after every use and rinsing it. The product is difficult to get in place, but once there, it is secure and seems to keep the cap sealed off from all liquid.  I would have preferred that the product could be ordered singly, but I suppose I have spares for when the cover wears out and needs replacing :)</li>
            <li> If you have one of the sonic care systems and are using different brushes for each member of your family, do not use this item.  When you change the brush head with this on it, the seal doesn&#x27;t turn with the brush head.  We ended up having to pull it up, attach the brush, and then pull it back down.  A complete waste of money and a huge source of frustration.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been using Sonicare toothbrushes for the last 7 years.  We replaced our brush heads every 6 months or so, and would always be subject to a large amount of black mold when taking the head off.  Yes, I know we should be cleaning the brushes regularly, but we were lazy about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I googled the black mold issue and learned about these Sonic Seals.  While they were expensive, we decided to purchase them about a year ago.  I am happy to say they work as advertised.  When we replace our heads now, we see absolutely no mold.  The Sonic Seal covers the opening and prevents water from going into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seal was slightly difficult to put on the first time.  But once you get the hang of it, it becomes very easy for future times.  As long as you are careful, the seal will not rip and you can keep re-using it.  A nice bonus about the bright colors is that my wife and I no longer get our toothbrushes mixed up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are trying to fix the black mold issue, look no further than these seals.  They are not cheap but are worth it.</li>
            <li> Especially after reading these reviews this looks like a waste of money.    After my Sonic toothbrush started smelling skanky, I replaced the head, then after using it in the miorning I disassemble it and let it dry -- no more mold.</li>
            <li> Must have with the E Series!</li>
            <li> Product works as described and makes cleaning Sonic head easy / non- existent.  Will be purchasing again if this one ever fails.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s brush gets incredibly funky because of how she rinses it when finished. Me, I conditioned myself to take an extra 10 seconds to simply unscrew the head and rinse both it and the base before placing the head in the little holder that came with the set. It stays clean and gets bone dry. She won&#x27;t do that, so I thought I&#x27;d give these a try. They are rather difficult to place on the brush and to get into place, which is needed in order to provide the seal. We&#x27;ll see how well it works, but I certainly do not look forward to swapping the brush in three months. I would not have purchased if I knew this then, especially for the price. Now if you never disassemble your brush, use the heads for a year or so before changing, and are willing to take the time to get the seal positioned correctly, you may find this very helpful and the price worth it.    Edit: 2009/10/01 - As an update, the seals are working at keeping water out as they are designed to do. I have to occasionally reseat the little lip that is supposed to fit into the groove between the brush head and the base. It will be time to replace the heads soon, so we&#x27;ll find out how the switch process goes when they arrive on Subscribe N Save.</li>
            <li> I just checked inside my Sonicare after using this for a month and it is bone dry in there and no signs of mold.  On this unit - the last head got super nasty with black mold (like the horror stories you read).  That is what compelled me to try the sonic seal for E-series.  All I can say is WOW - this thing really works! I think it actually looks better in there than before I put it on - but I did a little rinse with alcohol inside before I put this sonic seal on, since the actual handle still had a little nasty in the crevices so maybe that helped - but WOW this thing is amazing.</li>
            <li> My kids and I have been using the Sonic Seal for over a year now, through 2 brush head changes. It&#x27;s truly remarkable to finally remove the cover and find absolutely NO presence of mold or any of the brown gunk that otherwise seeps into the nooks and crannies of the original brush handle and head.    The material is quite strong, and can withstand being stretched a lot without tearing....unless you happen to gouge it by mistake with your fingernails, or if you use tweezers or other tools to put it on. If you do, it will fall apart at that spot as is to be expected.    I tore my first cover that way, until I figured out how to put it on correctly. Quite simply, follow the instructions on their website, but at the last step you can pull the cover lower by squeezing it between your thumb and fingers and coaxing it down a few times.</li>
            <li> They do rip if you are not careful. I haven&#x27;t ripped one but I could see it happening. I&#x27;ve had the same one for over a year and three brush head changes. What I do is spray a little isopropyl alcohol inside the cover and then slide it on the brush.  I keep some iso in a spray bottle and use it for cleaning various stuff around the house. These are overpriced but I&#x27;d have no problem buying another set when needed. Its so nice not having the nastyness build up in the brush.</li>
            <li> OK I&#x27;m a color-monster (for lack of the ability to post a stronger word), and thought these colors were the coolest! Loved the retro pink and pretty blue. To my disappointment, though, the colors were nowhere near what it looked like in this photo. Although it serves its purpose (of keeping water out of the place where the top and bottom pieces of the Sonicare are connected), the rubber is very thin. It shouldn&#x27;t tear for a long while, though, as they&#x27;re fitted pretty tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still though... the colors. SIGH. What a disappointment. Would I have bought them if I knew what they really looked like? Probably not. And especially not at over $10.</li>
            <li> This is a great little product!  It prevents all that gunk from getting inside the toothbrush.  It&#x27;s not easily removed so you need to have your own handle and brush.  My husband and I used to share a handle and it was annoying because he was messier than me.  Now we each have our own handle and I am so happy with this.  Sonic Seal really keeps your toothbrush handle clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the same sonicare for almost a decade now but just recently found this product. It took about 5 full minutes to put this seal on my sonicare replacement head, but it didn&#x27;t rip or get damaged. This is a real necessity because the toothbrush head lets liquid get inside but this product completely seals this opening. I&#x27;ll continue using this product in the future. Also, these are re-useable when you switch your toothbrush head.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a great product, but I guess I didn&#x27;t think it through.  I placed the seals on 2 replacement heads for my husband and me.  Hmmm, now how to screw brush head onto unit?  Doesn&#x27;t work and I would have liked to have known that before purchasing.  Still, a good idea for one brush head that does not get removed from base unit.</li>
            <li> I was a bit afraid after reading some reviews here, but I am very pleased with the product, it keeps the toothbrush gunk-free. and if you put a bit of cornstarch in it before sliding it, it will be easy as a breeze..</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my two kids and myself hoping to put an end to the&lt;br /&gt;problem with the yucky black stuff that accumulates inside all three of our Sonicare tooth brushes. They are just about impossible to put on is the main problem. It would be one thing if you were putting them on and leaving them on forever, but you will need to remove and replace when you change your brush every 3 months. A real pain to do this, infact almost impossible so this isn&#x27;t very useful in my house, in other words I will not recommend or be able to use what I spent my money on. Nice try though, I will say they LOOK good, but that&#x27;s all. Do we know of anything else to keep the yucky black stuff away??? If someone has any feedback please feel very free to email me with the information. Thanks anyway. Also, I was wondering if other people are put off from the yucky blackstuff inside the Sonicare tooth brush?? I love my Sonicare and use it daily I just have to spend extra time cleaning the inside almost everyday to prevent the yucky black stuff from making a comeback. It seems strange that this hasn&#x27;t been solved or has it??</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy them.  they are hard to put on and ripped if you pull on them too hard.  I ripped one on first try.  Also, if you travel and had to take apart head and base of unit, you would struggle to put the seal back on each time. Didn&#x27;t realize that these seals are not manufactured by sonic care when bought them.  Had I known this, I wouldn&#x27;t purchased them.  Also, they are not cheap.</li>
            <li> At first glance, I thought this was priced a little too high... $14 for a 3-pack of plastic covers?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after taking the plunge, I will never go back to putting mold an inch away from my mouth everyday.  I&#x27;ve brushed with a Sonicare for years, and was always disgusted at the black goo that seeps out of the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other commenters have mentioned, these covers will definitely be annoying to use if you share/swap heads daily, or even often.  Took me about 5 minutes to get it on.  But I bought a Sonicare two-pack at a certain Seattle-based big box mart, and now my wife and I can brush mold-free.  LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re going to spend the extra money on the Sonicare, do yourself a favor and buy these as well.</li>
            <li> I really liked the idea of having these colorful seals for two reasons; 1) it would prevent filtration of toothpaste and water into the Sonicare toothbrush and 2) the colorful seals would make it easy to identify among family members. My biggest disappointment is that you can&#x27;t leave it on permanently unless you have more than toothbrush.  If you share with others, taking it on and off requires to remove the seal and that&#x27;s a big hassle.  We opted not to use it.  So, were stuck on cleaning out the toothbrush at least once a week.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these! Of course I just got them so they have not been used for the full 3 months yet, but what a fantastic idea! Once I replace the brush head (3 months), I will change my rating to 5 stars I&#x27;m sure! Anyone that has the SoniCare electric toothbrushes knows why! The tooth brushes get really messy if you don&#x27;t wash them out every day....it&#x27;s GROSS! But with these silicon protectors, no liquid can get inside! Just make sure to pull them down below where the toothbrush unscrews! It takes a couple of minutes to put them on, but it&#x27;s not that bad. I can&#x27;t wait to see how well they work! Great idea!&lt;br /&gt;Thx!</li>
            <li> Just received these sonic seals. First one I applied to the unit seemed really  tedious to get on. Maybe I&#x27;ll use powder or cornstarch next time to make it easier. Can certainly see why some reviewers are saying it ripped during the process. Tried another reviewers suggestions using the fingers of a latex glove. Although it was a good idea. Didn&#x27;t feel this worked that well. You have to get a tight seal in order to keep the yuck from getting in the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI I do think hydrogen peroxide cleans better than alcohol/H20&amp;soap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3-5-15 Updated review these sleeves are great,well worth the money. You can continue to use the same one repeatedly. Putting one on is a bit tedious but just use a little baby powder,be patient/gentle,apply slowly until you get the sleeve over the crack that collects all the yuck.</li>
            <li> super easy to put on..works perfect. love the different colors too-makes it easy to keep the hubs and mine seperated! also paid the extra for one day shipping...ordered the 19th and it was here the 20th! couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> This virtually eliminated the disgusting, gunky, build-up on the inside of my toothbrush. I was getting so frustrated with trying to keep the inside of my toothbrush clean and dry--these seals were just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I had no problem slipping this on over the damp brush head. I put it on my brand new sonicare and it has worked perfectly. Not a single spore! It is also easy to clean. It has maintained its flexibility, although I haven&#x27;t yet changed the brush head to see if it will hold up to the wear and tear.</li>
            <li> Great idea but useless if more than one person uses the brush handle.  Can&#x27;t change brush heads with covers on!</li>
            <li> I strongly advise against using this product. Why? I&#x27;ve been using a seal on my sonicare since I&#x27;ve had it. In fact, I never used it without. Then I wondered if the seal might dampen the vibrations of the unit. So I took it off, and I couldn&#x27;t believe how strong the vibrations were. It was shocking, actually, and uncomfortable...which the sonicare instructions say I&#x27;ll get used to. Point being, I&#x27;ve been using the unit at a fraction of its effectiveness due to this silly product.  The sonicare works via its vibrating motion. The seal deadens it dramatically. If you&#x27;ve wasted your money on the seals already, try removing it, and you&#x27;ll see. I&#x27;m glad I figured it out before I went on for who knows how many years of ineffective teeth cleaning.  If you&#x27;re worried about gunk buildup, learn to brush with your lips closed around the post of the unit. Not hard.  What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Used these on my old Sonicare. They were strong, sturdy and a single pack lasted over a year tearing even with reuse. Only one of mine ever tore.</li>
            <li> I have used a Sonicare brush for many years. Recently I ordered new replacement. When ordering I noticed another product called \\&quot;sonic seals for E-Series Sonicare toothbrushes\\&quot;. The problem was that the joints between the brush and the body of the device leaked saliva and toothpaste and water into the cavity where the movement is magnetically generated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These soft silicone seals go over the two areas of leakage and look as though they will not allow leakage. Time will tell but I would advise getting the seals for your brushes, old or new. They fit very snug and I found very difficult to apply, but with my wife&#x27;s help we made it. One hint is to roll down the neck of the seal to get it over the bristles. From then on it&#x27;s a tugging job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are sold in packs of three on Amazon in white, pink and blue. They glow in the dark, I don&#x27;t know why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I noticed another review which suggested a light dusting of corn starch inside the cover to facilitate slipping on the device. I&#x27;ll try this next time but sounds like a stellar suggestion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to have found this little device, and I feel so much better about using this toothbrush now.  Some people have suggested, though, the use of cornstarch to assist in sliding the seal in place. And although it&#x27;s true that this works wonderfully, there is a down side. After getting the seal in the correct spot, there&#x27;s no way to remove the cornstarch trapped under. Even if all the excess was wiped off before placement, the use of the cornstarch itself removes the \\&quot;stickiness\\&quot; of the silicone. And the stickiness is necessary to keep the seal in place. After I first tried this with cornstarch, I actually couldn&#x27;t get the bottom of the seal to stay below the bottom of the replaceable head -- I would pull it down, and it kept rising up -- which left the entire bottom exposed to moisture entry. This defeats the whole purpose of the product.  Yes, the seal is very difficult to get in place. But it is doable. And without the use of cornstarch, once the seal is positioned correctly, it won&#x27;t budge. Great product!</li>
            <li> I bought these even though I read many reviews saying they were a waste of money.  I will say that they will take you some time putting them on your sonicare toothbrush.  Many past reviewers stated that theirs tore while they were trying to put them on.  I took my time and was fine.  They definitely keep water and spit from getting into your unit and getting all gross.  The fact that they glow in the dark is kind of fun too :o)</li>
            <li> It would have been helpful to know the Sonic Seal is intended only for Sonicare users who don&#x27;t need to remove the brush head on a daily basis.      I share the Sonicare with my wife (the handle, not the brushes.  That would be gross).  However, once you put the Sonic Seal over the brush head, you have to remove the seal in order to remove the brush head.  As other reviews have mentioned, it&#x27;s a pain to put the thing on. If you only had to do it once, no big deal.  But it&#x27;s just not realistic to spend 10 minutes removing and replacing the seal every time a different user needs to use the handle.    I have no judgment on the product&#x27;s ability to keep moisture out of the Sonicare handle.  After realizing the Sonic Seal is not intended for multiple users of the same handle, I tossed the product (and $14) in the trash.    If the product description or the manufacturer&#x27;s website noted this significant limitation, I would not have purchased it and it would have received one less 1-star review.</li>
            <li> Purchased the seals in a package (recommended by Amazon) with the Sonicare and two additional heads. I share the base with my husband and son. I thought that having the different colors would prevent us from using each others brushes (yuck). The seals made it difficult to change heads and screw the brush head into the base.  I also tore one when putting it on. After having purchased the Sonicare because of recommendations from my dentist, I did not want to risk my 15 year old skipping brushing his teeth because it is to much of a chore, so I took them off.  I guess I waisted $16.99.  Lesson learned!</li>
            <li> We love our Philips Sonicare tooth brushes. However, you&#x27;ll find that water and toothpaste finds it&#x27;s way into the gap at the base of the brush arm. Philips left a narrow space there to allow the brush arm to vibrate.  This rubber accessory solves that problem nicely. The only challenge is sliding it over the brush head. Just be careful and you can do it without a problem.  Yes, the are a bit pricey but if you remove your brush head and look inside you&#x27;ll gladly pay the price to prevent that gooey mess.</li>
            <li> These seals are better used if you are not sharing a Sonic Care unit. They are hard to screw on with the seal on, I just got them so we&#x27;ll see if they serve their purpose!</li>
            <li> I have an older model Sonicare toothbrush and never had a mold problem until I replaced it with the newer style head. It didn&#x27;t have a tight seal like the older model. Needless to say, I was disgusted to see what was lurking below the head when I went to clean it. There was mold and god only knows what else. Happened upon these and was willing to try anything. First off, let me start by saying I purchased these directly from Sonic Seal (may not seem fair to Amazon sellers, but it was way cheaper). This was a pain in the arse to get on, there&#x27;s no denying that. I did use some powder, but it didn&#x27;t seem to help all that much. There&#x27;s a short installation video on Sonic Seal&#x27;s website, which I watched repeatedly, but to no avail. I just wiggled, jiggled, stretched and pulled until I finally got it into position. I was concerned about it ripping, but it was unscathed. I have had this on for over 2 months and did notice (as someone else had mentioned) that it had shifted slightly and was no longer seated exactly into the groove of the brush. At that point I decided to roll it up and check underneath and all was well. No skankiness! I was on the fence about giving this 5 stars, due to the difficulty in getting it on, but I figured since it does prevent an otherwise hopeless problem, then it deserves 5!</li>
            <li> We bought these at the same time we purchased our Sonicare 5300 set with 2 handles. My husband and I each wanted our own toothbrush, and didn&#x27;t want to have to swap out heads. I have read a review on here that says you can&#x27;t use these when switching heads (sharing), and that is true. Once you put on the Sonic Seal, it&#x27;s meant to stay on until you change your head for a new one.    Yes, they were difficult to get on. But there&#x27;s a reason for that, they are tight so they can \\&quot;seal\\&quot;. Yes, I can see where they could rip, but ours didn&#x27;t, I was very very careful after reading the review that said he ripped his. I put the blue one on my husbands toothbrush, and the pink one on mine. My hands were actually sore afterwards from getting those things on!! We have been using them for 3+ weeks, and the brushes seem clean and \\&quot;sealed\\&quot;. And I acutally like the color it adds. As for the glow-in-the-dark feature.....I am not sure of the purpose for that. But yes, they do glow in the dark.    I am very happy with our purchase.....and I would not have bought the Sonicare 5300 without getting the Sonic Seals. Otherwise I would have gotten the Sonicare Whitening as it&#x27;s head and body are designed different and don&#x27;t collect the gross gunk that these can. But this model is cheaper and still does an awesome job. Also, if you need help or guidance, you can always visit the Sonic Seal website. They have a video showing how to get them on. They also have the grossest pics I have ever seen of what these toothbrushes can look like without the Sonic Seal or regular cleaning of the brush.</li>
            <li> The only downsisde to these is probably the price BUT I have used the same one since March 10,2011 and recently took apart my Sonicare for inspection. I was amazed! Perfectly dry and clean \\&quot;guts\\&quot; of my toothbrush. No more twice a month going through the trouble of Ultrasonic cleaning and scrubbing with Bleach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are great and the three of them will probably outlast my toothbrush! One star missing just for the high price. Actually they are quite worth the price if you are concerned at all about germs and fungus growing inside your toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My husband and I share one brush base and use two heads that we remove after each use. I thought this would be a great way to not only help keep them clean, but to tell them apart from each other. What the description doesn&#x27;t tell you is that when you have these on, you cannot remove the brush heads.</li>
            <li> Great idea in theory!  Purchased to keep our expensive brushes clean... goes on super easy (if you follow the instructions).  However, it holds the brush so tight it does not vibrate right.  Basically muffles so much vibration it defeats the point of the brush. Better off using a manual brush if you want to use these.  Very disapointed in them, waste of money!</li>
            <li> The Sonic Seals works great.  They perform exactly as described.  I checked my sonic toothbrush connection between the battery and the head after about a month and it was perfectly dry!  Which was awesome because it did get nasty in there.  I would recommend that you roll the Sonic Seal before trying to slide down the base of the toothbrush head.  Don&#x27;t get in a hurry, take you time and be patient.  I have only used one of them in six months.  I have removed, cleaned it (the Sonic Seal only) and reinstalled it several times.  Note:  I have only cleaned it for my benefit.  It has shown no signs of becoming dirty or icky.</li>
            <li> great little invention..keeps moisture out leaving dry and rust free...only issue is that the first time I tried to slide on toothbrush the seal ripped (thank goodness you get 3 in a pack)...be very careful putting on and don&#x27;t stretch too much at first....a little expensive but does the trick :)</li>
            <li> The first time I took my toothbrush head off and saw the gunk inside it grossed me out, so I was so glad to discover the sonic seals on Amazon. I took another reviewers advice and sprinkled just a little corn starch inside the sonic seal and tapped out the excess.  It slipped right on very easy.  I only needed one of the seals so I gave one to my son to put on his Sonicare toothbrush and he likes it too.  It makes keeping your toothbrush handle so much cleaner.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother buying these if you are planning on sharing a handle. The seal covers the brush head nut and doesn&#x27;t allow it to spin freely. It fits way too tightly to put on and take off each time - and that would defeat the intended purpose anyhow.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these! I was just about done with my sonicare, just was too grossed out by all the sludge that would accumulate on it. My sister got these and told me about them and I had to try for myself. They are AWESOME. Yes, they are hard to get on, but it seems to me that they need to be. I have used three and not had a rip yet, so I can&#x27;t speak to that. They are TIGHT, which makes them effective, so you should be aware of that. But the bottom line is that there is NOTHING on the market that comes even close to this product when it comes to eliminating that DISGUSTING sludge on your toothbrush. Do I think they are a bit expensive? Yes, but I&#x27;m still buying them anyway because I just cant and wont go back to that sludge again!!!</li>
            <li> This did what it said, but it is tough to get on. Should be a better description of how to do.</li>
            <li> After purchasing my first electric toothbrush, I saw the reviews about cleaning issues the brush had. So I decided to get these as well and they are worth the investment! It has definitely helped keep the \\&quot;ick\\&quot; areas that others have complained about clean. They are a little hard to get on at first, but I suspect that&#x27;s why it can keep a good seal and keep the water and toothpaste out of the working parts. I imagine they will last a really long time, so I have two back ups for a really, really long time since they come in a 3 pack. Bonus, it glows in the dark!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****update Feb2013*****Having ordered these, what? more than 2 years ago? I am still on my first seal, the pink and blue one are still brand new in the package. No ripping, no tearing, and looks just as good as the first time I put it on my Sonicare! Love it! The inside workings of my toothbrush? Still clean as a whistle!</li>
            <li> This product is keeping our tooth brushes from getting slimy, they are a little bit hard to get used to but they keep water and paste from getting into the mechanism and gettting slimy. A little hard to srew on because of the grip the sleeve has on the brush stem but it&#x27;s manageable.</li>
            <li> We recently ordered new Sonicare tooth brushes and the sonic seal popped up as one of those things that other people bought at the same time.  so I decided to give these things a try.  They work great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One problem with the sonicare design is that the constant dribble of water back down the brush head can enter the space at the top of the handle.  This is not going to damage the brush but can result in a rather nasty pile of goo accumulating in the top of the handle and its hard to clean out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sonic seals solve the problem by sealing the cracks in the head attachment mechanism where water can get in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem with them is that they prevent the easy removal of the brush head if you travel a lot.  It is necessary to pull the sonic seal completely up and over the brush itself so that screw on part of the head is free to rotate.  Getting the seal back in place is not easy.  This would not be a problem for people who never disassemble the sonicare for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple ways this could be fixed.  If sonicare or the sonic seal people would provide a case that does not require disassembly of the sonicare for travel the tight seal would not be an issue.  Making the seal easer to get on and off would also work but might compromise the seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good product and once I figure out how many brush heads it can be used on, before it wears out, Ill buy more so I wont ever have to deal with a nasty mess in my sonicare handle again.</li>
            <li> Because we each have our own handle they work awesome! They are a little hard to put on but I am so glad I don&#x27;t have to live with that awful build up and stink!</li>
            <li> I fought with first one and then had an idea. Use a little bit of baby powder on the inside and out, before you try to put it on.  Works like a charm!  Just got them, haven&#x27;t had a chance to see if they work but thought I&#x27;d let people know, they are easy to get on.  For the person who chucked theirs because of the multi user handle.. there&#x27;s no reason for that. You can still unscrew the brush and share..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for several months now. I&#x27;ll admit that it was extremely difficult to put on the first time. It took forever, and my fingers felt like they had just run a marathon. It was entirely worth it, though, because I no longer had to worry about brush handle gunk. I just replaced my brush head and put on a new seal. It was much, much easier than last time and only took a couple of minutes. Totally worth it for me.</li>
            <li> The product works well and a must-have for any sonic user. And the glow in the dark colors are a cute idea.</li>
            <li> The purpose of the seal may be good but if you have arthritis, forget it!  When&lt;br /&gt;the kids visit, maybe they can get it on the brush.</li>
            <li> These undoubtedly work, but they are expensive, so I tried making my own, as follows.  (1) Take a latex glove and cut off one of the fingers. (2) Cut off a very tiny section at the end of the detached fingertip (the resulting small hole will stretch temporarily in the next step). (3) Slip the glove finger down over the brush head, leaving the tip end above the top gasket of the brush head, and pulling the rest of the latex down to where the brush head joins the handle. Voila, no more slime build-up.  (Keep the glove on hand in case you have to make more protectors later on.)    It&#x27;s absurd that a special product should be needed to correct what&#x27;s obviously a design flaw in the Sonicare Essence line.  Sonicare should be providing the fix!</li>
            <li> I was sick of periodically cleaning disgusting black grunge out of my brush heads--very difficult to do because of their construction. The Philips brush head is simply a bad design that lets spittle and toothpaste seep into the interior of the device. This product solves the problem completely. I wish I had known about it years ago!</li>
            <li> After getting fed up with how gross my Sonicare gets, I googled \\&quot;nasty sonicare,\\&quot; and discovered these.   I bought the 3 pack directly from the manufacturer&#x27;s website which saved me a couple bucks. I stuck one on my tooth brush, and gave one to each of my parents. I made a point to watch the video on the sonic seal website to see the proper way to fit the seal over your toothbrush, and had no problems.   My mom was just telling me the other day how much she loves her sonic seal, and how much better it makes her feel about her toothbrush, cleanliness, etc. The inside of my toothbrush has been bone dry since July. Really a fantastic product. If you&#x27;re considering buying this, do yourself a favor and go for it.</li>
            <li> I understand the concept of this product, but it did not work out for me. My husband and I share the toothbrush handle, just switch heads on it. While you have the seal on it, it is pretty much impossible to screw and unscrew the head onto the toothbrush handle. If you always leave the head on the handle I suppose it would work, it just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine now for over a year and all is clean and dry inside my toothbrush. Tough to get on...but well worth it. No more mess. To clean...just run toothbrush under water. I love it! So easy!</li>
            <li> This seal work great at keeping the moisture out of brush innards - once you manage to get it on.  I honestly thought the seal would reduce the sound level, but to my surprise, it make it even louder.  Additionally, if you pack you Sonicare for travel don&#x27;t use this seal;</li>
            <li> I purchased two electric toothbrushes and had read reviews of people complaining that crud and stuff would build up inside the head of the toothbrush from run off when you are using it. I purchased the seals for it and they work great! It really protects the toothbrush. However, I am upset that they sell this in a quantity of three only. I have two electric toothbrushes and would have liked to have ordered an even four, but I suppose this is a marketing scheme to get you to buy a second order of them.</li>
            <li> Why didn&#x27;t Sonicare figure out that this was needed?  The only bad part about the Sonicare toothbrush is cleaning out the inside, yuck!!  This provides a seal so that no water gets inside.</li>
            <li> These are great.  When I had my first sonic toothbrush, I was cleaning the inside of my toothbrush every third day or so.  I use these and no cleaning.  I change it every few months when I dump my toothbrush head.  Seals out moisture and other crud.</li>
            <li> A waste of money and difficult to use and clean around too. Just get a bag of small colored rubberbands to mark each person&#x27;s. Quick, easy and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> The cover keeps the Sonicare toothbrush totally dry in the little spots where mildew and mold like to grow. Up until now I was the guys with the gross Sonicare. My wife used to bug me to clean it all the time. I love the cover idea because all you have to do it rinse off the toothbrush each time after use and it stays clean. The way a toothbrush should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is the ugly colors. I get it these colors are great for your kids, but a clear or whote one for adults would be ideal.</li>
            <li> WOW!! This product is perfect.  My wife and I both have the sonicare toothbrush and were amazed at how well the sonic seal does exactly what it advertises.  Our toothbrushes remain dry and CLEAN!!  I highly recommend this for every sonicare toothbrush owner, you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re missing!  You will love it, I promise!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my kids. They seem to restrict the brushes. It is easier and cheaper to just mark the brushes with a Sharpie.</li>
            <li> These seals work well to keep the water out of the toothbrush head.  I use my Sonicare in the shower so it was a problem with water getting in and grey gunk growing.  I use to have to take the head off everyday and leave it to dry on the counter.  These seals seem to do a pretty good job at keeping the water out - its only been a few weeks but I haven&#x27;t seen any grey gunk developing since I started using them.  They are a bit difficult to get on.  But if you flip the seal up while pulling it over the bristles, pull it all the way to the base of the shaft, and then roll the body down over the base of the toothbrush head, it gets you most of the way there.  Then you can smooth it down the rest of the way by rubbing/pushing your finger over the silicon in the direction you want it to go.  Grabbing it to pull and stretch will definitely tear the seal, so you have to be patient.  It is not entirely clear if the seal is intended to go down below the threaded joint between the bristlehead and the base; It just barely reaches there. I pulled it down over that joint but it would be nice if the seal was a 1/4\\&quot; longer because the material clearly starts thinning out when you stretch it that far.  Overall, it works well; I noticed no effect on the operation of the toothbrush.  My only \\&quot;complaint\\&quot; is that they seem pretty expensive for what clearly did not cost much to produce.  Even so, worth it to get rid of the disgusting grey ooze.  2/10/12 Update --  Been a couple of months now and still working great.  No grey slime and seals working perfectly.</li>
            <li> Sure does keep the insides from gunking up.  Recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These things are cheap and ripped when I tried to put them on my SonicCare toothbrush.  Not worth the $.  HOWEVER, the one I did get on helped keep the mildew from forming inside the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> If Sonicare sees the need for this product why aren&#x27;t they included with your toothbrush purchase?  I\\&quot;m tired of having to buy more parts just to make a product work the way it should in the first place. They couldn&#x27;t figure out that water might be able to get inside?  Sonicare and Pur are all the same company aren&#x27;t they?  Pur water filter systems always develop problems too.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re in the habit of handling things very heavily, then you&#x27;ll want to be extra careful. We&#x27;ve been using the same ones for a tad over two years now so that means about a dozen head replacements each on two toothbrushes. Never had a tear. Just apply a little baby powder when you put it on the first time and you&#x27;ll never have a problem. And more every six or so applications and it stays trouble free</li>
            <li> The idea is great but the execution is poor.I had one totally fall apart in my hands before I even got it on! Once I did get one on, it got even worse! They constrict the brush so it makes so much noise while you brush your teeth!! After dealing with the noise for 2 days I took mine off. I&#x27;d rather make sure I wash and dry out the inside of the brush then listen to the horrid noise these things create.</li>
            <li> This is a great idea, and a product that works well.  Don&#x27;t know why Sonic doesn&#x27;t just include this with their toothburshes.  It does make it a bit more difficult to unscrew the head to pop in in the UV sanitizer, but still well worth it!  I love this item!</li>
            <li> How are you supposed to possibly install without destroying bristles?  I did not want to chance my expensive Sonicare head bristles by forcing this seal over them, it wants to pull them all off and I did not want to destroy the toothbrush head.  So I am not using this item at all.</li>
            <li> I was disgusted with the black gunk growing in the toothbrush, so I was excited to see a solution. Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but these things were next to impossible to put on. For the price, really not worth it.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought it was user error, then I realized this product just does not fit on the head without bending the laws of physics and nearly breaking the replaceable head. Save yourself some time, frustration and money and mark the head otherwise.</li>
            <li> It prevents water from getting into the seal between the Sonicare head and body. It was a little tricky to put on but took no more than a few minutes per toothbrush. Didn&#x27;t have a problem with it breaking. $16.99 is a lot of money for these things but I haven&#x27;t seen any alternatives. I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and think it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> love this because it keeps the water out of the sonic care casing which is moldy and gross. Was having to clean with alcohol and tips before. The only down size is it not being very easy to put on and o have torn one before in process.  Make sure plastic cap is off of toothbrush head and take care not to over stretch cover</li>
            <li> Flimsy - tore when putting on. Come with no instructions. Too expensive since you will be lucky to get one of the three on.</li>
            <li> This product works really well! I was constantly cleaning my Sonic Tooth brush because water would get into it from under the screw on cap.  This product took care of the problem.</li>
            <li> Keeps the water from getting into the grooves on our toothbrushes. It&#x27;s also nice because it helps my husband and I tell our toothbrushes apart.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare toothbrushes for 15 years now.  One of the necessary evils of using this toothbrush was cleaning it regularly.  Formerly, I would designate a night when I&#x27;d take my toothbrush apart, wipe off the gunk and disinfect it with alcohol.  Then I saw the Sonic Seals on Amazon and tried them on a whim.  That was about four years ago and I&#x27;ve used them ever since...they are a great time-saver.  Luckily, I&#x27;ve never had a problem with them.  I pour a bit of rubbing alcohol inside the seal first so it is wet and slides down easily.  Then I tug it over the brush head and smooth it over the brush head until it covers the groove (I attach the brush head to the base/charger first).  These last so long that I clean them when changing brush heads and use them over and over until I get sick of the color.  I do wish they made a three-pack of all clear covers though.  Great product!</li>
            <li> First of all it&#x27;s a struggle to force the brush head thru the narrow portion of the cover and once having done that it&#x27;s another struggle to pull the fat portion of the cover down and over the fat portion of the brush head. Now, since the narrow portion of the brush head doesn&#x27;t rotate when you attach the brush head assembly to the charger, the narrow portion of the cover gets twisted around the brush.</li>
            <li> After much tugging and pulling, I finally got these on my and my husband&#x27;s toothbrush heads.  However, once the seal was on, the head would no longer twist onto the motor base!  This might be a good option for a single user who puts the seal onto the head once the head is already attached to the base.  But not if you take the head on and off for each brushing, as my husband and I do.  **Sorry.  I clearly didn&#x27;t read the product description properly.  I&#x27;m upping my star rating since it was my fault that I didn&#x27;t like the product.  Can&#x27;t give it a full 5 stars since I can&#x27;t vouch for the product as it was actually intended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned my Sonicare Elite toothbrush for years and hated the gunk that built up between the head and body. It looked nasty and smelled. When I stumbled upon this seal, I instantly had to have it. It works great although just one would&#x27;ve been fine. Luckily my GF has a similar Sonicare so I gave her the pink one.</li>
            <li> Great compliment to any Sonicare toothbrush.  I am the only one using the handle on it, so changing heads only occurs when needed.  Keeps water &amp; saliva &amp; toothpaste out of the head, yet doesn&#x27;t change the effecitveness of the sonic action.    1) out of the package feels a little bit sticky (like most silicone) so I held the cover over a bottle of cornstarch powder and squeezed (let the little puff of power land on the inside of the cover but did not sprinkle any powder on it).  Cover slipped down the neck just fine, no tearing, and was in place in less than 20 seconds.    2) needed a little bit of stretching to get the ring in place, but again, no problems and now snugly in place.  3) make sure your brush is completely dry both inside &amp; out for the obvious reasons you don&#x27;t want to trap gunk under the seal.    Suggestion to makers: offer a package of all clear.  I&#x27;m not a fan of either the pink or the blue.</li>
            <li> I love it! It makes it very easy to keep the toothbrush clean and is fairly easy to put on the brush!</li>
            <li> Of course these little covers are snug - If they weren&#x27;t they would not keep the water out.  As others have said, it is necessary to roll them on firmly but carefully so as not to rip the material. And these would not be very practical if two or more people share the same handle - But they work like a charm and I no longer need to disassemble the toothbrush after each use, rinse out and air dry the pieces.  Very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This product has been great for my sonicare toothbrush except for one thing.  The first one that I tried to put on ripped so I was down to 2 sonic seals from the start.  I tried to notify the company but have never heard back.  I would definitely buy the product again realizing now that you have to be pretty careful when stretching the product over the toothbrush.  The product that is on my brush now has been great and has been serving its purpose to keep the water out.</li>
            <li> My toothbrush came with a travel kit, which totally rocks.  This device has to be moved up to the neck to unscrew the head to put it into the travel case.  Totally annoying.  Great for differentiating between two different identical brushes, though.  Also a bit annoying to put on.</li>
            <li> It was a great idea when you have two people sharing a sonic and need to know who&#x27;s replacement head is who&#x27;s. However it takes to much time to change out these heads with this seal on it. I would not recommend this product. We ended up throwing them away. It was like flushing money down the toilet. I was very disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> First these are not heads, but covers. And they&#x27;re not very good covers. Once you get the cover on the brush head, you cannot change brush heads without partially removing it. So, instead of easily swapping out different brushes, I guess the designers of this terrible product think I should have several sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Started using this with a new sonicare brush about 7 months ago. Just 1 tiny spot recently started to get a little moldy, but still works 100 times better than not using 1.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is annoying that this product has to exist as an aftermarket item but if you&#x27;ve gotten surprised by the gunk that builds up inside of the toothbrush head like many others then this is what you want. For a while I tried the rubber glove finger method but it proved unsustainable; I either don&#x27;t have the skill or patience to consistently make that approach work. I could have just used ceram wrap, but that can come loose and looks....kind of terrible. I also tried making a habit of removing the head after each use, but eventually I&#x27;d always relapse and forget. So ideally you&#x27;d want something looking decent and sturdy that will survive reusing and that&#x27;s where this comes in. It&#x27;s made of sturdy silicone that feels like it will survive, aesthetically it&#x27;s ok looking I don&#x27;t really care for the glow in the dark effect, and finally it works. It seals up the weak points of the toothbrush heads and prevents gunk from building up. It&#x27;s not cheap but it does come in a 3 pack value to offset the cost a bit.</li>
            <li> we have 3 people using same base. you need to be careful turning the brush on and off with the silicone unit in use. seems it could dislodge the brush or not align properly</li>
            <li> Never never impractical especially in combination or in the jaw does not advise never purchased..Difficult-to-use installation and removal baaad baaad</li>
            <li> I have only had the Sonicare for a few days and it works great but the Seals make it more difficult to secure the brush to the handle.  I can see the need but since you can take the brush head apart and clean and dry, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going to worry about mold.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have to worry about the gunk buildup in housing with the Sonic Seal.</li>
            <li> AFTER purchasing these covers, I realized they have their own website...where they are cheaper! :( They&#x27;re $9.99+ around $2 for shipping.  Not happy that I purchased them on AMAZON!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said...these covers are definitely effective.  When I first received them I thought there was NO WAY they would fit over the toothbrush, and I actually came back to this site to look at other reviews to make sure I would be able to get them on.  I was worried about the cover ripping, but I didn&#x27;t have that problem.  I sort of just carefully worked it down the neck of the toothbrush and GENTLY stretched it over the base.  There were no instructions on the bag they came in, just a couple little drawings.  On the website, there is a video showing how they should be used.  I would definitely watch it if I hadn&#x27;t already put it on my toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, they work and I will definitely be using them from now on.  The colors leave a LOT to be desired...other color options would be much appreciated.  And it is ABSOLUTELY frustrating that this product needs to be purchased and used in the first place.  But that&#x27;s an issue with Sonicare....</li>
            <li> I very rarely in my reviews disagree with others openly, but come on people, its designed to keep water out of a crack and it has to be tight.  It took me all of five minutes to carefully put two of them on.  For the DIYers, yes I think you could make your own, but I really didn&#x27;t want to and the gloves idea was cool but looked like it would require more trial and error than I wanted.  Over all a very great and thoughtful product, just really wish they weren&#x27;t necessary because of a crappy design flaw.</li>
            <li> I liked the concept of them... and I understand they need to be snug in order to do their job... but it was too difficult to get on, I ripped one, couldn&#x27;t get it down all the way to the bottom of the base.  it would have just trapped bacteria because I couldn&#x27;t completely get it on.  after many attempts.  I sent it back.  I will just have to take off my toothbrush head after each use to ensure it gets enough air to dry before mold forms.    also, I agree with some reviewers, they should come up with a better color selection.  I knew my husband wouldn&#x27;t like anything but the clear, so I was stuck with the blue (I hate pink)</li>
            <li> I waited a while to buy these, as they seemed overpriced. I wish I had ordered them sooner. Maybe the guy who invented the Sonic Seal is making a bundle. Well, he DESERVES to make a bundle! This product works perfectly and solves a serious hygiene problem with the Sonicare brush head. They are slightly tricky to install, but that&#x27;s because they fit quite snugly and really keep the tooth brushing residue from seeping into the chamber and threads under the brush head. (Did you ever try to clean that stuff out? I did it with vinegar, a small brush and a Q-tip, and it wasn&#x27;t pleasant!) If you Google \\&quot;Sonic Seal\\&quot; you will find the product web site, which includes photos and a video showing how to install it.</li>
            <li> These are a nice idea.  I used corn starch on the sleeves and they went right on the heads.  I have to pull the sleeve up off the cap to get the threads to engage, but it&#x27;s no big deal.  I like them and the Sonicare head holder stays nice and clean - no residual gunk.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this thing. I read the reviews really carefully. Some people said it worked pretty well. So I bought one. But in fact I even don&#x27;t know how to make it on the brush.  Maybe I am not smart enough. And the quality is too bad!! You can feel once you open the box. It looks like some bonus stuff. But it charged you 17 USD. I feel really bad. Anyway don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> would love nicer colors or all clear, will try to remember to try the cornstarch next time to make application easier, but.. if you&#x27;ve ever had to suffer through &amp;#34;the gunk,&amp;#34; then let me say -- they work perfectly.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t work as well as some others I have had. They tear very easily.</li>
            <li> I stumbled across this product while ordering replacement heads on Amazon and I&#x27;m sure glad that I did.  I&#x27;ve been a Sonicare user for as long as I can remember.  I remember the base on the first Sonicare unit I used was so big it looked like a power drill!  The only complaint that I&#x27;ve ever had is how nasty the inside of the head gets from water getting in through the cracks.  I&#x27;ve tryed taking it apart and drying it after each use but it still seemed to retain moisture inside the head.  I would always be grossed out knowing that I was brushing my teeth with the nasty gunk right behind the plastic head but never wanted to change brushes as the Sonicare gets my teeth cleaner than any other product I&#x27;ve used.  Well my days of worrying about that are over now that I&#x27;ve purchased the Sonic Seal.  These seals keep all moisture out of the head and the inside of the head looks as new when taking it off to replace it.  I agree with other reviews that the seal is difficult to get on but I believe it needs to be that tight to keep the water and moisture out effectively.  The only reason I did not give this product 5 stars is that one of the seals ripped when I was putting it on.  I can see this being an issue when changing heads regularly but I won&#x27;t hestiate to purchase another set if needed as they work so well.</li>
            <li> I love these. They completely seal off the space between the brush head and the base. Which is what they are supposed to do. I&#x27;ve never had one break on me while putting it on the brush head. They are very tight, so a little hard to put on, but again that&#x27;s the point. I really appreciate knowing my toothbrush is clean inside and that I don&#x27;t have to take the brush head apart every time I use my toothbrush to dry everything.</li>
            <li> I got these for my wife, and she loves it.  She had some trouble with liquids getting inside her toothbrush beneath the head, and some bacterial growth was going on.  Not good.  Put this on there, and it keeps the liquid out.  No more problem!  I&#x27;m not sure what she does different than I do, as I don&#x27;t have the leaking problem, and the problem for her carried over to new heads for the toothbrush too.</li>
            <li> These things work.  After getting gross black mold in my Sonicare for years, I finally found a solution.  Incidentally, Philips Customer Care gave me the run-around and kept telling me that the mold was due to varying humidity in various homes.  Does not make sense considering I live with my wife :) and hers does not have mold.  They wanted me to take off and dry my brush head every day.  What a hassle!  Anyway, the Sonic Seal works but, like many of the reviews have said, it is very hard to get one and THEY WILL RIP IF YOU ARE NOT CAREFUL PUTTING THEM ON.  For this price, ripping is a bad situation.</li>
            <li> I love these things, just wish they were cheaper! On the plus side each one is reusable so hopefully I won&#x27;t have to re order for a long time. These keep water from collecting between the toothbrush head and base, which in  turn prevents mold from growing in that area. Don&#x27;t have to worry about what is growing inside my brush as I use it!</li>
            <li> Amazingly simple, yet works great. I buy a pack of these with each 3-pack of heads. The only reason I gave it 4-stars was due to the price.</li>
            <li> I have the Sonic Care toothbrush this cover goes to and it was always getting gross crud in the cracks from spit, toothpaste, that kind of stuff. One day while cleaning my toothbrush I thought about how nice it would be if there was a cover that would prevent all this build up. So I jumped on Amazon and low and behold here it was. It just so happens that aside from me, my husband and mother have the same toothbrush so this 3 packed worked great but it would be nice to have a single or double pack offer as well. I thought it was a little on the pricey side.</li>
            <li> This product is pictured differently than it truly is.  It is a very tight fitting silicone-like sleeve that fits over the brush head.  You must remove it each time you screw on the brush, so for families where multiple people share a brush base, this is not a product for you.  Please note, it is very difficult to put on and take off.  Definitely wasted money for our family, hopefully I have prevented it from happening to yours!</li>
            <li> These are a little tricky to get on, but probably because they WORK.  No water gets through these puppies, so no black mold stuff growing within your toothbrush.  Excellent item.  Will buy as long as I&#x27;m using my Sonic Care toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I only have two for these now - one broke when I was trying to put it on.  I understand that they have to be tight... but wow.  The second one is working great, but I am not looking forward to having to change the brush head.</li>
            <li> Works well. You have to be careful putting them o not to tear them. I found getting them over the brush head not all that difficult. Getting it over the threaded nut was harder. Found that flipping the bottom inside out once it was over the brush and then rolling it over the nut worked pretty good. Not much thicker than a condom which is basically what it is, only for your Sonic tooth brush. They do the job keeping water out of the base area.</li>
            <li> Some people have complained that this is hard to put on, and it is or it has to be a little difficult or it wouldn&#x27;t fit tightly enough to keep the water out.  If you wet the brush end of the toothbrush before pulling it over, it will be easier.  Then pull it down all the way around past the groove at the bottom of the toothbrush screw-on part before letting it retract to the groove or not since as long as it covers the groove it doesn&#x27;t matter.  Leave it loose at the point where the brush shaft comes out of the main body so that you don&#x27;t dampen the vibrations of the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the finger cut from a rubber glove shortcut before ordering this and it tore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember that this isn&#x27;t designed to be removed very often so don&#x27;t get it if you share a toothbrush with somebody or unscrew the head every week for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered from the supplier site and had a delivery issue which was promptly resolved after sending an e-mail.</li>
            <li> No more &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34;. No more yuk! Keeps the holder clean. I couldn&#x27;t believe it till I tried it. Now I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> Prevents the seeping of water into the brush head that causes the awful mold growing inside.  My only question to Sonicare is why should I have to purchase a separate accessory to do what should be incorporated into their product&#x27;s basic design.  Regardless, this purchase addresses a need that Sonicare&#x27;s poor design doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Was very impressed with these seals, altho it is a bit to thin.  When I was trying to put on the first one, it ripped, so had to take another new one and try to work it on the brush slowly and carefully.  It does work and keeps the inner parts of the toothbrush dry so now I don&#x27;t need to take the toothbrush apart every time I use it.  Hope they improved the thickness of these seals soon, then it would be much much better.</li>
            <li> What the haybunnies did I buy this for? Thought I was getting some replacement heads and instead got some condoms for my toothbrush. What a ditz.&lt;br /&gt;PS - I am writing this negative review cause I think the product advertising could have been a little clearer. OK - a lot clearer.</li>
            <li> This solves a really big problem with electric toothbrushes, especially my wife&#x27;s.  It is very much like using a rubber, but that is not bad, is it?</li>
            <li> Received these just this past week. Not excited about at all. Good concept, but much too hard to use.  Took 10 - 15 minutes to put on .... way more I would say than worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I hate spending so much $$ on these, but they last for years, and I much prefer using these than cleaning out a gunky toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This item definitely works as described and will keep grunge and crud out of your sonicare e series toothbrush...if you don&#x27;t mind that it completely mutes the vibrations of your brush rendering it basically about as powerful as a cheapy grocery store knock-off. On the one hand, I love my toothbrush to be clean in a hassle-free way. But it&#x27;s more important to me that my teeth are clean (I can just rinse the toothbrush more carefully and more frequently). I want the sonicare to work like it should, so both my husband and I dispensed with these after one day of use. Really a shame. They were pretty expensive. Anyone want ours?!</li>
            <li> These seals break very easily</li>
            <li> These seals are a great patch for a design flaw.  They are not easy to put on, but I have yet to try the cornstarch trick mentioned by another reviewer.  However, three of us split the pack and not one of us has had one rip.    Pros  Effectively keeps gunk out of the inner workings of the toothbrush.  Glows in the dark, which is kind of fun.  The price is reasonable.  The ridge along the bottom fits in the problematic groove on the toothbrush, which keeps the seal in place.    Cons  Requires a little patience to put on.  \\&quot;Stuff\\&quot; still runs down the handle, but this can&#x27;t really be blamed on the seal.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions very precisely -- did not use a tool to put one of these seals on my Sonicare toothbrush, but the seal ripped as soon as I gave it a slight tug. I don&#x27;t have sharp fingernails or rough skin or anything that would cut into the seal. The problem is the flimsy material used to make the seal itselt. The product is expensive and strong enough to put on the toothbrush without easily coming apart.</li>
            <li> Great product. Price is ok. Why doesn&#x27;t Sonicare create something like this to keep the crap out of your tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your best bet is to buy these when you first purchase your toothbrush. This will keep it clean inside from day 1. If you purchase these after the fact, you have some tedious cleaning on your hands to get the brush spotless before you install these. I ended up soaking my brush body upside down in a small amount of hydrogen peroxide to clean the crap from the cavity. I then used q-tips and some plastic scribes to assist with cleaning the cavity out.</li>
            <li> I purchased my whole family sonicares by philips, only to find out about the mold issue. These are a godsend and the only way that we will use sonicares. I recommend these to everyone with any model. Genuis idea. Too bad Philips won&#x27;t resolve this known issue since the brushes are very pricey up to $200!</li>
            <li> I would not use most models of sonicare without this seal.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot conceive of taking the brush apart after each use and washing&lt;br /&gt;out the collected juices.</li>
            <li> It was somewhat difficult to put it on, required persistence and firm massaging to get it to cover the place where the handle and the brush head meet. Once on, it does its job very well. I&#x27;m the only one using the brush, so maybe that makes it more useful and logical for me. I think it&#x27;s money well spent. So go ahead, get it on.</li>
            <li> Works ok, but my husband and I share a toothbrush base, so we have to take our brushes on and off.&lt;br /&gt;The rubber seal twists all around in this process and it&#x27;s hard to get it screwed on tight.&lt;br /&gt;Would work better if you are the only one using it.</li>
            <li> I purchased these in December 2013 for around $16, which is pretty pricy for 3 little rubbery protectors for my toothbrush, but at the time I felt it was worth the money not to have to cut my own out of latex gloves to protect my hundred-buck-toothbrush. NOW, the price has shot up to TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS. So $8 bucks a piece for what is essentially 3 little toothbrush condoms. Ridiculous! I&#x27;m using the ones I already have for as long as they last &amp; then when they tear up, I&#x27;m making my own. There is no way I&#x27;ll pay that much for an item that probably only costs pennies to manufacture. I&#x27;m really disappointed in this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: As of 7-9-14, the product is not carried by Sonic Seal on Amazon. It is carried by another seller &amp; the price has gone down. I found that Sonic Seal has their own website &amp; sells the 3 pack for only $9.99. Yay! Now, I have not ordered any, so I do not know how much the shipping is &amp; I couldn&#x27;t find shipping prices listed on the site. I am very pleased with the company to see that their product is being offered at a reasonable price, &amp; I&#x27;ll know where to order when I need Sonic Seals in the future.</li>
            <li> The Sonic Seal works really well for those who are not sharing the handle with other family or friends. It seals out water moisture and gunk, and (wow!) even glows in the dark. I use it on a Sonicare Essence 5300, which has a more difficult magnet-movement cavity, in terms of ease of cleaning.  Its bell shaped and has a lot of edges to make cleaning a bit of a problem.  In any case, the Sonic Seal solves this problem by not allowing anything into this area.  The Sonic Seal is hard to get on and it probably takes a good five minutes to coax and persuade it to do so. Once done though, it works great.</li>
            <li> This product works great - but I bought it directly from the company that sells it. It does take some doing to get it on the brush without damaging it. The only problem is taking it on vacation. It is a P.I.T.A. to  put it back together.</li>
            <li> These are very delicate items; and expensive for what you get. They should be sold for about $5.00 for three.  I tore one putting it on my toothbrush within a few minutes of receiving it in the mail.  I guess they work alright, but why doesn&#x27;t Sonicare provide a free fix for their mold producing tooth brush heads or replace the germ infested item with better technology either free to those of use that bought these brushes or at least at a discounted amount.  Shame on you Sonicare for making such a mold prone device.</li>
            <li> Everything was as advertised and worked well.</li>
            <li> Keeps the water out of my toothbrush.  The seal is very tight.  Love it!  I would recommend that everyone get it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how much I was grossed out by my Sonicare E-Series toothbrush&#x27;s disgusting smell. Not to mention the fact that the goo had a direct route to my mouth. Ewwwwww--defeated the purpose of the expensive brush in the first place. Periodically taking it apart and cleaning it with baking soda/vinegar and an old toothbrush wouldn&#x27;t always kill the smell/goop accumulation on the inside--and frankly, it was a pain.     By following the instructions other reviewers gave (a dusting of corn starch on the inside) and taking care when pulling over the brush head, I found the Sonic Seal to be the ONLY solution to remaining a Sonicare afficionado, and to keeping my brush more sterile. Another tip to reduce germ growth on your brush is to periodically soak the bristles in a mouthwash solution. This has been proven to kill bacterial growth.     If you own a Sonicare E-Series, the Sonic Seal is a must-have item. Happy brushing!</li>
            <li> Love this product, just changed toothbrush after 3 months; no mess or gook using this seal.  Used baby powder to make putting on a new one on a new brush.  Definitely recommeded!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Sonicare toothbrush for over 5 years now and always hated having to remove the brush head to clean the gook out of the insides and the threads.  Now, after installing the \\&quot;Sonic Seal\\&quot; nothing can get inside to foul the inside cavity.  The seal covers from the stem all the way passed the seam where the brush head attaches.  I will warn you the seal is a little rough to install without ripping the silicone material, but if your patient and careful &amp; take your time it&#x27;s really not too bad.  I recommend getting the seal wet after washing it with soap &amp; water first and leaving it a little wet to help slid it into proper position.  I have five people in my family, so after I practiced on the first one then next four were no big deal.  Plus they glow in the dark!</li>
            <li> These work as advertised and immediately make you feel better about no longer collecitng goo under the brush head.  As others have stated however, it&#x27;s only good for those with a dedicated brush -- changing brush heads would be a pain with these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why there have been other complaints about this product ripping or being hard to put on. I have had no trouble at all with mine and have found they are quite easy to put on and remove. I don&#x27;t think I could rip them if I tried. I love not having to worry about what kind of gunk it building up inside my toothbrush. My only complaint is the colors. I would prefer to have a pack of all clear.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly for the Sonicare toothbrush, although I don&#x27;t really like the colors, a personal taste.&lt;br /&gt;It is made of silicone, so water drops do not stay on. It makes cleaning very easy and fast, in seconds.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried to get this on, it took me a long time.  I didn&#x27;t really get it--how the little line at the base should go in the seam between the brush head and the body.  When I finally got it on and used it, oh, it was so worth it.  I&#x27;ve been bothered by the gross build-up in my otherwise-loved Sonicare for years.  I wasn&#x27;t looking forward to replacing heads, but it was much easier to get on the second time.  Protip: basically, think condom.</li>
            <li> They are a bit difficult to put on, but nowhere near as hard as I expected from other reviews. Also, once it is on, you don&#x27;t have to worry about it. These are a great solution to the issue of water getting through the connection points. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Easier to see who&#x27;s toothbrush is who&#x27;s!  Now there is no more confusion when we&#x27;re rushing off in the morning.</li>
            <li> Whoever comes up with these things is brilliant!  I love these.  Hate when the inside of the toothbrush has alll the moldy gunk!  It&#x27;s soooo gross!  This takes care of it.</li>
            <li> The Sonic Seal for my Sonicare Toothbrush has stopped all moisture from getting below the head where it attaches to the battery portion of the toothbrush.  Before I purchased the Sonic Seal, I had to dismantle and clean at least once a week to prevent a build up of mold where the brush head attached to the battery portion.  The Sonic Seal works so well I no longer have to do that and it stays mold free between changing heads.</li>
            <li> Purchased from Amazon Fulfillment. Way over priced for what you receive. In addition Shipping and Handling was twice what it should have been for these items. I think Amazon overcharges some people to make up for those purchasing more and getting free shipping. Only time will tell how long these seals will last. They are very thin and it won&#x27;t take much effort to puncture one of them somewhere down the line.</li>
            <li> The seals seem to work so far. Time can only tell if these will be worth the cost, which, at $16.99 is a little over a third of what I paid for the Sonicare Essence. I agree with other reviewers that this seems quite high to fix a design flaw with the entry level Sonicare Essence. If I could do it again, I would have just paid the $80 for the Easy Clean model, which does have the gunk issue. Brush heads are also cheaper with the Easy Clean, as you get four heads for the price of three Essence heads here on Amazon. However, I already had the Essence, and a few extra brush heads, but stopped using it because I was put off by the idea of putting mold anywhere near my mouth. I ended up getting my first cavity in several years. So, yes, the Sonicare E works, even with the mold issue. Then I remembered these and thought I would give it a shot before upgrading to the more expensive model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, why did I not get these sooner? I remember hearing about these when they came out several years ago, but the high cost and especially the attitude of the business owner toward customers made me decide against it. (Just check the responses to the reviews, if you want to know what I mean. The guy seems to think its all about him. I didn&#x27;t get the sense that he would stand behind the product. Terrible attitude, but apparently he&#x27;s a dentist so perhaps he just lacks social skills, and isn&#x27;t as dishonest as he presents himself to be. In any case, it doesn&#x27;t inspire my confidence in the product.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for now I am optimistic that the seals will work. If they rip, or otherwise fail to work, I&#x27;ll log back in and let everyone know. If I don&#x27;t post anything further, then they are continuing to work as advertised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to a normal toothbrush after using a sonicare for years, but the fact is that sonicare heads are terribly designed and will turn disgusting inside no matter how careful you are about taking care of them. After replacing head after head, I decided someone must have addressed this problem by now and sure enough I found these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work perfectly! As long as you can leave your head on your brush handle, these will keep your brush head clean and dry inside. They aren&#x27;t difficult to put on, you just have to take your time and slowly work it into place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice to use my sonicare and not feel disgusted about what&#x27;s growing inside it for a change!</li>
            <li> Best investment ever!  I have a newer model toothbrush and these still work just require a bit of elbow grease.  They definitely keep the brush head and body connecting area clean which is nice.  I am a messy brusher so I think this is awesome!</li>
            <li> What a good idea for the sonicare heads. To keep it cleaner, protected and color coded to quickly identify your toothbrush. They are sticky rubbery and you stretch it over your toothbrush head. I of course wanted the pink one. The narrow neck ripped when I stretched it on. This package of 3 should cost no more than $3. I have seen it priced at $16. WAY TOO MUCH for what it is. I just got it and put one on my sonicare head. I dont know if they can be taken off and reused when you replace the toothbrush head.The packaging was flimsey (thats ok in todays over packaged world) but offered little instruction. If the price came down it would get a lot, it would get a better review.</li>
            <li> These are absolute junk. I ripped two trying to put them on.  For the money--forget it!</li>
            <li> My husband found these so he wouldn&#x27;t have to keep removeing his toothbrush head to clean his ultra-sonic handle.  He always has a lot of toothpaste flowing down the brush handle when he brushes, seeping into the pocket of the handle. Over time this area grows mold and who knows what else, that needs to be cleaned out(a place that is difficult to get to to clean). This little boot covers the toothbrush head and handle enough so the liquids don&#x27;t seep into the handle pocket, proving a more sanitary toothbrush. I recomend this for those who have this problem.</li>
            <li> Keeps the interior of my Sonicare clean and dry, and with a small puff of cornstarch or baby powder, I find it easy to to put onto my toothbrush.  I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend taking it on and off regularly, like trying to share the same handle between separate heads, but pulling it on and off every few months with the head replacement has worked fine for me.  As for durability, I&#x27;m on the same seal as when I first bought my pack in 2010, so that must say something.</li>
            <li> Does not hold up. Difficult to remove head (for travel) and replace same.  Wish I had not purchased this item</li>
            <li> The concept is great, but if you cannot get them on, what&#x27;s the use? These were impossible to get on.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t break mine.  With all the complaints in reviews, I took extra care and nudging it in place is not that difficult, except it takes some patience.  Also, this is very over-priced, probably better and cheaper ones will emerge sometime.</li>
            <li> I was thinking of buying these to solve the ridiculous design problem of the otherwise good Sonicare brushes...that being the fact that water gets inside the brush, leaks, and crud builds up.  However, I read the comments by Sonic Seal in response to less than positive reviews, and Sonic Seal is so rude and unreceptive to customer feedback that there is no way I would give them business.</li>
            <li> These silicone based seals are of great value when you have any of the E-series Sonicare toothbrushes.  I have used the Sonicare toothbrush for over 3 years now.  On my first year of use, I realized that there was always a build-up of molds that happen right within the very neck of the brush head (where you screw in the brush replacement).  I really have a hard time cleaning it because the inside neck seems tight for your fingers to reach and clean.  With the Sonic Seal, you completely negate the chances of any mold build-up.  There is some quite of difficulty fitting it in but once you do, it will save you all the trouble of removing any mold build-up in the future.</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm to keep that gross moldy stuff out of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> cost 5 to 6 bucks apiece. first one ripped (and was therefore useless)when i tried to put it on.  used a little cornstarch and the other 2 went on the brushes easily enough. they should be more durable for this price. How about a replacement, huh?</li>
            <li> This product is heaven. The sonicare brush system should have been manufactured with these. I love my sonicare toothbrush, but the gross filth and scum that builds up under the head was a major turn-off for me, but now that is resolved. One caveat, these sleeves are very difficult to get over the brush head and the body of the brush, but once you figure out how to get it in the right position it won&#x27;t move, and it seals the brush head perfectly. I found that it is easiest to first get the sleeve over the brush, and then turn the sleeve inside out. Move the sleeve as far down on the brush head shaft and then slowly pull the sleeve down onto the body of the brush head.</li>
            <li> Instead of the expense and trouble of purchasing and applying these seals, isn&#x27;t it simpler, quicker, and ultimately just as effective to occasionally remove the Sonicare screw-on brush head and clean out accumulated gunk with small (manual) toothbrush and household cleaner (Windex, alcohol, etc.)?  Then, after rinsing, allow to dry overnight, wrapped in dry napkin or paper towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether expressed in Sonicare&#x27;s user&#x27;s manual or not, I have always assumed this is what they intended for routine maintenance between brush replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve been doing with ours for the past 10-15 years.</li>
            <li> These work great!  After 3+ years of use, I came back to buy replacements and it doesn&#x27;t look like they&#x27;re sold on Amazon any more.  Bummer.  Great idea!</li>
            <li> The packaging is a bit juvenile, making the product look like a novelty item (who needs glow-in-the-dark toothbrush covers?), and three guesses as to what we are calling these in my adult household, but they really work, and that is what it is all about, anyway. One of us had stopped using her Sonicare toothbrush, having noticed some nasty black mold growing within the handle, and another was still using hers, but disgusted at having to clean it so often. Strangely, the guy who shares a bathroom with one of us, with identical (but separate) toothbrush, toothpaste, soap, and vanity, did not have any problems with mold growing on his toothbrush. He is now using the Sonic Seal anyway, having heard of the others&#x27; experiences.&lt;br /&gt;The only suggestion I would have for improvement is more colors, as the pink cover, which now resides on my toothbrush, was none too popular in my household, and, in my experience, is studiously avoided by boys, of whom some households have more than two.&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;</li>
            <li> I love my brush cover. I live in a very damp maritime climate and before I got the Sonic Seal I had to deal with disgusting mold and mildew colonies inside my toothbrush when it came time to change the brush head, even though I dry it off after each use. Without the Sonic Seal, the damp seeped in under the brush head, and it was impossible to keep clean and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To apply the Sonic Seal, I washed the brush handle, dried it thoroughly, and put on a new brush head, then I put on the Sonic Seal to cover it. The Sonic Seal is tough, durable, and I have not had any trouble with it ripping because it is made of a material that is not designed to slide, so as long as you are careful with the application and don&#x27;t try to slide it, it should survive multiple brush head changings. I am still using the same pink Sonic Seal cover that has seen 3 brush head replacements so far. It is a little tricky to maneuver the Sonic Seal because the silicone is clingy and does not slide. It is worth its weight in gold because when you remove it and unscrew the brush head, the inside of your toothbrush base will still be pristine, new, and dry.</li>
            <li> Works, but isn&#x27;t critically needed.  I remove brush and clean/dry attachment areas of it and &#x27;handle&#x27; after every use--not inconvenient to me.  Brush head goes into dish washer periodically for more thorough cleaning and sanitizing.</li>
            <li> These have worked perfectly for me. So far, I haven&#x27;t had any of the problems other reviews have mentioned with ripping or with putting them on the toothbrush. A bit pricey for what they are. But they save a lot of hassle.  So, overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> My family has been using Sonicare toothbrushes for several years now. If you&#x27;re using a Sonicare I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve experienced they slimy goo that builds up inside the head. Each member of my germ-a-phobic family has their own base so we don&#x27;t have to change the heads out daily and share one base. Last year my base started growing black mold inside. I bleached and scrubbed it over and over and it kept coming back, however the others were not having this problem, just the goo issue. I decided I needed a whole new Sonicare despite the price. I found Amazon to be much less expensive than the local stores I normally would go to. Upon searching for replacement head prices for the rest of the family I stumbled across \\&quot;The Sonicare Seal\\&quot; and was amazed at the idea! I was skeptical if they would really work or change the performance of the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now had mine for 6 months and I must say I&#x27;m absolutely amazed!!! I checked the head after the first week and it was bone dry! No slimy goo! No moldy ick! I tried one more week and it was still dry so I quit checking. After 4 months of use I went to change the head out and it was still dry and spotless inside! I agree they are a little difficult to put on, they are very snug. You just need to be patient and work with it a little but once it is on you are good to go! Be sure to line the little ridge up with the seam between the head and the base. I did not have any ripping issues as others have mentioned and I replaced it onto my new head with no issues. 6 months later all 3 covers are still holding strong and none of us have slimy gooey heads!!! :) Well worth the money in my opinion, the time it has saved us cleaning the base and heads alone is well worth it to this happy family!</li>
            <li> After being horrified at the disgusting black gunk in my sonicare toothbrush, I found these little seals and figured they couldn&#x27;t make the problem any worse. They don&#x27;t just help this issue -- they totally fix the problem! Since using these seals, I haven&#x27;t found one speck of black mould inside my toothbrush handle. They also help to differentiate our different toothbrushes :-) Will buy more again soon!</li>
            <li> OK.  A little hard to put on but then if you want it to be waterproof it should fit tight.</li>
            <li> Great product. Requires some patience putting it on but keeps the inside of the base moisture free and mold free.</li>
            <li> Love it, no problems at all, product is exactly as explained by the sellers with the exact final result mentioned.</li>
            <li> These have kept our toothbrushes gunk free! Put it on and forget about it for 3 months when we change the heads. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I purchased these some time ago and amazingly, i have only used one so far. It has held up great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It does what it says it will do, keeping all the saliva and water out of the inside of your toothbrush. Man, I definitely DO NOT miss  having to clean that disgusting stuff out of there! If you have a Sonicare brush, these are SO worth it!</li>
            <li> I am so glad this was suggested to me by Amazon. It has COMPLETELY solved the problem of the nasty mold and gunk that has plagued the inside of my Sonicare for years. After a few months I was suspicious and took it off to check. It really works!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re very happy with these sonic seals... They take some finessing to get on... but just be careful. I would say if you feel unsure use your least favorite color first to do a test run... or do the cornstarch trick.  These things seal the top neck area AND the area where the toothbrush head gets put onto the base.  It would be nice if they sold them separately and had purple or a darker pink. My toothbrush didn&#x27;t have a leaking problem, but my BF&#x27;s did (I think he wasn&#x27;t drying it properly) but this solves the that!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and they do glow in the dark... but you have to REALLY hold it up to the light... and I always have a nite-lite on so it doesn&#x27;t really matter to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This product is amazingly simple and it works! If you are going to use The Sonicare, then you owe it to yourself to get these.  After I received them, I became concerned that the material was too thin, but it proved to be very, very, very strong and stretches for an air-tight fit. No more ugly residue build-up!</li>
            <li> These are a great product for keep the gunk out of the toothbrush, but they have gotten extremely expensve.  You either pay thru the nose for the item, or they stick it to you on the shipping.  Either way, you have to pay. They work great, but $15.99 for three little membrane&#x27;s made of plastic is overpriced.  If you can find them cheaper elsewhere, or where you don&#x27;t pay shipping, you&#x27;d be better off.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It&#x27;s not completely easy to get on, but once it&#x27;s on properly, it keeps your toothbrush crevices clean for so much longer.  I never need to clean the gunk out of my sonicare again!  Definitely worth the money to save yourself the time cleaning and germs that build up without it.</li>
            <li> Yup, they are usefull for telling who brush is who&#x27;s in the morning, no need to be awake just find your color and screw it on.</li>
            <li> Great idea to keep the brush head dry to avoid mold.  Not easy to get on and the material will tear very easily.  But it does provide full cover and does not impede use of the toothbrush.  Ridiculous price for 3 pieces of silicon but should be worth the investment.</li>
            <li> These covers have kept my toothbrush (not the brush itself) looking new.  Sonicare should have these as part of the purchase of the toothbrush as they keep the nasty grungy stuff from getting into the toothbrush base.  It would be nice to have a 3 pack with no colors (e.g., pink).</li>
            <li> This product does what it is supposed to do, keep water out of the toothbrush head.  But the first one I put on my toothbrush tore as I pulled it onto the brush.  The bottom part of the seal ripped very easily as I tugged it onto my brush cover.  Giving it two stars because it does still protect what it is supposed to protect, but I do not feel it is durable enough to use over and over again.</li>
            <li> For the money I paid, I expect this to last awhile but one of them already torn after day one.</li>
            <li> If you have ever opened your Sonicare toothbrush and seen the goo and gunk that builds up inside, you will love these. Works great!</li>
            <li> Really hard to get these on the toothbrush.  Once they are on they do a great job of keeping all the gunk out of the inside of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Great product, it helps with keeping the bacteria out of all the small spaces that the brush has.  Glad i finally found a product that can do this.  The constant cleaning was taking longer than actually brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> They are hard to get onto the brush, but they are well worth it.  A little pricey, but it does great to keep the bacteria and mold at bay and accumulates in the cracks.</li>
            <li> Did not like these at all they were very hard to use, had to throw them away.&lt;br /&gt;I would not waste your money.</li>
            <li> These have worked great and have kept the yuck out of our toothbrushes. The first time I put these on mine and my husband&#x27;s toothbrushes, I did tear these a little. They went on fairly easily, but as I tried to tug all the way to the bottom, they tore. However, the tear was by the bottom seam, and up by the brush head is wear water gets in. Even with the little tear, it protects the inside of the toothbrush just fine. Even better, I&#x27;ve been able to reuse these. Each time I replace the toothbrush head, I take it off and put it back on. I&#x27;ve reused these over 6 times each so far. Now that I know how to put it on and that you don&#x27;t need to yank tightly at the bottom I have had no further tears.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> Tears easily, one of the seals tore while pulling it down over the toothbrush. I did not apply excessive force. These are pretty expensive per piece, so that&#x27;s not OK.</li>
            <li> these are so awesome. they work perfect, preventing water/toothpaste from getting into the brush. If I would have known these were made years ago I could have saved myself a lot of OCD headaches with removing the brush after every use. I would recommend these to everyone with electric/battery brushes</li>
            <li> These work great. No more nasty residue inside the handle.</li>
            <li> This is the best idea!  I have hated my Sonicare E-series toothbrush because it leaks around the opening where the brush comes through, causing me to require taking it apart and cleaning it out each time I used it.  This product totally solved the problem and now I love my toothbrush again.  Sonicare should license the patent for this and make it part of every toothbrush they sell.</li>
            <li> I loved my Sonicare, until the fight against the black goo got to difficult. It seems to get worse and worse over time, collecting mold faster and faster. I tried a different toothbrush, the Oral B, and really didn&#x27;t like the results compared to my Sonicare. Then, I saw these things. Wow. It completely seals off that area where the blackness assembles. I can&#x27;t say how glad I am that someone came up with these! Thank you!</li>
            <li> My family and I rely on these toothbrush covers. Why, oh why did Sonicare design their wonderful toothbrushes with the awful gap where the toothbrush head screws onto the toothbrush handle? I&#x27;ll never know, but luckily I discovered these Sonic Seal covers. These covers really do seal the gap, so the inside of the toothbrush stays nice and clean. They can be a bit sticky to put on and take off, but that&#x27;s part of the design to maintain the seal. I&#x27;m impressed by how durable the material is. We&#x27;ve had them for more than a year now, and even with having taken them off and put them back on each time we switch to a new toothbrush head, they&#x27;re still in new condition. I can&#x27;t recommend these covers enough!</li>
            <li> So far it has kept my Sonicare toothbrush clean on the inside, but I am a bit disappointed at the quality. Previous versions of this product were thicker and did not break as easily. But, I gave this 4 stars because you get 3 in one package and as long as you take your time putting it on, it will likely not break. Plus, it does the job well once it is on the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought one pack about a year ago. I put the pink on mine and the blue on my husbands.  After the most recent head replacement (about 3 months ago), I decided to do an experiment (okay, I was a little lazy) and I didn&#x27;t put my husband&#x27;s sonic seal back on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 months go by, and yesterday I decide its time to replace the heads.  I had noticed lately that his side of the toothbrush stand was a lot &#x27;gunkier&#x27;, but I just dismissed it... After unscrewing the cap yesterday, I was APPALLED at all of the smelly, nasty, black, gunky goo on the inside!  It is actually incredible just how much stuff gets INSIDE!  I almost gagged, it was so disgusting.  I spent a while cleaning with paper towels, clorox wipes and a toothpick around the crevices - UGH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, I change my toothbrush - completely clean on the inside!  Ahhh...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve learned my lesson and will remember to keep these suckers on.  It is worth the small effort (maybe a minute each) to put on.</li>
            <li> These are a bit of a challenge to install, but they work perfectly and they do help keep the underside of the brush head clean and dry. As stated in the ad, these are NOT for people who share a single brush handleâ€”there is no way you are going to easily switch heads once this is on. But for semi-annual head replacement, it ain&#x27;t bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The white seal is almost invisible when installed, but the blue and red do a good job of indentifying the brushes if you have more than one around the bathroom sink. They glow-in-the-dark, too! You wouldn&#x27;t know this unless you look at the product photos as this isn&#x27;t in the description. Kinda neat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars for a product that does what it says and looks good doing it.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sonic Seals were difficult to put on the toothbrush. They seemed a bit thin and easily ripped. I ended up tearing one before getting it on the toothbrush. When on, though, the seals do their job.</li>
            <li> Keeps all the gunk out of the toothbrush but its really hard to put on the toothbrush. Other reviews warned of this but its worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> 4 of us in the family and each with the same exact toothbrush....There have been mix ups using eachother&#x27;s brushes! YUCK! These covers help avoid the confusion. They even glow in the dark....not that I brush my teeth with the lights off, but for the kids that is cool. I like that they are silicone so they grip nicely in hand and are quite snug on the brush head so no water or crud gets under them. I recommend!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly. It was a very snug fit and challenging to get on, but it keeps the water out. Also, there was a clear one in my package. I used that since I didn&#x27;t want any colors.</li>
            <li> this lets no water into my toothbrush so there&#x27;s no gross mold or mildew, even after months of use. however, it is very, very difficult to get on. i recommend watching the online video (google it) for instructions on how to wrangle it onto the toothbrush. you risk getting blisters or sore fingers otherwise.</li>
            <li> I was really looking for an answer to the mold growth in the toothbrush (ugh).  These seals make a solid connection...a problem solved.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d finally found a cure for the nasty stuff that&#x27;s been happening in my sonic are for the past ten years. At about $5 a pop they seemed expensive, but I splurged when I bought some new brush heads. What a waste of money. I had one tear on me as I put it on the first toothbrush. I was upset and should have returned them immediately for a refund, but I was able to get the other two on without tearing them and since I don&#x27;t take the heads off frequently, I figured it would be tough to damage them. This was the wrong move. We went in vacation last week and I took the toothbrush apart and then gently tried to remove the &#x27;Sonic Seal. It tore along the top as I pulled it over the brush head. I don&#x27;t know what these are made of, but it&#x27;s the cheapest quality plastic material I&#x27;ve ever encountered. It feels like silicon, but it&#x27;s nowhere near as tough. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s easier to tear than a single piece of paper. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these to anyone at the price they&#x27;re selling for.  Unfortunately I&#x27;m outside my return window now so I can&#x27;t get a refund, but I wanted to save anyone else from making the same mistake I did.</li>
            <li> I have a nice nightlight as well as a cover for my Sonicare toothbrush.  They are thin and need to be put on carefully, but worth the effort.</li>
            <li> These are a little tough to get on, but once they are on it is a DREAM! I had my Sonicare toothbrush for about a year and it would get so much mold in it.  When I went to buy my husband one I saw these recommended on Amazon, they are totally worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed that the Sonic Seal is made of a material that tears very easily.  Only one of the three made it onto the head of the toothbrush.  The idea is fantastic but the material needs to be more durable.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how much I hated taking apart my toothbrush and scrubbing it with soap a couple times a week.  But if I didn&#x27;t it got smelly with disgusting slime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I invested in this prophylactic.  These are not easy to get on, but once it&#x27;s on and covering both seams where gunk leaks into the chamber in the handle, I can leave it on until it&#x27;s time to change the head.  I just changed one this morning that had been on almost 4 months, and there was NOTHING inside the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Instant Order Update says I purchased these in Jan of 2011, so it has lasted over a year and still going strong.  Very much worth it to not have to clean out the handle every few days.</li>
            <li> Wish these seals were around years ago when I first began using Sonicare brushes. The seals a a very tight fit, a little difficult to get on, but they really, really do the job they are supposed to do.  They are a must have for E series brushes.</li>
            <li> Like many others, I love my Sonicare for how it cleans my teeth, but I don&#x27;t like how the air vents encourage muck to grow between the handle and brush assembly, which is much closer to my mouth than I want muck growing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little plastic thing creates an air-tight seal between handle and brush, and prevents the muck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside is that it takes some effort to pull it into place, in part because it does create an air-tight seal. The upside is that three months later, when it is time to replace the brush, everything is clean and muck-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This simple product fills such a clear need that I have to give it five stars.</li>
            <li> I was sick and tired of soaking our two Sonicares in bleach periodically to remove the mold that forms in the inside.  Why Sonicare doesn&#x27;t use an O ring is beyond me.  But this silicone sleeve is working nicely and we can practice safe brushing.</li>
            <li> I have bought these multiple times! I was sick of the inside of my Sonicare Essence getting tons of bacteria on the inside of it from water leaking in. I had to clean it every time I brushed my teeth. I have used sonic seal for over a year. I put a new one on every time I replace the toothbrush head. I have never had one tear, so I could even reuse them. They keep all the water out and I&#x27;m not cleaning my toothbrush all the time! I do wish they came in just clear, but the colors are nice if you have 2 toothbrushes. Buy this product!</li>
            <li> I have no problem with these (just wish they sold one at a time instead of three).  But they keep the gunk out of my toothbrush and keep it clean and running like new. So I&#x27;m happy :)</li>
            <li> Hated the way I had to clean out the toothbrush heads every couple of weeks.  Inside would build up the black moldy looking stuff.  Gross!  This thing complete eliminates all that.  A little cumbersome to screw the head on and off the sonicare, but well worth the effort.</li>
            <li> My toothbrush doesn&#x27;t accumulate mold under the brush head anymore. The only moderately annoying thing is that you can&#x27;t change brush heads easily. So if you and another person share a handle and just swap out the heads, this won&#x27;t work for you. But if you&#x27;re swapping out heads all the time, it&#x27;s just as easy to rise it off with soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, it&#x27;s perfect. I don&#x27;t have to worry about the mold.</li>
            <li> TIGHT on the toothbrush. Now i no longer have to clean my tooth brush after every use. When it comes time to replace the brush it is nice and dry inside the unit. Well worth the price</li>
            <li> They were a little hard to put on, but once I got the cover on I noticed an immediate difference in the toothbrush and realized I wont need to be replacing the brush heads nearly as frequently now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these for anyone who has a Sonicare e series brush, it&#x27;ll save you money (from replacing brush heads more frequently due to mold)</li>
            <li> These seals for the Sonicare heads are great.  Until I bought these, I was constantly having to clean yucky stuff out of the inside of the head.  The seal prevents this and lasts forever.  I put a dab of cornstarch on the inside and shake it around, and I have no problem getting the seal onto the head.</li>
            <li> I hated how yucky our Sonic toothbrushes would get. Cleaning them was just plain Gross!! I found these covers before, but the price was RIDICULOUS!! When I saw these were a great price here on Amazon, I bought them for stocking stuffers for the whole family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of caution: They are thin, so be very careful putting them on so they do not tear in the process. Once they are on, they are wonderful!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our toothbrushes are easy to keep clean!</li>
            <li> I have always had to clean around my brush head and handle!  No more!  This product seals the crevices where the toothpaste, water and saliva get into!  It&#x27;s so much nicer this way!&lt;br /&gt;I will say it makes taking it apart for travel a bit less easy but t can still be done.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice that you can wash and reuse the covers! A very cleaver invention!</li>
            <li> This is the best thing invented since the power toothbrush. Do NOT use your Sonicare without one! They are not difficult to put on and by using one you&#x27;ll save a fortune by making your toothbrush heads last longer. No more icky mold.</li>
            <li> Works great.  These guards work as advertised, no more gunk.  The glow in the dark catches me off guard once in a while still.</li>
            <li> My dog and every other dog I have encountered with these love them.  They have a bit of a chew yet are soft enough for my dentally challenged old girl.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and works great - just as advertised.  Really protects our expensive Rechargeable Toothbrush from unnecessary cleaning and corrosion.</li>
            <li> Difficult to put on the toothbrush head and flimsy - ripped while trying to put it on so I couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  My electric toothbrush is free of all the toothpaste &#x27;gunk&#x27; that ends up inside, and all over it.  More options and better pricing missing needed.</li>
            <li> I had some problems with mold growing inside my toothbrush.  I thought this product might help.  It takes some work to wiggle it on your toothbrush, but I am still using my original one from two years ago.  I have replaced the head several times.  The sleeve seems to keep out the water well.  I have almost nothing inside my toothbrush when I unscrew it for travel.  Good product.</li>
            <li> Very functional.  Lower quality than original.  My first attempt on new order broke one.  Kids like the glow in the dark.</li>
            <li> I just happened to run across these while online looking for replacement heads.  I am a messy tooth-brusher and my Sonicare would often mold. I would have to take the head off each time I used it and wipe it out.  This is a lifesaver!  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> These things are the consistancy of your average condom, hence the difficulty putting them on the toothbrush. However, they DO WORK! My toothbrush no longer has that icky black grime growing inside where the parts screw together.</li>
            <li> Works great and the price was right. I can&#x27;t see any reason why I can&#x27;t recommend these. No more gunk in my brush.</li>
            <li> The seals are hard to put on, but they work well. I hate cleaning the brush heads, so this is a must-have for me.</li>
            <li> Difficult to put on or take off. Does not seal the head therefore it now traps more gunk than before.Overpriced flimsy product that does not work.</li>
            <li> Great! This is a good item and it will be use for a long time to come.  I like it.</li>
            <li> These definitely work. I hated that losing battle against the black scum buildup inside Sonicare brushes. I just changed my brush head after one year (!), and the inside of the base was pristine.&lt;br /&gt;I was careful to follow others&#x27; suggestions regarding the cornstarch, and it didn&#x27;t tear, although I had to be super careful (it is a very tight fit and difficult to put on).  I agree the price is high, but it saves time not having to clean the inside of the brush head regularly!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame that you need a product like this. For the price of the Sonicare system, and brushes, Philips should figure out a way to seal up the system in the design rather than requiring the use of an extra product. This seals are crazy expensive for what they are but they do work and they keep the gunk out of the inside of the toothbrush head. They&#x27;re kind of a pain to get on. So, once on, you don&#x27;t want to remove them. This pretty much prevents you from disassembling the brush/base for traveling.</li>
            <li> This product works well - I have ordered it twice. But it seems to be made more flimsily now, and is very difficult to get onto the toothbrush. The order includes a package of three covers, but in trying to get them onto the sonicare, the first two actually ripped apart. I was able to make the third one work, and it will do a fine job I&#x27;m sure. But these covers do have a limited lifespan. Eventually the mold will creep in and grow under them. I was exceptionally disappointed that the new version is so flimsy that it is all too easy to destroy it while trying to put it on the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Waste of your money. This makes things worst than advertised. Don&#x27;t even bother looking at this page and reading these words.</li>
            <li> These are such a great buy if you have any type of electric toothbrush.  Prevents water and toothpaste from getting into the creases of the toothbrush and forming a gross film.  Makes for easy rinsing off and cleaning.  It&#x27;s a bit difficult to put on and take off but once it&#x27;s on, it&#x27;s on for good.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have used the Sonicare toothbrush for years, at the advice of my dentist.  I love it, and have actually seen a huge improvement in the condition of my gums.  My only gripe has been the way the handle collects water and the disgusting black and green slime that forms inside the handle.  I saw these a couple of years ago and put them on all the Sonicare units in my house - YAHOO!  They work great!  We jokingly call them toothbrush condoms.  They are kind of hard to put on (very tight-fitting), but completely keep the moisture out of the handle for months!  This purchase was for a family member who also was disgusted by the nastiness of the handles.  She is delighted, as well!</li>
            <li> I think this product is so simple, yet so effective! I always had a problem with toothpaste traveling down the handle and getting into the &amp;#34;neck&amp;#34; of my toothbrush and it was hard to clean. Now with my new neck cover I don&#x27;t have that problem anymore. I would highly recommend this product. It&#x27;s very easy to just slip over the bristles and tug down over the neck of the brush head. I would definitely recommend buying from this seller. Product came quickly and was very easy to use. Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, this actually works.  I had stopped using my sonicare due to the grossness that kept growing under the head.  Even though I would clean it often, it continued growing mold.  I bought these as a last ditch effort and I was surprised at how great this simple idea worked.  They are a little tricky to put on, but they fit tight and work perfectly.  I just checked it before writing this review and it is still gross-free.  I have not cleaned it once since I put it on a couple months ago.  FYI, I keep my sonicare in the shower at all timesâ€¦.pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> Having read reviews of the ick and grime that builds up on the Sonicare, I purchased these at the same time I ordered our toothbrushes.  We&#x27;ve had no gross build-up, so I guess they do their job.  I found them easy to put onto the toothbrush, though I don&#x27;t think they could be put on and off multiple times without breaking.  I only wish they came in more colors.</li>
            <li> This is an incredibly brilliant idea! I have struggled for the last several years with how to keep the inside of the toothbrush head clean and this completely solves this issue. I wish I had seen these sooner!!</li>
            <li> I love this and will continue to purchase this product because it keeps the water out.I am not disappointed !!</li>
            <li> The instrcutions that come with this are:&lt;br /&gt;1. Clean and dry toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;2. Pull the Sonic Seal over brush&lt;br /&gt;3. Align in the handle groove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good thing there are three in the pack as two of them tore pulling as gently as I could. Very thin material and totally not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Everyone in my family use sonicare and I am sick of the water go inside and germs grow.  Thoght this is good solution.  It is difficult to put it on and ripped right the way.  Way to waste your money.  Good idea but terrible design!!</li>
            <li> These are a really good idea, but much too expensive. Of the 3, one ripped while trying to put it on.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest to skip these and buy some rubber gloves at a dollar store, cut the fingers off and use that.</li>
            <li> Works well. Little hard to put it onto the brush head.I put it on all my Sonicare brushes. Colors are nice too.</li>
            <li> If you have a Sonic tooth brush then you are familiar with the black goo that seems to accumulate under the brush cover- icky!&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I had to take our brushes apart every time we used it let it dry so that gook wouldn&#x27;t return. Then we tried the Sonic seal booties and now even after 3 months when I change the brush head it&#x27;s still dry underneath and no goo!&lt;br /&gt;If you have a Sonic tooth brush you should give these a try. It&#x27;s a little challenging to put them on (try rolling them on like a sock) but it is worth the time. I reuse them a few times but give them a few hours soak in a weak bleach solution to sanitize them between uses.</li>
            <li> When you look at the item, your first thought might be &amp;#34;a condom for my toothbrush?!?&amp;#34;  It certainly does look like that.  And in a way, it WORKS like that only in reverse.  The Sonic Seal prevents toothpaste, saliva, and anything else from getting into the crack between the brush and the attachment to the motor.  If you own a Sonicare E-series toothbrush and have replaced the head at least once, you probably found a gross mess under the head.  The Sonic Seal prevents this effectively and one Sonic Seal lasts the entire life of the replaceable toothbrush head.  Comes in a package of three, just like the Sonicare replacement heads. If you are VERY careful installing and removing these, you can make one of the Sonic Seals last for three or four Sonicare brush heads.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have used sonicare toothbrushes since the 1990s. I have NEVER had any gunk or slime inside the handle of my&lt;br /&gt;brush simply because it&#x27;s obvious to me that it isn&#x27;t leak proof.  After brushing, I  rinse the brush and dry it with a paper towel.  I don&#x27;t rinse the handle because I don&#x27;t slobber toothpaste all over it but is wiped with the paper towel.  My husband  rinses his whole handle and brush and probably doesn&#x27;t wipe it off very well.  It would be great if they would make the connection waterproof but they probably won&#x27;t.  So  maybe it&#x27;s a good idea to take better care of your $100 toothbrush.</li>
            <li> These are terrific, but one tore as I was putting it on, which made me sad.  Since they are fragile, maybe adding an extra one in case of tearing would be a nice step?</li>
            <li> These little seals do an awesome job of keeping the head and handle clean--no need to detach every time you brush!  Would highly recommend this to all Sonic-care users!  When I read a previous review and their satisfaction--I just had to try them.  This is a great add-on to a superb Sonic product!  Great idea! Product delivery was right on time, too.</li>
            <li> [...]  Only $9.99 for three plus small S&amp;H  --    I too have the black gunk problem, didn&#x27;t realize it until changing the brush head. I had noticed an awful odor before then and was getting sore throats. Now I know why!!</li>
            <li> Considering buying these seal covers for Sonicare but completely turned off by statement on site: &amp;#34;Removing it daily will be a pain in the you know what.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;This is how people express themselves now because this is what they hear.  It is vulgar and completely out of place especially in business advertising!</li>
            <li> Did exactly what I wanted and kept water, etc. from getting into the cracks and crevices on my electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve had a sonicare, you undoubtedly know that changing heads for the first time can be a fright of moldy slime from water that&#x27;s crept between the body and the head, which may lead one to constantly clean and dry that area for fear of a nasty moldy/slimy surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These silicone sonicare seals keep the area between the body and the head dry, so it&#x27;s always clean (clear of said scary surprises).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, these glow in the dark!!!</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t inexpensive but it&#x27;s exactly what it represents itself to be and it does the job. I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to put on. It wrinkles and when you pull to straighten it out, it tears. Save your money.</li>
            <li> Really, they glow. Oh, they also do a great job of keeping water and other junk out of the inner compartment where the magnets do their magic. Using these eliminates the extra removal and cleaning that prevents mold from growing when junk does get inside the threading or the top connection of the brush head connection.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended and pretty easy to put on with a little water to help.</li>
