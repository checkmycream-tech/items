            <li>/&gt;Always get the perfect dimple in your tie, with no fuss.  </li>
            <li>I get asked all the time how my ties knots are always perfect.  </li>
            <li>so it looks perfect every time I won&#x27;t wear a tie without it</li>
            <li>Everything was perfect, the communication, speed of delivery, and the quality as well.</li>
            <li>I used to be jealous of President Obama&#x27;s dimple in his ties, but now my dimple looks just as good!</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t very good at making your own dimple, this product is perfect for you.</li>
            <li>Dimple Clip works great.</li>
            <li>You can dimple these ties without clip; they still look great with clip.</li>
            <li>Great idea</li>
            <li>I had ordered a pack of Dimple clips and was very impressed with how easy they were to use and how good it made my tie look.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and makes beautiful</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I got the perfect dimple the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Great product and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Nice to find a product that does what it was meant to do.</li>
            <li>No instructions of any kind are included with the shipment.</li>
            <li>stick with making my own dimple</li>
            <li>The clip works great, and if it was priced appropriate for what it is it would easily be a 5 star.</li>
            <li>I paid $12.95 for 3 plastic clips that are probably worth $.25 each, but they do the job, and make me look great, so I&#x27;ll still give the 4 star since I knew what I was buying when I bought them.</li>
            <li>Once you notice who has a dimple in their tie, you won&#x27;t be able to stop looking for it.</li>
            <li>Not to say they didn&#x27;t work, just took a bit more effort.</li>
            <li>not even sure what im supposed to do with them.</li>
            <li>Would love to&lt;br /&gt;see</li>
            <li>there was an extra free box with my order!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Good product, makes tie look crisp.</li>
            <li>Not an easy product to use.</li>
            <li>It is also great having multiple clips in one order because they can be easy to lose.</li>
            <li>The box that the dimple clip arrived in was worth more than the dimple clip.</li>
            <li>However, if your concerned the dimple might not hold, the clip would fit the bill.</li>
            <li>you get a fantastic looking tie</li>
            <li>This allows me to use/buy regular ties and still have a great looking knot.</li>
            <li>I use a full Windsor knot</li>
            <li>This not only makes creating a dimple easy, but it makes maintaining a nice, straight, and centered dimple throughout the day easy.</li>
            <li>You need to already know how to form a dimple naturally, which kind of negates the purpose of this product.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I&#x27;ve found the clip to be useful for holding my dimple in place throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Easy to use clip makes you look like you can tie a tie much better than you actually can.  </li>
            <li>These things are really cool, and the packaging was pretty neat as well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s nice when a simple product lives up to its advertising.</li>
            <li>I just received my first set of dimple clips and tried them out for the first time.  </li>
            <li>If tied properly, a knot without this product looks much better.  </li>
            <li>I have used them on several new silk ties that I recently purchased and they work great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, once mastered, they work very well.</li>
            <li>for the price that i paid I expected a much better product.</li>
            <li>Makes it easy to make and keep a dimple under the knot perfectly - as long as the tie is on.</li>
            <li>Not bad, but actually less useful or practical than it</li>
            <li>/&gt;It looks great with a Pratt knot with ties at least 4 inches wide.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping, even sent an extra set to help promote the product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, after figuring out how to utilize the clip, I learned dimple my tie naturally.  </li>
            <li>Wow, just the help</li>
            <li>I think my ties are too thick for the clip, I can get it on the tie and slip it under the bridge, but it always pops off and makes more of a problem then it fixes.</li>
            <li>Some people comment but not sure what is different only it looks better.</li>
            <li>I have a feeling it might work better with thin, lightweight ties or something.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll</li>
            <li>Makes less expensive ties look good.</li>

            <li> Easy to use clip makes you look like you can tie a tie much better than you actually can.  Comes with 3 clips although they are reuseable and you only need one.  Once you notice who has a dimple in their tie, you won&#x27;t be able to stop looking for it.</li>
            <li> I wasted time and money on this purchase.  The box that the dimple clip arrived in was worth more than the dimple clip.</li>
            <li> These things are really cool, and the packaging was pretty neat as well.  My wife told me I looked like Ron Burgundy, LOLOLOLOL.  These things rock.</li>
            <li> Will not work with ties that have any thickness.  A total waste of money, no doubt.  I threw them away.</li>
            <li> I am in the military and I had a \\&quot;Dress Blue\\&quot; Inspection a few months back. I had ordered a pack of Dimple clips and was very impressed with how easy they were to use and how good it made my tie look. After reading the negative reviews I tried it to see if it would work as well on my civilian ties and they seem to work just as well, if not better. It is also great having multiple clips in one order because they can be easy to lose.</li>
            <li> I have used them on several new silk ties that I recently purchased and they work great. Nice to find a product that does what it was meant to do.</li>
            <li> Dimple Clip works great. Quality handmade ties do not need this clip. You can dimple these ties without clip; they still look great with clip. Less expensive ties NEED the Dimple Clip. Makes less expensive ties look good.</li>
            <li> Does the job as intended. Makes it easy to make and keep a dimple under the knot perfectly - as long as the tie is on. Good product.</li>
            <li> The clip works great, and if it was priced appropriate for what it is it would easily be a 5 star. I paid $12.95 for 3 plastic clips that are probably worth $.25 each, but they do the job, and make me look great, so I&#x27;ll still give the 4 star since I knew what I was buying when I bought them.</li>
            <li> I initially had trouble making these things work, but after viewing an online demo it became much easier. No instructions of any kind are included with the shipment. They were easier to install on some ties, less so on others. I had the most trouble with the DC on the Retreez woven microfiber ties and really thick silk ties. Not to say they didn&#x27;t work, just took a bit more effort. Once installation is mastered, they do indeed make, or improve, any dimple. I can attest... practice helps!&lt;br /&gt;Again, once mastered, they work very well.</li>
            <li> there are no instructions whats so ever. received 3 clips in a bottle. not even sure what im supposed to do with them. for the price that i paid I expected a much better product.</li>
            <li> I just received my first set of dimple clips and tried them out for the first time.  Very easy to use and makes beautiful dimples.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice when a simple product lives up to its advertising.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping, even sent an extra set to help promote the product.&lt;br /&gt;Always get the perfect dimple in your tie, with no fuss.  Would love to&lt;br /&gt;see the product in retail stores.  I would recommend this without a&lt;br /&gt;doubt and hope sells continue to grow for the \\&quot;Dimple Clip\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Great product and easy to use. I used to be jealous of President Obama&#x27;s dimple in his ties, but now my dimple looks just as good!</li>
            <li> This product do not serve any purpose.  In my opinion, you don&#x27;t need to use it on your tie at all.  — Useless.</li>
            <li> This not only makes creating a dimple easy, but it makes maintaining a nice, straight, and centered dimple throughout the day easy.</li>
            <li> Not bad, but actually less useful or practical than it sounded!&lt;br /&gt;Does not work well with all tie fabrics and sizes.</li>
            <li> Purchased the dimple clip to spruce up my tie look.  However, after figuring out how to utilize the clip, I learned dimple my tie naturally.  No clip needed.  However, if your concerned the dimple might not hold, the clip would fit the bill.</li>
            <li> Not an easy product to use.</li>
            <li> My dimple clips just arrived. I ran to the mirror to give it a try; Wow, just the help I needed.&lt;br /&gt;Plus there was an extra free box with my order!!!!!! I will be telling all my friends and even&lt;br /&gt;giving a few away, thanks to you!&lt;br /&gt;Bob</li>
            <li> It takes some practice, but once you get the knack of it you get a fantastic looking tie knot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For it to work, before you fasten your tie to your collar, place your index finger firmly in the middle of the tie about half an inch under the knot and squeeze the tie with your thumb and middle finger to make it thin. Place the clip in the dimple above your fingers and fasten the tie to the collar. The clip should be hidden under your knot. Use a mirror!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks great with a Pratt knot with ties at least 4 inches wide.</li>
            <li> Small item that makes a big different with my ties</li>
            <li> Not as practical as taking an extra minute to tie the knot correctly.  Used the product then compared to a knot that I took my time preparing.  If tied properly, a knot without this product looks much better.  Will give them away.</li>
            <li> Coolest thing ever.. I get asked all the time how my ties knots are always perfect.  I use a full Windsor knot so it looks perfect every time I won&#x27;t wear a tie without it</li>
            <li> Good product, makes tie look crisp.</li>
            <li> This product is a bit misleading. It will not give your tie a dimple where there wasn&#x27;t one before. You need to already know how to form a dimple naturally, which kind of negates the purpose of this product.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I&#x27;ve found the clip to be useful for holding my dimple in place throughout the day. No more adjusting in the bathroom!</li>
            <li> Such a small plastic device that can add so much class and that little bit extra to a tie and suit. Some people comment but not sure what is different only it looks better.</li>
            <li> I think my ties are too thick for the clip, I can get it on the tie and slip it under the bridge, but it always pops off and makes more of a problem then it fixes. I have a feeling it might work better with thin, lightweight ties or something.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick with making my own dimple</li>
            <li> It does not work at all... Great idea bad product tried it before and after tiring the tie. It just doesn&#x27;t deliver</li>
            <li> I got the perfect dimple the very first time I used it. If you aren&#x27;t very good at making your own dimple, this product is perfect for you. I love it!</li>
            <li> Everything was perfect, the communication, speed of delivery, and the quality as well. Thank you</li>
            <li> My height puts me between regular and long ties. This allows me to use/buy regular ties and still have a great looking knot. I&#x27;m grateful.</li>
