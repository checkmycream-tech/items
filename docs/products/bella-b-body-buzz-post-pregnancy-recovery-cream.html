            <li> but after using it for just two and a half weeks twice a day</li>
            <li> and i feel like my cellulite is less and less.</li>
            <li> I have it on right now, and I need to shower it off because it smells so bad.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks, not sure it does anything to my stretch mark or not though.</li>
            <li> Those cottage cheese looking marks was thinning out and fading away as well as those ugly red or purple lines on legs and belly.</li>
            <li> After my first baby I didn&#x27;t use anything and my stomach ended up looking horrible.</li>
            <li> then, one cannot help wondering, why is it so expensive .</li>
            <li> and i was very skeptical of purchasing this product</li>
            <li> For me combining the two products together help speed up the process of fading out all those ugly marks.  </li>

            <li> great smell and noticing results after 1 week post partum. very natural and organic ingredients. i will definitely order more bella b body buzz products! &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> Pretty good product. Like the feel of it on my skin but did not work on what I needed it for very well.</li>
            <li> I ordered the bella b body buzz- post pregnancy recovery cream and also the body buzz-stretch mark belly cream and let me tell you it works. If you are a women suffering with cellulite because of pregnancy and stretch marks this is the product. I am a black women and i was very skeptical of purchasing this product but after using it for just two and a half weeks twice a day faithfully I noticed the difference. Those cottage cheese looking marks was thinning out and fading away as well as those ugly red or purple lines on legs and belly. My skin started getting the firmness back and looking tighter. For me combining the two products together help speed up the process of fading out all those ugly marks.  It will be three weeks for me in a couple of days and all my marks are almost completely gone. It may not work for all skin types but it is working for me. Even  the stretch marks i had before pregnancy is fading away. And i forgot to mention if you order this product especially the bella belly cream order two because its a 4oz tube and if you use it twice a day faithfully one tube will not be enough. It will go quick. I can say i am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have been using this religiously and have noticed no difference. It smells good at least.</li>
            <li> Waiting to use it until after I have the baby. I do really enjoy the body butter and hope I&#x27;ll enjoy this as well.</li>
            <li> My  allergist recommended this product for my sensitive skin and eczema, it works wonders I love it and I recommended it to all my friends!</li>
            <li> Arrived in good time and was quality. Got it as a gift for my sister for Christmas and I was very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I dont know if its made a difference on my 4 months post oartum bod but its a nice lotion.</li>
            <li> Feels really nice on the skin and has a very pleasant scent... does it help cellulite, stretch marks or any post-partum skin conditions? Well, I haven&#x27;t seen any difference at all.&lt;br /&gt;I love that it&#x27;s an all natural product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve repurchased this cream, it&#x27;s my fourth tube!! I like the texture and smell, but i use it together with Clarins and i feel like my cellulite is less and less. However, regular exercise needed!!</li>
            <li> This arrived today, I ordered two, because the ratings were so positive. I excitedly tried out one of the bottles and it smelled foul. It says fresh scent, but both of my bottles must have been expired. (Theres no exp. Date on the bottles, I looked.) I have it on right now, and I need to shower it off because it smells so bad. I wish I would have gotten newer bottles , but I guess I shouldve known better , it was on sale for a very good deal.</li>
            <li> This product is great. Gentle and light enough to use on your entire body. Would definitely recommend to anyone, preggo or not.</li>
            <li> As other reviews say, it smells really good. I have been using it for a few weeks, not sure it does anything to my stretch mark or not though. bottom line, it is a good smell body lotion. then, one cannot help wondering, why is it so expensive .</li>
            <li> After my first baby I didn&#x27;t use anything and my stomach ended up looking horrible. So after my second baby I decided to try Bella B and it has really shrunk my belly in just one month. I love getting compliments about how much thinner I look.</li>
            <li> I bought this several other Bella B products as a gift for my sister-in-law; she has told me several times how much she has been using it and loves the stuff.</li>
            <li> Used it and didnt see any results.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff...it is one of my postpartum staples and HIGHLY recommended to any of you out there that are pregnant or recently postpartum. I buy it for everyone I know that is pregnant. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a difference after 2 purchases of the product. I used this religiously twice a day and even bought a second bottle, I saw no difference at all. I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> In general this is the product is good, I want to use after that I will buy again, thank you for the goods, see you later</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it every day!  I will be reordering it!  I use on my tummy, thighs, and butt!!  it has really helped me with cellulite from my pregnancy!!  I really love all the body buzz products!</li>
            <li> Good product. It seems to have the best results if used 2 or more times a day.</li>
