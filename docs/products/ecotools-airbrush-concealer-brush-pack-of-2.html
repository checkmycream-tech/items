            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>Okay concealer brush.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s eco-friendly and cruelty-free.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better than the $30 concealer brush I got from Sephora.</li>

            <li>I know this says concealer brush, but I love it for a mineral eyeshadow brush</li>
            <li>Love this for eye shadow.</li>
            <li>Only needed one, but the price was too good to pass up!</li>
            <li>Two great brushes for a very low price would make one think that they may be just ok.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use--there&#x27;s no shedding of the hairs.</li>
            <li>I also appreciate that these are cruelty free - no need for any animal to suffer for my make up.  </li>
            <li>the item is great, but I only received one when the listing is saying there will be two</li>
            <li>but it is so friendly i do recommnde this brush</li>
            <li>this is a very nice blending brush, bristles are very soft and it&#x27;s eco friendly but for how much it cost and for it to completley fall apart after you wash</li>
            <li>Items arrived quickly and as detailed in the photo.</li>
            <li>These are full size brushes.  </li>
            <li>I actually recommend you to buy all of the eco-tools brushes because they are really good</li>
            <li>Two brushes for $7.98 not bad.</li>
            <li>I wash them once a month with coconut oil and BAM like new!  :)</li>
            <li>I was kind of expecting these brushes to be cheap, given the low price.  </li>
            <li>They are super soft and make applying concealer super easy!</li>
            <li>I like these concealer brushes very much!</li>
            <li>Anyone looking for a conceler brush look no further, they fact that they come in a 2 pack makes it even better!</li>
            <li>You can really get in close, like under eyes and around brows, to precisely apply concealer or foundation</li>
            <li>I have pretty dark circles under my eyes, and this brush works great at concealing them.</li>
            <li>the bristles all came right out in a clump.  </li>
            <li>Good brush for the purpose, no loose brushes at all and very soft and gentle.  </li>
            <li>i realy like to use this brush over and over it give you smooth and natural look</li>
            <li>needless to say, these are the best brushes ever!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend you to buy the eco-tools brush for a couple more bucks and you will not regret it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of concealer brushes, and many of the large ones are tricky around the eye area.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have another brush to compare it to, but it seems to be very high quality</li>
            <li>They seem to be very durable, functional, affordable brushes.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very dense, and it applies concealer very evenly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it with both a heavier and a lighter concealer, and it works very well with both.</li>
            <li>I really do like this brush.  </li>
            <li>With this brush I can cover up my dark circles better than before</li>
            <li>The hairs are soft and applies consistently</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I lost my concealer brush, but was so happy to find a pack of two for a reasonable price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It also makes the concealer look very natural!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Works much better as a concealer brush than the traditional flat concealer brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had them for nearly a year, and they are holding up very well.  </li>
            <li>I have been using elf brushes before because I was new to makeup</li>
            <li>As with any of the EcoTools brushes, the brush is very soft but sturdy.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li>Amazingly seamless application!</li>
            <li>I am actually a fan of this brand but after having a clump of bristles wind up in my fingers while all I was doing was gently working the body wash through them, I will never purchase this particular brush again.</li>
            <li>I use concealer underneath my eyes and wanted a brush that was really soft.  </li>
            <li>This brush is soft, blends well, and applies concealer seamlessly.</li>
            <li>Bristles are soft</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t really work for me because the bristles were really short, so</li>
            <li>This brush is soft, dense and well-built.  </li>
            <li>Eyeshadow goes on smooth and the shape allows for blending in small areas.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what I expected when applying concealer.  </li>
            <li>Both brushes are very soft, blend very very well, don&#x27;t shed, and feels gentle on my delicate undereye area.  </li>
            <li>I use Bare Minerals for makeup and was using their brushes up until I discovered Ecotools.  </li>
            <li>The concealer brushes are super soft, don&#x27;t shed at all, and have a thick densely bristled head.  </li>

            <li> I use Bare Minerals for makeup and was using their brushes up until I discovered Ecotools.  </li>
            <li> The concealer brushes are super soft, don&#x27;t shed at all, and have a thick densely bristled head.  </li>
            <li> I wash these regularly and have not yet had a single hair shed from them.  </li>
            <li> up.&lt;br /&gt;The brush head is a little too big for my tiny acne scars.</li>
            <li> The brushes from Bare Minerals are just too harsh on my skin; I can feel the bristles jabbing at me when I put my makeup on.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are a little larger and rounder than another Ecotools concealer brush I bought long ago, so the only reason I gave 4 not 5 stars is if you need to cover a small area you may want to use a sightly smaller brush head.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re just supposed to wet the bristles</li>
            <li> I have other EcoTools brushes and they work just as expected.  </li>
            <li> Bought this and other brushes probably 4-5 years ago....</li>
            <li> (always point brush down while wet), wash with soap, and rinse.</li>
            <li> I have really dark under-eye circles</li>
            <li> and I use less product.</li>
            <li> Not true.</li>
            <li> I wash this brush the same way as all my other brushes, with baby shampoo &amp; cold water (or alcohol wipes when I travel if they are synthetic) and this was the only brush from EcoTools that did not hold up.</li>

            <li> Eco tools are wonderful natural products and this brush is no exception.  it is a good size brush to use for your concealer.  However, it is advertised as a Pack of 2 and I only received one!  However, Amazon Customer Service was out of stock so they could not send a second brush but gave me credit on the undelivered product.  If you order - make sure you get both brushes.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, works great for under eye concealer, price was great, since it came as a 2 pack.  Very satisfied.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I use Bare Minerals for makeup and was using their brushes up until I discovered Ecotools.  The brushes from Bare Minerals are just too harsh on my skin; I can feel the bristles jabbing at me when I put my makeup on.  I use concealer underneath my eyes and wanted a brush that was really soft.  I bought an Ecotools kit from a makeup store and I found what I was looking for.  Unfortunately, I lost my concealer brush, but was so happy to find a pack of two for a reasonable price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The concealer brushes are super soft, don&#x27;t shed at all, and have a thick densely bristled head.  They clean up very easily, hold their shape, and they are a perfect size to blend concealer for a natural finish.  You can really get in close, like under eyes and around brows, to precisely apply concealer or foundation (although I recommend the larger Ecotools foundation brush for all over  foundation which is also a terrific brush).  The brushes are a little larger and rounder than another Ecotools concealer brush I bought long ago, so the only reason I gave 4 not 5 stars is if you need to cover a small area you may want to use a sightly smaller brush head.  I also appreciate that these are cruelty free - no need for any animal to suffer for my make up.  So overall these are great brushes, you get 2 at a great price, and should be a staple in any cosmetic collection.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time and in good condition.  Always will buy their products.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and same price as in the drug store except I don&#x27;t have to step out to buy it. It does a great job with the concealer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Eco Tools for quite some time and I love all their makeup brushes. They clean beautifully and the fibers stay put.  The concealer brush smooths out the makeup. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> great brush ultra soft ultra smooth great for concealer and eyeshadow and all around eye care i realy like to use this brush over and over it give you smooth and natural look no comes out hair even its a recycoble but it is so friendly i do recommnde this brush great helpfull and eye care ********</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly satisfied with both the brand and this set of brushes. It&#x27;s good for both concealer and eyeshadow. They seem to be very durable, functional, affordable brushes. Items arrived quickly and as detailed in the photo. Pleased.</li>
            <li> The brush is great but don&#x27;t get mislead by the description. There is no (Pack of 2). You get one brush.</li>
            <li> I like these concealer brushes very much! They are great quality &amp; easy to use. Anyone looking for a conceler brush look no further, they fact that they come in a 2 pack makes it even better!</li>
            <li> I love EcoTools and this brush is no exception! It&#x27;s perfect for applying under eye concealer (something I always seem to have a problem with.) This brush is soft, blends well, and applies concealer seamlessly. Love!</li>
            <li> Two great brushes for a very low price would make one think that they may be just ok. Not true. The are fantastic! Eyeshadow goes on smooth and the shape allows for blending in small areas. A must buy.</li>
            <li> The brush itself is great, but the ad says (pack of two)!  I only received one!!  Very disappointed in how they mislead by advertising.</li>
            <li> Blends my concealer great!</li>
            <li> Bought this and other brushes probably 4-5 years ago....needless to say, these are the best brushes ever! I still have all of them. Great brand!</li>
            <li> I was kind of expecting these brushes to be cheap, given the low price.  Instead, I got high-quality concealer brushes that can also be used to apply eyeshadow.  I wash these regularly and have not yet had a single hair shed from them.  Love these brushes!</li>
            <li> Love this brush. Feels very good on my skin. Works much better as a concealer brush than the traditional flat concealer brush. Has bamboo handle and the brush is probably 5 or 6 inches.</li>
            <li> Good brush for the purpose, no loose brushes at all and very soft and gentle.  Only needed one, but the price was too good to pass up!</li>
            <li> I like the brush very much, it applies and blends color very nicely. I recommend it as a basic tools for makeup application.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product since it is \\&quot;green\\&quot; that is the use of bamboo makes it planet frienddly!</li>
            <li> This came as a 2-pack, as advertised.  These are full size brushes.  I don&#x27;t use them for concealer; instead, I use them for eye shadow.  Either way...great brushes!</li>
            <li> I struggled to use these for concealer but found that they make great blending brushes for eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> These are the best concealer brushes I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! The bristles are very dense, and it applies concealer very evenly. I don&#x27;t have another brush to compare it to, but it seems to be very high quality and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Is because when you wash it the BRISTLES COME OUT BY THE LOAD.&lt;br /&gt;The last one I had I didn&#x27;t wash it for awhile but desided to because it was dirty. I let it soak in my sink with warm water and soap for awhile then when I took it out i squeezed it a bit to get excess water out and make up and the brsitles all came out!&lt;br /&gt;Yes this is a very nice blending brush, bristles are very soft and it&#x27;s eco friendly but for how much it cost and for it to completley fall apart after you wash it?&lt;br /&gt;I have no choice though because I have tried soo many brushes and this is the best :/ so I just have to keep buying new ones every few months because I can&#x27;t risk leaving it dirty and getting all that filth on my face!</li>
            <li> Okay concealer brush. Good price. I need to wash it often though, because it cakes up and gets matted. Does the job.</li>
            <li> I swear by these! They are super soft and make applying concealer super easy! The result is smooth and perfect. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes at a reasonable price, and Excellent customer service from Seller, What America Buys. Bristles are soft Everything was promptly taken care of, and I do appreciate that Seller shipped item in a timely manner. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is a great concealer brush. I have pretty dark circles under my eyes, and this brush works great at concealing them. I&#x27;ve used it with both a heavier and a lighter concealer, and it works very well with both. I received 2 brushes, packaged separately. I love that it&#x27;s eco-friendly and cruelty-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed another reviewer stated the bristles came out after soaking the brush in soap and water, but any brush&#x27;s bristles would! You are never supposed to soak makeup brushes- it loosens the glue between the brushes and the tool. You&#x27;re just supposed to wet the bristles (always point brush down while wet), wash with soap, and rinse. Repeat for brushes that are heavily soiled or caked with makeup. I have washed this brush a few times and have never had issues with bristles coming out.</li>
            <li> I really do like this brush.  It does exactly what I expected when applying concealer.  I would truly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> the entire brush tip fell out in 2 months of use</li>
            <li> I have really dark under-eye circles and I always end up putting on a lot of concealer with my finger over this spot and I just look ridiculous in the end. With this brush I can cover up my dark circles better than before and I use less product. It also makes the concealer look very natural!  I also had this e.l.f. concealer brush and it didn&#x27;t really work for me because the bristles were really short, so it made the concealer look very uneven. I definitely recommend you to buy the eco-tools brush for a couple more bucks and you will not regret it. I actually recommend you to buy all of the eco-tools brushes because they are really good and they&#x27;re nice to the environment as well.</li>
            <li> Really nice brushes.  I&#x27;ve had them for nearly a year, and they are holding up very well.  I wash them once a month with coconut oil and BAM like new!  :)</li>
            <li> i would like to recommend it. great brush for airbrush. I also give this brush a ten. fits in any bag you carry</li>
            <li> This brush is soft, dense and well-built.  I like to use it to apply concealer on my undereye areas but it doubles as a good eye shadow blending brush as well.</li>
            <li> I use this for under eye concealing. It&#x27;s easy to use--there&#x27;s no shedding of the hairs. The hairs are soft and applies consistently</li>
            <li> I got a pack of two as it says.  Both brushes are very soft, blend very very well, don&#x27;t shed, and feels gentle on my delicate undereye area.  No complaints here</li>
            <li> Amazingly seamless application! Everyone should have this brush to apply their concealer flawlessly. I wash this brush the same way as all my other brushes, with baby shampoo &amp; cold water (or alcohol wipes when I travel if they are synthetic) and this was the only brush from EcoTools that did not hold up. Maybe a glitch at the factory? No worries, they are so affordable I bought the 2 pack on Amazon.</li>
            <li> As with any of the EcoTools brushes, the brush is very soft but sturdy.  This brush works great for concealer or setting powder for under the eye area!</li>
            <li> Better than the $30 concealer brush I got from Sephora. Perfect for liquid concealer under the eyes and also around the nose and chin. Dense, no shedding, great airbrushed finish, no caking, I can&#x27;t even tell I am wearing concealer. Plus it&#x27;s eco-friendly. Can&#x27;t say enough about this brush.</li>
            <li> I got the eco brushes today in the mail. I have been using elf brushes before because I was new to makeup and I didn’t want to spend a lot on brushes now starting out. So this is a step up for me. I like these brushes. The bristles are very soft. I am going to add more eco brushes to my collection since I am getting more into make up.&lt;br /&gt;The brush head is a little too big for my tiny acne scars. I intend to use it as a blending brush because the elf blending brush is crap. Two brushes for $7.98 not bad.</li>
            <li> great brush and nice price.</li>
            <li> the item is great, but I only received one when the listing is saying there will be two</li>
            <li> I know this says concealer brush, but I love it for a mineral eyeshadow brush</li>
            <li> Love this for eye shadow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of concealer brushes, and many of the large ones are tricky around the eye area.  This brush is perfect for those hard-to-reach areas.  I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Bought this one for cream concealer and didn&#x27;t actually worked on my under eyes. They do not blend well cream.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush at Ulta Beauty fewer than 12 months ago.  Here&#x27;s the thing, I do not wear makeup every day or even once per week.  So the number of times I have actually used this brush is probably fewer than 20.  After applying my makeup I wash my brushes in warm water and body wash with moisturizer.  The last time I washed the brush the bristles all came right out in a clump.  I was shocked.  I have other EcoTools brushes and they work just as expected.  I am actually a fan of this brand but after having a clump of bristles wind up in my fingers while all I was doing was gently working the body wash through them, I will never purchase this particular brush again.</li>
