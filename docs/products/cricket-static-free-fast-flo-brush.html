            <li>B0002Z8OKG Cricket Mini Fast Flo Static Free]]</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to use with a blow dryer to quickly dry my hair.  </li>
            <li>The $8 price is reasonable, the free shipping from Beauty Genesis makes it worth it!</li>
            <li>Very comfortable, soft grip handle.  </li>
            <li>Fast with free shipping....</li>
            <li>Only kind I use.</li>
            <li>Very well made!</li>
            <li>Other color choices would be nice, but I&#x27;ll deal with the color.</li>
            <li>They seem to be just as good in quality as the ones we&#x27;ve had in the past.  </li>
            <li>Nice that it now comes in all black for the men in the house.</li>
            <li>, which is the same brush only smaller, great for purses and vehicle consoles/glove compartments.</li>
            <li>Works very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I have long hair and it easily detangles it without breaking my hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Do still have a little static at times though.</li>
            <li>Then out of the blue I stumble across this listing and found my favorite brush.</li>
            <li>The brush I was sent is a nice brush but the one I received was probably a newer model because it was all black and not red like the model shown.  </li>
            <li>The tips on the brush are very gentle on my scalp and fragile hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve kept it in my headset drawer at work, and while all other brushes have had massive static problems from being in that drawer, this Cricket does the trick.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The red one works a lot better than the all black one I received.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get this one at about 1/2 the price of what I had paid previously in a salon.</li>
            <li>And so far, none of the little red ball tips have come off the bristles, which happens on most brushes.</li>
            <li>the red tip protector coating comes off very quickly leaving sharp edged teeth.  </li>
            <li>it was a replacement for an old one.  </li>
            <li>This is the closest one I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve hunted high and low.  </li>
            <li>I ordered one just to have one onhand because I have been using my first one for a few years.</li>
            <li>I have been buying new brushes a couple times a year, only to have the bristles disfigure due to heat from the blow-dryer.  </li>

            <li> I love this brush. No static!</li>
            <li> Brush is great simple easy design no frils just works and does its job bought this as a gift and the person uses it and loves it for the price they cant get any better</li>
            <li> Update Jan 2012: We still have this brush and use it daily. None (zero!) of the red ball tips have broken off. It&#x27;s a GREAT brush!  Needed a durable brush that would allow air to flow through during blow drying because we all have thick hair. Works nicely! Handle is rubberized for a good grip (it&#x27;s not thick or rounded which took a little bit to get used to, but not a problem), the plastic brush base is solid and well-constructed. And so far, none of the little red ball tips have come off the bristles, which happens on most brushes. I&#x27;m ordering 2 more so we don&#x27;t have to fight for it in the mornings! The $8 price is reasonable, the free shipping from Beauty Genesis makes it worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for the past year and a half, with no problems. It&#x27;s a very good brush, very well constructed, with a comfortable rubberized grip. Not the biggest fan of red, but hey, it&#x27;s a brush. I&#x27;ve kept it in my headset drawer at work, and while all other brushes have had massive static problems from being in that drawer, this Cricket does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter uses the [[ASIN:B0002Z8OKG Cricket Mini Fast Flo Static Free]], which is the same brush only smaller, great for purses and vehicle consoles/glove compartments. It&#x27;s the only vent brush that she will use, since the others tend to hurt and tear out bits of her very long hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush&lt;br /&gt;Works on my frizzy hair</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t trust the picture. The actual brush they send you is a turquoise monstrosity with giant bulbs on the end of each bristle, not at all like the photo shown for this product.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this brush for years.  Nice that it now comes in all black for the men in the house.</li>
            <li> Good sturdy brush. Works very well.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend.  Good&lt;br /&gt;Value for the money. Static free&lt;br /&gt;Works well with blow dryer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 3 of these over some years.  They are great except for the red tip protector coating comes off very quickly leaving sharp edged teeth.  If they would fix this issue the brush would be perfect.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both use this hair brush and like it very much…it is easy on the head and easy to clean too!  So glad we found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Only kind I use. Won&#x27;t tear your hair out.</li>
            <li> i was sent the wrong brush.  the brush i was sent has hard bristles and I dont use it</li>
            <li> Fast with free shipping....perfect. I had a brush just like it that wore out after many years of service. Was glad they still made them. This brush is the same great quality. Five star</li>
            <li> The brush I was sent is a nice brush but the one I received was probably a newer model because it was all black and not red like the model shown.  The red one works a lot better than the all black one I received. Still good quality though.  Arrived quickly and in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> Yup.  It&#x27;s a brush that is static free.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used these for years and they work well.  We bought 2 brushes to replace some that had worn out after several years.  They seem to be just as good in quality as the ones we&#x27;ve had in the past.  Really fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned lots of these.. I just keep going back to them. They must be great!</li>
            <li> My absolutely favorite for my fine flyaway hair!</li>
            <li> The one that arrived was the smaller black version and not the big Red one that was pictured.</li>
            <li> Been using this brand of brush for over 10 years. Would never buy another kind. Works great; doesn&#x27;t pull out your hair.</li>
            <li> Love this brush ----- it was a replacement for an old one.  It came with a black handle - but it&#x27;s the brush head that I wanted and was perfect.  Color doesn&#x27;t matter!!!</li>
            <li> Love this brush! Very well made! Do still have a little static at times though.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the good reviews on Amazon.  It exceeds my expectations!  Very comfortable, soft grip handle.  The tips on the brush are very gentle on my scalp and fragile hair.  I have long hair and it easily detangles it without breaking my hair.  It&#x27;s great to use with a blow dryer to quickly dry my hair.  I love it!</li>
            <li> On just happened to find this brush online. I ordered one just to have one onhand because I have been using my first one for a few years. I was excited to get this one at about 1/2 the price of what I had paid previously in a salon. I sent one to my daughter away at college also. It us very nice to use when i am blow drying my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been buying new brushes a couple times a year, only to have the bristles disfigure due to heat from the blow-dryer.  But no longer! This brush is a keeper!  I got the recommendation from a hair stylist.  And you can&#x27;t beat the price.  I will be replacing my travel brush as well.  Other color choices would be nice, but I&#x27;ll deal with the color.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush a decade ago, used it forever and then lost it. Since then I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of bushes because I forget who made this brush, but all the other brushes broke or were terrible. Then out of the blue I stumble across this listing and found my favorite brush. Having it again has been a dream. And my hair looks damn good after using it. Yeah I said it.</li>
            <li> I was trying to replace a brush I&#x27;ve had for 30 years.  I&#x27;ve hunted high and low.  This is the closest one I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> I have had one of these brushes for many years. The dog chewed the handle off. I thought I was out of luck. Amazon saved the day again</li>
