            <li>The head of the brush is extreamly soft, and they are very easy to clean as well.</li>
            <li>/highlighter brushes are a no go even on their own (Flower Powder Brush, Real Techniques Large Powder Brush, Eco Tools Fan Brush).</li>
            <li>I really like all these brushes, there is a really good combination of sizes, I would give it 5 stars, just some of the brushes are too soft for my taste.</li>
            <li>I love how soft and dense they are.  </li>
            <li>within 2 days (standard shipping), packaging was tidy and everything was included.&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
            <li>Soft brushes and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This was my first set of makeup brushes and a year and some later they are still amazing.</li>
            <li>other than that, very pleased with the set.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve luckily had no problems (I have SUPER sensitive skin/chemical sensitivities</li>
            <li>I think the work the same or even better for the price.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave this 4 stars and not five is because this is not my fav set, they defiantly have much better ones.</li>
            <li>(except maybe a foundation brush, the one included is a flat painter style, if you prefer more of a rounded one)</li>
            <li>Brushes are soooo soft and colorful !</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super soft too!</li>
            <li>This is a nice little brush set for the price.  </li>
            <li>I surfed the web 4 something high quality at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t care about that feature because I use the brushes interchangeably so it doesn&#x27;t matter to me.</li>
            <li>this super-soft they came really fast</li>
            <li>The case seems really well made as well.</li>
            <li>Soft and colorful.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more BH products in the near future!</li>
            <li>Just love these brushes will probably never get any other brand and it didn&#x27;t hurt that they were shipped so fast.</li>
            <li>The brushes are really soft, it looks exactly like it does in the picture.</li>
            <li>I have had them for over a year now, and they are still exactly the same as when I first got them.</li>
            <li>some of the brushes are comparable to high quality..</li>
            <li>The brushes were high quality that I would purchase for myself.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t shed and are very soft to the skin.</li>
            <li>My only wish is that the carrying case was a little bigger, there&#x27;s room to fit a few more smaller brushes with the included brushes, but my favorite powder and bronzer</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t shed and they are so SOFT!</li>
            <li>and OMG they are SOOO soft!</li>
            <li>brushes are soft as ever cnt wait to use them</li>
            <li>and I got them to fast next thing on my list</li>
            <li>soft complexion and eye brushes</li>
            <li>Soft hairs, and</li>
            <li>So soft omg</li>
            <li>The packaging is super cute and light weight, I divide it and use it to store all my big brushes in one half and all the small brushes in the other.</li>
            <li>Only thing is if they get wet make sure to dry them or they will start to crack.</li>
            <li>I would have given it 5 stars, but there were a couple brushes intended for under the eyes or around the eyes that are not stiff enough to use.  </li>
            <li>They are a bit smaller than professional brushes, but I didn&#x27;t expect different.</li>

            <li> and I got them to fast next thing on my list</li>
            <li> soft complexion and eye brushes</li>
            <li> Soft hairs, and</li>
            <li> So soft omg</li>
            <li> The packaging is super cute and light weight, I divide it and use it to store all my big brushes in one half and all the small brushes in the other.</li>

            <li> They are a bit smaller than professional brushes, but I didn&#x27;t expect different.</li>
            <li> Minimal shedding (a couple hairs fell out of the larger brushes).  </li>
            <li> A friend had been wanting these for a long time now and another gift idea fell through</li>
            <li> However, I washed them well (including the handles) and let them dry before I used them</li>
            <li> I usually open the container and keep clean brushes in one &amp;#34;cup&amp;#34; and put the dirty ones in the other cup.  </li>
            <li> After a year one of the handles came off the brush but that was proably my fault for not washing carefully.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> The only brush in this set I do not care for is the small angeld brush.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be the pervading chemical smell (spray paint/clear coat?), hence the 4 star rating.  </li>
            <li> opening there is a slight chemical smell</li>
            <li> but it is not overwhelming at all.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, would buy from BH Cosmetics again.</li>
            <li> I was buying brushed from sephora and for one is expensive.</li>
            <li> Not sure what they&#x27;re all for</li>
            <li> Also if you&#x27;re dumb like me and don&#x27;t know how to girl, on the manufacturer&#x27;s website there is a picture that shows you what each brush is for.</li>

            <li> Great brushes fro the price</li>
            <li> Love these cute brushes!! They&#x27;re super soft too!</li>
            <li> I really like all these brushes, there is a really good combination of sizes, I would give it 5 stars, just some of the brushes are too soft for my taste.</li>
            <li> Very cute and soft. I didn&#x27;t realize I was using crappy brushes until I started using these awesome brushes.</li>
            <li> I bought this not knowing what to really expect - people have said good things online but you know!  Wow these brushes are very soft I am happy with them.  I used them once (not every brush) and for the ones I used I was impressed.  Definitely more &amp;#34;bang for buck&amp;#34; here.</li>
            <li> Great brush set.  I would have given it 5 stars, but there were a couple brushes intended for under the eyes or around the eyes that are not stiff enough to use.  Other than that, I love it! I&#x27;ve washed them several times and they always clean up beautifully and no shedding.</li>
            <li> For my first set of brushes, I love them! They don&#x27;t shed and they are so SOFT! They&#x27;re nice and sturdy. I&#x27;ve had them for about two months and I&#x27;m still very happy with them.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these one for myself and one as a gift for a friend. My friend and I both love these brushes and the colors of the handles are beautiful. After a year one of the handles came off the brush but that was proably my fault for not washing carefully. I do recommend this brush set.</li>
            <li> I will definitely stop and think twice before buying another &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; brush, these brushes are QUALITY. I can&#x27;t believe you get 10 of them and a travel case for the price of one (or even a portion of some!) My only wish is that the carrying case was a little bigger, there&#x27;s room to fit a few more smaller brushes with the included brushes, but my favorite powder and bronzer/highlighter brushes are a no go even on their own (Flower Powder Brush, Real Techniques Large Powder Brush, Eco Tools Fan Brush). If you&#x27;re looking for a brush starter kit, this is perfect! (except maybe a foundation brush, the one included is a flat painter style, if you prefer more of a rounded one)</li>
            <li> The brushes are really soft, it looks exactly like it does in the picture. GREAT VALUE. Also if you&#x27;re dumb like me and don&#x27;t know how to girl, on the manufacturer&#x27;s website there is a picture that shows you what each brush is for.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little brush set for the price.  I love how soft and dense they are.  They have a nice feel/weight to them and the colors are fun.  Minimal shedding (a couple hairs fell out of the larger brushes).  They seem to pick up product fairly well.  I especially love the larger brushes for applying a light amount of foundation, blending in concealer, etc.  The makeup almost looks airbrushed, even when I have red marks/rashes all over my cheeks from seasonal allergies.  The angled eyeliner brush is also very nice and the blending brushes work well with smoky eyes, etc.  My only complaint would be the pervading chemical smell (spray paint/clear coat?), hence the 4 star rating.  However, I washed them well (including the handles) and let them dry before I used them and I&#x27;ve luckily had no problems (I have SUPER sensitive skin/chemical sensitivities so I have to play it safe).  There are no labels or numbers on the brushes.  I really don&#x27;t care about that feature because I use the brushes interchangeably so it doesn&#x27;t matter to me.</li>
            <li> Loved it!!! Just like the description</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. They are so soft and the colors are beautiful.</li>
            <li> Soft and beautiful brushes</li>
            <li> I like the carrier they come in. Makes it easy to take the brushes everywhere with you while keeping them from getting messed up.</li>
            <li> Very soft and perfect for eyes, face, and lips</li>
            <li> Very soft, good quality brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Came within 2 days (standard shipping), packaging was tidy and everything was included.&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening there is a slight chemical smell but it is not overwhelming at all.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, would buy from BH Cosmetics again.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter, and she was so happy and loves her makeup brushes..very pleased!!</li>
            <li> Their brushes are cheap and flimsy. The brushes aren&#x27;t dense at all</li>
            <li> Am a happy customer shipped in 2 days all the way to the bahamas...brushes are soft as ever cnt wait to use them</li>
            <li> These brushes are awesome. This was my first set of makeup brushes and a year and some later they are still amazing. Some of the brush heads pop off sometimes, but that&#x27;s an easy fix with glue. The head of the brush is extreamly soft, and they are very easy to clean as well. I have had them for over a year now, and they are still exactly the same as when I first got them. I would reccomend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> Just amazing 😊 the are cut and soft and meet  my expectations ☺️</li>

            <li> This was bought as a Christmas gift for beauty novice.  It does the job.  Love the striped case.  Soft brushes and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great! I loved them, plus there affordable. I was buying brushed from sephora and for one is expensive. I think the work the same or even better for the price. I rate it 5</li>
            <li> This is a great starter for brushes and it&#x27;s great for travel. It has all the essentials and the blending brush is my favorite. I did my research and watched several YouTube videos on this product and was convinced I needed them!</li>
            <li> Really nice. Soft and colorful. Going to order a second set for someone else.</li>
            <li> Great affordable brushes</li>
            <li> Probably the best starter brush set before you go pro. Soft hairs, and the application is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> Only thing is if they get wet make sure to dry them or they will start to crack. But they are amazing.</li>
            <li> Exeptional! I surfed the web 4 something high quality at a reasonable price! The set is beautiful &amp; colorful! Soft,plush &amp;the case is sturdy and posh! This will be my travel set when im on the go!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! They don&#x27;t shed and are very soft to the skin. They are a bit smaller than professional brushes, but I didn&#x27;t expect different. The packaging is super cute and light weight, I divide it and use it to store all my big brushes in one half and all the small brushes in the other. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Not sure what they&#x27;re all for but the brushes are so solft and the colors are fun!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE these brushes ! Great quality, no smell, brushes are so soft and beautiful!</li>
            <li> Just love these brushes will probably never get any other brand and it didn&#x27;t hurt that they were shipped so fast. This is a great company to order from.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bristle shed a lot</li>
            <li> These are 100% AMAZINGGG!!! So soft omg and they work so well</li>
            <li> very pretty colors.. made a nice gift.. some of the brushes are comparable to high quality..</li>
            <li> I really enjoy bh cosmetics brushes. They are amazing quality for the price. I usually open the container and keep clean brushes in one &amp;#34;cup&amp;#34; and put the dirty ones in the other cup.  The only brush in this set I do not care for is the small angeld brush. I tried to use this for eyebrows and it does not hold its shape at all. other than that, very pleased with the set.</li>
            <li> I purchased thes brushes as a Christmas gift for my niece, she absolutely love them.  The brushes were high quality that I would purchase for myself.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the BH brushes, they are beyond soft and are great quality, especially for the price. The only reason I gave this 4 stars and not five is because this is not my fav set, they defiantly have much better ones.</li>
