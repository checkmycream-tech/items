            <li>but we&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very happy with the Dovo Shavette and would do this again.</li>
            <li>It will probably be the best $10</li>
            <li>Try it, you&#x27;ll love it!!!</li>
            <li>Until I can save up some money and invest in a very nice razor that requires stroping etc this is perfect.  </li>
            <li>This is a great razor that gets the job done on a budget.  </li>

            <li>great construction quality dovo.</li>
            <li>This handle feels great.  </li>
            <li>it is smooth, close shaving without nicks, cuts nor rash!!!  </li>
            <li>Good beginner blade at a really great price.</li>
            <li>After doing a review for the straight edge razor, i found that the Novo brand is one of the best in the market, i don&#x27;t have another point of comparison but after tested for almost a month i can say that the razor does an excellent job.</li>
            <li>My friend used it and said that it is of good quality and offered a good shave.  </li>
            <li>Good to start with before moving onto a Feather Artist.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s something very satisfying about shaving with this.</li>
            <li>Very light, feels good in hand.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s experienced using straight edges and said that the quality was good as well.</li>
            <li>It has good style and is a good razor without paying too much money.</li>
            <li>, able to be packed in carry-on, and gives a good, close, clean shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>This is very light weight, bordering on feeling &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>When you get used to the blade angle and the feel of the blade on stubble, this is going to be the best shave you can get unless you move to a full blown straight, guaranteed.</li>
            <li>this is an outstanding instrument.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re wondering about shaving with a straight blade but don&#x27;t want to commit to the expenses it implies, this is a great option.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect practice and beginner setup for learning proper technique.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d expect to get two-three safe shaves out of the included blades...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do buy it :)</li>
            <li>This is a great starter straight blade for those who have never used a razor like this.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed with the overall performance.  </li>
            <li>Just sort of jumped into it and I feel in love with it.</li>
            <li>I will eventually save up and buy a legit straight razor but in the meantime, this is great.</li>
            <li>Very light weight and easy to use</li>
            <li>Paired with the aluminum head, this makes for a light-weight and agile shaver, but be warned, this can make for an easy way to carve your face up if you aren&#x27;t careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend watching a youtube video on how to start shaving and preparing the blade and you skin for straight blade shaving, The razor is very light weight but shouldn&#x27;t cost more than 20 dollars</li>
            <li>Enjoy it.</li>
            <li>I recommend picking a good preshave oil or cream, this seems to help more witha shavette vs a DE or traditional</li>
            <li>Would have liked some more instructions (especially on which kinds of disposable blades to use) but there are plenty of resources online.</li>
            <li>My friends think Iâ€™m so cool and</li>
            <li>The guard also helps to give you a good starting angle when shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend using [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Exactly as described- got it as a training blade for straight edge and very pleased with it after 2 months, (first week is a bit like nightmare on elm street)</li>
            <li>Luckily I received a gift card for Xmas</li>
            <li>pretty good!,&lt;br /&gt;its sturdy, light weight.</li>
            <li>; good news, shaving with a shavette is very much the same.</li>
            <li>I use the red blade replacements, which are on the smaller side of the replacements, but still work great and give a smooth, clean shave.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be cheap and spend a little more money on a much better product.  </li>
            <li>For what I used to spend on a month&#x27;s worth of disposible razors I can buy two years worth of blades.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>So I decided to try it myself, ordered everything from Amazon, got it all in five days right to my mailbox.  </li>
            <li>So right from opening the package and not even using the razor, I can say I am NOT a Dovo fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#Dovo</li>
            <li>: Cheap, lightweight, sturdy, and decent looking for the price (looks aren&#x27;t everything, guys...)</li>
            <li>It is a very light razor that is easy to maneuver and the blades are very sharp.</li>
            <li>Straight edge razor shaving....manliness to the T!</li>
            <li>Super lightweight and a decent blade.</li>
            <li>I have another &amp;#34;shavette&amp;#34; that was 1/2 the price, but feels much more solid.  </li>
            <li>Also, the ability to just replace a worn out blade was appealing and has actually worked out pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Check out \\&quot;Shaving 101: Choosing the Right Blade\\&quot; for sharper blades when that time comes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not have any information on straight shaving before I started.</li>
            <li>I have also bought more of the Dovo blades because I love using razors that are 2.5&amp;#34; long instead of the short disposables.</li>
            <li>Starting teaching myself to shave with a straight blade, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>little to no irritation, ultra sharp blades, the best shaving experience i&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>Bought this as my first straight razor.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It was my first Straight Edge razor, took me some time to get used to, but I think I will keep it forever.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wanted to get into shaving with a straight razor and this was my first purchase.</li>
            <li>His place is always full of man of all ages waiting for their turn to get a shave from the old master.  </li>
            <li>product was good still not sure if its the real one because the company name is not on the handle as shown in the picture</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s not a horrible little razor, just very light weight.  </li>
            <li>My grandfather has always shaved with a straight edge rszor and swears by it.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to spend a fortune to get into the straight edge razor world.  </li>
            <li>Longer hairs tend to get caught up between the blade and blade housing but is not a Problem really.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve shaved with a straight razor before</li>
            <li>Started Shaving like a real man.</li>
            <li>Buy extras if you plan on continuing with straight blade shaving.</li>
            <li>He has never used a straight razor before</li>
            <li>happyto know that I converted someone to straight shaving.</li>
            <li>I had ordered a budget straight razor that I couldn&#x27;t hone for anything.</li>
            <li>This shavette allowing me to get that satisfaction of shaving with a straight razor without having to deal with the honing of a razor.</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t sure if you really want to get into straight shaving but are curious then get the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>They are the dullest of the straight razor blades but are still sharp enough to give you a good shave, and nick you.</li>
            <li>I think the heavier full blade will be something I&#x27;ll like in the future</li>
            <li>I mainly used this to edge my beard.</li>
            <li>blade guard is aluminum while the handle appears to be a high grade plastic (or maybe polymer?)</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this as an introductory learning tool with the idea of upgrading if I developed the skills to use it, and soon enough I found out that there&#x27;s no need for that becouse</li>
            <li>Feels great and comes with different seats for different straight razor blades (long and short).</li>
            <li>It was only $3.50 which is great if you aren&#x27;t serious but just want to try it</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re thinking of getting into straight razor shaving, but don&#x27;t want to commit to a pricy razor early on, this is a decent starter razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fan of Dovo straight razors and thought I&#x27;d get this for a quick shave when I don&#x27;t have time to strop and save a little wear and tear on my main straight razor.  </li>
            <li>it is light but has a decent rubber grip, very low maintenance and a simple mechanism for inserting blades.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Being that this isn&#x27;t like a traditional straight razor, in a sense that the blade doesn&#x27;t have to be installed all the time, makes it the perfect travel razor to take on flights, especially if you already have an expensive razor you don&#x27;t want to risk to loss, theft, or damage.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So if you want to start off with a straight razor buy this and if you like it you can move onto the more expensive dovo razors that donâ€™t need replacement blades, and Iâ€™m sure you will never look back.</li>
            <li>This surprised me since I am used to Dovo&#x27;s normal high quality.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this product for the pass 5 months and still like brand new.</li>
            <li>I have an old fashioned barber near my place that shaves the old fashioned way with a straight edge razor.</li>
            <li>Cheap Chinese imatation that&#x27;s flimsy and total complete garbage.</li>
            <li>have two older straight razors that I will restore and use in the future but for starting out the Shavette was much easier.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t want to drop the $200.00 - $500.00 for a new straight razor if this wasn&#x27;t going to last.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s only a little more than $10.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll never go back to any of the costly modern shavers I had been using.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your time or money on this.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this as a first straight razor to anyone that is serious about getting into straight shaving but is on a budget.</li>
            <li>dovo is light weight, and relatively inexpensive when looking at other shavettes/straight razors.</li>
            <li>easily change blades and after a slight learning curve shaves like  a champ!!</li>
            <li>The holders are plastic and fit very tightly in the shavette</li>
            <li>The only major difference that I have noticed is your angle will tend to be a little more aggressive than you&#x27;re likely used to.</li>
            <li>No stropping of the blade right now just meant one less step to worry about.</li>
            <li>but I dont think he will ever go back to his old ways of shaving.</li>
            <li>I looked up other straight edge razors and it was going to cost well over $200 just to get started, with brushes, bowls, and the razor itself.  </li>
            <li>handle, while plastic, is pretty sturdy and tight.</li>
            <li>Blades are cheap, a big plus if you are moving from a double-edge safety razor; just snap your blades in half and lock in a half in the red holder and get started shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Derby Professional Single Edge Razor Blades, 100 Count (Pack of 2)]] when starting out.</li>
            <li>I have been really into the old school way of doing things lately.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Dovo straight razors and thought I&#x27;d get this for a quick shave when I don&#x27;t have time to strop and save a little wear and tear on my main straight razor.  </li>
            <li> it is light but has a decent rubber grip, very low maintenance and a simple mechanism for inserting blades.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Being that this isn&#x27;t like a traditional straight razor, in a sense that the blade doesn&#x27;t have to be installed all the time, makes it the perfect travel razor to take on flights, especially if you already have an expensive razor you don&#x27;t want to risk to loss, theft, or damage.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So if you want to start off with a straight razor buy this and if you like it you can move onto the more expensive dovo razors that donâ€™t need replacement blades, and Iâ€™m sure you will never look back.</li>
            <li> This surprised me since I am used to Dovo&#x27;s normal high quality.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for the pass 5 months and still like brand new.</li>
            <li> I have an old fashioned barber near my place that shaves the old fashioned way with a straight edge razor.</li>
            <li> Cheap Chinese imatation that&#x27;s flimsy and total complete garbage.</li>
            <li> have two older straight razors that I will restore and use in the future but for starting out the Shavette was much easier.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t want to drop the $200.00 - $500.00 for a new straight razor if this wasn&#x27;t going to last.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s only a little more than $10.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll never go back to any of the costly modern shavers I had been using.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your time or money on this.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this as a first straight razor to anyone that is serious about getting into straight shaving but is on a budget.</li>
            <li> dovo is light weight, and relatively inexpensive when looking at other shavettes/straight razors.</li>
            <li> easily change blades and after a slight learning curve shaves like  a champ!!</li>
            <li> The holders are plastic and fit very tightly in the shavette</li>
            <li> The only major difference that I have noticed is your angle will tend to be a little more aggressive than you&#x27;re likely used to.</li>
            <li> No stropping of the blade right now just meant one less step to worry about.</li>
            <li> but I dont think he will ever go back to his old ways of shaving.</li>
            <li> I looked up other straight edge razors and it was going to cost well over $200 just to get started, with brushes, bowls, and the razor itself.  </li>
            <li> handle, while plastic, is pretty sturdy and tight.</li>
            <li> Blades are cheap, a big plus if you are moving from a double-edge safety razor; just snap your blades in half and lock in a half in the red holder and get started shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Derby Professional Single Edge Razor Blades, 100 Count (Pack of 2)]] when starting out.</li>
            <li> I have been really into the old school way of doing things lately.  </li>
            <li> Cheap enough that you won&#x27;t feel bad if you should end up not liking straight shaving.</li>
            <li> razor is very lightweight and I&#x27;m not sure if that helps or hurts.</li>
            <li> Multipocketed vinyl sleeve holding the shavette itself loaded with the red blade holder (for snapped DE blades), on the other side you have the black blade holder (for the ~2.5in shavette blades), a black combed blade holder (has teeth like a comb, I&#x27;ve never used this holder), and 2 shavette blades (unbranded) and a snapped Merkur Super Platinum DE blade (2 usable razors).</li>
            <li> /&gt;The two holders hold different size blades, one is normal size while the other holds longer blades, around an inch and a half long.</li>
            <li> Its one of those small things you have to experience, like diving off a high dive.</li>
            <li> As long as it isn&#x27;t loaded, packing it in your carry-on is no problem, just remember to either pack your blades in your checked baggage or pick up some blades at the nearest pharmacy when you step off at your destination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Without the correct blades this poor quality holder is being refunded as it is not worth the price and has cheap blade holders.</li>
            <li> My other &amp;#34;shavette&amp;#34; only holds small blades and a draw of this one is that it holds long disposable blades, but the way this one holds the blade, it doesn&#x27;t quite fit due to small &amp;#34;knobs&amp;#34; on the inside of the blade holder.  </li>
            <li> and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone serious about shaving.</li>
            <li> If you are serious about straight shaving then I would buy this Dovo shavette.</li>
            <li> Iâ€™m 20 and got tired of using the same old standard razor.</li>
            <li> but when I opened the package the Shavette is supposed to come with a red Shavette blade holder(from smaller blades) and a black comb Shavette blade holder and a black Shavette blade holder</li>
            <li> (both black holders for a larger blade)</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to worry about them slipping out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not a real Dovo!</li>
            <li> Extremely cheap.....used it once n in the garbage.</li>
            <li> It is very sharp so be very careful.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to get started with a straight razor you canâ€™t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> and I DID NOT receive either of the black blade holders.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used a straight before, I recommend heading to youtube and watching a few videos on technique: note - you will either cut yourself a few times on your first few shaves or your shaves are going to be terrible until you get the hang of it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light-weight and ergonomically designed for cutting.</li>
            <li> Lightweight, but not cheap feeling.  </li>
            <li> My only complain is that the one that i received is not the same that show in the picture, the one that i have the handle is just plain black for that i&#x27;m a little disappointed</li>
            <li> : The longer shavette blades tend to be harder to find in my area, so I&#x27;m limited to either ordering blades online or using blades from my DE (not that that is a bad thing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is the product to be a bad ass!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been really into the old school way of doing things lately.  My grandfather has always shaved with a straight edge rszor and swears by it. I looked into getting started into myself, but I am a college student, and therefore on a budget. I looked up other straight edge razors and it was going to cost well over $200 just to get started, with brushes, bowls, and the razor itself.  This is a great razor that gets the job done on a budget.  You don&#x27;t need to spend a fortune to get into the straight edge razor world.  Is this the best razor ever? Of course not, but it works for now. Until I can save up some money and invest in a very nice razor that requires stroping etc this is perfect.  Plus, all the guys on my floor think I am a beast, the men of men! Straight edge razor shaving....manliness to the T!</li>
            <li> the 5 I give this product because im a Barber and this is the only razor I will use on my clients</li>
            <li> I have an old fashioned barber near my place that shaves the old fashioned way with a straight edge razor. His place is always full of man of all ages waiting for their turn to get a shave from the old master.  After some years of watching this whenever I went to get my hair cut curiosity got the best of me.  I decided to try it. That was it!!!  I loved it!!  So I decided to try it myself, ordered everything from Amazon, got it all in five days right to my mailbox.  It took three to four shaves with these to get the hang of it and I&#x27;ll never go back to any of the costly modern shavers I had been using.  I always shave while taking my shower.  Once you learn and get the hang of it it is smooth, close shaving without nicks, cuts nor rash!!!  Try it, you&#x27;ll love it!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described- got it as a training blade for straight edge and very pleased with it after 2 months, (first week is a bit like nightmare on elm street) it is light but has a decent rubber grip, very low maintenance and a simple mechanism for inserting blades. Longer hairs tend to get caught up between the blade and blade housing but is not a Problem really. Will keep this as my travel blade for when I am working away from home.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this as an introductory learning tool with the idea of upgrading if I developed the skills to use it, and soon enough I found out that there&#x27;s no need for that becouse this is an outstanding instrument. I shave my head with this, and it&#x27;s aluminium construction means that it will never rust in the shower. I use the red blade replacements, which are on the smaller side of the replacements, but still work great and give a smooth, clean shave. Also, shaving with this is a bargain: For what I used to spend on a month&#x27;s worth of disposible razors I can buy two years worth of blades.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re wondering about shaving with a straight blade but don&#x27;t want to commit to the expenses it implies, this is a great option.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to get into shaving straight razor shaving but don&#x27;t want to make a heavy investment into getting a razor, a strop, and sharpening/honing stones; this shavette is the way to go. It is the perfect practice and beginner setup for learning proper technique. Blades are cheap, a big plus if you are moving from a double-edge safety razor; just snap your blades in half and lock in a half in the red holder and get started shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle, while plastic, is pretty sturdy and tight. Paired with the aluminum head, this makes for a light-weight and agile shaver, but be warned, this can make for an easy way to carve your face up if you aren&#x27;t careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being that this isn&#x27;t like a traditional straight razor, in a sense that the blade doesn&#x27;t have to be installed all the time, makes it the perfect travel razor to take on flights, especially if you already have an expensive razor you don&#x27;t want to risk to loss, theft, or damage. As long as it isn&#x27;t loaded, packing it in your carry-on is no problem, just remember to either pack your blades in your checked baggage or pick up some blades at the nearest pharmacy when you step off at your destination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve shaved with a straight razor before; good news, shaving with a shavette is very much the same. The only major difference that I have noticed is your angle will tend to be a little more aggressive than you&#x27;re likely used to. If you&#x27;ve never used a straight before, I recommend heading to youtube and watching a few videos on technique: note - you will either cut yourself a few times on your first few shaves or your shaves are going to be terrible until you get the hang of it (it&#x27;s happened to all of us, don&#x27;t get discouraged). When you get used to the blade angle and the feel of the blade on stubble, this is going to be the best shave you can get unless you move to a full blown straight, guaranteed. I recommend picking a good preshave oil or cream, this seems to help more witha shavette vs a DE or traditional straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this shavette 5 out of 5 for price, convenience, shave quality, and build quality (it is a Dovo afterall).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Cheap, lightweight, sturdy, and decent looking for the price (looks aren&#x27;t everything, guys...), able to be packed in carry-on, and gives a good, close, clean shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The longer shavette blades tend to be harder to find in my area, so I&#x27;m limited to either ordering blades online or using blades from my DE (not that that is a bad thing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Package contents: Multipocketed vinyl sleeve holding the shavette itself loaded with the red blade holder (for snapped DE blades), on the other side you have the black blade holder (for the ~2.5in shavette blades), a black combed blade holder (has teeth like a comb, I&#x27;ve never used this holder), and 2 shavette blades (unbranded) and a snapped Merkur Super Platinum DE blade (2 usable razors).</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll done for the $$. Local stores charge 10-20x in Dallas, what I paid for this item here. Enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Bought this as my first straight razor.  Feels great and comes with different seats for different straight razor blades (long and short).</li>
            <li> Started Shaving like a real man. this is the product to be a bad ass! great design/value. easily change blades and after a slight learning curve shaves like  a champ!!</li>
            <li> Super lightweight and a decent blade. I&#x27;d expect to get two-three safe shaves out of the included blades... Buy extras if you plan on continuing with straight blade shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Dovo straight razors and thought I&#x27;d get this for a quick shave when I don&#x27;t have time to strop and save a little wear and tear on my main straight razor.  This is very light weight, bordering on feeling &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;.  This surprised me since I am used to Dovo&#x27;s normal high quality.  I have another &amp;#34;shavette&amp;#34; that was 1/2 the price, but feels much more solid.  My other &amp;#34;shavette&amp;#34; only holds small blades and a draw of this one is that it holds long disposable blades, but the way this one holds the blade, it doesn&#x27;t quite fit due to small &amp;#34;knobs&amp;#34; on the inside of the blade holder.  Overall, it&#x27;s not a horrible little razor, just very light weight.  If you&#x27;re thinking of getting into straight razor shaving, but don&#x27;t want to commit to a pricy razor early on, this is a decent starter razor.</li>
            <li> Very light weight and easy to use once you figure out how to hold it for different cuts. I mainly used this to edge my beard.</li>
            <li> This frankly does not work.  Don&#x27;t be cheap and spend a little more money on a much better product.  Don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> Not a real Dovo! Cheap Chinese imatation that&#x27;s flimsy and total complete garbage. Luckily I received a gift card for Xmas so it wasn&#x27;t like I had to pay for it.</li>
            <li> pretty good!,&lt;br /&gt;its sturdy, light weight. The blade fits in well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was my first Straight Edge razor, took me some time to get used to, but I think I will keep it forever.&lt;br /&gt;Do buy it :)</li>
            <li> This is an inferior product and not what I ordered. How do I return this product as it didn&#x27;t come with any paperwork!!!???</li>
            <li> This is a great starter straight blade for those who have never used a razor like this. It is very sharp so be very careful. I recommend watching a youtube video on how to start shaving and preparing the blade and you skin for straight blade shaving, The razor is very light weight but shouldn&#x27;t cost more than 20 dollars that&#x27;s why I would give it a 3 star rating.</li>
            <li> I received this razor as a gift and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone serious about shaving. It is a very light razor that is easy to maneuver and the blades are very sharp. I was very impressed with the overall performance.  I would also recommend using shaving oil to help avoid having any accidents.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my hubby for Christmas and he loves it! He has never used a straight razor before but I dont think he will ever go back to his old ways of shaving.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the price. It has good style and is a good razor without paying too much money. If you are looking to get started with a straight razor you canâ€™t go wrong with this product. Iâ€™m 20 and got tired of using the same old standard razor. I made the switch and after 2 or 3 times using it I got used to it and now I never stop. My friends think Iâ€™m so cool and even though my girlfriend struggles to watch, she thinks itâ€™s ultra-sexy and sophisticated.&lt;br /&gt;So if you want to start off with a straight razor buy this and if you like it you can move onto the more expensive dovo razors that donâ€™t need replacement blades, and Iâ€™m sure you will never look back.</li>
            <li> never going back. little to no irritation, ultra sharp blades, the best shaving experience i&#x27;ve ever had. great construction quality dovo.</li>
            <li> Good beginner blade at a really great price. Would have liked some more instructions (especially on which kinds of disposable blades to use) but there are plenty of resources online.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for a friend and personally thought it looked &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;. My friend used it and said that it is of good quality and offered a good shave.  He&#x27;s experienced using straight edges and said that the quality was good as well.</li>
            <li> Without the correct blades this poor quality holder is being refunded as it is not worth the price and has cheap blade holders.</li>
            <li> Very light, feels good in hand. I started buying these Dovo&#x27;s for barber grad friends. Good to start with before moving onto a Feather Artist.</li>
            <li> After doing a review for the straight edge razor, i found that the Novo brand is one of the best in the market, i don&#x27;t have another point of comparison but after tested for almost a month i can say that the razor does an excellent job. My only complain is that the one that i received is not the same that show in the picture, the one that i have the handle is just plain black for that i&#x27;m a little disappointed but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> Starting teaching myself to shave with a straight blade, and I love it.  This handle feels great.  Lightweight, but not cheap feeling.  I have also bought more of the Dovo blades because I love using razors that are 2.5&amp;#34; long instead of the short disposables.</li>
            <li> Wanted to get into shaving with a straight razor and this was my first purchase. Didn&#x27;t want to drop the $200.00 - $500.00 for a new straight razor if this wasn&#x27;t going to last. The Shavette by Dovo was inexpensive enough for me to try and has worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two older straight razors that I will restore and use in the future but for starting out the Shavette was much easier. No stropping of the blade right now just meant one less step to worry about. Also, the ability to just replace a worn out blade was appealing and has actually worked out pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is very lightweight and I&#x27;m not sure if that helps or hurts. I think the heavier full blade will be something I&#x27;ll like in the future but we&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very happy with the Dovo Shavette and would do this again.</li>
            <li> If you are serious about straight shaving then I would buy this Dovo shavette. I bought another razor with a similar type design of off of amazon before this one. It was only $3.50 which is great if you aren&#x27;t serious but just want to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dovo is light weight, and relatively inexpensive when looking at other shavettes/straight razors. Mine came with two blade holders and a couple of starter blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two holders hold different size blades, one is normal size while the other holds longer blades, around an inch and a half long. The holders are plastic and fit very tightly in the shavette so you don&#x27;t have to worry about them slipping out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade guard is aluminum while the handle appears to be a high grade plastic (or maybe polymer?) The guard also helps to give you a good starting angle when shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend using [[ASIN:B006JVTHIU Derby Professional Single Edge Razor Blades, 100 Count (Pack of 2)]] when starting out. They are the dullest of the straight razor blades but are still sharp enough to give you a good shave, and nick you. Check out \\&quot;Shaving 101: Choosing the Right Blade\\&quot; for sharper blades when that time comes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not have any information on straight shaving before I started. Just sort of jumped into it and I feel in love with it. Its one of those small things you have to experience, like diving off a high dive. If you aren&#x27;t sure if you really want to get into straight shaving but are curious then get the [[ASIN:B005WKKA2Q Economy Razor]]. With the Derby blades it&#x27;s only a little more than $10. Cheap enough that you won&#x27;t feel bad if you should end up not liking straight shaving. It will probably be the best $10 you ever spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this as a first straight razor to anyone that is serious about getting into straight shaving but is on a budget. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me know if I convinced you. I would be happyto know that I converted someone to straight shaving.</li>
            <li> I just received the razor  I have not shaved with it yet, but when I opened the package the Shavette is supposed to come with a red Shavette blade holder(from smaller blades) and a black comb Shavette blade holder and a black Shavette blade holder (both black holders for a larger blade) and I DID NOT receive either of the black blade holders. So right from opening the package and not even using the razor, I can say I am NOT a Dovo fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#Dovo</li>
            <li> Extremely cheap.....used it once n in the garbage. Do not waste your time or money on this. Money gone forever</li>
            <li> product was good still not sure if its the real one because the company name is not on the handle as shown in the picture</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for the pass 5 months and still like brand new. It&#x27;s very light-weight and ergonomically designed for cutting. I recommend.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s something very satisfying about shaving with this. I had ordered a budget straight razor that I couldn&#x27;t hone for anything. This shavette allowing me to get that satisfaction of shaving with a straight razor without having to deal with the honing of a razor. I will eventually save up and buy a legit straight razor but in the meantime, this is great.</li>
