    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Awesome Razor.</li>
            <li>he says it&#x27;s the best razor he&#x27;s ever had and</li>
            <li>This is without a doubt the best razor I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>Combined with a badger hair brush and cream, it is perfect.</li>
            <li>and I get the best shaves</li>
            <li>Happy shaving!</li>
            <li>Great buy!</li>
            <li>Excellent razor!  </li>
            <li>it is just AWESOME for me!</li>
            <li>Warning, though:  don&#x27;t keep going over and over an area trying to &#x60;perfect&#x27; the shave.  </li>
            <li>The shave is excellent.  </li>
            <li>I am now getting the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.    </li>
            <li>The quality of the razor itself is excellent:  </li>
            <li>I am very happy I bought this razor and will be using it from now on.</li>
            <li>AN EXCELLENT RAZOR!!!</li>
            <li>THE BEST I&#x27;VE EVER USED!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shaving is awesome, and I literally look forward to it.</li>
            <li>I took a shower (and my time) and had a very good shave on setting &#x60;1&#x27; with no nicks at all.  </li>
            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>You paid a lot of money and got a beautiful work of sculpture.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Leaving the razor around 1 or 1 1/2 seems to work great</li>
            <li>100% happy with my decision.</li>
            <li>(it feels great).</li>
            <li>Again, use quality shaving products and your skin will feel great and refreshed after a shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it works alright and looks/feels great.  </li>
            <li>Anyone who has had a shave with a barber knows how great this</li>
            <li>/&gt;Get a good brush too.</li>
            <li>I do not hesitate to recommend this Razor to anyone that will take time to develop good shaving technique.    </li>
            <li>Which is good, because you need to let the razor do the work -- NO PRESSURE, OR YOU WILL TAKE OFF YOU FACE).</li>
            <li>The quality and workmanship is top notch!</li>
            <li>sure to buy a styptic and some Merkur blades while you&#x27;re at it!</li>
            <li>YOU WILL LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>Another warning:  be sure to push the guard fully on!  </li>
            <li>face is now totally smooth, something I haven&#x27;t experienced in decades.</li>
            <li>The cost saving over the long-run (heck, the mid-run) is amazing since the replacement blades work out to about a quarter per blade (20 blades [double-sided] per $5.00 pack).</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;The nicest feature of this amazing razor is that it allows you to adjust the closeness of the blade.</li>
            <li>I was almost put off by reviews suggesting that the Merkur Futur wasn&#x27;t a good \\&quot;beginner&#x27;s razor\\&quot;, and that it would be better to start with something cheaper and</li>
            <li>a good shaving cream - Aveda&#x27;s seems to be the best one that I have used so far.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s more to a good shave than just the tool.</li>
            <li>so I had a nice bit of sandpaper by the afternoon when the razor arrived.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll soon be getting a nice close shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li>The Merkur Futur impressed me so much that I want to share this information with everyone:    </li>
            <li>The adjustable razor is superior because it give the user the most control to determine the closeness of the shave they desire.</li>
            <li>The stability of this 4.0 ounce  razor is perhaps its best asset (after being adjustable) and it makes shaving a lot easier, more fun, and even faster (one stroke is all it takes).</li>
            <li>WELL WORTH IT!!!</li>
            <li>While Merkur has an incredible reputation among wet shavers, this model isn&#x27;t very good in use.    </li>
            <li>I use it with Derby&#x27;s, not too happy with the Merkur blades, my setting right now is 1.</li>
            <li>It is well balanced, it is easy to handle, just keep the shave cream off your shaving hand dude!</li>
            <li>And the device itself is a beautiful work of engineering, stainless steel, no plastic parts.</li>
            <li>For me right between 1 and 2 is best, any higher and the shave is too close.</li>
            <li>I even shave my head with it :)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine for about 6 months and love it.</li>
            <li>- you will be able to play with the settings until you get it</li>
            <li>the shaves are better than a Mach III without any irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>The quality of this thing is top notch.  </li>
            <li>The user reviews on the Merkur were all outstanding, so I decided to give it a go.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Actually I have encountered most of the problems that Robert Charlton has already mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The blades are very inexpensive, making this a great investment...</li>
            <li>Now...it does do my neck better.  </li>
            <li>The reason is this: Since there is no lubricating strip on the razors, I have to constantly use more shaving cream to keep the face lubricated if I want to get that perfect shave.</li>
            <li>, more care is needed to prevent injury with a razor like this, but if you want the quality, you have to put the time, the effort and (sometimes)</li>
            <li>and It was ok.    </li>
            <li>&quot; I am going to order a the most maligned DE razor on the internet;</li>
            <li>In my short DE experience it has delivered the best shaves of my lifetime.</li>
            <li>and I got a better shave on the least-aggressive setting than I ever did with the Mach III.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;And when you go to buy safety razors at $0.50 a piece, you&#x27;ll be glad you made the switch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried changing to better shave creams, oils, etc.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve on this blade, so better to under-shave then to over-shave and get razor burn and cuts.</li>
            <li>* Check the Mens Essentials web site for more reviews and info.</li>
            <li>The highest setting \\&quot;6\\&quot; gives the most exposure of the blade to the skin, giving a harsher, but closer shave.</li>
            <li>Setting \\&quot;2\\&quot; is a favorite among many users including myself.    </li>
            <li>The top unsnaps from both sides.</li>
            <li>The razor looks great and has a good feel, but I don&#x27;t think it does as well as my ten dollar</li>
            <li>It was okay.</li>
            <li>the process should be more enjoyable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;In sum, this razor adds an old-school, refreshing routine to my mornings.</li>
            <li>I love it, and would whole-heartedly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I learned my dad was right; all it takes for a great shave is a good safety razor, a decent brush, shaving soap and a mug.</li>
            <li>It was pretty good.</li>
            <li>After having great success with the Merkur Classic I decided to own up and get the Futur.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the other magic ingredient of a perfect shave.</li>
            <li>I just worry that over the years, the cover will stop fitting securely and I&#x27;ll end up with a wobbly blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Technique is the most important part of using any DE shaver, go online and study those youtube vids.</li>
            <li>It is of excellent German craftsmanship and quality and worth the price.</li>
            <li>With a Safety razor like Merkur&#x27;s my face gets an easy shave that is smoother than any razor I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use but does take some skill around your chin.  </li>
            <li>A superior shaving tool and highly recommended.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Among many aspects I really, really like about the Merkur experience, what nobody here&#x27;s mentioned is the sound of shaving with it, which is kind of a bristly, metallic remix of traffic on raindamp asphalt.</li>
            <li>Mine is set at one and a half and it gives me a perfect shave every time.</li>
            <li>If this is your first double edge razor I strongly recommed it, however, don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re going to be able to get a perfect shave right out of the box.  </li>
            <li>So when it is run under hot water, it gets warm and the thermal mass keeps it warm, an extra nice touch.</li>
            <li>It is well balanced, comfortable and finely crafted,--and as an added bonus, it&#x27;s adjustable.</li>
            <li>his face is as smooth as ever.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shave from this razor is so spectacular that I almost get carried away and shave my whole body.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m comfortable with trying to shave as I shouldn&#x27;t feel I might drop the darn thing.  </li>
            <li>They will really help you develop your own style, for your face.    </li>
            <li>As others have said, use a light touch and let the razor do the work.  </li>
            <li>My pinky finger rests lightly on the hilt.  </li>
            <li>Mercedes precise -- without a blade in the thing.  </li>
            <li>it is as close and smooth a shave as I have ever had.</li>
            <li>the effort is completely worth it!</li>
            <li>A great shave takes a little more commitment than just breaking out a can of foam and a disposable razor.  </li>
            <li>you cut yourself, I&#x27;d look for some of the pre-shave oils that are available and/or use a high-quality shaving cream that provides adequate lubrication.</li>
            <li>Just remember there are many other factors that contribute to a good shave, not just the razor.    </li>
            <li>I was super excited because I thought to myself, \\&quot;shoot</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and I have had no problems with that since getting this amazing razor.  </li>
            <li>I recently received a Fusion razor and loved that, until I went to replace the blades.  </li>
            <li>I have a remington electric razor (series 7526) which gets 100s of times closer than the Mach 3 or Excel, but it for some reason does not do a good job on my neck - only my face.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Do not consider this as a full solution if you have shaving issues as I do.  </li>
            <li>I get a way better shave using my merkur classic</li>
            <li>but wow, this thing delivers an incredibly close shave (currently using a setting of 3).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Merkur Hefty Classic or HD is far better designed and far safer till you&#x27;re an experienced double-edge blade shaver.</li>
            <li>I have also bloodied myself pretty good with the Mach III, including a permanent scar on the bottom of my left &#x60;cleft&#x27; where I flattened the curve with that razor.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!</li>
            <li>Once you get used to using a double edge, moving to the Futur will be easy and an even better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>MAKE SURE TO PUSH THE HEAD IN ALL WAY UNTIL IT IS NICE AND TIGHT</li>
            <li>so tiny it didn&#x27;t need any kind of aftercare.</li>
            <li>Over the years, my skin has become more sensitive and prone to ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>Plus, the razor itself is a work of art that will last a lifetime and adds a nice aesthetic element to the morning routine.</li>
            <li>The replacement blades for this razor are fifty cents a piece and do a far better job.   </li>
            <li>many others I was looking for an alternative to the $$$ n-blade disposibles that seem to go up in price almost as frequently as gasoline.  </li>
            <li>I absorbed all I could over a 3 day period</li>
            <li>You must be quite experienced to tame this razor.    </li>
            <li>I often use my old razor for spots that didn&#x27;t get very cleanly shaven.  </li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>Still trying to find the right balance on the setting</li>
            <li>now I look shaven right to bed time.  </li>
            <li>The shave was good, but not extraordinary.  </li>
            <li>Rub a little oil on the bumps, then spend a good 20-30 seconds lathering up your beard with the brush in a clockwise motion</li>
            <li>, I just switched from Mach 3 Turbo to Merkur Futur, and my first shave resulted in one nick on my chin,</li>
            <li>/&gt;You should use lighter razors first because the Merkur cuts closer.  </li>
            <li>I started on 1 the first day to get a handle on the razor.  </li>
            <li>because if it&#x27;s supposed to be a better razor than anything before it, there shouldn&#x27;t be a learning curve from one double edge to another.  </li>
            <li>and this is the first time i have shaved with a doble edge safety razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>just week or so after using this for the first time...</li>
            <li>/&gt;After practicing with a basic (non-adjustable) model, I am getting much better results.</li>
            <li>The first day I mascaraed myself.  </li>
            <li>So upon stumbling into an old Schick FX in my medicine closet (that I must have gotten free somewhere years ago)</li>
            <li>buy a new one of the same kind.  </li>
            <li>I also say if you&#x27;re already getting a good shave with a double edge you have, don&#x27;t buy a new style for the sake of buying a new style.  </li>
            <li>Some suppliers don&#x27;t even carry the gold-plated finish and with good reason: the durability of gold-plated razors are questionable and I recommend either the Satin and Polish Nickel finishes for long-term durability (many decades).    </li>
            <li>Then too it is too big -- good luck with shaving your upper lip.</li>
            <li>For my initial shave I set it on \\&quot;1\\&quot; (least aggressive), and got an absolutely wonderful shave, with no nicks, razor burn, or any discomfort at all.  </li>
            <li>My first razor was a simple Merkur- quite light but able enough</li>
            <li>First, I actually did notice a flaw on this razor but it can be easily mitigated once user knows about it.</li>
            <li>I look forward to a long life of comfortable shaving!</li>
            <li>it is well-fitted with large sturdy-looking parts.  </li>
            <li>the next one in the pack always works just fine.</li>
            <li>This type of razor takes a few months to perfect and it brings quite a few nicks with it</li>
            <li>i got this for my boyfriend for xmas and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>really don&#x27;t understand how some guys here have gotten \\&quot;the closest shave of my life\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Also, the handle is weighted, so you have to allow the razor to do all the work, or you run the real risk of filleting your face.  </li>
            <li>But I really got the hang of it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really that voluptuous a feeling.</li>
            <li>Preparation and technique are important,  but after three weeks with this razor (using the same blade that it came with)</li>
            <li>, I thought I was using way too much pressure</li>
            <li>I have spent most of that time using an electric razor Panasonic and Braun.    </li>
            <li>I encourage FNG&#x27;s to embrace the whole shaving experience;</li>
            <li>which is very therapeutic for me now, it improves my day.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really know why that practice has been lost.    </li>
            <li>You have no idea how much this has improved my life.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be saving so much money on blades, why not?</li>
            <li>From the picture it might look like the non-grove handle, smooth is \\&quot;slippery when wet\\&quot; but this couldn&#x27;t be further from the truth.</li>
            <li>with the Merkur brush is a real treat.</li>
            <li>And not the kind of heavy</li>
            <li>It just isn&#x27;t close to the same level of quality of the adjustable merkur or the original.</li>
            <li>Like many other guys on this board, I had the Mach3.</li>
            <li>The razor is made of high quality stainless steel and feels very substantial in your hand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a young guy that grew up with his first razor being a Mach III.  </li>
            <li>the wet shave thing, it only costs $10 more a year, but the quality of the shave is worth it.  </li>
            <li>Really close, clean shave with a pretty quick learning curve (only a few nicks on my first go).</li>
            <li>I learned that most people like it between one and one and a half.  </li>
            <li>So for the next week I went back to a 2.5 and did it more consistantly, still gave me a crappy shave.  </li>
            <li>this particular razor, the user can adjust the blade angle based on beard type and coarseness.</li>
            <li>I found that the Panasonic gave me the best shaves because I could wet shave with it; unknowingly I had stumbled upon the secret of shaving - wetness.</li>
            <li>and this particular model kept showing up as &#x27;highly recommended&#x27;</li>
            <li>Get a soft toothbrush, and gently brush the bumps 2-3 times a day.</li>
            <li>It was worth the price, too, because it is the same cost as 4 sets of Fusion replacements.  </li>
            <li>I replaced it with a fresh blade from my existing stock (same brand, Merkur Platinum) and it made all the difference in the world.  </li>
            <li>Remember maneuvering that new 5-blade Gillette razor on your lip?</li>
            <li>Based on the reviews, I thought this would be a must have item as I&#x27;m in the military and need a clean shave every day.  </li>
            <li>The futuristic-looking ergonomic handle is just stable when wet as a traditional grooved handle (in my opinion, even more stable).    </li>
            <li>I must first describe how the razor works: to change blades, you must lift the head by pulling it up and then putting in a new blade, and then pushing the head back into place.</li>
            <li>If word gets out how much better of a shave you will get as well as the money you will save, the rest of the razor industry is in trouble!  </li>
            <li>This is my first double edge safety razor.  </li>
            <li>It beats the heck out of my dad&#x27;s old Gilette (which he still uses after 50 years!)</li>
            <li>In addition, this particular razor is constructed of solid stainless steel.</li>
            <li>I use new razors frequently, Truefit and Hill shaving cream, and apply it with a silver tip badger tail brush.  </li>
            <li>I also have a hard time defining my goatee since I go for very straight and clean lines.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 1 adjustment is between a 6 and 7 on an old Gillette.  </li>
            <li>I concurr with everything you&#x27;ve read so far, with one additional note.  </li>
            <li>(how far can it go?)</li>
            <li>The only problem is that I do take much longer to shave now than I did before.</li>
            <li>old.   </li>
            <li>That discomfort has now been eliminated thanks to my double edge razor.    </li>
            <li>I use short strokes I really try to like the razor, but I just don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>At fifty cents a blade this is a wonderfully economical way to shave after the initial investment in the razor, which barring earthquake, fire, or apocalypse should last a lifetime.</li>
            <li>First off, this is likely the last razor you will ever need to purchase.</li>
            <li>I have become more and more disappointed in the ransom I have to pay for Mach III blades.  </li>
            <li>The main difference between this razor and shaving with cartridges, is that you actually feel the blade against your face (as opposed to a chunk of plastic).</li>
            <li>I assure you, even if it takes a few days to get the technique down, you will be thrilled with this razor.</li>
            <li>I recently realized that while my wife spends hundreds on high quality skin care products for us, I was still using throw away razors.  </li>
            <li>Second, I highly recommend you buy an adjustable razors (like the one).</li>
            <li>Initial learning curve is high coming from run-of-the-mill razors, but stick with it..</li>
            <li>I have tried many other razors and have always had trouble getting a close shave without razor burn.</li>
            <li>suggest starting out with an old Gillette or a Merkur HD before you try the Futur.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re double edge gets old...</li>
            <li>have read reviews for this razor by people who, apparently, weren&#x27;t trained to shave.  </li>
            <li>The problem with my old razor was that it ALWAYS gave me skin irritation and didn&#x27;t allow me to shave often enough.</li>
            <li>I thought it was my technique as this razor is far heavier than my last one</li>
            <li>The trick I use is to hold the razor lightly near the head with my thumb and forefinger and let the razor follow the curves by itself in short passes.  </li>
            <li>I finally settled on Sensor 3 -- at nearly 2 bucks a blade.</li>
            <li>No longer will I subject my face to double bladed plastic toys that not only cut off twice as much hair, but also scrape away twice as much</li>
            <li>about 2 months ago, I gave it a shot (because my Braun just sucks overall) and bless my soul, it was not bad!</li>
            <li>Super soft, holds a ton of water, and results in a thick lather.</li>
            <li>Visually everything looked OK but taking the guard off and snapping it back on (hard!)</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using the safety razor for several months now, I recently tried my Mach3 for old time&#x27;s sake.</li>
            <li>Like many, I was tired of blowing dough on Mach 3 cartridges that I could only get a week or two out of before they started tearing my face up.</li>
            <li>When you first start out shaving, you will get a little nicked here &amp; there.</li>
            <li>First, it is too heavy.</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous at first with no experience useing a double edge razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please note: as stated above the brush smells a little \\&quot;badgery\\&quot; at first, but it goes away.</li>
            <li>I have a heavy beard and large pores.  </li>
            <li>After reading several of the other reviews, I was careful my first weeks with this razor.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Awesome Razor.</li>
            <li> he says it&#x27;s the best razor he&#x27;s ever had and</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the best razor I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Combined with a badger hair brush and cream, it is perfect.</li>
            <li> and I get the best shaves</li>
            <li> Happy shaving!</li>
            <li> Great buy!</li>
            <li> Excellent razor!  </li>
            <li> it is just AWESOME for me!</li>
            <li> Warning, though:  don&#x27;t keep going over and over an area trying to &#x60;perfect&#x27; the shave.  </li>
            <li> The shave is excellent.  </li>
            <li> I am now getting the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.    </li>
            <li> The quality of the razor itself is excellent:  </li>
            <li> I am very happy I bought this razor and will be using it from now on.</li>
            <li> AN EXCELLENT RAZOR!!!</li>
            <li> THE BEST I&#x27;VE EVER USED!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shaving is awesome, and I literally look forward to it.</li>
            <li> I took a shower (and my time) and had a very good shave on setting &#x60;1&#x27; with no nicks at all.  </li>
            <li> Good luck!</li>
            <li> You paid a lot of money and got a beautiful work of sculpture.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Leaving the razor around 1 or 1 1/2 seems to work great</li>
            <li> 100% happy with my decision.</li>
            <li> (it feels great).</li>
            <li> Again, use quality shaving products and your skin will feel great and refreshed after a shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it works alright and looks/feels great.  </li>
            <li> Anyone who has had a shave with a barber knows how great this</li>
            <li> /&gt;Get a good brush too.</li>
            <li> I do not hesitate to recommend this Razor to anyone that will take time to develop good shaving technique.    </li>
            <li> Which is good, because you need to let the razor do the work -- NO PRESSURE, OR YOU WILL TAKE OFF YOU FACE).</li>
            <li> The quality and workmanship is top notch!</li>
            <li> sure to buy a styptic and some Merkur blades while you&#x27;re at it!</li>
            <li> YOU WILL LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li> Another warning:  be sure to push the guard fully on!  </li>
            <li> face is now totally smooth, something I haven&#x27;t experienced in decades.</li>
            <li> The cost saving over the long-run (heck, the mid-run) is amazing since the replacement blades work out to about a quarter per blade (20 blades [double-sided] per $5.00 pack).</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;The nicest feature of this amazing razor is that it allows you to adjust the closeness of the blade.</li>
            <li> I was almost put off by reviews suggesting that the Merkur Futur wasn&#x27;t a good \\&quot;beginner&#x27;s razor\\&quot;, and that it would be better to start with something cheaper and</li>
            <li> a good shaving cream - Aveda&#x27;s seems to be the best one that I have used so far.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s more to a good shave than just the tool.</li>
            <li> so I had a nice bit of sandpaper by the afternoon when the razor arrived.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll soon be getting a nice close shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li> The Merkur Futur impressed me so much that I want to share this information with everyone:    </li>
            <li> The adjustable razor is superior because it give the user the most control to determine the closeness of the shave they desire.</li>
            <li> The stability of this 4.0 ounce  razor is perhaps its best asset (after being adjustable) and it makes shaving a lot easier, more fun, and even faster (one stroke is all it takes).</li>
            <li> WELL WORTH IT!!!</li>
            <li> While Merkur has an incredible reputation among wet shavers, this model isn&#x27;t very good in use.    </li>
            <li> I use it with Derby&#x27;s, not too happy with the Merkur blades, my setting right now is 1.</li>
            <li> It is well balanced, it is easy to handle, just keep the shave cream off your shaving hand dude!</li>
            <li> And the device itself is a beautiful work of engineering, stainless steel, no plastic parts.</li>
            <li> For me right between 1 and 2 is best, any higher and the shave is too close.</li>
            <li> I even shave my head with it :)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for about 6 months and love it.</li>
            <li> - you will be able to play with the settings until you get it</li>
            <li> the shaves are better than a Mach III without any irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> The quality of this thing is top notch.  </li>
            <li> The user reviews on the Merkur were all outstanding, so I decided to give it a go.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Actually I have encountered most of the problems that Robert Charlton has already mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The blades are very inexpensive, making this a great investment...</li>
            <li> Now...it does do my neck better.  </li>
            <li> The reason is this: Since there is no lubricating strip on the razors, I have to constantly use more shaving cream to keep the face lubricated if I want to get that perfect shave.</li>
            <li> , more care is needed to prevent injury with a razor like this, but if you want the quality, you have to put the time, the effort and (sometimes)</li>
            <li> and It was ok.    </li>
            <li> &quot; I am going to order a the most maligned DE razor on the internet;</li>
            <li> In my short DE experience it has delivered the best shaves of my lifetime.</li>
            <li> and I got a better shave on the least-aggressive setting than I ever did with the Mach III.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;And when you go to buy safety razors at $0.50 a piece, you&#x27;ll be glad you made the switch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried changing to better shave creams, oils, etc.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve on this blade, so better to under-shave then to over-shave and get razor burn and cuts.</li>
            <li> * Check the Mens Essentials web site for more reviews and info.</li>
            <li> The highest setting \\&quot;6\\&quot; gives the most exposure of the blade to the skin, giving a harsher, but closer shave.</li>
            <li> Setting \\&quot;2\\&quot; is a favorite among many users including myself.    </li>
            <li> The top unsnaps from both sides.</li>
            <li> The razor looks great and has a good feel, but I don&#x27;t think it does as well as my ten dollar</li>
            <li> It was okay.</li>
            <li> the process should be more enjoyable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;In sum, this razor adds an old-school, refreshing routine to my mornings.</li>
            <li> I love it, and would whole-heartedly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I learned my dad was right; all it takes for a great shave is a good safety razor, a decent brush, shaving soap and a mug.</li>
            <li> It was pretty good.</li>
            <li> After having great success with the Merkur Classic I decided to own up and get the Futur.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the other magic ingredient of a perfect shave.</li>
            <li> I just worry that over the years, the cover will stop fitting securely and I&#x27;ll end up with a wobbly blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Technique is the most important part of using any DE shaver, go online and study those youtube vids.</li>
            <li> It is of excellent German craftsmanship and quality and worth the price.</li>
            <li> With a Safety razor like Merkur&#x27;s my face gets an easy shave that is smoother than any razor I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use but does take some skill around your chin.  </li>
            <li> A superior shaving tool and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Among many aspects I really, really like about the Merkur experience, what nobody here&#x27;s mentioned is the sound of shaving with it, which is kind of a bristly, metallic remix of traffic on raindamp asphalt.</li>
            <li> Mine is set at one and a half and it gives me a perfect shave every time.</li>
            <li> If this is your first double edge razor I strongly recommed it, however, don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re going to be able to get a perfect shave right out of the box.  </li>
            <li> So when it is run under hot water, it gets warm and the thermal mass keeps it warm, an extra nice touch.</li>
            <li> It is well balanced, comfortable and finely crafted,--and as an added bonus, it&#x27;s adjustable.</li>
            <li> his face is as smooth as ever.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shave from this razor is so spectacular that I almost get carried away and shave my whole body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m comfortable with trying to shave as I shouldn&#x27;t feel I might drop the darn thing.  </li>
            <li> They will really help you develop your own style, for your face.    </li>
            <li> As others have said, use a light touch and let the razor do the work.  </li>
            <li> My pinky finger rests lightly on the hilt.  </li>
            <li> Mercedes precise -- without a blade in the thing.  </li>
            <li> it is as close and smooth a shave as I have ever had.</li>
            <li> the effort is completely worth it!</li>
            <li> A great shave takes a little more commitment than just breaking out a can of foam and a disposable razor.  </li>
            <li> you cut yourself, I&#x27;d look for some of the pre-shave oils that are available and/or use a high-quality shaving cream that provides adequate lubrication.</li>
            <li> Just remember there are many other factors that contribute to a good shave, not just the razor.    </li>
            <li> I was super excited because I thought to myself, \\&quot;shoot</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and I have had no problems with that since getting this amazing razor.  </li>
            <li> I recently received a Fusion razor and loved that, until I went to replace the blades.  </li>
            <li> I have a remington electric razor (series 7526) which gets 100s of times closer than the Mach 3 or Excel, but it for some reason does not do a good job on my neck - only my face.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not consider this as a full solution if you have shaving issues as I do.  </li>
            <li> I get a way better shave using my merkur classic</li>
            <li> but wow, this thing delivers an incredibly close shave (currently using a setting of 3).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Merkur Hefty Classic or HD is far better designed and far safer till you&#x27;re an experienced double-edge blade shaver.</li>
            <li> I have also bloodied myself pretty good with the Mach III, including a permanent scar on the bottom of my left &#x60;cleft&#x27; where I flattened the curve with that razor.  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!</li>
            <li> Once you get used to using a double edge, moving to the Futur will be easy and an even better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> MAKE SURE TO PUSH THE HEAD IN ALL WAY UNTIL IT IS NICE AND TIGHT</li>
            <li> so tiny it didn&#x27;t need any kind of aftercare.</li>
            <li> Over the years, my skin has become more sensitive and prone to ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> Plus, the razor itself is a work of art that will last a lifetime and adds a nice aesthetic element to the morning routine.</li>
            <li> The replacement blades for this razor are fifty cents a piece and do a far better job.   </li>
            <li> many others I was looking for an alternative to the $$$ n-blade disposibles that seem to go up in price almost as frequently as gasoline.  </li>
            <li> I absorbed all I could over a 3 day period</li>
            <li> You must be quite experienced to tame this razor.    </li>
            <li> I often use my old razor for spots that didn&#x27;t get very cleanly shaven.  </li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> Still trying to find the right balance on the setting</li>
            <li> now I look shaven right to bed time.  </li>
            <li> The shave was good, but not extraordinary.  </li>
            <li> Rub a little oil on the bumps, then spend a good 20-30 seconds lathering up your beard with the brush in a clockwise motion</li>
            <li> , I just switched from Mach 3 Turbo to Merkur Futur, and my first shave resulted in one nick on my chin,</li>
            <li> /&gt;You should use lighter razors first because the Merkur cuts closer.  </li>
            <li> I started on 1 the first day to get a handle on the razor.  </li>
            <li> because if it&#x27;s supposed to be a better razor than anything before it, there shouldn&#x27;t be a learning curve from one double edge to another.  </li>
            <li> and this is the first time i have shaved with a doble edge safety razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> just week or so after using this for the first time...</li>
            <li> /&gt;After practicing with a basic (non-adjustable) model, I am getting much better results.</li>
            <li> The first day I mascaraed myself.  </li>
            <li> So upon stumbling into an old Schick FX in my medicine closet (that I must have gotten free somewhere years ago)</li>
            <li> buy a new one of the same kind.  </li>
            <li> I also say if you&#x27;re already getting a good shave with a double edge you have, don&#x27;t buy a new style for the sake of buying a new style.  </li>
            <li> Some suppliers don&#x27;t even carry the gold-plated finish and with good reason: the durability of gold-plated razors are questionable and I recommend either the Satin and Polish Nickel finishes for long-term durability (many decades).    </li>
            <li> Then too it is too big -- good luck with shaving your upper lip.</li>
            <li> For my initial shave I set it on \\&quot;1\\&quot; (least aggressive), and got an absolutely wonderful shave, with no nicks, razor burn, or any discomfort at all.  </li>
            <li> My first razor was a simple Merkur- quite light but able enough</li>
            <li> First, I actually did notice a flaw on this razor but it can be easily mitigated once user knows about it.</li>
            <li> I look forward to a long life of comfortable shaving!</li>
            <li> it is well-fitted with large sturdy-looking parts.  </li>
            <li> the next one in the pack always works just fine.</li>
            <li> This type of razor takes a few months to perfect and it brings quite a few nicks with it</li>
            <li> i got this for my boyfriend for xmas and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> really don&#x27;t understand how some guys here have gotten \\&quot;the closest shave of my life\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Also, the handle is weighted, so you have to allow the razor to do all the work, or you run the real risk of filleting your face.  </li>
            <li> But I really got the hang of it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really that voluptuous a feeling.</li>
            <li> Preparation and technique are important,  but after three weeks with this razor (using the same blade that it came with)</li>
            <li> , I thought I was using way too much pressure</li>
            <li> I have spent most of that time using an electric razor Panasonic and Braun.    </li>
            <li> I encourage FNG&#x27;s to embrace the whole shaving experience;</li>
            <li> which is very therapeutic for me now, it improves my day.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really know why that practice has been lost.    </li>
            <li> You have no idea how much this has improved my life.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be saving so much money on blades, why not?</li>
            <li> From the picture it might look like the non-grove handle, smooth is \\&quot;slippery when wet\\&quot; but this couldn&#x27;t be further from the truth.</li>
            <li> with the Merkur brush is a real treat.</li>
            <li> And not the kind of heavy</li>
            <li> It just isn&#x27;t close to the same level of quality of the adjustable merkur or the original.</li>
            <li> Like many other guys on this board, I had the Mach3.</li>
            <li> The razor is made of high quality stainless steel and feels very substantial in your hand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a young guy that grew up with his first razor being a Mach III.  </li>
            <li> the wet shave thing, it only costs $10 more a year, but the quality of the shave is worth it.  </li>
            <li> Really close, clean shave with a pretty quick learning curve (only a few nicks on my first go).</li>
            <li> I learned that most people like it between one and one and a half.  </li>
            <li> So for the next week I went back to a 2.5 and did it more consistantly, still gave me a crappy shave.  </li>
            <li> this particular razor, the user can adjust the blade angle based on beard type and coarseness.</li>
            <li> I found that the Panasonic gave me the best shaves because I could wet shave with it; unknowingly I had stumbled upon the secret of shaving - wetness.</li>
            <li> and this particular model kept showing up as &#x27;highly recommended&#x27;</li>
            <li> Get a soft toothbrush, and gently brush the bumps 2-3 times a day.</li>
            <li> It was worth the price, too, because it is the same cost as 4 sets of Fusion replacements.  </li>
            <li> I replaced it with a fresh blade from my existing stock (same brand, Merkur Platinum) and it made all the difference in the world.  </li>
            <li> Remember maneuvering that new 5-blade Gillette razor on your lip?</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews, I thought this would be a must have item as I&#x27;m in the military and need a clean shave every day.  </li>
            <li> The futuristic-looking ergonomic handle is just stable when wet as a traditional grooved handle (in my opinion, even more stable).    </li>
            <li> I must first describe how the razor works: to change blades, you must lift the head by pulling it up and then putting in a new blade, and then pushing the head back into place.</li>
            <li> If word gets out how much better of a shave you will get as well as the money you will save, the rest of the razor industry is in trouble!  </li>
            <li> This is my first double edge safety razor.  </li>
            <li> It beats the heck out of my dad&#x27;s old Gilette (which he still uses after 50 years!)</li>
            <li> In addition, this particular razor is constructed of solid stainless steel.</li>
            <li> I use new razors frequently, Truefit and Hill shaving cream, and apply it with a silver tip badger tail brush.  </li>
            <li> I also have a hard time defining my goatee since I go for very straight and clean lines.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 1 adjustment is between a 6 and 7 on an old Gillette.  </li>
            <li> I concurr with everything you&#x27;ve read so far, with one additional note.  </li>
            <li> (how far can it go?)</li>
            <li> The only problem is that I do take much longer to shave now than I did before.</li>
            <li> old.   </li>
            <li> That discomfort has now been eliminated thanks to my double edge razor.    </li>
            <li> I use short strokes I really try to like the razor, but I just don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> At fifty cents a blade this is a wonderfully economical way to shave after the initial investment in the razor, which barring earthquake, fire, or apocalypse should last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> First off, this is likely the last razor you will ever need to purchase.</li>
            <li> I have become more and more disappointed in the ransom I have to pay for Mach III blades.  </li>
            <li> The main difference between this razor and shaving with cartridges, is that you actually feel the blade against your face (as opposed to a chunk of plastic).</li>
            <li> I assure you, even if it takes a few days to get the technique down, you will be thrilled with this razor.</li>
            <li> I recently realized that while my wife spends hundreds on high quality skin care products for us, I was still using throw away razors.  </li>
            <li> Second, I highly recommend you buy an adjustable razors (like the one).</li>
            <li> Initial learning curve is high coming from run-of-the-mill razors, but stick with it..</li>
            <li> I have tried many other razors and have always had trouble getting a close shave without razor burn.</li>
            <li> suggest starting out with an old Gillette or a Merkur HD before you try the Futur.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re double edge gets old...</li>
            <li> have read reviews for this razor by people who, apparently, weren&#x27;t trained to shave.  </li>
            <li> The problem with my old razor was that it ALWAYS gave me skin irritation and didn&#x27;t allow me to shave often enough.</li>
            <li> I thought it was my technique as this razor is far heavier than my last one</li>
            <li> The trick I use is to hold the razor lightly near the head with my thumb and forefinger and let the razor follow the curves by itself in short passes.  </li>
            <li> I finally settled on Sensor 3 -- at nearly 2 bucks a blade.</li>
            <li> No longer will I subject my face to double bladed plastic toys that not only cut off twice as much hair, but also scrape away twice as much</li>
            <li> about 2 months ago, I gave it a shot (because my Braun just sucks overall) and bless my soul, it was not bad!</li>
            <li> Super soft, holds a ton of water, and results in a thick lather.</li>
            <li> Visually everything looked OK but taking the guard off and snapping it back on (hard!)</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using the safety razor for several months now, I recently tried my Mach3 for old time&#x27;s sake.</li>
            <li> Like many, I was tired of blowing dough on Mach 3 cartridges that I could only get a week or two out of before they started tearing my face up.</li>
            <li> When you first start out shaving, you will get a little nicked here &amp; there.</li>
            <li> First, it is too heavy.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous at first with no experience useing a double edge razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please note: as stated above the brush smells a little \\&quot;badgery\\&quot; at first, but it goes away.</li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard and large pores.  </li>
            <li> After reading several of the other reviews, I was careful my first weeks with this razor.</li>
            <li> If you are new to safety razors you will want to start out on one of the higher settings and gradually work your way into a closer shave to avoid unnecessary nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> I was only getting 4-5 shaves from a Fusion blade, but I can shave my face and head for at least 2-3 weeks on a single safey razor blade :) Even if I changed the blade after every shave it would still cost less than a fusion.  </li>
            <li> The price is high for a razor, but it will take you less than a year to break even if you are buying cartriges like the Gillette Fusion at $4 a pop!</li>
            <li> First of all, one cannot go &#x27;against the grain&#x27; with it, which in turn results with a so-so shave (at least for now).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The problem was limited by using the Quattro, but was eliminated by moving to a double edge safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Finally, the German designers seem to have forgotten this carries a sharp blade.  </li>
            <li> and I really think at least for me, this is the way to go.  </li>
            <li> it might seem like a lot of money to shell out now, but you will save in the long run.</li>
            <li> Smoother face and for twice as long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been exclusively wet shaving for several months, using a Merkur Trac II style razor.  </li>
            <li> have been shaving for the last 13 years wit a Gillette of one sort or the other (sensor, sensor excel, mach3...)</li>
            <li> $4+ a piece, and they last no longer than any other blade.  </li>
            <li> I am open to hearing other solutions.</li>
            <li> I use one side for one week and then the other for the second week, skipping the weekends.  </li>
            <li> Blade changing isn&#x27;t a problem if the razor and your hands are dry.  </li>
            <li> so I just wipe dry my hands and the razor on the robe or towel and change the blade.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dry shaving, shaving before I shower, shaving after I shower, etc, etc.  </li>
            <li> I seem to have pretty tough skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a replacement for the single edge Wilkinson for over three decades.</li>
            <li> But then I heard that shaving with a single blade razor would help, so I picked this one up.</li>
            <li> If you do not push it in all the way until it snaps (a very common mistake if you are not aware), the setting system won&#x27;t work properly and all your shaves be very aggressive and close, and probably cause irritation.    </li>
            <li> Quality products also last longer as you use less.</li>
            <li> I expected the package to arrive</li>
            <li> I wish I had had this razor prior to a few job interviews over the years.  </li>
            <li> While doing this, pay attention to the direction of hair growth, and make a mental note to always shave with it.</li>
            <li> Be careful.  </li>
            <li> would you need to run 3, 4, 5.. blades over your skin if one sharp blade will do the job and do it better?\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I was worried about carving myself up based on other reviews.  </li>
            <li> Thenext morning I have a beard but not nearly the heavy beard I had with the Mach III.  </li>
            <li> I also cut myself about every other time with it - never with the Mach 3.  </li>
            <li> only complaint about the razor is how the blades are changed with the snap-off cover.</li>
            <li> It is also difficult to get high up on my lip (under the nose) due to the size of the razor.  </li>
            <li> I got the technique down</li>
            <li> (Be warned, the first few times you use it, it stinks like wet badger...</li>
            <li> I typically have a &#x60;five o&#x27;clock shadow&#x27; at about 3pm:  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll have it figured out in a week or less.</li>
            <li> Not cool at 39 yrs.</li>
            <li> Nothing terrible, but I was TOO careful the first few times and left some long spots...</li>
            <li> Just be careful, go slowly,</li>
            <li> I ordered a Merkur 38c used it a few times</li>
            <li> Going slow and being careful is the trick</li>
            <li> The few times I&#x27;ve nicked myself I had let my hand slip into a hammer-grip.    </li>
            <li> The Mach3 was not a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Safety razors require technique, but after a few days, you&#x27;ll pick it up just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble with ingrown hairs, and have always used Gillete Excel type razors.</li>
            <li> razor itself is heavy...</li>
            <li> I still miss a spot now and then, but I&#x27;d definitely recommend this razor -- take it slow and give it at least a month of practice before making up your mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For starters the razor is bulking and plain heavy.  </li>
            <li> Also, you can laugh at the expensive, over advertized 4 blade razor thing with a battery!?!  </li>
            <li> No more over priced packs of blades were I would spend $15 for 8 blades.</li>
            <li> No more 5 O&#x27;clock shadow at 3 PM.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First, let your beard grow out for at least a few days.</li>
            <li> I mean heavy.</li>
            <li> If my hand was wet and soapy and I tried to pry the guard off the blade I could envision slipping and cutting my hand.  </li>
            <li> It got the job done, but there was no real joy in shaving.</li>
            <li> * Toss out the blade that comes with the razor, it&#x27;s probably dull from the packaging.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just tired of little cuts and a so-so shave.  </li>
            <li> At least not one this severe.  </li>
            <li> I have had this guy for three months now, and am really not thrilled about it.</li>
            <li> Over the next few days I wasn&#x27;t killing myself but the shaves were just painful.  </li>
            <li> a side note, I have of late noticed some quality issues with the Merkur blades.  </li>
            <li> Considering I have to do it at least once a day (twice if I&#x27;m going out at night)</li>
            <li> and I mean nothing has given me a shave like my Merkur Futur.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps one out of twenty seem to have some manufacturing defect that causes some pretty bad nicks and just an uncomfortable shave..</li>
            <li> I have used the Excel &amp; Mach for a long time, but I have a curved chin and end up cutting myself all the time with these razors.  </li>
            <li> And it ends up nicking and cutting you pretty bad.  </li>
            <li> Not a good shave, missed alot of spots and patches of hair.  </li>
            <li> but I gave myself a case of razor-burn under my nose that was painful and very obvious.  </li>
            <li> I have yet to cut myself terribly, but I did nick myself a bit the first week.</li>
            <li> It is so irritating.  </li>
            <li> I bought it thinking that the travel version could be my spare for the gym, but it is useless.</li>
            <li> I have a difficult time thinking that this unit will ever fail or need replacement.  </li>
            <li> am sorry to say that this does NOT get closer than the Remington Electric Razor.  </li>
            <li> I took the plunge and bought a Merkur Futur Razor, after years of shelling out for expensive Gillette Sensor blades.</li>
            <li> Turns out there was something wrong with the blade that came with it.  </li>
            <li> I have had a difficult time shaving ever since I began growing a beard.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps I&#x27;m doing something wrong.  </li>
            <li> I work outdoors at night in cold weather and nothing is worse than a cold face with razor burn.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Don&#x27;t be afraid to make the switch.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Lastly, rinse with cold water and balm up.</li>
            <li> Finishing up with a cold water splash, non-alcoholic toner / aftershave, and a moisturizing lotion, is an invigorating way to start the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Bad combination)</li>
            <li> I must have failed to do so and gave myself a couple of nasty nicks on my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> Very dangerous.    </li>
            <li> I tried a Mach 3, and I hated it</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was almost put off by reviews suggesting that the Merkur Futur wasn&#x27;t a good \\&quot;beginner&#x27;s razor\\&quot;, and that it would be better to start with something cheaper and easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I just switched from Mach 3 Turbo to Merkur Futur, and my first shave resulted in one nick on my chin, so tiny it didn&#x27;t need any kind of aftercare. Just be careful, go slowly, start off with the lowest closeness setting, and you&#x27;ll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face is now totally smooth, something I haven&#x27;t experienced in decades. No razor burn. And the device itself is a beautiful work of engineering, stainless steel, no plastic parts. I expect it&#x27;ll last the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get a good brush too. That&#x27;s the other magic ingredient of a perfect shave.</li>
            <li> The quality and workmanship is top notch! The price is high for a razor, but it will take you less than a year to break even if you are buying cartriges like the Gillette Fusion at $4 a pop! And it will last you a lifetime.  Replacement blades for the razor run about 50 cents each and last a hole lot longer! I was only getting 4-5 shaves from a Fusion blade, but I can shave my face and head for at least 2-3 weeks on a single safey razor blade :) Even if I changed the blade after every shave it would still cost less than a fusion.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It takes some getting used to. I got a few minor nicks when I first started using it, but now I never get any.  I even shave my head with it :)  I&#x27;ve had mine for about 6 months and love it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I suggest starting out on the #1 setting and work your way up. For me right between 1 and 2 is best, any higher and the shave is too close.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other razors and have always had trouble getting a close shave without razor burn. This Razor finally did it! Some tips: 1) get the adjustable version - you will be able to play with the settings until you get it just right. 2) use only merkur blades - they are sharper and last longer than the standard grocery-store variety. 3)Don&#x27;t buy the travel razor. It just isn&#x27;t close to the same level of quality of the adjustable merkur or the original. I bought it thinking that the travel version could be my spare for the gym, but it is useless. 4) Use a good shaving cream - Aveda&#x27;s seems to be the best one that I have used so far. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a young guy that grew up with his first razor being a Mach III.  Over the years, my skin has become more sensitive and prone to ingrown hairs.  The problem was limited by using the Quattro, but was eliminated by moving to a double edge safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest starting out with an old Gillette or a Merkur HD before you try the Futur.  Once you get used to using a double edge, moving to the Futur will be easy and an even better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should use lighter razors first because the Merkur cuts closer.  It&#x27;s 1 adjustment is between a 6 and 7 on an old Gillette.  However, once you get used to it - the shaves are better than a Mach III without any irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to buy a styptic and some Merkur blades while you&#x27;re at it!</li>
            <li> Awesome Razor. I save a lot of money of razor blades now too! No more over priced packs of blades were I would spend $15 for 8 blades.</li>
            <li> i got this for my boyfriend for xmas and he absolutely loves it. he says it&#x27;s the best razor he&#x27;s ever had and his face is as smooth as ever. he likes shaving now.</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the best razor I have ever owned. Combined with a badger hair brush and cream, it is perfect. In addition, this particular razor is constructed of solid stainless steel. So when it is run under hot water, it gets warm and the thermal mass keeps it warm, an extra nice touch. It is of excellent German craftsmanship and quality and worth the price. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The shave from this razor is so spectacular that I almost get carried away and shave my whole body. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Just wanted to toss in my comments.  I&#x27;ve been using my Futur for about two months and I love it.  I concurr with everything you&#x27;ve read so far, with one additional note.  The quality of this thing is top notch.  I have a difficult time thinking that this unit will ever fail or need replacement.  This is one of those things that it seems will never need to be replaced. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Do the wet shave thing, it only costs $10 more a year, but the quality of the shave is worth it.  No more 5 O&#x27;clock shadow at 3 PM.  I actually like shaving now. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> After reading several of the other reviews, I was careful my first weeks with this razor. I have yet to cut myself terribly, but I did nick myself a bit the first week. Nothing terrible, but I was TOO careful the first few times and left some long spots... trying to rectify that by cranking the razor from 1 to 3 is when I nicked myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaving the razor around 1 or 1 1/2 seems to work great and I get the best shaves I&#x27;ve ever had -- after just 3 weeks or practice. I still miss a spot now and then, but I&#x27;d definitely recommend this razor -- take it slow and give it at least a month of practice before making up your mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you cut yourself, I&#x27;d look for some of the pre-shave oils that are available and/or use a high-quality shaving cream that provides adequate lubrication.</li>
            <li> After having great success with the Merkur Classic I decided to own up and get the Futur.  I was super excited because I thought to myself, \\&quot;shoot, one pass instead of two...\\&quot;  Not quite.  For starters the razor is bulking and plain heavy.  And not the kind of heavy I&#x27;m comfortable with trying to shave as I shouldn&#x27;t feel I might drop the darn thing.  I started on 1 the first day to get a handle on the razor.  Not a good shave, missed alot of spots and patches of hair.  So day two I went to level 2 on the razor.  Same story, second verse.  It left patches and didn&#x27;t shave well in some areas.  2.5 the areas got smaller but still...they were there.  Went to a 3 setting on the razor and almost mangled myself.  So for the next week I went back to a 2.5 and did it more consistantly, still gave me a crappy shave.  I give this one star because if it&#x27;s supposed to be a better razor than anything before it, there shouldn&#x27;t be a learning curve from one double edge to another.  At least not one this severe.  I get a way better shave using my merkur classic and I really think at least for me, this is the way to go.  I say use caution on the Merkur Futur.  I also say if you&#x27;re already getting a good shave with a double edge you have, don&#x27;t buy a new style for the sake of buying a new style.  If you&#x27;re double edge gets old...buy a new one of the same kind.  Only a suggestion.</li>
            <li> Like many, I was tired of blowing dough on Mach 3 cartridges that I could only get a week or two out of before they started tearing my face up. When they came out with the 5-bladed Fusion monstrosity, I knew it was time to opt out of the mainstream safety razor merry-go-round. The user reviews on the Merkur were all outstanding, so I decided to give it a go. 100% happy with my decision. Really close, clean shave with a pretty quick learning curve (only a few nicks on my first go). The cost saving over the long-run (heck, the mid-run) is amazing since the replacement blades work out to about a quarter per blade (20 blades [double-sided] per $5.00 pack). Plus, the razor itself is a work of art that will last a lifetime and adds a nice aesthetic element to the morning routine. If you&#x27;re thinking about getting out from under the Mach 3/Fusion 5 (how far can it go?) B.S., go Merkur.</li>
            <li> I have had this guy for three months now, and am really not thrilled about it. First of all, one cannot go &#x27;against the grain&#x27; with it, which in turn results with a so-so shave (at least for now).&lt;br /&gt;I have been shaving for the last 13 years wit a Gillette of one sort or the other (sensor, sensor excel, mach3...) and this is the first time i have shaved with a doble edge safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;Actually I have encountered most of the problems that Robert Charlton has already mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t understand how some guys here have gotten \\&quot;the closest shave of my life\\&quot; just week or so after using this for the first time...&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, if i get a breakthrough with this razor i will change this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;After practicing with a basic (non-adjustable) model, I am getting much better results. I guess that the beard also needs to adjust to a different way of shaving, since I have found that it is much more difficult to shave  with a Gillette razor.</li>
            <li> I recently realized that while my wife spends hundreds on high quality skin care products for us, I was still using throw away razors.  I recently received a Fusion razor and loved that, until I went to replace the blades.  $4+ a piece, and they last no longer than any other blade.  So, I got online and researched shaving and what I learned was that, though there have been advances in shaving technology, nothing has been improved, only made more expensive.  I learned my dad was right; all it takes for a great shave is a good safety razor, a decent brush, shaving soap and a mug. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I received my razor a couple of days ago and now, I wake up eager to take a shower and shave.  Nothing has ever cut this close without giving me razor burn.  My skin is sensitive and I have had no problems with that since getting this amazing razor.  It was worth the price, too, because it is the same cost as 4 sets of Fusion replacements.  The replacement blades for this razor are fifty cents a piece and do a far better job.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have read reviews for this razor by people who, apparently, weren&#x27;t trained to shave.  This razor will not cut against the grain.  Also, the handle is weighted, so you have to allow the razor to do all the work, or you run the real risk of filleting your face.  Be patient.  A great shave takes a little more commitment than just breaking out a can of foam and a disposable razor.  Let the razor do the work.  I assure you, even if it takes a few days to get the technique down, you will be thrilled with this razor. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The nicest feature of this amazing razor is that it allows you to adjust the closeness of the blade. I learned that most people like it between one and one and a half.  Mine is set at one and a half and it gives me a perfect shave every time. Until now, I didn&#x27;t know that such a thing was even possible.  Happy shaving!</li>
            <li> First off, this is likely the last razor you will ever need to purchase. The razor is made of high quality stainless steel and feels very substantial in your hand. The blades are very inexpensive, making this a great investment... it might seem like a lot of money to shell out now, but you will save in the long run. There is a bit of a learning curve though. If you are new to safety razors you will want to start out on one of the higher settings and gradually work your way into a closer shave to avoid unnecessary nicks and cuts. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Excellent razor!  I was a little nervous at first with no experience useing a double edge razor. But I really got the hang of it the SECOND TIME I USED IT!  Wife loves it, too! Smoother face and for twice as long.  I look forward to a long life of comfortable shaving! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> unless you&#x27;ve let someone lather you up and take a straightedge razor to your throat. It&#x27;s really that voluptuous a feeling. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Among many aspects I really, really like about the Merkur experience, what nobody here&#x27;s mentioned is the sound of shaving with it, which is kind of a bristly, metallic remix of traffic on raindamp asphalt. A sensual pleasure all around - and a nonpareil shave.</li>
            <li> I purchased this model (June, 2006) after trying to find an alternative solution to razor burn.  I have used the Excel &amp; Mach for a long time, but I have a curved chin and end up cutting myself all the time with these razors.  They also give me razor burn around my adam&#x27;s apple.  I have a remington electric razor (series 7526) which gets 100s of times closer than the Mach 3 or Excel, but it for some reason does not do a good job on my neck - only my face.  After reading the reviews on here, I was convinced this would be my solution. &lt;br /&gt;I am sorry to say that this does NOT get closer than the Remington Electric Razor.  No way, no how.  And it ends up nicking and cutting you pretty bad.  To the point where I&#x27;ve never had to wear a band-aid after shaving until now.  I&#x27;ve tried it several times, and it just cannot get closer than the electric.  Now...it does do my neck better.  So...I have to resort to a two part shaving system: electric for face and chin; Safety razor for neck.  &lt;br /&gt;Do not consider this as a full solution if you have shaving issues as I do.  I am open to hearing other solutions.</li>
            <li> I took the plunge and bought a Merkur Futur Razor, after years of shelling out for expensive Gillette Sensor blades. The problem with my old razor was that it ALWAYS gave me skin irritation and didn&#x27;t allow me to shave often enough. With a Safety razor like Merkur&#x27;s my face gets an easy shave that is smoother than any razor I&#x27;ve used before. My fiance agrees as well. The only problem is that I do take much longer to shave now than I did before. The reason is this: Since there is no lubricating strip on the razors, I have to constantly use more shaving cream to keep the face lubricated if I want to get that perfect shave. I also have a hard time defining my goatee since I go for very straight and clean lines.</li>
            <li> If word gets out how much better of a shave you will get as well as the money you will save, the rest of the razor industry is in trouble!  I have a heavy beard and large pores.  (Bad combination) The double, triple, or whatever they are up to now would work for one shave, the blades would clog up and then cause acne.  Not cool at 39 yrs. old.   &lt;br /&gt;This makes shaving a pleasure, the razor is well made, has some weight and is adjustable.  I would recommend starting on a 1 and going from there.  (I like a 1.5) It&#x27;s easy to use but does take some skill around your chin.  I use one side for one week and then the other for the second week, skipping the weekends.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Do your face and wallet a favor, get this thing!  YOU WILL LOVE IT!  Also, you can laugh at the expensive, over advertized 4 blade razor thing with a battery!?!  Come on! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Without a doubt this is the finest razor I have ever used! It is well balanced, comfortable and finely crafted,--and as an added bonus, it&#x27;s adjustable. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Like many others I was looking for an alternative to the $$$ n-blade disposibles that seem to go up in price almost as frequently as gasoline.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was searching through sites on shaving equipment, techniques, etc. and this particular model kept showing up as &#x27;highly recommended&#x27; so I decided to give it a try.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With this particular razor, the user can adjust the blade angle based on beard type and coarseness. The construction is very solid, so there is no flexing, or twisting when shaving and the satin finish allows it to just glide along the skin and the whole body is fairly heavy, so almost no pressure is needed to shave. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Granted...there&#x27;s more to a good shave than just the tool. Preparation and technique are important,  but after three weeks with this razor (using the same blade that it came with) I still only need one pass to go from stubble to smoothe skin! ...with no knicks or cuts! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the razor blades themselves? About $30 for 100 blades instead of about $30 for just 16 cartridges. ...and each blade lasts longer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yes, more care is needed to prevent injury with a razor like this, but if you want the quality, you have to put the time, the effort and (sometimes) the money in.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As someone else has said,\\&quot;Why would you need to run 3, 4, 5.. blades over your skin if one sharp blade will do the job and do it better?\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with DE safety razors for about a year after that 5 bladed monstrosity came out.  My first razor was a simple Merkur- quite light but able enough but I was itching to try an adjustable.  I got the Futur for Christmas.  The first day I mascaraed myself.  I thought it was my technique as this razor is far heavier than my last one, I thought I was using way too much pressure (let the razor do the work).  Over the next few days I wasn&#x27;t killing myself but the shaves were just painful.  Turns out there was something wrong with the blade that came with it.  I replaced it with a fresh blade from my existing stock (same brand, Merkur Platinum) and it made all the difference in the world.  Still trying to find the right balance on the setting but wow, this thing delivers an incredibly close shave (currently using a setting of 3).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about the razor is how the blades are changed with the snap-off cover. I just worry that over the years, the cover will stop fitting securely and I&#x27;ll end up with a wobbly blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, I have of late noticed some quality issues with the Merkur blades.  Perhaps one out of twenty seem to have some manufacturing defect that causes some pretty bad nicks and just an uncomfortable shave.. the next one in the pack always works just fine.</li>
            <li> I had been shaving for about 20 years and finally come to the conclusion that I did not know what the hell I was doing. I have spent most of that time using an electric razor Panasonic and Braun.    I found that the Panasonic gave me the best shaves because I could wet shave with it; unknowingly I had stumbled upon the secret of shaving - wetness. Of course It took about 8 years to realize this. So upon stumbling into an old Schick FX in my medicine closet (that I must have gotten free somewhere years ago) about 2 months ago, I gave it a shot (because my Braun just sucks overall) and bless my soul, it was not bad! So I figured a newer model would just be the bomb so I hit Amazon.    That is where I discovered DE shaving. I absorbed all I could over a 3 day period and I just had to give it a shot. I ordered a Merkur 38c used it a few times and It was ok.    That was when i said \\&quot;screw it\\&quot; I am going to order a the most maligned DE razor on the internet; the dreaded Merkur Futur.    I do not know what those people were complaining about it is just AWESOME for me! It is well balanced, it is easy to handle, just keep the shave cream off your shaving hand dude! I just use both hands. Technique is the most important part of using any DE shaver, go online and study those youtube vids. They will really help you develop your own style, for your face.    In my short DE experience it has delivered the best shaves of my lifetime. I use it with Derby&#x27;s, not too happy with the Merkur blades, my setting right now is 1. Yes 1.    I do not hesitate to recommend this Razor to anyone that will take time to develop good shaving technique.    Just remember there are many other factors that contribute to a good shave, not just the razor.    I encourage FNG&#x27;s to embrace the whole shaving experience; which is very therapeutic for me now, it improves my day.</li>
            <li> I have become more and more disappointed in the ransom I have to pay for Mach III blades.  The shave was good, but not extraordinary.  I found the Futur razor after getting the notion that I should give double-edged safety razors a try.  My Dad used a double edge and I don&#x27;t really know why that practice has been lost.    I bought the Futur and 30 Merkur blades, a badger brush and a tube of the Poraso soap from Perect Beauty/Amazon.  I didn&#x27;t shave the morning I expected the package to arrive so I had a nice bit of sandpaper by the afternoon when the razor arrived.  Time to get to work.    I have a coarse beard and an angular face with a cleft chin.  I was worried about carving myself up based on other reviews.  I took a shower (and my time) and had a very good shave on setting &#x60;1&#x27; with no nicks at all.  Going slow and being careful is the trick and I got a better shave on the least-aggressive setting than I ever did with the Mach III.  I have also bloodied myself pretty good with the Mach III, including a permanent scar on the bottom of my left &#x60;cleft&#x27; where I flattened the curve with that razor.  That cut didn&#x27;t even stop bleeding with a Band-Aid; I had to use gauze and tape.  Speed was a factor there.    As of this writing I have had the razor just over a month.  I am using a setting of &#x60;3&#x27; on my cheeks and neck and &#x60;2&#x27; under my nose and on my chin.  The head of the Futur is indeed big but not noticeably bigger than the Mach III.   Warning, though:  don&#x27;t keep going over and over an area trying to &#x60;perfect&#x27; the shave.  If you don&#x27;t get it in three passes MOVE ON.  I seem to have pretty tough skin but I gave myself a case of razor-burn under my nose that was painful and very obvious.  I looked like I had a first-degree burn under my nose and I haven&#x27;t made that mistake since.    The shave is excellent.  My wife has commented several times on the quality of the shave.  I typically have a &#x60;five o&#x27;clock shadow&#x27; at about 3pm:  now I look shaven right to bed time.  Thenext morning I have a beard but not nearly the heavy beard I had with the Mach III.  I wish I had had this razor prior to a few job interviews over the years.  I am now getting the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.    As others have said, use a light touch and let the razor do the work.  The trick I use is to hold the razor lightly near the head with my thumb and forefinger and let the razor follow the curves by itself in short passes.  My pinky finger rests lightly on the hilt.  The few times I&#x27;ve nicked myself I had let my hand slip into a hammer-grip.    Blade changing isn&#x27;t a problem if the razor and your hands are dry.  If my hand was wet and soapy and I tried to pry the guard off the blade I could envision slipping and cutting my hand.  I shave in either a robe or a towel around my waist so I just wipe dry my hands and the razor on the robe or towel and change the blade.  Another warning:  be sure to push the guard fully on!  I must have failed to do so and gave myself a couple of nasty nicks on my face and neck.  Visually everything looked OK but taking the guard off and snapping it back on (hard!) solved the problem.    The quality of the razor itself is excellent:  it is well-fitted with large sturdy-looking parts.  I am very happy I bought this razor and will be using it from now on.</li>
            <li> This is my first double edge safety razor.  I have had a difficult time shaving ever since I began growing a beard.  I get razor rash, razor burn and irritation like you wouldn&#x27;t believe.  I&#x27;ve tried dry shaving, shaving before I shower, shaving after I shower, etc, etc.  I&#x27;ve tried electric razors, disposable razors, 3 blade, 4 blade and even 5 blade razors.    Nothing, and I mean nothing has given me a shave like my Merkur Futur.  I no longer suffer from razor burn, rash or irritation.  You have no idea how much this has improved my life.  I work outdoors at night in cold weather and nothing is worse than a cold face with razor burn.  It is so irritating.  That discomfort has now been eliminated thanks to my double edge razor.    If this is your first double edge razor I strongly recommed it, however, don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re going to be able to get a perfect shave right out of the box.  This type of razor takes a few months to perfect and it brings quite a few nicks with it but once you get the hang of it nothing can beat it. [...]    If you buy this razor be patient with it and start on the 1st setting.  I believe it has a total of 6 settings.  I&#x27;ve been using for ten months now and I&#x27;m still on the 1st setting but my shave is so close I don&#x27;t see any need to go further.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a replacement for the single edge Wilkinson for over three decades. At last my search is over! No longer will I subject my face to double bladed plastic toys that not only cut off twice as much hair, but also scrape away twice as much skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Merkur is one burly blade, hefty but well balanced. It beats the heck out of my dad&#x27;s old Gilette (which he still uses after 50 years!) and the only time that I managed to nick myself is when the cat ran across my feet while I was shaving. A superior shaving tool and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Like many other guys on this board, I had the Mach3. I even got duped into buying the Mach3 Power. I was mortified when I saw the cost of replacement blades for the Mach3 Power, and the shave was no closer than the regular Mach3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to ditch it &amp; go traditional. I got the Futur razor, Merkur blades, Geo. F. Trumper shaving cream, and a badger shaving brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the safety razor for several months now, I recently tried my Mach3 for old time&#x27;s sake. The Mach3 was not a smooth shave. I felt each of the 3 blades dragging across my skin. It was horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be afraid to make the switch. When you first start out shaving, you will get a little nicked here &amp; there. Safety razors require technique, but after a few days, you&#x27;ll pick it up just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And when you go to buy safety razors at $0.50 a piece, you&#x27;ll be glad you made the switch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble with ingrown hairs, and have always used Gillete Excel type razors. I&#x27;ve tried changing to better shave creams, oils, etc. but with only marginal improvement. But then I heard that shaving with a single blade razor would help, so I picked this one up. Now my ingrown hairs are gone. Here&#x27;s how I did it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;First, let your beard grow out for at least a few days. While doing this, pay attention to the direction of hair growth, and make a mental note to always shave with it. For example, the hairs at the bottom of my neck grow up towards the chin, so I shave up there. Get a soft toothbrush, and gently brush the bumps 2-3 times a day. This exfoliates the skin, and helps lift the hairs out. I also used some Bump Stopper, which you can pick up at a Walgreens. Next, pick up some quality after shave balm, and put some on 2-3 times a day to help healing and soothe it out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For the shave, do yourself a favor and pick up a shaving brush and some quality pre-shave oil and shaving soap/cream (I like Art of Shaving products - lavender). Rub a little oil on the bumps, then spend a good 20-30 seconds lathering up your beard with the brush in a clockwise motion (it feels great). Now, shave with short strokes, rinsing the blade often, and take your time. There&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve on this blade, so better to under-shave then to over-shave and get razor burn and cuts. Keep at it and you&#x27;ll have it figured out in a week or less. You&#x27;ll soon be getting a nice close shave with no irritation. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lastly, rinse with cold water and balm up. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Other tips:  &lt;br /&gt;* Toss out the blade that comes with the razor, it&#x27;s probably dull from the packaging.  &lt;br /&gt;* This blade is adjustable, I find it works well around 4. Start off around there, and keep an eye on it because if you tap the razor a lot, it&#x27;ll move. &lt;br /&gt;* If possible, shave in the shower. Buy one of those mirror that de-fogs itself and mounts on the showerhead. &lt;br /&gt;* Again, use quality shaving products and your skin will feel great and refreshed after a shave. You&#x27;ll be saving so much money on blades, why not? Quality products also last longer as you use less. &lt;br /&gt;* Check the Mens Essentials web site for more reviews and info.</li>
            <li> The Merkur Futur impressed me so much that I want to share this information with everyone:    First, I actually did notice a flaw on this razor but it can be easily mitigated once user knows about it. I must first describe how the razor works: to change blades, you must lift the head by pulling it up and then putting in a new blade, and then pushing the head back into place. MAKE SURE TO PUSH THE HEAD IN ALL WAY UNTIL IT IS NICE AND TIGHT (YOU&#x27;LL KNOW WHEN IT \\&quot;SNAPS\\&quot; INTO POSITION). If you do not push it in all the way until it snaps (a very common mistake if you are not aware), the setting system won&#x27;t work properly and all your shaves be very aggressive and close, and probably cause irritation.    Second, I highly recommend you buy an adjustable razors (like the one). The adjustable razor is superior because it give the user the most control to determine the closeness of the shave they desire. The lowest setting \\&quot;1\\&quot; is the safest keeping blade furthest away from the skin. The highest setting \\&quot;6\\&quot; gives the most exposure of the blade to the skin, giving a harsher, but closer shave. In between there are settings 2,3,4,5. Setting \\&quot;2\\&quot; is a favorite among many users including myself.    Third, the product is heavy and thus very stable. The stability of this 4.0 ounce  razor is perhaps its best asset (after being adjustable) and it makes shaving a lot easier, more fun, and even faster (one stroke is all it takes). From the picture it might look like the non-grove handle, smooth is \\&quot;slippery when wet\\&quot; but this couldn&#x27;t be further from the truth. The futuristic-looking ergonomic handle is just stable when wet as a traditional grooved handle (in my opinion, even more stable).    It comes in three finishes (Satin Nickel, Polished Nickel, and Gold-Plated) Some suppliers don&#x27;t even carry the gold-plated finish and with good reason: the durability of gold-plated razors are questionable and I recommend either the Satin and Polish Nickel finishes for long-term durability (many decades).    AN EXCELLENT RAZOR!!! THE BEST I&#x27;VE EVER USED!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! WELL WORTH IT!!!</li>
            <li> While Merkur has an incredible reputation among wet shavers, this model isn&#x27;t very good in use.    You paid a lot of money and got a beautiful work of sculpture. Five stars, no question.     But especially for newbies, it has glaring faults. First, it is too heavy. Imagine using a one-pound block of steel with a samurai-sharp edge to shave your face. That&#x27;s what it feels like.  You must be quite experienced to tame this razor.    Then too it is too big -- good luck with shaving your upper lip. Remember maneuvering that new 5-blade Gillette razor on your lip? Same idea.    Finally, the German designers seem to have forgotten this carries a sharp blade.  The top unsnaps from both sides. No twist to open. Be careful.  And, whatever you do, adjust the closeness setting -- admittedly Mercedes precise -- without a blade in the thing.  My inclination in adjusting the razor is to rotate the head with my hand. Oops. Very dangerous.    The Merkur Hefty Classic or HD is far better designed and far safer till you&#x27;re an experienced double-edge blade shaver.</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews, I thought this would be a must have item as I&#x27;m in the military and need a clean shave every day.  The razor looks great and has a good feel, but I don&#x27;t think it does as well as my ten dollar Mach 3.  I often use my old razor for spots that didn&#x27;t get very cleanly shaven.  I also cut myself about every other time with it - never with the Mach 3.  I use new razors frequently, Truefit and Hill shaving cream, and apply it with a silver tip badger tail brush.  I&#x27;ve even used shaving oil in hopes that would help.  I&#x27;ve had the razor about 2 months and have tried different settings.  I use short strokes I really try to like the razor, but I just don&#x27;t.  Perhaps I&#x27;m doing something wrong.  It is also difficult to get high up on my lip (under the nose) due to the size of the razor.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, it works alright and looks/feels great.  I&#x27;m just tired of little cuts and a so-so shave.  Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been exclusively wet shaving for several months, using a Merkur Trac II style razor.  Having decided to take the plunge to a DE safety razor, I ordered the Merkur Futur Adjustable.  For my initial shave I set it on \\&quot;1\\&quot; (least aggressive), and got an absolutely wonderful shave, with no nicks, razor burn, or any discomfort at all.  Even around my jaw line and the point of my chin (notoriously touchy areas) there were no problems whatsoever.  At fifty cents a blade this is a wonderfully economical way to shave after the initial investment in the razor, which barring earthquake, fire, or apocalypse should last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> I used a Gillette Sensor. It was okay. I upgraded to Sensor XL. It was pretty good. I tried a Mach 3, and I hated it -- it felt like I was wiping my face with a wall of blades. I finally settled on Sensor 3 -- at nearly 2 bucks a blade. It got the job done, but there was no real joy in shaving. Considering I have to do it at least once a day (twice if I&#x27;m going out at night) the process should be more enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After quite a bit of research, including newsgroups and customer reviews, I splurged and got the Merkur Futur (though I got the chrome finish).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving is awesome, and I literally look forward to it. Lathering up the shave cream (I use Crabtree and Evelyn Sandlewood) with the Merkur brush is a real treat. Super soft, holds a ton of water, and results in a thick lather. (Be warned, the first few times you use it, it stinks like wet badger... but it goes away).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself is heavy... I mean heavy. Which is good, because you need to let the razor do the work -- NO PRESSURE, OR YOU WILL TAKE OFF YOU FACE). The main difference between this razor and shaving with cartridges, is that you actually feel the blade against your face (as opposed to a chunk of plastic). Anyone who has had a shave with a barber knows how great this feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I got the technique down it is as close and smooth a shave as I have ever had. Finishing up with a cold water splash, non-alcoholic toner / aftershave, and a moisturizing lotion, is an invigorating way to start the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: as stated above the brush smells a little \\&quot;badgery\\&quot; at first, but it goes away. The head of the razor does not pivot, so you have to follow the contours of your face. And the head itself it bulky, so you have to work on your technique around your nose, and under you chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum, this razor adds an old-school, refreshing routine to my mornings. I love it, and would whole-heartedly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Initial learning curve is high coming from run-of-the-mill razors, but stick with it.. the effort is completely worth it!</li>
