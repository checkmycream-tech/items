            <li>I am going to give the brushes a good cleaning and hope I can use them for something.</li>
            <li>I was fooled by the \\&quot;good reviews\\</li>
            <li>They come with variety of brushes which is good for my business.</li>
            <li>They look &amp; feel like good quality brushes.</li>
            <li>The pouch they come in looks good, but smells.</li>
            <li>Product arrived promptly and in good condition.  </li>
            <li>It is a good product, I acquired as a gift</li>

            <li>I thought I loved these brushes</li>

            <li>Ordering was easy, shipping was on time and arrived when stated, in great shape, and it was Christmas time so even more impressed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this purchase and I will continue to buy from the FASH brand.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t expect them to be great as MAC or Sigma brushes, but I&#x27;ve gotten better quality lower-end brushes (EcoTool, Claire&#x27;s).</li>
            <li>The brushes are good quality and the leather pouch they are stored in is really nice.</li>
            <li>Nice brushes, maybe not the highest of quality but</li>
            <li>Really liked the carrying case.  </li>
            <li>Also nice that they comes with storage .</li>
            <li>If you want to spend more more you can but for me this are just as good.</li>
            <li>The brush set are good, but the smell is too strong</li>
            <li>i think i will stick to buying my brushes online at sephora so far they have the best brushes i have ever used.</li>
            <li>I opened the leather pouch pretty nice pouch, the brushes were all very nice packed In plastics covers.</li>
            <li>As I become more efficient and experienced with makeup application I will invest end a higher in product.</li>
            <li>I received my brushes within about a week of ordering them, the brushes look very nice, of course not of the higher quality brand</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care how great their brushes or makeup are, if there is a company out there that can mix quality and a great price, FASH Limited is one.</li>
            <li>I will gladly order from them again.</li>
            <li>okay    </li>
            <li>but I was glad to get it.</li>
            <li>More brushes than I know what to do with them.  </li>
            <li>I really love these brushes.</li>
            <li>I love the brushes...</li>
            <li>So many brushes for the money.  </li>
            <li>I love the variety to choose from, and the protective plastic for travel and storage.  </li>
            <li>Love them and will buy again of needed</li>
            <li>artist I learn by making some mistakes:-)</li>
            <li>If you are looking for good and not expensive brushes, I suggest ecotools.</li>
            <li>They are so soft and are great for applying my makeup.</li>
            <li>Just what I was looking for in a brush set as far as variety of uses, and at a great price.</li>
            <li>the metal pieces break off so easily</li>
            <li>I was so suprised to had received them so very quickly.  </li>
            <li>but it is a strong smell.</li>
            <li>The smell is like petroleum or gasoline, which I highly doubt is good for you skin.</li>
            <li>The purchase came through just fine.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>Reasonable set of brushes but nothing spectacular.  </li>
            <li>The material of the brushes are a bit inferior ,the case is cheap looking the blush brush is scanty all in all</li>
            <li>I would say buy one brush at a time and pay more because it is worth the brush.</li>
            <li>Nice brushes and you really can&#x27;t get anything nicer for the price.</li>
            <li>It comes in a really nice case and I like that it has plastic lining on both sides and the whole thing is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I grabbed the first brush ran my fingers through it alot of fall out!!</li>
            <li>This set is perfect against my skin and now that I&#x27;ve used and washed them multiple times, they still feel new.</li>
            <li>Well I too purchased these brushes because I was excited after reading all the five star reviews they got.</li>
            <li>Fewer but higher quality would be better.</li>
            <li>Im gonna clean them in quats to see if the smell goes away.</li>
            <li>Great product, brushes are high quality and are very soft.</li>
            <li>The brushes arrived in a very timely manner and I love the way the brushes look and feel.  </li>
            <li>I love the roll too, very convenient for home or travel.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>I liked them just fine, especially considering the price.</li>
            <li>I recomend this set of brushes but make sure you wash them (any new set of brushes needs to be wash)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m from Venezuela and takes about a month to get the product, I think theywas sent quickly .</li>
            <li>:) I will most definitely buy from Fash again!</li>
            <li>I would totally recommend these brushes to ANYONE and believe them to be excellent for how little I paid. :)</li>
            <li>These brushes are pretty but cheap, plus they  smell like gasoline.</li>
            <li>the odor was very offensive and strong.  </li>
            <li>Only problem was the chemical smell that it had when it was first delivered, but it disappeared after a good cleaning .</li>
            <li>these brushes came fast which was a plus!!   </li>
            <li>It smells strongly of some chemical, most likely the vinyl the case is made of.  </li>
            <li>If you can afford a little more, Sigma would be a nice choice.</li>
            <li>not proffeciolan brushes but great for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth buying</li>
            <li>I was really looking for nice, soft brushes...</li>
            <li>I was so excited I never had this many different brushes it can with this gasoline smell and still smells like it</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t have none of the brushes they had to put ur makeup on the right way</li>
            <li>The handles are nice &amp; long.</li>
            <li>I will spend a little more for better brushes.</li>
            <li>The bristles aren&#x27;t super high quality but its worth the money I paid for it.</li>
            <li>The bristles were also fine not stiff at all.</li>
            <li>likewise thank you very much for the services offered.</li>
            <li>No one wants to put on make up as have brush hairs flying every where !</li>
            <li>I wish I thought it over more before I made such a mistake.</li>
            <li>I havent tried them out but the first thing I noticed was the smell</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>and I have to say that even though this set has less tools, the quality is much better!</li>
            <li>Bristles are not soft, more prickly sometimes.  </li>
            <li>My daughter is in the process of washing the brushes now before she uses them, which is not what you should have to do with a new product !!</li>
            <li>i ordered this set a few days ago and got it in yestureday got to love amazon prime!</li>
            <li>For the cost and variety of this set, it is pretty decent.</li>
            <li>No I didn&#x27;t expect too much for such a cheap product</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft though if thats worth it to you</li>
            <li>AT ALL which is really a dissapointment that should be a staple in any set of brushes.    </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast (as it always is with amazon) but as soon as I opened the box I smelled this aweful odor.</li>
            <li>I tried them out on my shadows and the aplyed it on really well.</li>
            <li>Also, they are very sparse.</li>
            <li>They all are very well made.  </li>
            <li>I really like these brushes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really understand what there is to complain about.</li>
            <li>Considering the price, this set really exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t use them much.</li>
            <li>The smaller brushes such as the lip brush and eye shadow brushes are fair but you should use a soft hair .</li>
            <li>The brushed are nice and long which gives you plenty of room to hold it and helps to keep from putting too much pressure on the brushes.</li>
            <li>But the bristles are pretty stiff and not as soft as I would have liked.  </li>
            <li>Received my package earlier than expected and was very satisfied with packaging.</li>
            <li>The brushes will allow you to experiment with makeup application without spending an arm and a leg for decent brushes.    </li>
            <li>When we brought the case back into the house, it still had the same overpowering chemical odor that bothered everyone, and we had to wash our hands after touching it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The wooden handles are polished and very pretty.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for high quality brushes with this set.</li>
            <li>The brushes are made with real horse hair and are not as soft as I had hoped but they maintain their shape well.</li>
            <li>The case does smell like new car, it isn&#x27;t gross-smelling</li>
            <li>They come all protected and covered in plastic and the case looks durable, the handles are wood and looks very professional.</li>
            <li>so I bought new ones different seller and these other brushes I love</li>
            <li>Brush set was a gift for my 18yr old daughter; she loves them!  </li>
            <li>I tried to wash out the smell by soaking the brushes in soap and hot water, but the steam rising from the water made my entire house stink.  </li>
            <li>the brushes shed, they are not as soft as i thought</li>
            <li>I am very disspointed with this product, would not recommend it , the only thing that convenced me on buying them was the reviews, but fully regret buying them!</li>
            <li>After waiting two weeks to get these brushes they just arrived this afternoon and not only is the moth ball stench coming off the faux leather case giving me a migraine, I am very concerned about the gasoline smell coming from the brush tips themselves.</li>
            <li>Set is complete and everything that they were advertised to be.  </li>
            <li>i got when i was about 17 years old man that was forever ago.</li>
            <li>the case is also made out of soft leather.</li>
            <li>They are soft and natural to be hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li>They are soft and durable.</li>
            <li>I did experience minor shedding on the first wash, but none since</li>
            <li>their soft don&#x27;t feel like horse hair</li>
            <li>it being real horse hair, but they hold up well with being washed regularly.</li>
            <li>so they feel soft...  </li>
            <li>Yes, the case that the brushes come in does have a rather strong smell, but I don&#x27;t mind since I use a small makeup bag to carry my brushes in.</li>
            <li>I should have spent a little more for quality made producrts</li>
            <li>The FASH brushes are a thrifty deal for new makeup fashionistas (such as myself).  </li>
            <li>the angled eyerbow brush is not stiff enough but it works</li>
            <li>they perform their function and look professional enough that friends of my thought they were from Sephora.</li>
            <li>I would say go with bare minerals.</li>
            <li>The product was poorly packaged and many of the brushes were misshaped because of it.</li>
            <li>These brushes are ok, not great.</li>
            <li>Not extremely soft but soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t irritate the sensitive skin around the eye.</li>
            <li>you get this set, which is reasonably priced, you&#x27;ll probably want to store the brushes in something other than the included case.</li>
            <li>but when I first used these brushes I found that the brush part were loose sort of like loose hairs</li>
            <li>First I would like to say I&#x27;m not a makeup artist or an everyday makeup wearer.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and there aren&#x27;t any loose bristles are anything.</li>
            <li>The quality isn&#x27;t the best, the bristles are artificial hair and a little rough, but this is to be expected for the price.</li>
            <li>The shedding is not too bad though and for the money, the brushes are really a good deal.  </li>

            <li> I was so suprised to had received them so very quickly.  </li>
            <li> but it is a strong smell.</li>
            <li> The smell is like petroleum or gasoline, which I highly doubt is good for you skin.</li>
            <li> The purchase came through just fine.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> Reasonable set of brushes but nothing spectacular.  </li>
            <li> The material of the brushes are a bit inferior ,the case is cheap looking the blush brush is scanty all in all</li>
            <li> I would say buy one brush at a time and pay more because it is worth the brush.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes and you really can&#x27;t get anything nicer for the price.</li>
            <li> It comes in a really nice case and I like that it has plastic lining on both sides and the whole thing is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I grabbed the first brush ran my fingers through it alot of fall out!!</li>
            <li> This set is perfect against my skin and now that I&#x27;ve used and washed them multiple times, they still feel new.</li>
            <li> Well I too purchased these brushes because I was excited after reading all the five star reviews they got.</li>
            <li> Fewer but higher quality would be better.</li>
            <li> Im gonna clean them in quats to see if the smell goes away.</li>
            <li> Great product, brushes are high quality and are very soft.</li>
            <li> The brushes arrived in a very timely manner and I love the way the brushes look and feel.  </li>
            <li> I love the roll too, very convenient for home or travel.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> I liked them just fine, especially considering the price.</li>
            <li> I recomend this set of brushes but make sure you wash them (any new set of brushes needs to be wash)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m from Venezuela and takes about a month to get the product, I think theywas sent quickly .</li>
            <li> :) I will most definitely buy from Fash again!</li>
            <li> I would totally recommend these brushes to ANYONE and believe them to be excellent for how little I paid. :)</li>
            <li> These brushes are pretty but cheap, plus they  smell like gasoline.</li>
            <li> the odor was very offensive and strong.  </li>
            <li> Only problem was the chemical smell that it had when it was first delivered, but it disappeared after a good cleaning .</li>
            <li> these brushes came fast which was a plus!!   </li>
            <li> It smells strongly of some chemical, most likely the vinyl the case is made of.  </li>
            <li> If you can afford a little more, Sigma would be a nice choice.</li>
            <li> not proffeciolan brushes but great for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth buying</li>
            <li> I was really looking for nice, soft brushes...</li>
            <li> I was so excited I never had this many different brushes it can with this gasoline smell and still smells like it</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have none of the brushes they had to put ur makeup on the right way</li>
            <li> The handles are nice &amp; long.</li>
            <li> I will spend a little more for better brushes.</li>
            <li> The bristles aren&#x27;t super high quality but its worth the money I paid for it.</li>
            <li> The bristles were also fine not stiff at all.</li>
            <li> likewise thank you very much for the services offered.</li>
            <li> No one wants to put on make up as have brush hairs flying every where !</li>
            <li> I wish I thought it over more before I made such a mistake.</li>
            <li> I havent tried them out but the first thing I noticed was the smell</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> and I have to say that even though this set has less tools, the quality is much better!</li>
            <li> Bristles are not soft, more prickly sometimes.  </li>
            <li> My daughter is in the process of washing the brushes now before she uses them, which is not what you should have to do with a new product !!</li>
            <li> i ordered this set a few days ago and got it in yestureday got to love amazon prime!</li>
            <li> For the cost and variety of this set, it is pretty decent.</li>
            <li> No I didn&#x27;t expect too much for such a cheap product</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft though if thats worth it to you</li>
            <li> AT ALL which is really a dissapointment that should be a staple in any set of brushes.    </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast (as it always is with amazon) but as soon as I opened the box I smelled this aweful odor.</li>
            <li> I tried them out on my shadows and the aplyed it on really well.</li>
            <li> Also, they are very sparse.</li>
            <li> They all are very well made.  </li>
            <li> I really like these brushes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really understand what there is to complain about.</li>
            <li> Considering the price, this set really exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t use them much.</li>
            <li> The smaller brushes such as the lip brush and eye shadow brushes are fair but you should use a soft hair .</li>
            <li> The brushed are nice and long which gives you plenty of room to hold it and helps to keep from putting too much pressure on the brushes.</li>
            <li> But the bristles are pretty stiff and not as soft as I would have liked.  </li>
            <li> Received my package earlier than expected and was very satisfied with packaging.</li>
            <li> The brushes will allow you to experiment with makeup application without spending an arm and a leg for decent brushes.    </li>
            <li> When we brought the case back into the house, it still had the same overpowering chemical odor that bothered everyone, and we had to wash our hands after touching it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wooden handles are polished and very pretty.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for high quality brushes with this set.</li>
            <li> The brushes are made with real horse hair and are not as soft as I had hoped but they maintain their shape well.</li>
            <li> The case does smell like new car, it isn&#x27;t gross-smelling</li>
            <li> They come all protected and covered in plastic and the case looks durable, the handles are wood and looks very professional.</li>
            <li> so I bought new ones different seller and these other brushes I love</li>
            <li> Brush set was a gift for my 18yr old daughter; she loves them!  </li>
            <li> I tried to wash out the smell by soaking the brushes in soap and hot water, but the steam rising from the water made my entire house stink.  </li>
            <li> the brushes shed, they are not as soft as i thought</li>
            <li> I am very disspointed with this product, would not recommend it , the only thing that convenced me on buying them was the reviews, but fully regret buying them!</li>
            <li> After waiting two weeks to get these brushes they just arrived this afternoon and not only is the moth ball stench coming off the faux leather case giving me a migraine, I am very concerned about the gasoline smell coming from the brush tips themselves.</li>
            <li> Set is complete and everything that they were advertised to be.  </li>
            <li> i got when i was about 17 years old man that was forever ago.</li>
            <li> the case is also made out of soft leather.</li>
            <li> They are soft and natural to be hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li> They are soft and durable.</li>
            <li> I did experience minor shedding on the first wash, but none since</li>
            <li> their soft don&#x27;t feel like horse hair</li>
            <li> it being real horse hair, but they hold up well with being washed regularly.</li>
            <li> so they feel soft...  </li>
            <li> Yes, the case that the brushes come in does have a rather strong smell, but I don&#x27;t mind since I use a small makeup bag to carry my brushes in.</li>
            <li> I should have spent a little more for quality made producrts</li>
            <li> The FASH brushes are a thrifty deal for new makeup fashionistas (such as myself).  </li>
            <li> the angled eyerbow brush is not stiff enough but it works</li>
            <li> they perform their function and look professional enough that friends of my thought they were from Sephora.</li>
            <li> I would say go with bare minerals.</li>
            <li> The product was poorly packaged and many of the brushes were misshaped because of it.</li>
            <li> These brushes are ok, not great.</li>
            <li> Not extremely soft but soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t irritate the sensitive skin around the eye.</li>
            <li> you get this set, which is reasonably priced, you&#x27;ll probably want to store the brushes in something other than the included case.</li>
            <li> but when I first used these brushes I found that the brush part were loose sort of like loose hairs</li>
            <li> First I would like to say I&#x27;m not a makeup artist or an everyday makeup wearer.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and there aren&#x27;t any loose bristles are anything.</li>
            <li> The quality isn&#x27;t the best, the bristles are artificial hair and a little rough, but this is to be expected for the price.</li>
            <li> The shedding is not too bad though and for the money, the brushes are really a good deal.  </li>
            <li> some of the brushes are useless  the sponge brush broke without me even using it the first day!!!  </li>
            <li> They get the job done but they aren&#x27;t as soft as other brushes I used.</li>
            <li> You may notice a strange smell but thats the leather sitting in the packaging.</li>
            <li> These brushes are NOT soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend to someone who just needs brushes, not really professional quality.</li>
            <li> I am totally against buying MAC and Sephora products due to the ridiculous prices they want for a whole set!</li>
            <li> My advice: spend a little extra money and invest in a few key brushes that will last you a lifetime instead of buying big kits like these that don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> other then this tiny set</li>
            <li> I wash my brushes often and the larger ones take a while to dry out due to</li>
            <li> When I opened the box it smelled like fake leather, plastic, and other cheap materials used to make the \\&quot;leather\\&quot; case.</li>
            <li> no shedding so far even after doing the usual test of running ur fingers through the hairs and washing them.</li>
            <li> But with alittle common sence its not hard to figure out</li>
            <li> Only down fall i have is that if you are a bigginer and have no clue what brush is what this set does have a label on what brush is what.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what other reviewer&#x27;s are saying about the smell, they just smell new to me...</li>
            <li> I got even more disappointed about these brushes after I&#x27;d purchased an ecotools set at my local Ride Pharmacy.</li>
            <li> The ONLY issue I have with the brushes is that they shed a little bit.</li>
            <li> They are so soft that the makeup has a hard time keeping on the brush.</li>
            <li> i dont reccommend this for begginers because you dont have you basic brushes that are needed for everyday make up</li>
            <li> We took the brushes out and left the case to air out on the patio for a few days, but that just made the patio unusable during that time.  </li>
            <li> it is not what I expected</li>
            <li> They are soft but a little stiff</li>
            <li> Not only that, when I ran the brush tips through my fingers, it leave an odd almost soot like black residue on my fingers.</li>
            <li> but I did expect a clean hygienic product, not something I am afraid to put on my skin.</li>
            <li> I recommend other beauty items to buy and give to my wife.</li>
            <li> but I watch other girls put makeup on</li>
            <li> brushes are very rough on your face.</li>
            <li> I have purchased cheaper brushes before such as e.l.f and coastal scent and never came across such poor quality.</li>
            <li> For the price i expected a lot better, the bristles on the brushes are crap, they always shed.</li>
            <li> The other problem with the brushes is that there is some slight shedding of the hairs.  </li>
            <li> The faux-leather case included with this set is made of some noxious chemical that seems wet to the touch and stinks up the whole house.  </li>
            <li> and I had little black brush fragments come off in my hand.  </li>
            <li> The brushes do shed a little...</li>
            <li> I think it was little pricy</li>
            <li> I read the review i knew they were mediocre but really who can get over these stiff stiff stiff bristles while applying make up.  </li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money... again.</li>
            <li> To be honest the blush, fan, and power brush are horrible.</li>
            <li> a few days and the smell should be gone.</li>
            <li> It went away over time after a few washes, .</li>
            <li> I purchased the 18 Piece Fash Brush set a few weeks ago and have used it everyday.</li>
            <li> A few days of airing it out will do the job!</li>
            <li> These brushes did not apply my make up well, I was not satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li> If you test the quality of a brush by rubbing them hard in your hand, no bristle fragments should break off.  </li>
            <li> My biggest complaint was the smell of the faux leather case...</li>
            <li> and I got the items late.</li>
            <li> The case did have a weird odor as stated by other purchasers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously considering returning this product.</li>
            <li> but nothing so bad you wouldn&#x27;t want to use them on a regular basis.    </li>
            <li> After a few days the odor lessened but it is still faintly there after 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> they are complete crap.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, these brushes are not much better than those that can be bought at your nearest Walmart.</li>
            <li> there isn&#x27;t this really horrible smell that is completely unbearable.</li>
            <li> After purchasing the product I decided to read the reviews, I was not impressed with what I read.</li>
            <li> The only problem with the brushes are that they had an awful smell when they arrived</li>
            <li> Ill stick with ELF or ECO tools.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what to call it sorry</li>
            <li> Desperately needing some make-up brushes, I purchased the cheapest ones I could find.</li>
            <li> I waited to receive the product and to my disappointment the reviews were correct.</li>
            <li> I read from another customer review that the brushes smelled really badly</li>
            <li> i dont even touch them anymore because im so disappointed in them.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> Like gasoline , it smelled disgusting!</li>
            <li> When they arrived there was a horrible chemically smell.</li>
            <li> Upon opening the the package a terrible chemical smell permeated my bathroom and remained even after washing the brushes.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This was a wonderful product for a great price! Definitely exceeded my expectations. I will gladly order from them again.</li>
            <li> The FASH brushes are a thrifty deal for new makeup fashionistas (such as myself).  The set includes the essentials for makeup application.  The brushes will allow you to experiment with makeup application without spending an arm and a leg for decent brushes.    The brushes do shed a little...but nothing so bad you wouldn&#x27;t want to use them on a regular basis.    My biggest complaint was the smell of the faux leather case... the odor was very offensive and strong.  It reminded me of gasoline.  I threw it away.    Overall, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.  As I become more efficient and experienced with makeup application I will invest end a higher in product.</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes on the 4th and I received them on the 15th. When I opened the box it smelled like fake leather, plastic, and other cheap materials used to make the \\&quot;leather\\&quot; case. The brushes are already shedding too and they haven&#x27;t even been used. I&#x27;m seriously considering returning this product. The brushes are soft though if thats worth it to you but I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money... again.</li>
            <li> I bought the brush set as a Christmas present for my sister and she loves them. They look and feel great and handle make up well. Great product and one very happy customer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what other reviewer&#x27;s are saying about the smell, they just smell new to me...there isn&#x27;t this really horrible smell that is completely unbearable. They come all protected and covered in plastic and the case looks durable, the handles are wood and looks very professional. The brushes are soft and there aren&#x27;t any loose bristles are anything. I am very happy with my purchase and you cant beat the price!</li>
            <li> Everything you need, good price, attractive appearance, good quality. Great that they came super-quick with amazon prime! I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product, brushes are high quality and are very soft. The case does smell like new car, it isn&#x27;t gross-smelling but it is a strong smell. A few days of airing it out will do the job!</li>
            <li> Hi, buy the attachment for my wife, in reality the product has not arrived by express difficulties in liberty. I&#x27;m from Venezuela and takes about a month to get the product, I think theywas sent quickly . I like that I recommend other beauty items to buy and give to my wife. likewise thank you very much for the services offered.</li>
            <li> Prior to this set, I bought the bundle monster 32 pc. set and I have to say that even though this set has less tools, the quality is much better! I am totally against buying MAC and Sephora products due to the ridiculous prices they want for a whole set! I don&#x27;t care how great their brushes or makeup are, if there is a company out there that can mix quality and a great price, FASH Limited is one. :) I will most definitely buy from Fash again!</li>
            <li> brushes fray hair things fall out the metal pieces break off so easily i dont even touch them anymore because im so disappointed in them.</li>
            <li> these brushes came fast which was a plus!!   some of the brushes are useless  the sponge brush broke without me even using it the first day!!!  the brushes shed, they are not as soft as i thought but they work.  they need to include a stippling brush!!!  there is no BLEDING BRUSH AT ALL which is really a dissapointment that should be a staple in any set of brushes.    the angled eyerbow brush is not stiff enough but it works okay    overall i use some of the brushes. 4 out of the 18      i dont reccommend this for begginers because you dont have you basic brushes that are needed for everyday make up</li>
            <li> Desperately needing some make-up brushes, I purchased the cheapest ones I could find. After purchasing the product I decided to read the reviews, I was not impressed with what I read. I waited to receive the product and to my disappointment the reviews were correct. The product was poorly packaged and many of the brushes were misshaped because of it. After attempting to reshape them I realized that they were also were trimmed improperly. The case did have a weird odor as stated by other purchasers. All in all, I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> The brushes arrived in a very timely manner and I love the way the brushes look and feel.  The handles are gorgeous and they feel really good in my hands.  The only problem with the brushes are that they had an awful smell when they arrived and I had to wash them twice to get rid of the smell...it was a smell similar to cheap/fake leather.  The other problem with the brushes is that there is some slight shedding of the hairs.  The shedding is not too bad though and for the money, the brushes are really a good deal.  I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> These brushes are pretty but cheap, plus they  smell like gasoline. I will spend a little more for better brushes.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes, maybe not the highest of quality but they perform their function and look professional enough that friends of my thought they were from Sephora. Definitely worth buying</li>
            <li> To be honest the blush, fan, and power brush are horrible. No one wants to put on make up as have brush hairs flying every where ! Lol. The smaller brushes such as the lip brush and eye shadow brushes are fair but you should use a soft hair .</li>
            <li> Great cosmetic brushes for a great price. Not extremely soft but soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t irritate the sensitive skin around the eye.</li>
            <li> Just got my package today. Shipping was fast (as it always is with amazon) but as soon as I opened the box I smelled this aweful odor. Like gasoline , it smelled disgusting! I opened the leather pouch pretty nice pouch, the brushes were all very nice packed In plastics covers. I grabbed the first brush ran my fingers through it alot of fall out!! I grabbed another one and same thing!! I am very disspointed with this product, would not recommend it , the only thing that convenced me on buying them was the reviews, but fully regret buying them! I should of forked out the extra cash and gotten the ( SIGMA ) brush set!!</li>
            <li> Well I too purchased these brushes because I was excited after reading all the five star reviews they got. Now I have to wonder if they got these reviews from employees of the company or what? After waiting two weeks to get these brushes they just arrived this afternoon and not only is the moth ball stench coming off the faux leather case giving me a migraine, I am very concerned about the gasoline smell coming from the brush tips themselves. Not only that, when I ran the brush tips through my fingers, it leave an odd almost soot like black residue on my fingers. Just gross. I am going to give the brushes a good cleaning and hope I can use them for something. No I didn&#x27;t expect too much for such a cheap product but I did expect a clean hygienic product, not something I am afraid to put on my skin. I have purchased cheaper brushes before such as e.l.f and coastal scent and never came across such poor quality. I wish I thought it over more before I made such a mistake.</li>
            <li> Brush set was a gift for my 18yr old daughter; she loves them!  Set is complete and everything that they were advertised to be.  Ordering was easy, shipping was on time and arrived when stated, in great shape, and it was Christmas time so even more impressed.  All in all, a great buy and we are very happy.</li>
            <li> The purchase came through just fine. I think it was little pricy but I was glad to get it. Thank you</li>
            <li> Reasonable set of brushes but nothing spectacular.  Not bad for the price. More brushes than I know what to do with them.  Fewer but higher quality would be better.</li>
            <li> I really love these brushes. They are so soft and are great for applying my makeup. I am very pleased with this purchase and I will continue to buy from the FASH brand.</li>
            <li> i ordered this set a few days ago and got it in yestureday got to love amazon prime! i have owned alot of different set of brushes. other then this tiny set i got when i was about 17 years old man that was forever ago. this set is stands up to that set. the fibers or synthitic hairs no shedding so far even after doing the usual test of running ur fingers through the hairs and washing them. They are soft but a little stiff which is what you want so you can load up the brushes with the products without having to do it over and over again. I tried them out on my shadows and the aplyed it on really well. Only down fall i have is that if you are a bigginer and have no clue what brush is what this set does have a label on what brush is what. But with alittle common sence its not hard to figure out which is which. The case is a roll upcase with manetic claps. the case is also made out of soft leather. You may notice a strange smell but thats the leather sitting in the packaging. a few days and the smell should be gone. i hope this review was helpful for you.</li>
            <li> I just got these brushes. They literally stink.  I tried to wash out the smell by soaking the brushes in soap and hot water, but the steam rising from the water made my entire house stink.  The smell is like petroleum or gasoline, which I highly doubt is good for you skin. after four days of soaking the brushes I just returned them.</li>
            <li> These brushes are NOT soft. Also, they are very sparse. I was fooled by the \\&quot;good reviews\\&quot;. I got even more disappointed about these brushes after I&#x27;d purchased an ecotools set at my local Ride Pharmacy. If you are looking for good and not expensive brushes, I suggest ecotools. If you can afford a little more, Sigma would be a nice choice.</li>
            <li> I received my brushes within about a week of ordering them, the brushes look very nice, of course not of the higher quality brand but they will do for now, I hope. I havent tried them out but the first thing I noticed was the smell, The brushes have a gasoline smell to them. Im gonna clean them in quats to see if the smell goes away. They come with variety of brushes which is good for my business.</li>
            <li> The faux-leather case included with this set is made of some noxious chemical that seems wet to the touch and stinks up the whole house.  My daughter ordered this and we could smell it through the packaging.  We took the brushes out and left the case to air out on the patio for a few days, but that just made the patio unusable during that time.  When we brought the case back into the house, it still had the same overpowering chemical odor that bothered everyone, and we had to wash our hands after touching it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get this set, which is reasonably priced, you&#x27;ll probably want to store the brushes in something other than the included case.</li>
            <li> I liked them just fine, especially considering the price. The bristles aren&#x27;t super high quality but its worth the money I paid for it. I&#x27;d recommend to someone who just needs brushes, not really professional quality.</li>
            <li> First I would like to say I&#x27;m not a makeup artist or an everyday makeup wearer. With that being said I like the quality, variety and compact case.</li>
            <li> Yes, the case that the brushes come in does have a rather strong smell, but I don&#x27;t mind since I use a small makeup bag to carry my brushes in.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!!!!!!! I USE THESE ON CLIENTS AND I HAVE REFEREED THEM TO THIS SITE AND THEY HAVE RDERED THEM!!! LOVE THEM!!! NO SHED !!!</li>
            <li> I love the brushes... I&#x27;m happy to have them ! It came in time and very happy to use this</li>
            <li> Great brushes.  They all are very well made.  So many brushes for the money.  I was so suprised to had received them so very quickly.  I am very happy and would recommend the brushes.  If you want to spend more more you can but for me this are just as good.</li>
            <li> The material of the brushes are a bit inferior ,the case is cheap looking the blush brush is scanty all in all it is not what I expected</li>
            <li> The brush set are good, but the smell is too strong but I still recommended it they are beautiful and the case is so nice.</li>
            <li> I received these brushes and immediately upon opening the carton this odor of chemical assaulted me.  It&#x27;s the case.  It smells strongly of some chemical, most likely the vinyl the case is made of.  After a few days the odor lessened but it is still faintly there after 3 weeks.  The brushes however are wonderful. Perhaps the vendor can change the case on this item.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great!  I love the variety to choose from, and the protective plastic for travel and storage.  They are perfect for beginners all the way to the pros!</li>
            <li> They look &amp; feel like good quality brushes. The handles are nice &amp; long. The pouch they come in looks good, but smells. The smell will go away.</li>
            <li> Great brushes. I use them in my clients all the time. They are soft and natural to be hypoallergenic. Love them and will buy again of needed</li>
            <li> Received my package earlier than expected and was very satisfied with packaging. Brushes individually wrapped and the case was well taken care of no scratches or problems. The bristles were also fine not stiff at all.</li>
            <li> I read from another customer review that the brushes smelled really badly and they did !  In fact I forgot to give them to my daughter for Christmas because I was airing them out...  I don&#x27;t know whether it is the brush itself or the plastic case they came in.  My daughter is in the process of washing the brushes now before she uses them, which is not what you should have to do with a new product !!</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes. They are soft and durable. I don&#x27;t really understand what there is to complain about. Considering the price, this set really exceeded my expectations. The variety and quality is very nice.</li>
            <li> Product arrived promptly and in good condition.  Really liked the carrying case.  Though for the price paid the brushes are rather mid grade quality.  Strands of the brush fall out while applying the make up.  Bristles are not soft, more prickly sometimes.  This kit does provide a brush for ANY circumstance, quite a varied assortment.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for in a brush set as far as variety of uses, and at a great price. I love the roll too, very convenient for home or travel. The quality isn&#x27;t the best, the bristles are artificial hair and a little rough, but this is to be expected for the price. They get the job done quite well.</li>
            <li> It is a good product, I acquired as a gift and I was told that they were delighted with the gift</li>
            <li> I read the review i knew they were mediocre but really who can get over these stiff stiff stiff bristles while applying make up.  my eyes were really red when i used the brush to apply a three tone eyeshadow look.  i think i will stick to buying my brushes online at sephora so far they have the best brushes i have ever used. That or alta but if you don&#x27;t mind feeling like you are applying your makeup with a brillow pad than these brushes are for you</li>
            <li> I found these brushes to be scratchy on my eyelids/face. There is also a lot of fallout with the bristles. You do get what you pay for in terms of makeup brushes. My advice: spend a little extra money and invest in a few key brushes that will last you a lifetime instead of buying big kits like these that don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> For the price i expected a lot better, the bristles on the brushes are crap, they always shed. they are complete crap. Ill stick with ELF or ECO tools.</li>
            <li> These brushes are ok, not great. They get the job done but they aren&#x27;t as soft as other brushes I used. I don&#x27;t expect them to be great as MAC or Sigma brushes, but I&#x27;ve gotten better quality lower-end brushes (EcoTool, Claire&#x27;s). When they arrived there was a horrible chemically smell. It went away over time after a few washes, . but I can&#x27;t seem to get the smell out of the carrying case so I haven&#x27;t used it. I did experience minor shedding on the first wash, but none since</li>
            <li> There not the best brushes out there. They are so soft that the makeup has a hard time keeping on the brush. I dont even use the foundation brush because it does not go on even and it does not pick up the makeup. But you do get what you pay for, your getting a lot of brushes for your money. They look great and come in a really great holder. I would say buy one brush at a time and pay more because it is worth the brush. I would say go with bare minerals.</li>
            <li> I thought the brushes were good quality for the price. Also nice that they comes with storage . I would purchase them again</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product. Only problem was the chemical smell that it had when it was first delivered, but it disappeared after a good cleaning .</li>
            <li> There are a lot of brushes for the price. But the bristles are pretty stiff and not as soft as I would have liked.  If you test the quality of a brush by rubbing them hard in your hand, no bristle fragments should break off.  I tested these and I had little black brush fragments come off in my hand.  I probably won&#x27;t use them much.</li>
            <li> Upon opening the the package a terrible chemical smell permeated my bathroom and remained even after washing the brushes. These brushes did not apply my make up well, I was not satisfied with my purchase and I got the items late.</li>
            <li> I purshased this item I was so excited I never had this many different brushes it can with this gasoline smell and still smells like it I thought I loved these brushes but I watch other girls put makeup on and I didn&#x27;t have none of the brushes they had to put ur makeup on the right way so I bought new ones different seller and these other brushes I love their soft don&#x27;t feel like horse hair so I will not buy anymore of ur brushes</li>
            <li> They have a chemical smell I can&#x27;t get rid of</li>
            <li> brushes are very rough on your face. they had a great selection of every brush that you need in the kit, but you get what you pay for and this is not something I would recommend.</li>
            <li> For the cost and variety of this set, it is pretty decent. I did have some problems with some shedding on the face brushes and the brushes were a bit stiffer than I had anticipated but they do the job and would be great for a beginner set.</li>
            <li> now im not a make up artist or anything but when I first used these brushes I found that the brush part were loose sort of like loose hairs I guess. I don&#x27;t know what to call it sorry but I would advice you to wash these before using. now your probably suppose to do that any way but like I said im not a make up artist I learn by making some mistakes:-)</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both use this set. It works great and stores nicely. I did buy a brush cleaner for them.</li>
            <li> Very nice set for the price and all seperated as shown and even all were individually wrapped.would recommend again to buy</li>
            <li> The last brush set I bought from another company was durably made, but irritated my skin when used. This set is perfect against my skin and now that I&#x27;ve used and washed them multiple times, they still feel new. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the product. The tops came off the holders. I should have spent a little more for quality made producrts</li>
            <li> Nice brushes and you really can&#x27;t get anything nicer for the price. The brushes are good quality and the leather pouch they are stored in is really nice.</li>
            <li> I purchased the 18 Piece Fash Brush set a few weeks ago and have used it everyday. It comes in a really nice case and I like that it has plastic lining on both sides and the whole thing is easy to clean. The brushed are nice and long which gives you plenty of room to hold it and helps to keep from putting too much pressure on the brushes. The wooden handles are polished and very pretty. The brushes are made with real horse hair and are not as soft as I had hoped but they maintain their shape well. I wash my brushes often and the larger ones take a while to dry out due to it being real horse hair, but they hold up well with being washed regularly. The ONLY issue I have with the brushes is that they shed a little bit. I would totally recommend these brushes to ANYONE and believe them to be excellent for how little I paid. :)</li>
            <li> I was hoping for high quality brushes with this set. Unfortunately, these brushes are not much better than those that can be bought at your nearest Walmart. I was really looking for nice, soft brushes...but these are not it. I would save your money and buy nicer brushes at a MAC store or the like.</li>
            <li> I washed this set of brushes with baby shampoo and olive oil so they feel soft...  not proffeciolan brushes but great for everyday use.  The variation of sizes are great.  I recomend this set of brushes but make sure you wash them (any new set of brushes needs to be wash)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
