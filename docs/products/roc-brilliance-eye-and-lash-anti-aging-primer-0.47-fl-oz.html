            <li>My lashes love it and when I wake up in the morning</li>
            <li>This product is more than a primer, it also conditions lashes and provides anti-aging around the eyes.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>If you put in on top of the eye</li>

            <li>Texture is lovely..</li>
            <li>Makes my eyelash makeup go on easily and look better.  </li>
            <li>This is another cosmetic favorite because it leaves eyelids with a smooth finish after moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re good to go for the whole eye area....</li>
            <li>Comes off easily with washing, but not just by itself.</li>
            <li>cannot notice a difference yet but product is silky smooth</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and non-greasy and keeps my eye shadow from caking all day.</li>
            <li>Smooth and even.</li>
            <li>It makes my eyelids feel smooth as light.  </li>
            <li>It helps to smooth your eye area.  </li>
            <li>I love what it does and it doesn&#x27;t require the use of more than just a small dab to create a beautiful result.</li>
            <li>no heavy fragrance which is good...</li>
            <li>but, can&#x27;t really tell if its doing the work it claims...Doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for around eye area, but as an eyelash primer before mascara, it works very nicely to prepare and separate lashes...</li>
            <li>My makeup went out clean and smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, I&#x27;m very upset that the manufacturer has discontinued it.  </li>
            <li>If you are going to try this cream make sure you keep a very close look at your skin.</li>
            <li>I use it every day, not just as a primer since I rarely wear</li>
            <li>Really makes your under eye area look and feel a whole lot better.</li>
            <li>I liked it enough that I started using other Roc products after I found out how good this was.</li>
            <li>but it just doesn&#x27;t seem right.</li>
            <li>I have used a variety of more expensive eye primers, but for the money, this is the best one by far!  </li>
            <li>Price is very reasonable..</li>
            <li>It made my lashes feel soft and light.  </li>
            <li>It really does lift the eyes and makes my lashes grow longer.</li>
            <li>So.....being possessed to have to have it, went online, much to husband&#x27;s dismay..</li>
            <li>It has really made my lashes fuller and stronger.  </li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>I use too faced and Urban decay primers and this does better job by far.</li>
            <li>You have to keep using it and not stop, or they will go back to the original condition.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s grey and greasy going on but dries clear and more like a lotion than eye shadow primer.  </li>
            <li>They are nice and soft and I have noticed less falling out.</li>
            <li>Maybe the particular tube I got was exposed to heat or something</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>the only such primer product I have found that really helps smooth the wrinkles under my eye.  </li>

            <li>Feels slick when first applied but dries quickly.</li>
            <li>skin feels smooth, not sure about the lashes</li>
            <li>Great for under the eye!&lt;br /&gt;It seems that this Is about impossible to get anymore,but I like it</li>
            <li>It comes out grey, but dries clear.  </li>

            <li> I have always had really thin lashes, but this product does make my lashes thicker. I now have lashes you can see.</li>
            <li> nice. skin feels smooth, not sure about the lashes</li>
            <li> cannot notice a difference yet but product is silky smooth</li>
            <li> Helps to soften eyelashes.  Also softens the skin and lines around the eyes.  Great product and great service.  Thank you</li>
            <li> this is one of the latest product I found is so good that you can see the changes without minutes</li>
            <li> Great eye primer. I love this. I use too faced and Urban decay primers and this does better job by far. Pls add it again to eligible for international shipping as I would like to re-order. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> This is another cosmetic favorite because it leaves eyelids with a smooth finish after moisturizing.  With or without makeup, I use this daily.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love or dislike this product.  It is just ok. I will use all of what I have but don&#x27;t know that I will purchase it again. The BEST eye lip primer that I have found thus far is \\&quot;Stay Don&#x27;t Stray\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This is my second order of this wonderful product.  I have used a variety of more expensive eye primers, but for the money, this is the best one by far!  It goes on smooth and non-greasy and keeps my eye shadow from caking all day. I also use it in the under eye area, and it prevents my foundation from settling into the tiny lines.&lt;br /&gt;My only hope is that Amazon continues selling it and keeps the price down - it is impossible to find it in the stores in my area...</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it every day, not just as a primer since I rarely wear all of the eye make up that I did when I was younger. My lashes love it and when I wake up in the morning, my lashes aren&#x27;t all dried out and stuck together due to my allergy medicines. They are nice and soft and I have noticed less falling out.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is a lot different than any other I have used.  It&#x27;s grey and greasy going on but dries clear and more like a lotion than eye shadow primer.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t work to prevent creasing or keep makeup in place.  Maybe the particular tube I got was exposed to heat or something but it just doesn&#x27;t seem right.</li>
            <li> Very good feeling after using it. Smooth and even. Nice skin touch after use. I highly recommend this product. Happy with my choice.</li>
            <li> Really makes your under eye area look and feel a whole lot better.</li>
            <li> It makes my eyelids feel smooth as light.  It comes out grey, but dries clear.  I even used it after I had been crying, and I woke up the next morning without puffy eyes! My makeup went out clean and smoothly.  It made my lashes feel soft and light.  I definitely will be using it daily.</li>
            <li> not for me, maybe someone else.</li>
            <li> Waste of money... didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> This product is more than a primer, it also conditions lashes and provides anti-aging around the eyes.  I&#x27;ve been using this for over two years and love it!</li>
            <li> Why did they stop making this product? It is great.</li>
            <li> I can say this product actually works. I love it. It makes my laser longer and softer.</li>
            <li> Have used this since it first launched, just now ordering my second tube. It really does lift the eyes and makes my lashes grow longer. You have to keep using it and not stop, or they will go back to the original condition. Mascara does not clump after application. Feels slick when first applied but dries quickly. Thank you Roc!</li>
            <li> Very happy with the primer... you just need a tiny midge and you&#x27;re good to go for the whole eye area.... not seeing the anti aging part of the product on me however.</li>
            <li> Great for under the eye!&lt;br /&gt;It seems that this Is about impossible to get anymore,but I like it a lot--- only for under my eyes. It totally eliminates dark shadows if you apply the tiniest dot. If you put in on top of the eye it pills off when you apply powdered eye shadow.</li>
            <li> I started using this after I read a review in a business journal of all places. I was always having to rub mascara off my brow bone by about 3:00 p.m..  When I wear this it doesn&#x27;t seem to transfer itself.  Also, it smooths away small wrinkles and crepey finish I get when I don&#x27;t get enough sleep.  I liked it enough that I started using other Roc products after I found out how good this was.</li>
            <li> I like how this works.  It helps to smooth your eye area.  It also helps concealer to go on smoother and last longer.</li>
            <li> the only such primer product I have found that really helps smooth the wrinkles under my eye.  Onmy third tube.</li>
            <li> This product claims to improve your skins appearance and it didn&#x27;t let me down! I love what it does and it doesn&#x27;t require the use of more than just a small dab to create a beautiful result.</li>
            <li> Makes my eyelash makeup go on easily and look better.  Comes off easily with washing, but not just by itself.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Wish the company still made it.</li>
            <li> Love the texture of this primer, best I&#x27;ve ever used, I wish they didn&#x27;t stop the making them.  Just need to get them while they are still out there!</li>
            <li> My Walgreen&#x27;s kept advertising this new ROC product, but never got it in stock. So.....being possessed to have to have it, went online, much to husband&#x27;s dismay..again...and ordered it .  Price is very reasonable..Texture is lovely..no heavy fragrance which is good...but, can&#x27;t really tell if its doing the work it claims...Doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for around eye area, but as an eyelash primer before mascara, it works very nicely to prepare and separate lashes...</li>
            <li> I love this product, I&#x27;m very upset that the manufacturer has discontinued it.  It has really made my lashes fuller and stronger.  It really works.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this about three times now and I am very happy with it.  It is a great eye primer.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream for $9.99 at TJ Maxx.  I used it for about 10 days and noticed that the skin under my eyes were severely wrinkled like never before.  If you are going to try this cream make sure you keep a very close look at your skin.</li>
