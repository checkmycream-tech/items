    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Great price and work as described, makes flossing a breeze.  </li>
            <li>These work great for me.</li>
            <li>great for flossing a child&#x27;s teeth.</li>
            <li>Perhaps if you have perfect teeth with perfect, uniform and adequate separations between all your teeth, then this tool might work for you.</li>
            <li>Great product and and Great Service--would do business again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a Butler flosser for a good 20 years and just now got an updated one--</li>
            <li>Nice!</li>
            <li>Nice colors too!</li>
            <li>They seem fairly sturdy, and they are not as wasteful as the disposable variety.</li>
            <li>good quality.  </li>
            <li>so we feel good about not adding to land fill.  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>The supplier acted promptly and courteously.</li>
            <li>It is nicely engineered and it does what it says.</li>
            <li>I can use my own floss with these.</li>
            <li>Good for all ages to teach that flossing is not a difficult task!!</li>
            <li>I love the Floss Mate handle.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s even better than before:  </li>
            <li>wider mouth and improved design hold the floss in place so much better.  </li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>They were more like doll toys.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m ok with that.</li>
            <li>We love this too.  </li>
            <li>Sure beats fighting with the slippery string between your fingers.</li>
            <li>These are perfect for smaller mouths.  </li>
            <li>I was glad to find these.  </li>
            <li>Floss that is more string like (sort of wound) does not work well with this item.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for delivery in good time, the right product, and appropriate package.</li>
            <li>I gave up and went to a water pick, which is fine most of the time</li>
            <li>but with this tool it&#x27;s quite easy.  </li>
            <li>He likes flossing because this tool makes it so easy to do.  </li>
            <li>I wish it was still available in stores.</li>
            <li>Plus the smaller size and durability make it great for travel.</li>
            <li>so I can easily and quickly floss between my teeth.</li>
            <li>also environmentally friendly, if you care.</li>
            <li>a big thank you to Wright Heath Products for offering the Floss Mate at a good price.</li>
            <li>My 9 year old is learning to use this item so she can floss on her own.  </li>
            <li>You just have to make sure that you don&#x27;t put too much tension on the floss or the plastic ends will break off.</li>
            <li>The floss holders for sale at the local drugstores seemed to be made for people with tiny hands and perfect teeth.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this floss mate handle to anyone that wants to floss their teeth quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>If you do this with both ends, it takes about 18&amp;#34; of floss instead of 12&amp;#34;, but I have years and years worth of dental floss that I was given by dentists and never used.  </li>
            <li>I think this is worth a try</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m giving it a low rating because it does not provide a better clean than with your fingers.</li>
            <li>great - flossing is so much easier now, and uses less floss to boot.    </li>
            <li>The are very easy ti maneuver and they are not difficult to handle and add the floss as necessary.</li>
            <li>Many were disposable or only used proprietary dental floss sources.  </li>
            <li>This is mostly caused by the fact that it is crucial that the angle that you pull it out at must be exactly correct in two planes.</li>
            <li>much better than those flimsy disposable ones that constantly break.    </li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s not a throw away flosser</li>
            <li>This one is much more solidly made.  </li>
            <li>product is pretty straight forward and works like you would expect it to.</li>
            <li>My teeth are kind of crammed and are really tight together so this product doesn&#x27;t really work for me.  </li>
            <li>I wanted this to work - I really did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these for years and really like them.</li>
            <li>I did not want to drive to twenty different places just to find a floss handle that should be sold in every store because teeth are important.</li>
            <li>The longer reach makes flossing my children&#x27;s teeth much simpler.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking to help someone else floss, or finding it more difficult to reach in your own mouth</li>
            <li>The size is just right too--it&#x27;s a little smaller than others, which is great since I don&#x27;t need 8&amp;#34; of plastic to reach the back molars!  </li>
            <li>Husband broke his very old one and this one is at least as good.</li>
            <li>Nothing more, nothin less.    </li>
            <li>Perhaps if i only had this tool or nothing, then after enough months of training, I could get it to be better than using my hands to hold the floss.</li>
            <li>A bit larger than expected but does the job nicely.</li>
            <li>(you just need to be able to wind the floss tight around the wheel).</li>
            <li>I also like being able to set the tension on the floss by how tightly I pull the floss between the two ends of the floss mate handle.</li>
            <li>Floss alone is much cheaper (or free from the dentist), and this just seems less wasteful.  </li>
            <li>so I had to look for a new one</li>
            <li>The review process requires me to enter too much new inormation not pertinent to the product.</li>
            <li>But usually last about 3-6 months, so very reasonable.</li>
            <li>, one strand flosses allow for longer use, smoother fit between teeth, and stay tight.  </li>
            <li>I much prefer these to the disposable handled individual flossers.  </li>
            <li>Our six year old has been using it since he was three.  </li>
            <li>By keeping the floss in a straight line, you are not wrapping it around the tooth&#x27;s curves, and you remove far less plaque than the traditional way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, the straight floss line ends up cutting your gums more than the traditional way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this would be a good product for hard-to-reach back teeth, or people who have a disability like arthritis (who cannot use their fingers); but otherwise, just stick with the traditional flossing method.</li>
            <li>Clever idea - and immediately obvious why it&#x27;s not sold in stores anymore.    </li>
            <li>so I could get a better reach into the back of my mouth because it is hard to floss back there with my fingers.  </li>
            <li>Anyone having trouble should follow the directions, but also, add a few more winds of floss to prevent slippage.</li>
            <li>If you teeth aren&#x27;t tight then this would probably work really well.</li>
            <li>If your teeth tend to bind up much at all on the floss that you use by hand, then it if pretty certain that this tool will drive you mad.</li>

            <li> I would highly recommend it for others who have trouble getting their fingers to those back teeth to floss.  </li>
            <li> It is long enough that I don&#x27;t have to have my hand all the way in my mouth to reach those teeth.  </li>
            <li> tool is large enough for me to grasp firmly so that I can jam the floss into the tight gaps between my back teeth.  </li>
            <li> In the 1970s I owned something called a Daily Double, which was a double-ended dental tool with a toothbrush on one end and a floss holder on the other end.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t possibly get the floss tight enough to get it between your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because it is EXTREMELY overpriced for just a piece of plastic.  </li>
            <li> The floss can&#x27;t stay tight and will just bend rather than actually slide between your teeth.  </li>
            <li> If you only wrap the floss around the knob provided for that purpose, it won&#x27;t stay tight on the tool if you need to apply a lot of pressure to it.  </li>
            <li> And, it is a little different for each tooth!</li>
            <li> This is just a piece of garbage, no use at all, waste of money, creating pollution only.</li>
            <li> I always had trouble flossing with my fingers only.</li>
            <li> Seems a tad expensive for a formed hunk of plastic, but then again, see my first sentence.    </li>
            <li> I was sometimes reduced to using sharp tweezers to remove those bits of fiber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much less wasteful than the disposable brands in the stores.</li>
            <li> We use them with glide or tape like floss, wind it tight, and I can use that floss band with no adjustment with each flossing (we unwind and throw out floss after each use).  </li>
            <li> Why even waste your time on this piece of junk?  </li>
            <li> I have narrow gaps between my teeth</li>
            <li> They work well for small hands, and they get my kids to want to floss every night.  </li>
            <li> The button that you wind the floss around usually lasts about six months before breaking.  </li>
            <li> I was never able to master the technique of holding floss in my fingers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for over 20 years, and now have a hard time finding them locally,so</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s so often hard to find these.</li>
            <li> I have arthritis in my hands and hard to floss otherwise.</li>
            <li> Difficult to find in stores.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These are as-described, and individually sealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it a low rating because it does not provide a better clean than with your fingers. By keeping the floss in a straight line, you are not wrapping it around the tooth&#x27;s curves, and you remove far less plaque than the traditional way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, the straight floss line ends up cutting your gums more than the traditional way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this would be a good product for hard-to-reach back teeth, or people who have a disability like arthritis (who cannot use their fingers); but otherwise, just stick with the traditional flossing method.</li>
            <li> I much prefer these to the disposable handled individual flossers.  Floss alone is much cheaper (or free from the dentist), and this just seems less wasteful.  But to each his own!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is pretty straight forward and works like you would expect it to.</li>
            <li> I love the Floss Mate handle. I&#x27;ve been using them for over 20 years, and now have a hard time finding them locally,so a big thank you to Wright Heath Products for offering the Floss Mate at a good price.</li>
            <li> Why even waste your time on this piece of junk?  I got this in and tried tying my floss to it so I could get a better reach into the back of my mouth because it is hard to floss back there with my fingers.  Well guess what?  It didn&#x27;t work!  You can&#x27;t possibly get the floss tight enough to get it between your teeth.  If you have to push your floss between your teeth forget using this piece of junk.  The floss can&#x27;t stay tight and will just bend rather than actually slide between your teeth.  The plastic on this thing allows the floss to just slide around and not stay taut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never got a use out of them and have since retired them to the trash.</li>
            <li> They work well for small hands, and they get my kids to want to floss every night.  That&#x27;s a victory!  They seem fairly sturdy, and they are not as wasteful as the disposable variety.</li>
            <li> This tool is a life saver.  Well, a floss saver.  I could never get my fingers in my mouth to floss my back teeth but with this tool it&#x27;s quite easy.  I wish it was still available in stores. I had one when I was a child that recently broke so I had to look for a new one and I could only find it here.  I only gave it 4 stars because it is EXTREMELY overpriced for just a piece of plastic.  That&#x27;s all it is.  A Y shaped piece of plastic.  But it does it&#x27;s job and keeps me flossing so I had no choice but to pay it.  I would highly recommend it for others who have trouble getting their fingers to those back teeth to floss.  Simply wind the floss around this tool and it stays put and taunt.  You can use whatever floss brand you desire and it&#x27;s much less wasteful than the disposable brands in the stores.</li>
            <li> The button that you wind the floss around usually lasts about six months before breaking.  This one lasted two days before the button broke off.  I have a 15 year-old one with the same brand name which is still fully functional.  They must have outsourced these newer ones to China.    The supplier acted promptly and courteously.</li>
            <li> Great price and work as described, makes flossing a breeze.  Anyone having trouble should follow the directions, but also, add a few more winds of floss to prevent slippage.</li>
            <li> Thank you for delivery in good time, the right product, and appropriate package.</li>
            <li> Good for all ages to teach that flossing is not a difficult task!! You will never be without this once you try it.</li>
            <li> Great product and and Great Service--would do business again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a Butler flosser for a good 20 years and just now got an updated one--it&#x27;s even better than before:  wider mouth and improved design hold the floss in place so much better.  I love this product</li>
            <li> Clever idea - and immediately obvious why it&#x27;s not sold in stores anymore.    Works great - flossing is so much easier now, and uses less floss to boot.    Delivery was spot on - no complains there.    Seems a tad expensive for a formed hunk of plastic, but then again, see my first sentence.    Nice!</li>
            <li> This is just a piece of garbage, no use at all, waste of money, creating pollution only. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> In the 1970s I owned something called a Daily Double, which was a double-ended dental tool with a toothbrush on one end and a floss holder on the other end.  The brush was soon used to the point of uselessness, but I used the floss holder for years.  Eventually the plastic broke, after a couple of decades of use.  When I went to buy another, to my dismay there were none to be found.  The floss holders for sale at the local drugstores seemed to be made for people with tiny hands and perfect teeth.  They were more like doll toys.  Many were disposable or only used proprietary dental floss sources.  I gave up and went to a water pick, which is fine most of the time but sometimes just can&#x27;t get at stubborn bits of food stuck between my molars.  I was sometimes reduced to using sharp tweezers to remove those bits of fiber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tool is large enough for me to grasp firmly so that I can jam the floss into the tight gaps between my back teeth.  It is long enough that I don&#x27;t have to have my hand all the way in my mouth to reach those teeth.  It uses generic floss.  It does have one weakness.  If you only wrap the floss around the knob provided for that purpose, it won&#x27;t stay tight on the tool if you need to apply a lot of pressure to it.  But you can wrap it around the knob, then around the handle, and then around the knob again, and it will stay.  If you do this with both ends, it takes about 18&amp;#34; of floss instead of 12&amp;#34;, but I have years and years worth of dental floss that I was given by dentists and never used.  I don&#x27;t think I will run out soon.</li>
            <li> This impliment &amp;#34;should&amp;#34; work. It is nicely engineered and it does what it says. The problem (that I had no idea would exist when I bought it) is that it just gets hopelessly stuck between my teeth. This is mostly caused by the fact that it is crucial that the angle that you pull it out at must be exactly correct in two planes. And, it is a little different for each tooth! Perhaps if i only had this tool or nothing, then after enough months of training, I could get it to be better than using my hands to hold the floss. I wanted this to work - I really did. Perhaps if you have perfect teeth with perfect, uniform and adequate separations between all your teeth, then this tool might work for you. If your teeth tend to bind up much at all on the floss that you use by hand, then it if pretty certain that this tool will drive you mad.</li>
            <li> I was never able to master the technique of holding floss in my fingers. Geeez I love this product! But it&#x27;s so often hard to find these. Why again doesn&#x27;t everyone use this?????</li>
            <li> I always had trouble flossing with my fingers only. These work great for me. The do not save on the amount of floss used. But I&#x27;m ok with that.</li>
            <li> The dental floss holder is as expectd.  Nothing more, nothin less.    The review process requires me to enter too much new inormation not pertinent to the product.</li>
            <li> great for flossing a child&#x27;s teeth. only drawback is that it uses a lot of floss.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years and really like them. I have arthritis in my hands and hard to floss otherwise. I have narrow gaps between my teeth so the ones with floss attached already get stuck. I can use my own floss with these. Only problem is I use waxed floss, so get wax buildup around winding area. But usually last about 3-6 months, so very reasonable.</li>
            <li> rigid construction. good quality.  much better than those flimsy disposable ones that constantly break.    also environmentally friendly, if you care.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping to get out buying refills for my existing flosser.  My teeth are kind of crammed and are really tight together so this product doesn&#x27;t really work for me.  If you teeth aren&#x27;t tight then this would probably work really well.</li>
            <li> We love this too.  First, it&#x27;s not a throw away flosser so we feel good about not adding to land fill.  Our six year old has been using it since he was three.  He likes flossing because this tool makes it so easy to do.  Nice colors too!</li>
            <li> Difficult to find in stores. I did not want to drive to twenty different places just to find a floss handle that should be sold in every store because teeth are important. Using this for work. Still using my fingers for home. I don&#x27;t want my boss to catch me knuckle-deep in the bathroom because the secretary pool decides to order spinach quiche and ribs.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t leave home without it.  Buy 2 so you have one at home also.</li>
            <li> A bit larger than expected but does the job nicely. Sure beats fighting with the slippery string between your fingers.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for smaller mouths.  The are very easy ti maneuver and they are not difficult to handle and add the floss as necessary.</li>
            <li> Ours had blue &amp; red. I already had another style for my daughter. Works well and helps assist with flossing. I think was made in USA but I can&#x27;t remember.</li>
            <li> I received one of these around age 11, and I found it easier to use then my fingers.  When our pediatric dentist wanted me to floss my girls teeth I was glad to find these.  The longer reach makes flossing my children&#x27;s teeth much simpler.  I bought one for each of them and we have been using them several years.  We use them with glide or tape like floss, wind it tight, and I can use that floss band with no adjustment with each flossing (we unwind and throw out floss after each use).  Floss that is more string like (sort of wound) does not work well with this item.  Waxed, one strand flosses allow for longer use, smoother fit between teeth, and stay tight.  My 9 year old is learning to use this item so she can floss on her own.  If you are looking to help someone else floss, or finding it more difficult to reach in your own mouth I think this is worth a try (you just need to be able to wind the floss tight around the wheel).</li>
            <li> I bought this flosser after another one broke on me.  This one is much more solidly made.  The size is just right too--it&#x27;s a little smaller than others, which is great since I don&#x27;t need 8&amp;#34; of plastic to reach the back molars!  Plus the smaller size and durability make it great for travel.</li>
            <li> I received a blue and red floss mate handle when my purchase arrived and I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. The floss mate handle holds the floss so I can easily and quickly floss between my teeth. I also like being able to set the tension on the floss by how tightly I pull the floss between the two ends of the floss mate handle. You just have to make sure that you don&#x27;t put too much tension on the floss or the plastic ends will break off. I would recommend this floss mate handle to anyone that wants to floss their teeth quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> Husband broke his very old one and this one is at least as good.</li>
