            <li>I burned my hair using a cheap hair dryer--lesson learned!  </li>
            <li>love this shampoo and conditioner...</li>
            <li>However I moved to North Carolina and found this product magical effects were no longer there.  </li>
            <li>and I was so excited to find these liter bottles at such a great price!</li>
            <li>That is how you get the full use out of this product!</li>
            <li>Hands down THE BEST hair care products I have used.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, wavy/curly hair that is color treated.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s sulfate free</li>
            <li>It makes my hair look and feel fantastic</li>
            <li>so I went to many different websites and read many reviews and decided that based on what I was reading that this product was the top rated product from consumers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I lived in New York this product worked amazingly well.  </li>
            <li>The product is fantastic and the delivery of the product was exactly what they said it would be - I highly recommend this shampoo for anyone who has struggled to find a product that your hair and scalp will love!  </li>
            <li>It is nice and soft and a lot easier to style it since she began using it.</li>
            <li>I always get it quickly too.</li>
            <li>It is amazing and the only shampoo and conditioner I can use because of citric acid allergy.</li>
            <li>This is worth a try</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells and how soft my hair feels.</li>
            <li>price is worth it.</li>
            <li>I could feel a difference in my hair right away.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner smells so good and moisturizes without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li>I find the price to be  very reasonable on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The oil in the conditioner is very intense.</li>
            <li>My beautician washed my hair with this shampoo and for the first time since I lived in my house I could run a brush through my hair without a problem.</li>
            <li>I had recently got my hair color treated and felt that I needed a better shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>Lanza Healing Haircare is exactly what it says this product saved my damaged color treated hair</li>
            <li>I tried the conditioner first.</li>
            <li>my hair color has stayed bright and shiny and hasn&#x27;t faded as much as usual.</li>
            <li>It leaves ur hair smelling fresh and clean even the next day</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased these items several times because it&#x27;s a fantastic product for keratin treated hair.</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioning duo really does heal your hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would really recommend blow drying your hair and then straightening it.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money if you want quality and professional stuff for your hair.</li>
            <li>Purchased for way too much at my health club spa.</li>
            <li>In fact, because I spent so much on it, it has encouraged me to take better care of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I highly reccommend anyone who is looking for a new line to try Lanza!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>but if you live in the northeast don&#x27;t hesitate.  </li>
            <li>Probably too heavy for thin hair, but perfect for my course over-processed mane.</li>
            <li>My hair feels great and is much easier to style, I hardly need any product at all, just a few drops of serum</li>
            <li>It works great on very thick dry hair!</li>
            <li>Lanza, FANTASTIC everyday shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>When I started using this shampoo it made my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>With bleached highlights, naturally wavy but on occasion I will straighten it or blow it</li>
            <li>am completely dissatisfied with this product</li>
            <li>and I surprised her and bought  a gift set of this product for one of her Christmas presents.</li>
            <li>My hair is wavy frizzy but this product made it feel soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Keeps hair soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>Also, I have a pixie style and I love that a little bit of product goes a long way, so the bottles last forever.</li>
            <li>It leaves my virgin roots very oily and my bleached strips very dry.</li>
            <li>It provides enough hydration but does not weight my hari down like most other products on the market.  </li>
            <li>Small quantities (one press of the plunger) of both the shampoo and conditioner suffice and the results are both cleaner and better looking and conditioned than with Redken or any other high-end line I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s the water here and not the shampo (hard water and full of chlorine in nc)</li>

            <li> have personally used these products for years, no matter what other hair care lines</li>
            <li> It makes my hair dry and tangled like a rats nest.</li>
            <li> I also recommend that you use Lanza Trauma Treatment before you blow dry your hair</li>
            <li> My hair turned really dry after 1 month of using it.</li>
            <li> If you have dry hair, BUY THIS SHAMPOO/CONDITIONER SET.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves hair very dry.</li>
            <li> She has long black hair but dyes it blond.</li>
            <li> I will throw it away and get some other shampoo.</li>
            <li> Italian girl, with very long dark black very thick hair.</li>
            <li> Purchased both for way less on Amazon.</li>
            <li> , shampoo won&#x27;t make your hair feel dried out and the conditioner is awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> had never blow dried my hair before this product and now I do every time because it makes my hair</li>
            <li> Before using this my hair was dull and dry dye to excessive bleaching.</li>
            <li> we have used volumizing products in the past and our hair stylist encouraged us to go to this product instead</li>
            <li> The house that I&#x27;m renting doesn&#x27;t have a water softener and the water is realllly hard.</li>
            <li> have thick color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has thick, wavy, color treated hair.</li>
            <li> She has had some bad salon experiences in the last year with color that just about ruined her hair.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy from my salon, but so expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really the worst Shampoo and Conditioner</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair.</li>
            <li> wash my hair every day because if I don&#x27;t halfway into day 2 you can tell that it starts to get oily and dirty</li>
            <li> I have never been disappointed with any of their products.  </li>

            <li> This duo has been really good for my fine frizzy hair. An added bonus is my hair color has stayed bright and shiny and hasn&#x27;t faded as much as usual. It leaves ur hair smelling fresh and clean even the next day</li>
            <li> One of the best shampoo/conditioner combos on the market</li>
            <li> The house that I&#x27;m renting doesn&#x27;t have a water softener and the water is realllly hard. It makes my hair dry and tangled like a rats nest. I tried a ton of different shampoos and nothing worked. My beautician washed my hair with this shampoo and for the first time since I lived in my house I could run a brush through my hair without a problem. It&#x27;s a miracle in a bottle. Love love love it!</li>
            <li> These are fantastic hair products! We were using the Aveda products for quite awhile and just couldn&#x27;t justify the price of continuing once we found these. Very similar results to the Aveda for about a third the price.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It has a great scent and is very moisturizing for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Although its pricey I have been using for 5 years.</li>
            <li> My hair is silkier and looks better than ever. Also, I have a pixie style and I love that a little bit of product goes a long way, so the bottles last forever.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair very dry. I love Lanza&#x27;s Healing Treatment.</li>
            <li> my hair stylist recommended them to me a couple of years ago. Best out there if you want great hair get them improves your hair stronger shinner just makes your hair much better.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner works wonders.  I could feel a difference in my hair right away.  My stylist recommended it to me and the Amazon price could not be beat.  My hair feels great and is much easier to style, I hardly need any product at all, just a few drops of serum and it still looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> This product line is great! I highly reccommend anyone who is looking for a new line to try Lanza! Everything I&#x27;ve tried has been awesome!</li>
            <li> Love this product!!! Smells great!!! Makes my hair feel like I just left a salon... Great product !! Definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased these items several times because it&#x27;s a fantastic product for keratin treated hair. I always get it quickly too. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair. I need a shampoo that was going to clean it but not leaving it limp and dull looking. This not only did that, but it made it fuller and it has actually began to grow again!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, love the way my hair looks and feels.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product.  Hands down THE BEST hair care products I have used.  Lanza is just outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick color treated hair.  My daughter has thick, wavy, color treated hair. She has had some bad salon experiences in the last year with color that just about ruined her hair.  These products have been awesome.  Can they fix the damage?  No shampoo or conditioner can do that, but they have helped keep her hair looking great and kept the healthy hair, healthy.&lt;br /&gt;I have personally used these products for years, no matter what other hair care lines I try, I always come back to Lanza.&lt;br /&gt;Great smell, shampoo won&#x27;t make your hair feel dried out and the conditioner is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s hair is different and responds differently to products.  This is worth a try and I would definitely buy these products again.  And again.</li>
            <li> The product is fantastic and the delivery of the product was exactly what they said it would be - I highly recommend this shampoo for anyone who has struggled to find a product that your hair and scalp will love!  It is amazing and the only shampoo and conditioner I can use because of citric acid allergy. Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> we have used volumizing products in the past and our hair stylist encouraged us to go to this product instead and we love it</li>
            <li> Lanza is an excellent hair care product. I love the way it smells and how soft my hair feels.</li>
            <li> Love this brand.  Smells Hawaiian and makes hair feel great.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my wife  on a recommendation from our daughter-in-law. My wife says it&#x27;s really great and leaves her hair more manageable  with great aroma! When she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> Lanza, FANTASTIC everyday shampoo and conditioner. Shipper excellent timing!! 10 star shipper and product.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioning duo really does heal your hair. Before using this my hair was dull and dry dye to excessive bleaching. When I started using this shampoo it made my hair soft and shiny. The smell it leaves is great as well. My ends are not as crispy as they were before. I will continue to use this product knowing I will gain my healthy hair once again.</li>
            <li> I have fine, wavy/curly hair that is color treated.  This product is fantastic!  It provides enough hydration but does not weight my hari down like most other products on the market.  I wish L&#x27;anza would still be in business.</li>
            <li> I have used Lanza products for quite some time and I was so excited to find these liter bottles at such a great price! If you have not tried Lanza, you should!</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo and conditioner based on the consumer reviews alone. I was using Paul Mitchell before. I had recently got my hair color treated and felt that I needed a better shampoo and conditioner so I went to many different websites and read many reviews and decided that based on what I was reading that this product was the top rated product from consumers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hair every day because if I don&#x27;t halfway into day 2 you can tell that it starts to get oily and dirty looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair type: Italian girl, with very long dark black very thick hair. With bleached highlights, naturally wavy but on occasion I will straighten it or blow it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for over 3 months now. It&#x27;s really the worst Shampoo and Conditioner I ever bought. It leaves my virgin roots very oily and my bleached strips very dry. I have broke out on my back in the areas that my hairs touch. I have broke out on the sides of my face where the hairs touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid $80.00 for this set, price not a problem for good hair care but this was a waste of my money. I cannot wait until it&#x27;s gone so I can get something better.&lt;br /&gt;I am completely dissatisfied with this product and I don&#x27;t recommend it for anyone.</li>
            <li> Lanza Healing Haircare is exactly what it says this product saved my damaged color treated hair and I absolutely love it! It&#x27;s smells great and leaves your hair feeling light and smooth I also recommend that you use Lanza Trauma Treatment before you blow dry your hair and it&#x27;s fairly inexpensive on amazon!</li>
            <li> These products leave your hair feeling silky and smelling delicious. My daughter came to visit over the holidays and I surprised her and bought  a gift set of this product for one of her Christmas presents. She was over the top with happiness.  . . .she loves this twin set! I find the price to be  very reasonable on Amazon. The bottles are Xlarge and go a long way.  It works great on very thick dry hair! I also buy the conditioner  hair masque by Lanza.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo ever made!!!</li>
            <li> I got my hair keratin treated and my stylist recommended this shampoo. I bought it through Amazon and I inmediately started using it. My hair turned really dry after 1 month of using it. I will throw it away and get some other shampoo. Yes, it&#x27;s sulfate free but it doesn&#x27;t work on keratin treated hair. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> quite happy with product</li>
            <li> Love Lanza. I usually buy from my salon, but so expensive.</li>
            <li> Lanza is an excellent product and I am very pleased with the health of my hair since I have been using this product. The fragrance is delicious and I receive many positive comments of my hair and how good I smell when I am close to others. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Small quantities (one press of the plunger) of both the shampoo and conditioner suffice and the results are both cleaner and better looking and conditioned than with Redken or any other high-end line I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Lanza was recommended to me a couple years ago for my color treated hair. I love this product. It makes my hair look and feel fantastic and I get compliments all the time.</li>
            <li> THE BEST shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!!!</li>
            <li> Repaired my perm fried hair!</li>
            <li> I burned my hair using a cheap hair dryer--lesson learned!  This shampoo and conditioner smells so good and moisturizes without weighing it down.  I can tell that my hair is healing.  It is great in combination with the Healing Oil and the Magic Bullet--also Lanza products.</li>
            <li> If you have dry hair, BUY THIS SHAMPOO/CONDITIONER SET.&lt;br /&gt;If you have curly, frizzy hair, BUY THIS SET.&lt;br /&gt;If you think your hair is unmanageable and cant be helped. Buy it!!!&lt;br /&gt;I love this shampoo and conditioner... It is literally the greatest thing ever made.&lt;br /&gt;The price is worth it. In fact, because I spent so much on it, it has encouraged me to take better care of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I had never blow dried my hair before this product and now I do every time because it makes my hair so so soft.&lt;br /&gt;Use this set with the L&#x27;anza leave in healing treatment creme in the red bottle and your hair will looking like a million bucks no matter how damaged it is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would really recommend blow drying your hair and then straightening it. That is how you get the full use out of this product!</li>
            <li> Great product!  I have never been disappointed with any of their products.  The oil in the conditioner is very intense.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this shampoo and conditioner and it has made a big difference the way her hair looks. She has long black hair but dyes it blond. It is nice and soft and a lot easier to style it since she began using it. I can always smell it the day after using it and it has a nice scent to it. Definitely worth the money if you want quality and professional stuff for your hair.</li>
            <li> When I lived in New York this product worked amazingly well.  I would buy it by the truckload.  My hair is wavy frizzy but this product made it feel soft and manageable. However I moved to North Carolina and found this product magical effects were no longer there.  I think it&#x27;s the water here and not the shampo (hard water and full of chlorine in nc) but if you live in the northeast don&#x27;t hesitate.  Buy buy buy.</li>
            <li> I tried the conditioner first. Purchased for way too much at my health club spa. Decided to give the shampoo a try too and really liked it. Purchased both for way less on Amazon. I had been using Biolage hydrating balm, this was comparable. Probably too heavy for thin hair, but perfect for my course over-processed mane.</li>
            <li> Keeps hair soft and supple.  Smells nice too.</li>
