            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t afford a full bottle of this during Christmas - so this was perfect!</li>
            <li>I think this is quite possibly the best cologne I have ever bought.</li>
            <li>(It also helps that most of those compliments come from girls)</li>
            <li>this a try.u will love it</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this.  </li>
            <li>He and his friends all love it and he has to hide it to keep his friends from borrowing it.</li>
            <li>absolutely in love with it</li>
            <li>and have had many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>girls love it.</li>
            <li>Girls love it</li>
            <li>bit&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;The ladies love it, hell</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing more needs said.</li>
            <li>It has a very clean scent which lasts for quite awhile.</li>
            <li>Loved this product so much that i purchased one for my Dad for his Birthday.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;shipping was easy  </li>
            <li>I really love the smell, great to wear around a female u just meeting or just met</li>
            <li>This is someone strong smell, it&#x27;s reminding of the 1million Paco</li>
            <li>but my gf did say that she enjoyed the scent very much!</li>
            <li>You really have to spray on like 10 times if you want some kind of an effect.</li>
            <li>I (like a lot of people) was attracted to the pricing &amp; free shipping</li>
            <li>Not over powering, not too light.  </li>
            <li>On the plus side if you tell someone you&#x27;re wearing Gucci cologne it makes you sound rich.</li>
            <li>Amazing girls love it and my girl friend doesn&#x27;t let me hug other girls because she saids that they would fall in love with me</li>
            <li>i bought it as a new year&#x27;s  gift for my friend and he loved it so much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s alittle bit strong for morning time and hot humedite days.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and the right product for the cheapest price :)</li>
            <li>It smells crisp and clean but also has some sweet tones to it.</li>
            <li>but it seems to work just great with my other sprays!</li>
            <li>this is me 2nd bottle, and i don&#x27;t think the sent is that strong, but every one has commented how much they love it !</li>
            <li>the bottle also has a unique look, which in a way hides how much the bottle has in it.</li>
            <li>Original packaging, smells and looks real.</li>
            <li>U cant go wrong wit this purchase, it smells awesome.</li>
            <li>It has a very sweet and fresh smell that is different from most other cologne</li>
            <li>Gucci Guilty for men is a light pleasant citrus smell that won&#x27;t offended anyone</li>
            <li>Very manly but not musky manly.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.will buy again from this seller very soon.so if u lookin for one.give</li>
            <li>it came fast</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just not the sort of scent I really go for.</li>
            <li>He really loves it, and oh my my fragrance is sooooo damn goood</li>
            <li>Really liked Gucci Guilty and have worn it awhile, but since have started wearing L&#x27;Homme by Yves Sait Laurent and like it much better.</li>
            <li>I definitely reccommend this if you are looking for something to wear on fancy or special occasions.</li>
            <li>you get more and pay less.</li>
            <li>I guess I had high expectations therfore</li>
            <li>I sprayed some on me at 8am in the morning, had a full active day and still up to now</li>
            <li>it was delivered fast and as promised smelling like a mix of travis barker mixed with lady godiva and it is irresistable to the women who walk any where near</li>
            <li>so I decided to give online EDT spray buying a try &amp; ordered Kenzo (shipped directly by Amazon)</li>
            <li>I may have thought nothing of it if I had not read so many negative reviews.</li>
            <li>It was a gift for my 17 year old son at Christmas.  </li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Its ok but doesnt rank at the top of my favorites.  </li>
            <li>With these I&#x27;ve almost doubled up, can barely smell them on myself &amp; even though the faint smell lasts the whole day (which leads me to believe they are the \\&quot;genuine article\\&quot;)</li>
            <li>The scent is great but too bad it only lasts for 15 min to 1 hour.  </li>
            <li>With my other EDT sprays (which are not overpowering scents) 3 sprays will last the whole day.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> And long lasting..</li>
            <li> The reason why I have given the fair rating of 3/5 is because it is not a counterfeit scent that I have received with both orders just watered down ones in my opinion because I find it hard to believe that a quality fragrance can be manufactured so weak.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of colognes, having owned quite a few ranging from expensive brands to cheap go to colognes.</li>
            <li> Quicker than expected, not damaged nor anything...</li>
            <li> With all my other sprays I get compliments from strangers (at the very least from my wife) but with these the only person who could smell them was myself and that is barely.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Also I have to add that the scent is not over powering and does not give off an abrasive Odor that other colognes tend to do</li>
            <li> they have no potency, which I believe is because the product has been watered down.</li>
            <li> &amp; Gucci Guilty (shipped from New York Perfumes via Amazon).</li>
            <li> Not too overpowering but seems to wear off a little sooner than my others I have on the shelf.</li>
            <li> Now I know how patrons feel when they get watered down alcohol at a bar...disappointed!</li>
            <li> Not for everyday use in my opinion, but can be used often.</li>
            <li> I had read a lot of reviews for various fragrances purchased on Amazon &amp; one complaint that kept coming up a lot is fake or diluted products.</li>
            <li> , I blind bought the men&#x27;s version for him.  </li>
            <li> they are very weak!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I think this is quite possibly the best cologne I have ever bought. It smells crisp and clean but also has some sweet tones to it. I just received it 2 days ago and I have constantly gotten compliments since wearing it. (It also helps that most of those compliments come from girls) I definitely reccommend this if you are looking for something to wear on fancy or special occasions.</li>
            <li> this is me 2nd bottle, and i don&#x27;t think the sent is that strong, but every one has commented how much they love it ! sooooo im gonna def keep buying it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of colognes, having owned quite a few ranging from expensive brands to cheap go to colognes. Gucci guilty has to be ranked among my top 5 of colognes. It has a very clean scent which lasts for quite awhile. I sprayed some on me at 8am in the morning, had a full active day and still up to now 1215am I can still smell it! I haven&#x27;t received any compliments yet from others as I&#x27;ve been only using this product for a couple days but my gf did say that she enjoyed the scent very much! Also I have to add that the scent is not over powering and does not give off an abrasive Odor that other colognes tend to do</li>
            <li> This is a excellent smelling cologne. Very manly but not musky manly. On the plus side if you tell someone you&#x27;re wearing Gucci cologne it makes you sound rich. Don&#x27;t let the pricing on this fool you. At the time of this review a 3.0 oz bottle is $51, a 1.6 oz is $35, but a 1.0 oz bottle is $41. I thought about buying the 1.0 oz bottle so I could sample it. I checked the prices and with the 1.6 oz you get more and pay less.</li>
            <li> The scent is great but too bad it only lasts for 15 min to 1 hour.  You really have to spray on like 10 times if you want some kind of an effect.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and the right product for the cheapest price :) The packaging, like someone else did look sketchy but it doesn&#x27;t matter because it was protected and good when I took it out.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Not for everyday use in my opinion, but can be used often. Try it out in stores before you buy it though.</li>
            <li> it was delivered fast and as promised smelling like a mix of travis barker mixed with lady godiva and it is irresistable to the women who walk any where near</li>
            <li> It has a very sweet and fresh smell that is different from most other cologne the bottle also has a unique look, which in a way hides how much the bottle has in it.</li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t afford a full bottle of this during Christmas - so this was perfect! A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> U cant go wrong wit this purchase, it smells awesome. Shipping was fast.will buy again from this seller very soon.so if u lookin for one.give this a try.u will love it</li>
            <li> It was a christmas gift for my boy friend! He loved it and it smells so nice!&lt;br /&gt;shipping was easy  it came fast and I&#x27;m really happy.</li>
            <li> I had read a lot of reviews for various fragrances purchased on Amazon &amp; one complaint that kept coming up a lot is fake or diluted products. I (like a lot of people) was attracted to the pricing &amp; free shipping so I decided to give online EDT spray buying a try &amp; ordered Kenzo (shipped directly by Amazon) &amp; Gucci Guilty (shipped from New York Perfumes via Amazon). Orders arrived on time, packaging &amp; bottles seemed legit, the fragrances smelled like they were supposed to with one problem...they are very weak! I may have thought nothing of it if I had not read so many negative reviews. With my other EDT sprays (which are not overpowering scents) 3 sprays will last the whole day. With these I&#x27;ve almost doubled up, can barely smell them on myself &amp; even though the faint smell lasts the whole day (which leads me to believe they are the \\&quot;genuine article\\&quot;) they have no potency, which I believe is because the product has been watered down. With all my other sprays I get compliments from strangers (at the very least from my wife) but with these the only person who could smell them was myself and that is barely. It&#x27;s a shame companies still do business like this but they have lost mine. Went to a local store today (Perfumania) &amp; what a difference! The reason why I have given the fair rating of 3/5 is because it is not a counterfeit scent that I have received with both orders just watered down ones in my opinion because I find it hard to believe that a quality fragrance can be manufactured so weak. Maybe my sense of smell is off but it seems to work just great with my other sprays! Now I know how patrons feel when they get watered down alcohol at a bar...disappointed!</li>
            <li> Loved this product so much that i purchased one for my Dad for his Birthday.  Wish it was bigger but still does the Job</li>
            <li> Its ok but doesnt rank at the top of my favorites.  Not too overpowering but seems to wear off a little sooner than my others I have on the shelf.</li>
            <li> What can I say, it smells likeI thought I it would. How can anyone complain about getting what they wanted?</li>
            <li> i bought it as a new year&#x27;s  gift for my friend and he loved it so much. Anyway, i will order one later.</li>
            <li> Smells great and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my bf and he loves it.. Smells great. And long lasting.. He keeps raving about it</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this.  It was a gift for my 17 year old son at Christmas.  He and his friends all love it and he has to hide it to keep his friends from borrowing it.</li>
            <li> smells absolutely amazing. absolutely in love with it and have had many compliments on it. whether you are walking by or getting close, it grabs attention. girls love it.</li>
            <li> Great scent and smells great and lasts the night away. A number of my friends both male and female asked me what the fragrance was. They went out and bout some for themselves or gifts for their mates.</li>
            <li> I wear the female version of this, so short on gift ideas for my boyfriend, I blind bought the men&#x27;s version for him.  It smells like soap to me--a really nice soap--but a soap nonetheless.  It&#x27;s just not the sort of scent I really go for.</li>
            <li> Great scent. I took a chance and got this for my boyfriend for Christmas last year. Of course I smelled it before giving it to him and couldn&#x27;t be happier. He loves it too. 8 months later, there&#x27;s still cologne left in the bottle. Great value, great smell, great gamble :)</li>
            <li> I really love the smell, great to wear around a female u just meeting or just met and she would die for u!!!</li>
            <li> I have bought it a gift for my hubby. He really loves it, and oh my my fragrance is sooooo damn goood never goes away from the clothes</li>
            <li> This is just a great product! Girls love it, I am getting so many complements !! And the container with a liquid is big, I didn’t expect it to be like that.  The great smell stays for hours.</li>
            <li> Great smelling cologne bought as a gift</li>
            <li> Amazing girls love it and my girl friend doesn&#x27;t let me hug other girls because she saids that they would fall in love with me</li>
            <li> This scent is rediculous. Not over powering, not too light.  Perfect blend of &amp;#34;you smell so damn good&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;lets slip away for a bit&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;The ladies love it, hell I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing more needs said.</li>
            <li> Original packaging, smells and looks real. The only problem I have is that it took extra time for me to get it.</li>
            <li> This is someone strong smell, it&#x27;s reminding of the 1million Paco</li>
            <li> i claim the reall stuff here none of the bait and switch. arrived on time and the package was well shipped</li>
            <li> My husband has always worn Gucci Envy, but when it was discontinued we had to find something different. I took a gamble and ordered this, and he loves it. And he is picky when it comes to cologne.</li>
            <li> Quicker than expected, not damaged nor anything...</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t attacked in the elevator, but I did get some comments.</li>
            <li> I prefer my gucci. It is the best perfume.&lt;br /&gt;The best products.</li>
            <li> great smell. If u want to impress a woman put this on...</li>
            <li> Very elegant smell love it, makes a man feel sexy and proud. Great gift for my sons, will continue to purchase this cologne over and over again.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and it was well protected and it smells really really good!! You should definably get yourself one of these Gucci&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I guess I had high expectations therfore I didn&#x27;t find it Wow. Although I think people are deffrent and it might be wonderful for some one elese. It&#x27;s alittle bit strong for morning time and hot humedite days.</li>
            <li> Gucci Guilty for men is a light pleasant citrus smell that won&#x27;t offended anyone, it won&#x27;t capture anyone&#x27;s attention either. It smells like axe, unsophisticated.</li>
            <li> Really liked Gucci Guilty and have worn it awhile, but since have started wearing L&#x27;Homme by Yves Sait Laurent and like it much better.</li>
