            <li>Dermalogica is the best and usually are the products that they used while they were in school.  </li>
            <li>I can use my regular moisturizer with this, and my face looks and feels really nice!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to find this on amazon.</li>
            <li>Hydrolyzed wheat protein tops the list, but the rest of them aren&#x27;t that friendly either.  </li>
            <li>Skin will never feel as clean as it will after you use this cleansing product..</li>
            <li>You rub it into the your face with your fingertips for about 60 seconds, and wipe clean.  </li>
            <li>There are no artificial colors or fragrances, a huge bonus for me because of my skin sensitivities, but it does contain tea tree oil which gives it a light, clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I felt like it was rubbing rice powder on my face, and it felt really clean after, but that&#x27;s it....</li>
            <li>definitely the best option for a soft face cleansing&lt;</li>

            <li>i have been using this product for over a year.i bought a new ones finishing the old one.its a great product especially for oily skin.its effective aginst pimples.i love it.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel so fresh, clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>This is a great product that i was first introduced during a facial i had.</li>
            <li>I started off with the travel size container, but soon splurged on the full size container because I love it so much.</li>
            <li>Amazing exfoliant for sensitive skin.  </li>

            <li>I began using this product in hopes it would help smooth out my skin, control my oil and make my skin look healthier and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I add more water and continue rubbing gently, then rinse it all off.  </li>
            <li>My skin has both oily and dry patches:  this product treats both areas successfully and without irritation.</li>
            <li>Sure, it may be $30, but your gonna end up spending OVER $30 on trying new products every year, so you might as well just invest in a good product that actually works!  </li>
            <li>Deleivered quickly  </li>

            <li>Love this scrub, it works well, leaves my skin exfoliated, soft and feeling so clean.</li>
            <li>Amazing combined with your favorite high-end cleanser and Dermalogica Active Moist hydrating lotion.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a long time and love it; it&#x27;s gentle yet feels very effective; I like having a product that is safe to use daily.</li>
            <li>If you like the powder and mildness of this, an equally great product (for less $) is DHC Washing Powder.</li>
            <li>My skin is now so smooth and glowing and my pimple scars are so generally faded that I can feel ok about leaving the house without foundation.</li>
            <li>love this product, makes my skin feel very soft</li>

            <li>I rarely use anything else.</li>
            <li>my face has developed a more even tone.  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin and get whiteheads but rarely get pimples.  </li>
            <li>I have been using St. Ives Fresh Skin Apricot Scrub [[ASIN:B000UVY8IE</li>
            <li>St. Ives, Fresh Skin Apricot Scrub, 6oz]].</li>
            <li>My skin is soft, and it looks healthy after using this.</li>
            <li>I agree, and the results are well worth it.  </li>
            <li>the most natural based on rice powder.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I bought myself a bottle pricy, but worth it.  </li>
            <li>I started using Dermalogica Daily Mircrofoliant years ago and liked it.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin glow even though it&#x27;s 51 years old :)</li>
            <li>My skin has a glow and is always fresh looking.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m satisfied with it so far.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll DEF see full results in 8 wks ;)</li>
            <li>that are only once-a-week, it&#x27;s nice to have something that I can use whenever I want my skin looking fab (date night, anyone?)</li>
            <li>but this is SO WORTH IT.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes it is better to purchase direct from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>Does not irritate my blemish-prone skin, but helps keep my skin more clear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this gentle exfoliant for years now, and it is effective for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Economical.</li>
            <li>and my facial skin has been smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s great that the general public can now purchase it on their own rather than going to a spa.&lt;br /&gt;**A key note that they don&#x27;t tell you (since it&#x27;s meant to be a Professionally-bought product where the practitioner already has been trained in it)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product, makes my skin really clean like after a facial.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews about this product, and was excited to buy since I really like Dermalogica products, but....</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and can&#x27;t really tolerate most acne or skin products.</li>
            <li>The lot number at the bottom of the bottle was in a larger font and the product printing label rubbed off very easily.  </li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive skin which irritates easily</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a fantastic product that works well for me, and I would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a fantastic product that works well for me, and I would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I have used so many different skin care products from low end to high end items but the Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant is the best exfoliant I have used!</li>
            <li>Great gentle scrub you can use daily with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>, my acne scars will have faded completely, however I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased and will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li>This brand is amazing and have used it for so long.</li>
            <li>Actually, I noy a result from the very first use but over time it just gets better.  </li>
            <li>I have acne occasionally and my face is smooth and healthy looking after every use, I&#x27;m expecting better results for a long term use.</li>
            <li>It exfoliates/cleanses my skin very well but doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling super tight/dry.</li>
            <li>Nice and gentle on the face, can be used daily.</li>
            <li>This product is gentle but effective at the same time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a great exfoliant, not too big</li>
            <li>You can feel the scrubbing particles at first, but the large pieces dissolve quickly</li>
            <li>Something like this should provide more effective results that can be seen and felt AFTER initial use (long term results).</li>
            <li>Harsh soaps can really do a number on my skin, heck even many powdered laundry detergents irritate my skin (not a problem with my homemade detergent however!!)</li>
            <li>The powder is very fine - not at all harsh or granular like most exfoliants, but it does the job very well.</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t use it daily, maybe 4 or 5 times weekly, it produces a more satisfying result than anything else I have used, always leaving my face looking better, and  without the overly dried feeling that some exfoliants produce.</li>
            <li>Very gentle on my combination skin.  </li>
            <li>This is a VERY gentle exfoliant for your skin.</li>
            <li>My skin feels clean and new after each use.</li>
            <li>When it arrived, I was ecstatic to use it for the first time til I ended up pouring a bunch of sand like substance into my hand..</li>
            <li>You will notice a difference the first time and EVERY time you use it.  </li>
            <li>I have enjoyed daily microfoliant for years.</li>
            <li>It has been eight days since I began using this product (combined with the overnight clearing gel and clearing mattifer) and it was only when I snapped a picture today that I realsied how smooth my face looked!</li>
            <li>The first day I used it, I felt that my face was smoother but there was still acne and their associated marks.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, the finer exfoliant works better than larger exfoliating granules like apricot scrubs.  </li>
            <li>For a higher cost cleanser (compared to drug store products) .  </li>
            <li>I could feel the difference in the texture of my skin the first time i used it.</li>
            <li>I think It&#x27;s making a difference in my overall appearance, but time will tell for sure.</li>
            <li>This was my first time buying dermalogica products from amazon.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt smooth, soft, and energized.  </li>
            <li>higher in price</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite facial cleansers that I&#x27;ll use throughout the year.</li>
            <li>The texture threw me off at first.</li>
            <li>This was my first Dermalogica purchase</li>
            <li>If you are worried about the price, try the travel size first.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin smooth and soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li>I keep an air-tight container of it in the shower, put it on first, do my thing, and manipulate it here &amp; there while showering.  </li>
            <li>*  ; )</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does keep your skin looking fresh as it gently exfoliates, and my skin texture and tone has improved.</li>
            <li>Noticeable difference after the first try.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slightly gritty and doesn&#x27;t foam up like most products, but once you get used to that, I think you&#x27;ll like it</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve finally found my favorite exfoliant.</li>
            <li>The combo of chemical and mechanical exfoliants leave my skin baby soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>(just make sure you keep the bottle outside the shower or it cakes up around the holes.)</li>
            <li>Also make sure you rinse your face well or you will have white stuff on it.</li>
            <li>It works great and it last a long time.</li>
            <li>I love Dermalogica products especially the cleansers.  </li>
            <li>this is one of my favorite products to use daily in addition to face wash.</li>
            <li>and this is a great back up when my face have minor breakouts.  </li>

            <li>I recieved the microfoliant quickly and highly recommend this seller..</li>
            <li>It is often plagued by blackheads and pimples, but dry spots crop up too, and I have issues finding something that is gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>It is very rare that a product actually works and this one certainly surpasses expectations!!</li>
            <li>This paired with the dermalogica special cleaning gel makes your face feel so soft!</li>
            <li>I have rosacea...not the redness but the pustule/papular kind and have to be very careful with my skin.  </li>
            <li>After using it my skin looks so clean and feels amazingly soft.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so clean and soft.</li>
            <li>My skin feels clean after and soft.</li>
            <li>Mild enough for everyday use and my skin looks great -</li>
            <li>My face feels soft &amp; clean after using it.</li>
            <li>But my overall rating is good, because I definitely plan to keep buying this.</li>
            <li>this works great to clear the dead skin &amp; soften skin before I moisturize.</li>
            <li>First of all, I have been using this product for a long time and used to love it.  </li>
            <li>The little beads/particles do kind of dissolve/get foamy, and it takes a bit of practice to determine the right amount.  </li>
            <li>I mean it in the best possible way!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Vendor service was straightforward and quick; no issues with the purchase, and the delivery was in simple but sufficiently protective packaging - and it was fast.  </li>
            <li>first thing I noticed was that it does not take much of this product.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference at first</li>
            <li>I love how it dissipates slowly the more you scrub &amp; use it so as to not cause too much microdermabrasion.</li>
            <li>: Be sure to collect enough foliant powder into your palm, just enough to create a thin &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; to get best results.</li>
            <li>Easy on the skin, can be used as a daily exfoliant.</li>
            <li>Comes in a powdery form &amp; is simple &amp; easy to use.  </li>
            <li>only use the microfoliant about twice a week, but it keeps my skin feeling clean, soft, and smooth.</li>
            <li>I use in conjunction with the Dermal Clay Cleanser and the Age Smart Resurfacing Cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Came on time, Exactly what i have expected from the product, and a realy good price, with short supply time.</li>
            <li>Hands down my most favorite facial product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great texture without being too harsh and would be easy to use everyday although I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I thought this one was pretty unique, it&#x27;s actually a powder that you put on your hands and then add water to it and apply to the face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to get a good consistency with the water and powder.</li>
            <li>Since it comes in powder form and you have to mix it with water, it is hard to get a good consistency.  </li>
            <li>It exfoliates very nicely (not rough), cleanses very well, washes away easily and leaves a very soft feel to my skin.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product, just a little mixed with water and then rub it on your face and it does a great job.  </li>
            <li>this product is SO WORTH the $30 because in the long run I end up spending hundreds of dollars a year trying to find the right face wash anyway!</li>
            <li>Plus, it is in powder form, so you are more conscious of how much you use -- and since it is so effective, you only need to use a little bit each time, so</li>
            <li>I had been a huge fan of Glotherapeutics pumpkin scrub, but my facialist was out last time I went.</li>
            <li>As you massage it in, you feel the grit gently working on your skin, until  the product finally turns smooth.</li>
            <li>Gentle enuf to use every day which I do....</li>
            <li>one I continue to use as I really feels it helps exfoliate gently.</li>
            <li>So I really like the results of the Microfoliant on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Regardless, I&#x27;ve bought 3 of these because I like it that much.  </li>
            <li>Really cleans you skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on the skin yet it has exfoliating property.</li>
            <li>, so I really have to pay attention to how products affect my face.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin which is prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li>I really like Dermalogica products.  </li>
            <li>This and the clearing gel have helped so much fade out spots (no acne to cause them).</li>
            <li>This product feels like a gently abrasive yet calming oatmeal exfoliant designed for your face.</li>
            <li>If you buy anything of dermalogica, you must absolutely have this in your mix.  </li>
            <li>Gentle.</li>
            <li>You do not need to really rub it</li>
            <li>a gentle massage with do.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on my skin</li>
            <li>I really like the product.</li>
            <li>this does the job of exfoliation in gentle way.</li>
            <li>I bought this product from an Ulta store and found that Amazon&#x27;s price is much lower.</li>
            <li>I have yet to feel that I can overuse or over-scrub my face, all the ingredients are extremely gentle.</li>
            <li>It is especially great a few days after a peel when the dead skin is ready to come off and it just rolls it away.</li>
            <li>if you use it correctly .It helps minimize shine and really exfoliates gently.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and have used it for years.  </li>
            <li>and it really helped.</li>
            <li>This product is so gentle, you could use it every day.</li>
            <li>I just gently rub it around on my face in a circular motion, then rinse.  </li>
            <li>and I am really seeing some fast results in terms of skin</li>
            <li>Fast and efficient delivery.</li>
            <li>very smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It lost one point because it leaves my skin very shiny afterwards.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>and I have noticed a real difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>If you miss a spot you will notice it very soon...  </li>
            <li>He really likes the the product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s something I like to have around that much.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m African American and most products out there for skin and hair are harsh, so when an esthetician suggested it, I tried it and loved the results.</li>
            <li>that makes you think there is a lot more, but it&#x27;s empty.</li>
            <li>Using it before shaving gives you a really clean/close shave.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I dont feel that this really works for me.</li>
            <li>I really like the cheaper price on Amazon, but I will order from the Dermalogica website from now on.  </li>
            <li>Light not harsh on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive skin and this product is very gentle.</li>
            <li>There are so many other products at our local drug store that carry a much more sensitive line.</li>
            <li>My husband, son and myself used it and loved it so much that we give each other facial...</li>
            <li>Always looking for a better deal, I bought my second bottle from amazon - the product I received from Amazon turns into more of a gritty paste when I use it, and it just plain doesn&#x27;t make my face feel clean.  </li>
            <li>I like the whole product line, but don&#x27;t use too many products due to the cost.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>This product is able to carefully remove the accumulation of dead cells on ones skin and reveals the new bright and clear skin ready to absorb the cream of your choice.</li>
            <li>and it works into a nice thick paste which  leaves your skin feeling clean but not tight at all.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally like powder style scrubs, my aversion came from using &#x27;Japanese Washing Grains&#x27; by The Body Shop when I was a teenager, but this product gives you a fine scrub that leaves your skin</li>
            <li>I can get the same clean feeling from a $5 Queen Helene or Garnier scrub.</li>
            <li>If I scrub too hard, I have a red face for hours, so I have to be gentle, and with this product, I end up with a nice, smooth face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very fine grain powder and you only need a tiny bit (I use about the size of a dime on my face).</li>
            <li>It really does make your skin smoother and glowing and yet mild enough to use every day.</li>
            <li>I really had high hopes for this, but I&#x27;ve had it since last fall and still have a full bottle.</li>
            <li>It is gentle, thorough, and it takes very little product to get great results, so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can see the full ingredients list in one of the product images (zoom in to read the tiny print).  </li>
            <li>I am usually the chick who HATES putting down more than $10 for any kind of face wash/cosmetic products...</li>
            <li>little micro balls are actually balls unlike other products, making it awesome for your pores..</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t live without this product!  </li>
            <li>I have pretty normal skin, I have pretty rare breakouts every few months, but they clear up quickly.</li>
            <li>I have huge pores on my nose that are always clogged and some of them have completely disappeared since starting to use this one week ago and the rest are about 1/2 the size they were and are not so visibly clogged!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s dry powder and mixes water well to make light paste.  </li>
            <li>Will not purchase from this particular vendor again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I don&#x27;t use it daily, I enjoy the soft, silky skin on my face and glow it leaves.</li>
            <li>This item shipped quickly but the box was not sealed and item was open.  </li>
            <li>but I realize that this is what makes it such a mild product.</li>
            <li>have been purchasing this product from a local beauty supply for 20% more for the last 4 years.</li>
            <li>Dermologica Daily Microfoliant love this product, clearer pores and improved texture after one use, highly recommend the entire product line!</li>
            <li>and I have very sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li>I normally use more gritty product to exfoliate, and of course my face is always red and inflamed looking afterward.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and you don&#x27;t have to use much, so a container lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for all ages and skin types.</li>
            <li>that are basically like using a high school chemistry class on your face.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this as an exfoliant for anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for oily skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for any type of skin.</li>
            <li>If you have the money by all means go for it, but if your like me and have to be a little creative sometimes give it a shot.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s made any dramatic improvement on my skin, but it&#x27;s a nice exfoliator that seems to be pretty gentle.</li>
            <li>This gentle exfoliant has been a treasure for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It works well and is gentle on sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I love to use it everyday in the morning.</li>
            <li>Well, I have used it everyday for about a week, and it is fabulous!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely pricey, but completely worth it.</li>
            <li>this entire line is worth the price.</li>
            <li>but after a few weeks, my skin was clearer, smoother, and more  \\&quot;glowy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Keeps your skin soft and blemish free, also goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Since I am battling severe dryness in the winter months, this product does the trick , taking dead skin off without over drying the healthy skin.</li>
            <li>I love this exfoliating powder that turns into a paste when you add a few drops of water.</li>
            <li>The Esthi also suggested leaving it on like a mask for 5-8 minutes, once a month, and it does a more thorough breakdown of dead cells.</li>
            <li>have been using this gentle exfoliant in the mornings for several weeks now and my skin feels clean but not dry.</li>
            <li>It is effective, but gentle enough to use daily, even with my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>the little microbeads (made from rice) really clean a days worth of makeup off completely without stripping/drying.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and you only need a tiny bit.</li>
            <li>It gives you just the right amount of daily exfoliation without drying out your skin.</li>
            <li>Very effective and long lasting - you only need a small amount to clean your face.</li>
            <li>Some products leave the area around the nose a little red, but not this one; nice result.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this product doesn&#x27;t agitate it.&lt;br /&gt;Costly for sure, but the bottle I have seems to last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I contacted the seller they assured me it was new, but did not offer to exchange it for a sealed product.  </li>
            <li>This winter has been mild, yet still the face on my skin got so dry.  </li>
            <li>I feel that the gently microfoliant really improves my face to reveal younger and less-acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is such an interesting product; it&#x27;s a powder that turns to a paste in your wet hands.</li>
            <li>I wash my face daily with the Dermalogica cleanser and then use a small amount of microfoliant mixed with a little water to make my face fresh, clean and bright.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any strange smells, I can use it often and my face is left feeling clean and certainly smoother.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle and turns into a paste that doesn&#x27;t feel gritty yet</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s definitely gentle enough to use every day, although I prefer every other day just to preserve product (that bottle isn&#x27;t full to the brim)!</li>
            <li>Not sure if this product is authentic.</li>
            <li>and the clumps don&#x27;t dispense through the small hole in the top of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I recently brought this after trying so many other scrubs, and could not believe my face after one use.</li>
            <li>It might be a bit pricey compared to other products, but I am sure it will last awhile.</li>
            <li>Is it exactly the same as Dermalogica?</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t strip like other exfoliating products which only makes you produce more oil.</li>
            <li>Yes, it is pricey but it lasts for a long time and it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>but so ususally I wash my face first with the Foaming Gel, then pair it with the Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant... and WOW!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve suffered with acne prone and sensitive ALL my life!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One minor item, not even worth taking off a star, bcs</li>
            <li>I first learned about this product during a facial.</li>
            <li>It leaves skin feeling soft and looking refreshed!</li>
            <li>-  be sure to not get water near the opening, especially if you are opening the bottle while wet in the shower.  </li>
            <li>and I can never get a full use out of the bottle no matter how careful I am to avoid any excess water getting to it.</li>
            <li>Very gentle on sensitive skin so it can be daily without drying or redness issues.  </li>
            <li>Also i saved almost half buying it on amazon.. cant beat that!! :)</li>
            <li>To me this is an essential item for my daily beauty regime, which to be honest is very minimal.</li>
            <li>I have Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant in the past, and have always been thrilled with the product.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It was in a sealed box and the sticker and the print matched exactly, but the powder wasn&#x27;t as gritty as the one purchased directly from Dermalogica.</li>
            <li>but this is the only one that I can use every day, that doesn&#x27;t cause micro tears, that is super gentle and REALLY removes the dead flakes that you would normally have.  </li>
            <li>This product will over exfoliate quickly so if you have sensitive skin be careful.  </li>
            <li>Not only is my skin brighter and more even toned, I&#x27;ve noticed I haven&#x27;t had one zit for a week and a half now (which for me is a miracle).</li>
            <li>No fuss and no mess!  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;deep clean&amp;#34; feeling and to fight away flaky skin, especially the flaky skin I see after using certain acne fighting products.</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling very smooth and firm, which it&#x27;d never felt like that.</li>
            <li>You just pour a little bit onto your palm and gently smooth it on your face.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle, but you may ecperimce some redness the first few days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 42 and have had a clear forehead all my life.</li>
            <li>It helps keep my problem skin clear of blemishes.</li>
            <li>As soon as I opened the box I realized that the bottle had clearly been opened and used before.  </li>
            <li>Skin: African-American, Combination, Sensitive, Eczema, allergic to Benzyl Peroxide and prone to hyper-pigmentation.</li>
            <li>I have combination sensitive skin</li>
            <li>So has my 29 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and dewy, and seemed to reduce my whiteheads.  </li>
            <li>My face felt soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>This is a DAILY and GENTLE exfoliant.  </li>
            <li>It really does what it says I would definitely recommend it</li>
            <li>I am a sensitive person, to the point where even my skin is sensitive.  </li>
            <li>My makeup never dried, flaked, or cracked at all.  </li>
            <li>It cost me as much as I paid for both products to ship each one individually.</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>After use my skin felt incredibly soft, like a baby.</li>
            <li>My skin is so clear and soft, I almost cannot believe it.</li>
            <li>However, I developed contact dermatitis in the skin around both of my eyes.</li>
            <li>Iam 20 years old and recommend this to anyone with oily acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>Even my old acne spots are despairing.</li>
            <li>As someone who deals with adult acne (without prescription medication), I found that this product works wonders on my skin.</li>
            <li>Microfoliant is a rice based cleanser which doesn&#x27;t stripe your skin natural oils.</li>
            <li>I also mix it with my DHC oil cleanser occasionally and that works very well too.  </li>
            <li>Gentle enough to use every day, and makes my skin noticeably brighter and smoother.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit I prefer to use a product directly out of the packaging.</li>
            <li>and when i got home i was so surprised on how well it worked.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 58years old &amp;</li>
            <li>I Recommend this product I Have Sensitive Skin</li>
            <li>I suffer from chronic ingrown hairs on my bikini area because I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I came very close to trying to send it back, but the seller&#x27;s return policy seemed cumbersome</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough for that, and it&#x27;s also quite effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough to use every day.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t use it daily then you won&#x27;t notice much of a difference.</li>
            <li>product so far has lasted well</li>
            <li>will now be using this nearly every day as part of my skin regime.</li>
            <li>Your skin feels soft and refreshed after using.</li>
            <li>Gentle enough for every day use.  </li>
            <li>Scrubs without over drying your skin and makes skin feels soft.</li>
            <li>I am 45 years old with oily skin.</li>
            <li>This product completely met my expectations.</li>
            <li>This product contains several highly allergenic ingredients!  </li>
            <li>As soon as I rinsed it off and saw and felt my skin, I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>It evens the skin tone and leave the face feeling soft.</li>
            <li>The product is made to smooth skin, clear dead cells, and remove any buildup and debris on the face.</li>
            <li>When you use your wet hands to make the paste, it feels slightly gritty, but as you massage it with wet fingertips, it forms a nice foam.  </li>
            <li>When I wasn&#x27;t using it everyday, a container would last a year or more.</li>
            <li>I was apprehensive of salicylic acid in it at first due to past adverse reactions, but somehow my skin was able to handle it.</li>
            <li>Now that my skin is in much better condition, I only use this product every other day, in part to make my sample last longer, and in part because I do not want to over exfoliate my skin and cause</li>
            <li>I have now ordered more of the Dermalogica line and am anxious to try them out!</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t &#x27;yet&#x27;, but it does make my face feel very clean after use and perhaps with daily use in a few weeks I might see a change.  </li>
            <li>Read rave reviews about this daily scrub and was excited to try but have not really seen any improvements or benefits on my skin.</li>
            <li>I really like this facial scrub -very fine powder instead of harsh sandblasting that other scrubs provide.</li>
            <li>The particles seem to clean the pores and exfoliate the dead, skin, and oil.  </li>
            <li>I ordered over Amazon for the better price, but the product seems different from my past purchases.</li>
            <li>My first thought was that it wasn&#x27;t gritty enough</li>
            <li>A month later, you&#x27;d realise that pores are generally smaller (or invisible unless viewed under strong light and magnifying glass) and blackheads/pimples or uneven pigmentation are essentially much less than a month ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel smooth and soft, providing a nice even base (after moisturizer) for applying makeup.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to someone who is trying to get that youthful glow back and also get rid of a few fine lines along the way.</li>
            <li>I discovered it a couple of years ago, but did not start using it daily until last year, when I got smart and started getting it from Amazon instead of trying to find a salon that carried it.  </li>
            <li>This is such a reliable exfoliant, I can&#x27;t live with out it.</li>
            <li>I live in the desert, and that keeps my skin on the drier side, especially in winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System 0.68 Fl Oz, 1-Count]]] and my skin is crazy smooth.  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely cannot and will not live without it.</li>
            <li>The discounted cost on Amazon is irresistible but if it runs out here, I will go back to my local shop and pay the higher price if necessary.</li>
            <li>Is the bottle only supposed to be half full with product???</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s red and dry but only on the right side of my face.</li>
            <li>I normally purchase Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant however, this particular order the granules did not dissolve well and the &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; were rough on my face.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as a general exploration of DM products and must say it&#x27;s one of the products I will keep buying again and again.</li>
            <li>My skin feels extra soft and supple after use.  </li>
            <li>Before I was using cleansers such as Lush&#x27;s Ocean Salt</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a male, have combination, olive tone skin that isn&#x27;t sensitive or acne prone.  </li>
            <li>I suggested it to a friend who has porcelain (aka very white) and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It can be used daily as the title suggests without fear of stripping the oil and natural moisture from the skin.</li>
            <li>My skin always feels like I just had a professional facial.  </li>
            <li>not rough-</li>
            <li>and I immediately noticed, after putting on my regular old moisturizer, that my skin was way softer and mega-dewy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant for years now but have always purchased directly from Dermalogica.</li>
            <li>I have had my bottle for over a year, and still have no regrets with my purchase.</li>
            <li>These tiny rice grains of rice gently scrub off dead skin and does so in a gentle way.  </li>
            <li>She uses it daily, and so far has not had any skin problems.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist&#x27;s assistant used this on my sensitive skin several years ago, and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since.</li>
            <li>It was baby soft and glowing with not a red, irritated spot in sight.  </li>
            <li>Stopped using this product for a few months and didn&#x27;t realize how fresh it makes my face look and feel after I restarted.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;d be a bit expensive for me to purchase in stores, but I have always found it on Amazon and saved a nice chunk of money.</li>
            <li>Messy, right?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s odd at first....</li>
            <li>I use it pretty much every day and it has really helped with my troubled forehead areas.</li>
            <li>You only need a small amount and after cleansing, my face feels soft and fresh.  </li>
            <li>The synergy of active ingredients really works to dissolve excess surface cells.</li>
            <li>This is a little pricier than I&#x27;d normally pay for a product, but I&#x27;ve been having such great results, and my sample container has lasted for at least two weeks already (so a little goes a long way), that I&#x27;m probably going to be picking this up again soon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a harsh scrub which makes it gentle enough for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Its gentle enough to use daily, although i use it every other day.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, oily, dry, pain-in-the-butt skin.</li>
            <li>I have very noticeable pores and have always had issues with black heads on my nose.  </li>
            <li>Having acne-prone combination oily skin, I was still slightly breaking out and my acne scars weren&#x27;t fading very well.</li>
            <li>A container lasts about 10 months if you use it once a day and the quality of my skin is so improved, they could charge half again as much</li>
            <li>The main active ingredients being Rice-based enzymes, papain and Salicylic Acid.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey but totally worth the investment, plus, a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and my face is smooth and balanced, not dry or tight.</li>
            <li>I have very dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Course powder added to a little water in your palm mixes into a &#x27;paste&#x27; and gently exfoliates your skin.  </li>
            <li>Long story short, I end up spending, just like everyone else, $10 here, $10 there, $10 $10 $10 $10 $10 every month trying out new products from walgreens or cvs that NEVER WORK and give me the same results -- dry skin and redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin feeling soft but does not dry out the skin like other exfoliants.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be messy or hard to use as a cleanser.  </li>

            <li> This is also an amazing exfoliant that you can feel working as it cleans your skin of impurities.  </li>
            <li> Let me tell all of you something, not proactive..and nothing you buy from the store compares to this amazing product..</li>

            <li> and I am already blown away with its performance and very premature yet impressive results.</li>
            <li> It softens the skin nicely.</li>
            <li> The real one is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Product is excellent because it really works the way it is described.  </li>
            <li> The apricot scrub felt like it was doing more harm than good.</li>
            <li> I then immediately purchased my own.</li>
            <li> Well worth your money for a gorgeous smooth face!!!</li>
            <li> A fresh alternative to soap, and lotion cleansers!!!  </li>

            <li> it works beautifully with the right cleanser and depends on your skin type.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for travelling and a quick skin pick me up without being too abrasive on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li> Love this stuff so much, dermalogica products are the best!</li>

            <li> Also it&#x27;s nice to be able to add water to customize the consistency of the cleanser from more liquid to paste-like.  </li>
            <li> HOwever, the product has worked its best when I use a broad spectrum UVA/UVB SPF.</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to buy it at first based on the price, but quickly learned this is actually an excellent deal.  </li>
            <li> Everyone had such good things to say, and I&#x27;m happy to add my own praise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just wetting face and hands, shaking a bit onto palm and massaging in without adding any water to my palms allows the crystals to massage better before they dissolve.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to find this on amazon.</li>

            <li> It is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought myself a bottle pricy, but worth it.  </li>
            <li> I started using Dermalogica Daily Mircrofoliant years ago and liked it.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin glow even though it&#x27;s 51 years old :)</li>
            <li> My skin has a glow and is always fresh looking.</li>

            <li> so it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll DEF see full results in 8 wks ;)</li>

            <li> but this is SO WORTH IT.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes it is better to purchase direct from the manufacturer.</li>

            <li> , it&#x27;s great that the general public can now purchase it on their own rather than going to a spa.&lt;br /&gt;**A key note that they don&#x27;t tell you (since it&#x27;s meant to be a Professionally-bought product where the practitioner already has been trained in it)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product, makes my skin really clean like after a facial.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews about this product, and was excited to buy since I really like Dermalogica products, but....</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and can&#x27;t really tolerate most acne or skin products.</li>
            <li> The lot number at the bottom of the bottle was in a larger font and the product printing label rubbed off very easily.  </li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive skin which irritates easily</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a fantastic product that works well for me, and I would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a fantastic product that works well for me, and I would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I have used so many different skin care products from low end to high end items but the Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant is the best exfoliant I have used!</li>
            <li> Great gentle scrub you can use daily with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> , my acne scars will have faded completely, however I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased and will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> This brand is amazing and have used it for so long.</li>
            <li> Actually, I noy a result from the very first use but over time it just gets better.  </li>
            <li> I have acne occasionally and my face is smooth and healthy looking after every use, I&#x27;m expecting better results for a long term use.</li>
            <li> It exfoliates/cleanses my skin very well but doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling super tight/dry.</li>
            <li> Nice and gentle on the face, can be used daily.</li>
            <li> This product is gentle but effective at the same time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a great exfoliant, not too big</li>
            <li> You can feel the scrubbing particles at first, but the large pieces dissolve quickly</li>
            <li> Something like this should provide more effective results that can be seen and felt AFTER initial use (long term results).</li>
            <li> Harsh soaps can really do a number on my skin, heck even many powdered laundry detergents irritate my skin (not a problem with my homemade detergent however!!)</li>
            <li> The powder is very fine - not at all harsh or granular like most exfoliants, but it does the job very well.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t use it daily, maybe 4 or 5 times weekly, it produces a more satisfying result than anything else I have used, always leaving my face looking better, and  without the overly dried feeling that some exfoliants produce.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on my combination skin.  </li>
            <li> This is a VERY gentle exfoliant for your skin.</li>
            <li> My skin feels clean and new after each use.</li>
            <li> When it arrived, I was ecstatic to use it for the first time til I ended up pouring a bunch of sand like substance into my hand..</li>
            <li> You will notice a difference the first time and EVERY time you use it.  </li>
            <li> I have enjoyed daily microfoliant for years.</li>
            <li> It has been eight days since I began using this product (combined with the overnight clearing gel and clearing mattifer) and it was only when I snapped a picture today that I realsied how smooth my face looked!</li>
            <li> The first day I used it, I felt that my face was smoother but there was still acne and their associated marks.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, the finer exfoliant works better than larger exfoliating granules like apricot scrubs.  </li>
            <li> For a higher cost cleanser (compared to drug store products) .  </li>
            <li> I could feel the difference in the texture of my skin the first time i used it.</li>
            <li> I think It&#x27;s making a difference in my overall appearance, but time will tell for sure.</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying dermalogica products from amazon.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt smooth, soft, and energized.  </li>
            <li> higher in price</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite facial cleansers that I&#x27;ll use throughout the year.</li>
            <li> The texture threw me off at first.</li>
            <li> This was my first Dermalogica purchase</li>
            <li> If you are worried about the price, try the travel size first.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin smooth and soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li> I keep an air-tight container of it in the shower, put it on first, do my thing, and manipulate it here &amp; there while showering.  </li>
            <li> *  ; )</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does keep your skin looking fresh as it gently exfoliates, and my skin texture and tone has improved.</li>
            <li> Noticeable difference after the first try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly gritty and doesn&#x27;t foam up like most products, but once you get used to that, I think you&#x27;ll like it</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve finally found my favorite exfoliant.</li>
            <li> The combo of chemical and mechanical exfoliants leave my skin baby soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> (just make sure you keep the bottle outside the shower or it cakes up around the holes.)</li>
            <li> Also make sure you rinse your face well or you will have white stuff on it.</li>
            <li> It works great and it last a long time.</li>
            <li> I love Dermalogica products especially the cleansers.  </li>
            <li> this is one of my favorite products to use daily in addition to face wash.</li>
            <li> and this is a great back up when my face have minor breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I use dermalogica Daily Microfoliant every day and love the silky smooth feel of my 58 year old skin.</li>
            <li> I love Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> shipping was appreciated!</li>
            <li> Dont be put off by it being in powder form.. its simple to use and safe on your skin.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I have used many different products because my skin is acne prone.  </li>
            <li> I have smooth, soft skin after using it.</li>
            <li> my skin was just not as soft and smooth as before.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel so soft and smooth...</li>
            <li> When I was using this weekly, on the day I used it, people always commented on how pretty my skin looked.</li>
            <li> You have to be consistent with it.</li>
            <li> This was my first Dermalogica purchase, and it sold me on the brand.</li>
            <li> Love Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years, MUCH cheaper than the spa!  </li>
            <li> Saves you from using extra cream and makes your skin look healthy.</li>
            <li> I first tried this when it came in a Birchbox.</li>
            <li> Every time I use this exfoliant my skin feels soft and smooth when I am done.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It rinses off well and my skin feels soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product from a spa first, and instantly fell in love with it -</li>
            <li> From now on I&#x27;ll be buying the real deal!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle, yet powerful.  </li>
            <li> I recieved the microfoliant quickly and highly recommend this seller..</li>
            <li> It is often plagued by blackheads and pimples, but dry spots crop up too, and I have issues finding something that is gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> It is very rare that a product actually works and this one certainly surpasses expectations!!</li>
            <li> This paired with the dermalogica special cleaning gel makes your face feel so soft!</li>
            <li> I have rosacea...not the redness but the pustule/papular kind and have to be very careful with my skin.  </li>
            <li> After using it my skin looks so clean and feels amazingly soft.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so clean and soft.</li>
            <li> My skin feels clean after and soft.</li>
            <li> Mild enough for everyday use and my skin looks great -</li>
            <li> My face feels soft &amp; clean after using it.</li>
            <li> But my overall rating is good, because I definitely plan to keep buying this.</li>
            <li> this works great to clear the dead skin &amp; soften skin before I moisturize.</li>
            <li> First of all, I have been using this product for a long time and used to love it.  </li>
            <li> The little beads/particles do kind of dissolve/get foamy, and it takes a bit of practice to determine the right amount.  </li>
            <li> I mean it in the best possible way!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Vendor service was straightforward and quick; no issues with the purchase, and the delivery was in simple but sufficiently protective packaging - and it was fast.  </li>
            <li> first thing I noticed was that it does not take much of this product.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference at first</li>
            <li> I love how it dissipates slowly the more you scrub &amp; use it so as to not cause too much microdermabrasion.</li>
            <li> : Be sure to collect enough foliant powder into your palm, just enough to create a thin &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; to get best results.</li>
            <li> Easy on the skin, can be used as a daily exfoliant.</li>
            <li> Comes in a powdery form &amp; is simple &amp; easy to use.  </li>
            <li> only use the microfoliant about twice a week, but it keeps my skin feeling clean, soft, and smooth.</li>
            <li> I use in conjunction with the Dermal Clay Cleanser and the Age Smart Resurfacing Cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Came on time, Exactly what i have expected from the product, and a realy good price, with short supply time.</li>
            <li> Hands down my most favorite facial product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great texture without being too harsh and would be easy to use everyday although I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I thought this one was pretty unique, it&#x27;s actually a powder that you put on your hands and then add water to it and apply to the face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get a good consistency with the water and powder.</li>
            <li> Since it comes in powder form and you have to mix it with water, it is hard to get a good consistency.  </li>
            <li> It exfoliates very nicely (not rough), cleanses very well, washes away easily and leaves a very soft feel to my skin.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product, just a little mixed with water and then rub it on your face and it does a great job.  </li>
            <li> this product is SO WORTH the $30 because in the long run I end up spending hundreds of dollars a year trying to find the right face wash anyway!</li>
            <li> Plus, it is in powder form, so you are more conscious of how much you use -- and since it is so effective, you only need to use a little bit each time, so</li>
            <li> I had been a huge fan of Glotherapeutics pumpkin scrub, but my facialist was out last time I went.</li>
            <li> As you massage it in, you feel the grit gently working on your skin, until  the product finally turns smooth.</li>
            <li> Gentle enuf to use every day which I do....</li>
            <li> one I continue to use as I really feels it helps exfoliate gently.</li>
            <li> So I really like the results of the Microfoliant on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Regardless, I&#x27;ve bought 3 of these because I like it that much.  </li>
            <li> Really cleans you skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on the skin yet it has exfoliating property.</li>
            <li> , so I really have to pay attention to how products affect my face.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin which is prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li> I really like Dermalogica products.  </li>
            <li> This and the clearing gel have helped so much fade out spots (no acne to cause them).</li>
            <li> This product feels like a gently abrasive yet calming oatmeal exfoliant designed for your face.</li>
            <li> If you buy anything of dermalogica, you must absolutely have this in your mix.  </li>
            <li> Gentle.</li>
            <li> You do not need to really rub it</li>
            <li> a gentle massage with do.</li>
            <li> It is gentle on my skin</li>
            <li> I really like the product.</li>
            <li> this does the job of exfoliation in gentle way.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from an Ulta store and found that Amazon&#x27;s price is much lower.</li>
            <li> I have yet to feel that I can overuse or over-scrub my face, all the ingredients are extremely gentle.</li>
            <li> It is especially great a few days after a peel when the dead skin is ready to come off and it just rolls it away.</li>
            <li> if you use it correctly .It helps minimize shine and really exfoliates gently.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and have used it for years.  </li>
            <li> and it really helped.</li>
            <li> This product is so gentle, you could use it every day.</li>
            <li> I just gently rub it around on my face in a circular motion, then rinse.  </li>
            <li> and I am really seeing some fast results in terms of skin</li>
            <li> Fast and efficient delivery.</li>
            <li> very smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It lost one point because it leaves my skin very shiny afterwards.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed a real difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> If you miss a spot you will notice it very soon...  </li>
            <li> He really likes the the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s something I like to have around that much.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American and most products out there for skin and hair are harsh, so when an esthetician suggested it, I tried it and loved the results.</li>
            <li> that makes you think there is a lot more, but it&#x27;s empty.</li>
            <li> Using it before shaving gives you a really clean/close shave.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I dont feel that this really works for me.</li>
            <li> I really like the cheaper price on Amazon, but I will order from the Dermalogica website from now on.  </li>
            <li> Light not harsh on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive skin and this product is very gentle.</li>
            <li> There are so many other products at our local drug store that carry a much more sensitive line.</li>
            <li> My husband, son and myself used it and loved it so much that we give each other facial...</li>
            <li> Always looking for a better deal, I bought my second bottle from amazon - the product I received from Amazon turns into more of a gritty paste when I use it, and it just plain doesn&#x27;t make my face feel clean.  </li>
            <li> I like the whole product line, but don&#x27;t use too many products due to the cost.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> This product is able to carefully remove the accumulation of dead cells on ones skin and reveals the new bright and clear skin ready to absorb the cream of your choice.</li>
            <li> and it works into a nice thick paste which  leaves your skin feeling clean but not tight at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally like powder style scrubs, my aversion came from using &#x27;Japanese Washing Grains&#x27; by The Body Shop when I was a teenager, but this product gives you a fine scrub that leaves your skin</li>
            <li> I can get the same clean feeling from a $5 Queen Helene or Garnier scrub.</li>
            <li> If I scrub too hard, I have a red face for hours, so I have to be gentle, and with this product, I end up with a nice, smooth face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very fine grain powder and you only need a tiny bit (I use about the size of a dime on my face).</li>
            <li> It really does make your skin smoother and glowing and yet mild enough to use every day.</li>
            <li> I really had high hopes for this, but I&#x27;ve had it since last fall and still have a full bottle.</li>
            <li> It is gentle, thorough, and it takes very little product to get great results, so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can see the full ingredients list in one of the product images (zoom in to read the tiny print).  </li>
            <li> I am usually the chick who HATES putting down more than $10 for any kind of face wash/cosmetic products...</li>
            <li> little micro balls are actually balls unlike other products, making it awesome for your pores..</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t live without this product!  </li>
            <li> I have pretty normal skin, I have pretty rare breakouts every few months, but they clear up quickly.</li>
            <li> I have huge pores on my nose that are always clogged and some of them have completely disappeared since starting to use this one week ago and the rest are about 1/2 the size they were and are not so visibly clogged!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dry powder and mixes water well to make light paste.  </li>
            <li> Will not purchase from this particular vendor again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I don&#x27;t use it daily, I enjoy the soft, silky skin on my face and glow it leaves.</li>
            <li> This item shipped quickly but the box was not sealed and item was open.  </li>
            <li> but I realize that this is what makes it such a mild product.</li>
            <li> have been purchasing this product from a local beauty supply for 20% more for the last 4 years.</li>
            <li> Dermologica Daily Microfoliant love this product, clearer pores and improved texture after one use, highly recommend the entire product line!</li>
            <li> and I have very sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li> I normally use more gritty product to exfoliate, and of course my face is always red and inflamed looking afterward.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and you don&#x27;t have to use much, so a container lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for all ages and skin types.</li>
            <li> that are basically like using a high school chemistry class on your face.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this as an exfoliant for anyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for oily skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for any type of skin.</li>
            <li> If you have the money by all means go for it, but if your like me and have to be a little creative sometimes give it a shot.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s made any dramatic improvement on my skin, but it&#x27;s a nice exfoliator that seems to be pretty gentle.</li>
            <li> This gentle exfoliant has been a treasure for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It works well and is gentle on sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I love to use it everyday in the morning.</li>
            <li> Well, I have used it everyday for about a week, and it is fabulous!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely pricey, but completely worth it.</li>
            <li> this entire line is worth the price.</li>
            <li> but after a few weeks, my skin was clearer, smoother, and more  \\&quot;glowy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Keeps your skin soft and blemish free, also goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Since I am battling severe dryness in the winter months, this product does the trick , taking dead skin off without over drying the healthy skin.</li>
            <li> I love this exfoliating powder that turns into a paste when you add a few drops of water.</li>
            <li> The Esthi also suggested leaving it on like a mask for 5-8 minutes, once a month, and it does a more thorough breakdown of dead cells.</li>
            <li> have been using this gentle exfoliant in the mornings for several weeks now and my skin feels clean but not dry.</li>
            <li> It is effective, but gentle enough to use daily, even with my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> the little microbeads (made from rice) really clean a days worth of makeup off completely without stripping/drying.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and you only need a tiny bit.</li>
            <li> It gives you just the right amount of daily exfoliation without drying out your skin.</li>
            <li> Very effective and long lasting - you only need a small amount to clean your face.</li>
            <li> Some products leave the area around the nose a little red, but not this one; nice result.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this product doesn&#x27;t agitate it.&lt;br /&gt;Costly for sure, but the bottle I have seems to last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I contacted the seller they assured me it was new, but did not offer to exchange it for a sealed product.  </li>
            <li> This winter has been mild, yet still the face on my skin got so dry.  </li>
            <li> I feel that the gently microfoliant really improves my face to reveal younger and less-acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is such an interesting product; it&#x27;s a powder that turns to a paste in your wet hands.</li>
            <li> I wash my face daily with the Dermalogica cleanser and then use a small amount of microfoliant mixed with a little water to make my face fresh, clean and bright.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any strange smells, I can use it often and my face is left feeling clean and certainly smoother.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle and turns into a paste that doesn&#x27;t feel gritty yet</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s definitely gentle enough to use every day, although I prefer every other day just to preserve product (that bottle isn&#x27;t full to the brim)!</li>
            <li> Not sure if this product is authentic.</li>
            <li> and the clumps don&#x27;t dispense through the small hole in the top of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I recently brought this after trying so many other scrubs, and could not believe my face after one use.</li>
            <li> It might be a bit pricey compared to other products, but I am sure it will last awhile.</li>
            <li> Is it exactly the same as Dermalogica?</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t strip like other exfoliating products which only makes you produce more oil.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is pricey but it lasts for a long time and it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> but so ususally I wash my face first with the Foaming Gel, then pair it with the Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant... and WOW!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered with acne prone and sensitive ALL my life!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One minor item, not even worth taking off a star, bcs</li>
            <li> I first learned about this product during a facial.</li>
            <li> It leaves skin feeling soft and looking refreshed!</li>
            <li> -  be sure to not get water near the opening, especially if you are opening the bottle while wet in the shower.  </li>
            <li> and I can never get a full use out of the bottle no matter how careful I am to avoid any excess water getting to it.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on sensitive skin so it can be daily without drying or redness issues.  </li>
            <li> Also i saved almost half buying it on amazon.. cant beat that!! :)</li>
            <li> To me this is an essential item for my daily beauty regime, which to be honest is very minimal.</li>
            <li> I have Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant in the past, and have always been thrilled with the product.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It was in a sealed box and the sticker and the print matched exactly, but the powder wasn&#x27;t as gritty as the one purchased directly from Dermalogica.</li>
            <li> but this is the only one that I can use every day, that doesn&#x27;t cause micro tears, that is super gentle and REALLY removes the dead flakes that you would normally have.  </li>
            <li> This product will over exfoliate quickly so if you have sensitive skin be careful.  </li>
            <li> Not only is my skin brighter and more even toned, I&#x27;ve noticed I haven&#x27;t had one zit for a week and a half now (which for me is a miracle).</li>
            <li> No fuss and no mess!  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;deep clean&amp;#34; feeling and to fight away flaky skin, especially the flaky skin I see after using certain acne fighting products.</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling very smooth and firm, which it&#x27;d never felt like that.</li>
            <li> You just pour a little bit onto your palm and gently smooth it on your face.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle, but you may ecperimce some redness the first few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 42 and have had a clear forehead all my life.</li>
            <li> It helps keep my problem skin clear of blemishes.</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened the box I realized that the bottle had clearly been opened and used before.  </li>
            <li> Skin: African-American, Combination, Sensitive, Eczema, allergic to Benzyl Peroxide and prone to hyper-pigmentation.</li>
            <li> I have combination sensitive skin</li>
            <li> So has my 29 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and dewy, and seemed to reduce my whiteheads.  </li>
            <li> My face felt soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> This is a DAILY and GENTLE exfoliant.  </li>
            <li> It really does what it says I would definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> I am a sensitive person, to the point where even my skin is sensitive.  </li>
            <li> My makeup never dried, flaked, or cracked at all.  </li>
            <li> It cost me as much as I paid for both products to ship each one individually.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> After use my skin felt incredibly soft, like a baby.</li>
            <li> My skin is so clear and soft, I almost cannot believe it.</li>
            <li> However, I developed contact dermatitis in the skin around both of my eyes.</li>
            <li> Iam 20 years old and recommend this to anyone with oily acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Even my old acne spots are despairing.</li>
            <li> As someone who deals with adult acne (without prescription medication), I found that this product works wonders on my skin.</li>
            <li> Microfoliant is a rice based cleanser which doesn&#x27;t stripe your skin natural oils.</li>
            <li> I also mix it with my DHC oil cleanser occasionally and that works very well too.  </li>
            <li> Gentle enough to use every day, and makes my skin noticeably brighter and smoother.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit I prefer to use a product directly out of the packaging.</li>
            <li> and when i got home i was so surprised on how well it worked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 58years old &amp;</li>
            <li> I Recommend this product I Have Sensitive Skin</li>
            <li> I suffer from chronic ingrown hairs on my bikini area because I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I came very close to trying to send it back, but the seller&#x27;s return policy seemed cumbersome</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough for that, and it&#x27;s also quite effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough to use every day.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use it daily then you won&#x27;t notice much of a difference.</li>
            <li> product so far has lasted well</li>
            <li> will now be using this nearly every day as part of my skin regime.</li>
            <li> Your skin feels soft and refreshed after using.</li>
            <li> Gentle enough for every day use.  </li>
            <li> Scrubs without over drying your skin and makes skin feels soft.</li>
            <li> I am 45 years old with oily skin.</li>
            <li> This product completely met my expectations.</li>
            <li> This product contains several highly allergenic ingredients!  </li>
            <li> As soon as I rinsed it off and saw and felt my skin, I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> It evens the skin tone and leave the face feeling soft.</li>
            <li> The product is made to smooth skin, clear dead cells, and remove any buildup and debris on the face.</li>
            <li> When you use your wet hands to make the paste, it feels slightly gritty, but as you massage it with wet fingertips, it forms a nice foam.  </li>
            <li> When I wasn&#x27;t using it everyday, a container would last a year or more.</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive of salicylic acid in it at first due to past adverse reactions, but somehow my skin was able to handle it.</li>
            <li> Now that my skin is in much better condition, I only use this product every other day, in part to make my sample last longer, and in part because I do not want to over exfoliate my skin and cause</li>
            <li> I have now ordered more of the Dermalogica line and am anxious to try them out!</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t &#x27;yet&#x27;, but it does make my face feel very clean after use and perhaps with daily use in a few weeks I might see a change.  </li>
            <li> Read rave reviews about this daily scrub and was excited to try but have not really seen any improvements or benefits on my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this facial scrub -very fine powder instead of harsh sandblasting that other scrubs provide.</li>
            <li> The particles seem to clean the pores and exfoliate the dead, skin, and oil.  </li>
            <li> I ordered over Amazon for the better price, but the product seems different from my past purchases.</li>
            <li> My first thought was that it wasn&#x27;t gritty enough</li>
            <li> A month later, you&#x27;d realise that pores are generally smaller (or invisible unless viewed under strong light and magnifying glass) and blackheads/pimples or uneven pigmentation are essentially much less than a month ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel smooth and soft, providing a nice even base (after moisturizer) for applying makeup.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to someone who is trying to get that youthful glow back and also get rid of a few fine lines along the way.</li>
            <li> I discovered it a couple of years ago, but did not start using it daily until last year, when I got smart and started getting it from Amazon instead of trying to find a salon that carried it.  </li>
            <li> This is such a reliable exfoliant, I can&#x27;t live with out it.</li>
            <li> I live in the desert, and that keeps my skin on the drier side, especially in winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System 0.68 Fl Oz, 1-Count]]] and my skin is crazy smooth.  </li>
            <li> and I absolutely cannot and will not live without it.</li>
            <li> The discounted cost on Amazon is irresistible but if it runs out here, I will go back to my local shop and pay the higher price if necessary.</li>
            <li> Is the bottle only supposed to be half full with product???</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s red and dry but only on the right side of my face.</li>
            <li> I normally purchase Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant however, this particular order the granules did not dissolve well and the &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; were rough on my face.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as a general exploration of DM products and must say it&#x27;s one of the products I will keep buying again and again.</li>
            <li> My skin feels extra soft and supple after use.  </li>
            <li> Before I was using cleansers such as Lush&#x27;s Ocean Salt</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male, have combination, olive tone skin that isn&#x27;t sensitive or acne prone.  </li>
            <li> I suggested it to a friend who has porcelain (aka very white) and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It can be used daily as the title suggests without fear of stripping the oil and natural moisture from the skin.</li>
            <li> My skin always feels like I just had a professional facial.  </li>
            <li> not rough-</li>
            <li> and I immediately noticed, after putting on my regular old moisturizer, that my skin was way softer and mega-dewy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant for years now but have always purchased directly from Dermalogica.</li>
            <li> I have had my bottle for over a year, and still have no regrets with my purchase.</li>
            <li> These tiny rice grains of rice gently scrub off dead skin and does so in a gentle way.  </li>
            <li> She uses it daily, and so far has not had any skin problems.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist&#x27;s assistant used this on my sensitive skin several years ago, and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since.</li>
            <li> It was baby soft and glowing with not a red, irritated spot in sight.  </li>
            <li> Stopped using this product for a few months and didn&#x27;t realize how fresh it makes my face look and feel after I restarted.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;d be a bit expensive for me to purchase in stores, but I have always found it on Amazon and saved a nice chunk of money.</li>
            <li> Messy, right?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s odd at first....</li>
            <li> I use it pretty much every day and it has really helped with my troubled forehead areas.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount and after cleansing, my face feels soft and fresh.  </li>
            <li> The synergy of active ingredients really works to dissolve excess surface cells.</li>
            <li> This is a little pricier than I&#x27;d normally pay for a product, but I&#x27;ve been having such great results, and my sample container has lasted for at least two weeks already (so a little goes a long way), that I&#x27;m probably going to be picking this up again soon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a harsh scrub which makes it gentle enough for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Its gentle enough to use daily, although i use it every other day.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, oily, dry, pain-in-the-butt skin.</li>
            <li> I have very noticeable pores and have always had issues with black heads on my nose.  </li>
            <li> Having acne-prone combination oily skin, I was still slightly breaking out and my acne scars weren&#x27;t fading very well.</li>
            <li> A container lasts about 10 months if you use it once a day and the quality of my skin is so improved, they could charge half again as much</li>
            <li> The main active ingredients being Rice-based enzymes, papain and Salicylic Acid.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey but totally worth the investment, plus, a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and my face is smooth and balanced, not dry or tight.</li>
            <li> I have very dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Course powder added to a little water in your palm mixes into a &#x27;paste&#x27; and gently exfoliates your skin.  </li>
            <li> Long story short, I end up spending, just like everyone else, $10 here, $10 there, $10 $10 $10 $10 $10 every month trying out new products from walgreens or cvs that NEVER WORK and give me the same results -- dry skin and redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin feeling soft but does not dry out the skin like other exfoliants.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be messy or hard to use as a cleanser.  </li>
            <li> It gets rid of rough patches right away and isn&#x27;t too harsh or drying.</li>
            <li> At first I was worried about drying out my skin, so I only used it every other day for a few uses.</li>
            <li> I have only been recently introduced to this product and now could not live without it.  </li>
            <li> I am 40, with sensitive dry skin (due to starting hormone changes) and rosacea</li>
            <li> The bottle is a generous size and will last a LONG time.  </li>
            <li> After noticing that it wasn&#x27;t irritating my skin, but leaving it smooth and soft, I decided to try using it everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed how long the 2.6 oz. lasts; when used daily and according to directions the product lasts 4 to 5 months in my case.</li>
            <li> Which is no fun, but to slow the process down I started using Dermalogica because of their quality and the results I started seeing immediately, which was a more supple and glowing skin.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product and swear by it but really wish it wasn&#x27;t so gosh darn expensive!!</li>
            <li> I have been using it daily and without issue on my skin, which usually has a high histamine response</li>
            <li> My complaint to users out there is make sure you do not scrub too hard</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even left it on as a spot treatment overnight and woken up with radically diminished (if not completely disappeared!)</li>
            <li> This formula is so unique because unlike scrubs and other exfoliators there are no abrasive ingredients like walnut shell powder or other small granules.</li>
            <li> It is almost inevitable that Winter brings on the dry, flaky, cracked skin.  </li>
            <li> This is a dry powder that you mix with water to form a gritty paste.  </li>
            <li> The only exfoliant that doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin.</li>
            <li> : wet hands only (don&#x27;t cup water), shake some product into your palm, use fingers on opposite hand to mix into paste, and apply with both hands to face &amp; throat.  </li>
            <li> Most products for acne make me break out worse because they are too harsh for my skin.</li>
            <li> I was sent a sample of almost half an ounce, and three weeks later I have barely made a dent in it.  </li>
            <li> Nonetheless, the reason I bought this product is because I have very dry skin that flakes and clogs my pores, and redness around my t-zone and nose area that constantly bother me.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t scrub away hard: just gentle until the beads turn into lather.</li>
            <li> Some reviews complained about mixing with too much water; here&#x27;s my advice</li>
            <li> And it lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> It lasts long too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a gritty rice powder you have to put on your wet face.</li>
            <li> This product contains a long list of ingredients.</li>
            <li> I use it for exfoliating just once a week and have seen results in the texture of my skin and intend to continue using for a long time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The price does seem steep, however, this stuff lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years long before I went on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> A WEEK.. WILL LAST A LONG TIME SINCE NOT MUCH IS NEEDED..</li>
            <li> A 5 oz cream exfoliant might cost you half the price, but it will last a third of the time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product daily for about a year and a half, and I just purchased my 3rd bottle in that time.</li>
            <li> These are super expensive at a regular retail store.</li>
            <li> It is quite different than any other exfoliant I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other exfoliant products but none compare to the Daily Microfoliant by Dermalogica.  </li>
            <li> I look forward to using this line for a long time!</li>
            <li> I am only 20, I don&#x27;t have severe acne, only an occasional breakout here or there, so WHY was I using products that usually say \\&quot;cure break</li>
            <li> The 2.6 oz package will last you for months because you only need to use a little bit every day.</li>
            <li> This product is dry and water is added to apply it.</li>
            <li> however it makes my face too dry.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t dry out my face and also helps with my breakouts.</li>
            <li> I find that this helps to keep my skin dry</li>
            <li> It takes away my flaky, dry patches.</li>
            <li> or you&#x27;ll end up with some dry and pealing patches on your skin.  </li>
            <li> and I still have dry skin on my face.</li>
            <li> and I had just wasted my money, but I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong..  </li>
            <li> I use it at least once a week without issue and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It exfoliates your face very gently, and leaves glowing skin behind.</li>
            <li> At least it costs less than the higher end cleansers.  </li>
            <li> The 2.6 ounces is of pure powder exfoliant, so all you need each time is a small shake onto your palm, that you can wet slightly and massage into your face.  </li>
            <li> I also use the calming serum daily after I use this to keep the sensitizing down.</li>
            <li> You only need a little of the power in your hands , it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I use once a day along with my wash, tone and moisturize regimen and my skin is brighter,my acne scars are slightly lighter and my skin isn&#x27;t red, irritated or peeling.</li>
            <li> After multiple uses, I noticed my skin was clearer, and my pores were less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I started using the dermalogica medibac skin set about 2 and a half weeks ago, and I purchased a travel sized bottle of this shortly after to t.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin and never had a negative reaction to this product.</li>
            <li> Now in my 50&#x27;s I&#x27;ve developed some dark pigmentation on my cheeks (I think from sun damage) and have tried expensive treatments and lighteners without much change.</li>
            <li> the box was ripped open, and I was actually a little concerned that the product itself had been tampered with.</li>
            <li> I no longer get blackheads or little white bumps on my skin.  </li>
            <li> You can sprinkle a little into your daily cleanser and do this all in one step.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so a bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I missed the middle bottom of my neck and the skin was rough and a little scaly.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and it take a long time before this runs out.</li>
            <li> I use this on clients with sensitive skin (including myself); I have never had a client react to this product negatively.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a mini facial everyday.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t have any regrets with anything in this skin care line.</li>
            <li> However, I wish I would have come upon quality cleansing products like this when I was younger because I wasted a ton of money and did a lot of irreversible damage to my skin by using drug store/infomercial products.   </li>
            <li> Then work it into your damp or wet face.  </li>
            <li> not what I expected</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get it wet, or it will clump and ruin it.</li>
            <li> but  my skin became red and irritated after a few days of use.</li>
            <li> It GENTLY exfoliates without scratching or irritating my skin.  </li>
            <li> the products that didn&#x27;t have acne medication still dried out my skin -- and when I looked at the back of the bottle at the ingredients...guess what!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get it too wet before you put it on your face, though, or you&#x27;ll end up wasting some.  </li>
            <li> Anyone who tries it is an immediate convert.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a daily scrub that wasn&#x27;t going to be too harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> It just becomes a paste when its gets wet.</li>
            <li> I would be crushed...</li>
            <li> There is really no fragrance with this product, it&#x27;s nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I expected this price as it is Dermalogica.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t be put off by the price.</li>
            <li> (are there other microfoliants??).    </li>
            <li> I was not aware of this when I bought the product.</li>
            <li> I will never buy any other products except books through Amazon.</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit skeptical because of the fact that the microfoliant is a powder</li>
            <li> I used to do chem peels to deal with hyperpigmented skin due to breakouts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other exfoliants, but they made my face breakout.</li>
            <li> purchase every other month.</li>
            <li> I have been using Dermalogica products for the past ten years since I was 45.</li>
            <li> I have tried other scrubs</li>
            <li> If you are struggling with acne as I am, you will need something to go along with this product as I still notice that breakouts due to my oily skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try their other products as well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use any other brand and</li>
            <li> This exfoliator is to be added with other products or used alone.  </li>
            <li> My skin is cleaner and brighter and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li> Just dump a bit in very wet hands and rub together until it lathers, and apply.</li>
            <li> During the winter I have extremely dry, flaky skin, and I needed a skin care product that would get rid of all the dead skin.</li>
            <li> But with sensitive skin, this can be tricky, and often results in even drier, and now angry red, skin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t however use the Dermalogica product everyday, I feel it would dry my skin.</li>
            <li> am not accusing the seller of doing anything specific, but there is no good reason for removing a tamper proof seal before shipping a product, and many bad reasons.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Sprinkle a little in your wet hand and rub into a paste.  </li>
            <li> As a teenager, I barely suffered from acne but as I crossed into my late 20s, I found that I am experiencing serious shifts in  my skins overall balance and oil production.</li>
            <li> It brightens, exfoliates, and softens my skin and also helps to fade dark spots.</li>
            <li> Does not dry or strip face, just subtly microfoliates.</li>
            <li> This expensive rice powder did absolutely nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li> My only complaint?  </li>
            <li> It buffs off dead skin without harming your face and being too rough.  </li>
            <li> If water gets into it, it will cause the product to stick and develop a thick film over time, essentially ruining the rest of the contents.</li>
            <li> That way, you don&#x27;t lose any product down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> HANDS DOWN.  </li>
            <li> My skin is partly oily and it calmed down the break outs and evened the color.</li>
            <li> Amazon is hands down the cheapest to get all Dermalogica products.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to be one of those reviewers who criticizes the product due to something that is not the product&#x27;s fault!)</li>
            <li> My redness has virtually disappeared, and my t-zone isn&#x27;t showing any flakes like it usually does once I dry off my face after washing</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin that gets dry and flaky, especially in cold weather.  </li>
            <li> First,by smell of purchased product compared to previously purchased microfoliant product.  </li>
            <li> Only problem is, Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant is absurdly expensive.</li>
            <li> (Wish it was less costly though)</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it lasts a long time; at least 3 months.  </li>
            <li> hence the few pimples I get a month tend to leave dark marks for what seems like forever.</li>
            <li> This did not overdry my face, nor ever made it feel tight as if I was over using it.</li>
            <li> For a month after discontinuing this wash, that skin was tight, peeling, BLEEDING, and itchy until I got a prescription to heal it.</li>
            <li> This size usually lasts at least 6 months + for me with usage several times weekly.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not sure how it compares to other microfoliants because I have tried others</li>
            <li> It may be a little pricey, but</li>
            <li> A little of this goes a looong way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lighter and less sloppy than liquid facial soap.</li>
            <li> Add a few drops of water at a time and mix with your finger (thicker/less water if masking, thinner/more water if scrubbing.)</li>
            <li> but I think it was too harsh for my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is firm and glowy  like it was when I was in my twenties.</li>
            <li> Not too harsh.</li>
            <li> This product exfoliates your face and you can use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I use it in the am and in the pm (or after sports during the day) and it hasn&#x27;t irritated or dried my skin ever.</li>
            <li> After a few days I was hooked and ordered it.  </li>
            <li> This is not genuine dermalogica .</li>
            <li> simply cause its everyones beauty secret.</li>
            <li> This was not a genuine Dermalogica product.  </li>
            <li> Not a genuine product and it wasn&#x27;t sealed.</li>
            <li> and I use it a few times a week on my face.</li>
            <li> If you have an uneven skin tone, you will need to use this in combination with another product.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this it looks like its a fake one, Original one has a plastic seal (this one does not) around the bottle and when I tried it on my skin it feels absolutely different than I bought directly from Dermalogica.com.</li>
            <li> This gets the job done without being harsh.</li>
            <li> missing alot</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve sampled quite a few exfoliators and one thing I like about this one</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not at all harsh</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use it everyday.</li>
            <li> It seems to even out the skin tones, it isn&#x27;t harsh and doesn&#x27;t cause redness.  </li>
            <li> is that doesn&#x27;t contain fragrance, or what seems to be a lot of extra and unnecessary extras.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made for everyday use, but I limit it to 3x a week depending on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years now</li>
            <li> I think you can feel that and the green tea in there.</li>
            <li> Costs a bit less than going to the salon where the price is $50!</li>
            <li> Must follow with at least a light-weight moisturizer, as it can leave skin just a bit too squeaky-clean, tight, and slightly dehydrated.  </li>
            <li> Not exactly easy to use, but I do like it.</li>
            <li> I pour a small amount into one hand, add water, a little at a time, then rub the resulting &#x27;paste&#x27; onto my face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit painful to have to mix the product first.</li>
            <li> IT is expensive, but does seem to last a while.</li>
            <li> Its just a bit too messy for my taste!</li>
            <li> This is a staple in my skincare routine and has been for the past 6 years or so.</li>
            <li> DO NOT USE EVERYDAY!</li>
            <li> I use it once a day after washing my face with my usual cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a small one for 7.75 on Amazon from Skin Care Investments here[...]</li>
            <li> not many people know about dermalogica</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to take my word, as in practically every beauty magazine when it comes time to rate beauty products, this one usually comes in #1.</li>
            <li> Combining it with the clay cleanser now, not sure how well they will work together.</li>
            <li> It was nothing like what I have ordered in the past.  </li>
            <li> so won&#x27;t stretch your pores and this size lasts me usually a year.</li>
            <li> Also - based on a past experience with a bottle of this</li>
            <li> There are very few skin products that I can say that about.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I might be the only one thinking this, but i seriously had no idea that this product came in powder form!!</li>
            <li> Difficult to determine when the container is running on empty as it has that little weight thingy in it to keep from clumping.  </li>
            <li> If you feel like you&#x27;re looking a little dull and need something to freshen up your skin try this!</li>
            <li> My complaint is that the powder gets moist when kept in the shower.  </li>
            <li> This stuff has an awkward, grainy texture that you can definitely feel working.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having some problems with my skin lately</li>
            <li> Use it everyday for years!!</li>
            <li> There is a subtle difference.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> seriously.</li>
            <li> Seriously</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been two weeks and seriously</li>
            <li> It was a little weird because this product is in powder form and has to be moistened and then applied.  </li>
            <li> Your expensive cream will do no good to your skin if you are wearing 10 layers of dead cells!</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll never go back to crap brands like st. ives.</li>
            <li> I began using this scrub a couple years ago and am now addicted to it.....</li>
            <li> This stuff cleans out my pores without irritating anything.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels softer, cleaner and smoother - I&#x27;ve never experienced redness or irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with the results.</li>
            <li> and it was expensive.</li>
            <li> But I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical but thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> This is fake product.</li>
            <li> If that sounds weird, don&#x27;t be scared -</li>
            <li> It is just expensive.</li>
            <li> I know it is expensive</li>
            <li> Might seem expensive</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product until I used it at a friend&#x27;s house.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a fake product or Dermalogica</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive up front</li>
            <li> that is not to say that I still didn&#x27;t have a pimple here or there, but fixing your skin after years of failed products and bad make-up will often take a while.  </li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s inconvenient to keep taking the bottle in and out of the shower</li>
            <li> Although, it is crazy expensive!</li>
            <li> I use this every morning without fail!</li>
            <li> How could I go wrong!</li>
            <li> Cant go wrong with this !</li>
            <li> I used to have acne bad, and started using this</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about this product...</li>
            <li> My husband has bad actinic keratosis (sun damage) on his scalp and has started using it (3-2015).</li>
            <li> I have never used an exfoliant like this and was shocked to see that it was a powder that you mix with water.  </li>
            <li> Wanna know why my skin looked like crap before?</li>
            <li> Very disappointed...</li>
            <li> My skin responds well to salicylic acid but is terribly irritated by benzyl peroxide.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great gentle scrub you can use daily with sensitive skin.  Helped reduce my blackheads and leaves a very clean feeling.  I enjoy using it.  Just wetting face and hands, shaking a bit onto palm and massaging in without adding any water to my palms allows the crystals to massage better before they dissolve.</li>
            <li> Best stuff on the market for my sensitive skin! I also use the calming serum daily after I use this to keep the sensitizing down.</li>
            <li> Love this scrub, it works well, leaves my skin exfoliated, soft and feeling so clean. IT is expensive, but does seem to last a while.</li>
            <li> So initially I thought I was getting a cream exfoliant of some sort . I guess I didn&#x27;t do my homework. When it arrived, I was ecstatic to use it for the first time til I ended up pouring a bunch of sand like substance into my hand.. I get it; NOW. Its just a bit too messy for my taste! Each time I end up eith it in my eye, in my hair...</li>
            <li> Cleans your skin without drying.  Gentle abrasion to remove dead skin cells and brighten your skin. Gentle enuf to use every day which I do....I am dry/oily and it works great for me</li>
            <li> This exfoliant is amazing.  You will notice a difference the first time and EVERY time you use it.  I use this on clients with sensitive skin (including myself); I have never had a client react to this product negatively.  Great for all skin types. LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;JA Licensed in FL&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000980PGM Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant, 2.6-Ounce]]</li>
            <li> I like the whole product line, but don&#x27;t use too many products due to the cost.&lt;br /&gt;This one I continue to use as I really feels it helps exfoliate gently.</li>
            <li> This is a great sand like quality and used with a clarisonic brush you will have perfect skin.A facial at home!</li>
            <li> Not sure if this product is authentic. It smelled different and didn&#x27;t foam after I mix &amp; rub the powder with water. The lot number at the bottom of the bottle was in a larger font and the product printing label rubbed off very easily.  Will not purchase from this particular vendor again.</li>
            <li> This is a staple in my skincare routine and has been for the past 6 years or so. My skin responds well to salicylic acid but is terribly irritated by benzyl peroxide. Tip: Pour some powder into the cap and then pour that into your hand tapping the cup to get all the excess product. Add a few drops of water at a time and mix with your finger (thicker/less water if masking, thinner/more water if scrubbing.) I use this as a scrub 2-3 times a week, as a mask once a week, and as a spot treatment as needed. I&#x27;ve even left it on as a spot treatment overnight and woken up with radically diminished (if not completely disappeared!) blemishes. It brightens, exfoliates, and softens my skin and also helps to fade dark spots. It creates the perfect flawless and smooth base for makeup application as well. It&#x27;s pricey but totally worth the investment, plus, a little goes a very long way. This size usually lasts at least 6 months + for me with usage several times weekly. One of my favorite products of all time and I recommend it to everyone that I know! Be sure to follow up with a toner while your face is still damp. I use Mario Badescu&#x27;s rose water spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Skin: African-American, Combination, Sensitive, Eczema, allergic to Benzyl Peroxide and prone to hyper-pigmentation.</li>
            <li> I have combination sensitive skin and I can&#x27;t tolerate traditional exfoliation products with mechanical exfoliation or stronger chemicals. As a result I get occasional breakouts and blackheads on my nose. Pigmentation from healed pimples plagued my skin too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daily microfoliant lives up to its promises. One use (following instructions) is sufficient to smoothen and even up skin tone. A week later is sufficient to see a reduction in overall blackheads and pimples. A month later, you&#x27;d realise that pores are generally smaller (or invisible unless viewed under strong light and magnifying glass) and blackheads/pimples or uneven pigmentation are essentially much less than a month ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly I love this product simply because it&#x27;s gentle yet effective. I was apprehensive of salicylic acid in it at first due to past adverse reactions, but somehow my skin was able to handle it. Try it and you won&#x27;t regret it. And it lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed daily microfoliant for years. So has my 29 year old daughter. No complaints, just nicer looking skin. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This exfoliant was recommended to me by an esthetician that I go to for facials.  I hesitated buying the product a year ago but decided I needed to take better care of my skin so upon her recommendation (still) a year later, I went for it!  I&#x27;m glad I did!  It really does make your skin smoother and glowing and yet mild enough to use every day.</li>
            <li> I love this microfoliant. It&#x27;s an amazing exfoliant and is so gentle on my skin. I rarely use anything else.</li>
            <li> DO NOT USE EVERYDAY! This probably works for most people but I think it was too harsh for my skin. At first I loved it, my forehead felt clean and crisp but after using it 4-5 times a week for 3 months my forehead slowing started to break out. Dermatologist said I had folliculitis. I&#x27;m 42 and have had a clear forehead all my life. I wish I never tried this stuff.</li>
            <li> Good price for a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> This is great face scrub. Great price, too!!</li>
            <li> Dermalogica&#x27;s daily microfoliant  is the best I have found. While I don&#x27;t use it daily, maybe 4 or 5 times weekly, it produces a more satisfying result than anything else I have used, always leaving my face looking better, and  without the overly dried feeling that some exfoliants produce. Some products leave the area around the nose a little red, but not this one; nice result. Recommended!</li>
            <li> It has been eight days since I began using this product (combined with the overnight clearing gel and clearing mattifer) and it was only when I snapped a picture today that I realsied how smooth my face looked! The first day I used it, I felt that my face was smoother but there was still acne and their associated marks. This did not overdry my face, nor ever made it feel tight as if I was over using it. A little does go a long way. I still have acne but its not as pronounced and my face has developed a more even tone.  I plan to buy the clearing skin wash to complement my line of skin care product.  I thank Dermalogica for helping me achieve my best skin possible</li>
            <li> This an excellent product.  I was reluctant to buy it at first based on the price, but quickly learned this is actually an excellent deal.  The 2.6 ounces is of pure powder exfoliant, so all you need each time is a small shake onto your palm, that you can wet slightly and massage into your face.  I first product I bought lasted me over 6 months, using it 5-6 times per week!  A 5 oz cream exfoliant might cost you half the price, but it will last a third of the time.  This is also an amazing exfoliant that you can feel working as it cleans your skin of impurities.  Highly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial scrub I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;It does the job, without damaging the skin, leaving it smooth and lovely.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of this after a facial at Ulta.  I use it once a day after washing my face with my usual cleanser.  I have huge pores on my nose that are always clogged and some of them have completely disappeared since starting to use this one week ago and the rest are about 1/2 the size they were and are not so visibly clogged!  It smells great, is no irritating and makes my skin feel so smooth!  I love this, definitely worth the price!!</li>
            <li> I really like this facial scrub -very fine powder instead of harsh sandblasting that other scrubs provide.</li>
            <li> So I really like the results of the Microfoliant on my skin.  It leaves my skin soft and dewy, and seemed to reduce my whiteheads.  I have combination skin and get whiteheads but rarely get pimples.  In my opinion, the finer exfoliant works better than larger exfoliating granules like apricot scrubs.  But I&#x27;m not sure how it compares to other microfoliants because I have tried others (are there other microfoliants??).    As a constant traveler who doesn&#x27;t like the check bags or bring excess liquids, the powder form is convenient for traveling.  Also it&#x27;s nice to be able to add water to customize the consistency of the cleanser from more liquid to paste-like.  I prefer the paste.    My complaint is that the powder gets moist when kept in the shower.  And after awhile, the powder gets so moist that it clumps up and the clumps don&#x27;t dispense through the small hole in the top of the bottle.  I end up wasting about 1/3 or 1/4 of the product because of this.  Otherwise, it lasts a long time; at least 3 months.  I know that you&#x27;re not supposed to store it in the shower for the same I mentioned but I think it&#x27;s inconvenient to keep taking the bottle in and out of the shower (I don&#x27;t believe in shower caddies).  Regardless, I&#x27;ve bought 3 of these because I like it that much.  For a higher cost cleanser (compared to drug store products) .  At least it costs less than the higher end cleansers.  I will try my hardest not to store in the shower to see if that prevents the clumping.</li>
            <li> Dermalogica is great stuff, we just love it, and now both my 17 year old son and husband use it...</li>
            <li> Excellent product, a fare price. Deleivered quickly  I like this product as my cosmetic advised me to use it with my other items (Hava Zingeboim, best that I know that works for my skin). This can be used with Hava&#x27;s products so I started. It costs high at the regular stores, so the internet is a best option to but this great product.</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for over a year.i bought a new ones finishing the old one.its a great product especially for oily skin.its effective aginst pimples.i love it.</li>
            <li> I recently brought this after trying so many other scrubs, and could not believe my face after one use. My face felt softer and cleaner. I also have very sensitive skin and this product is very gentle. It might be a bit pricey compared to other products, but I am sure it will last awhile. Really great product!</li>
            <li> Really cleans you skin.</li>
            <li> I wish this product came in bigger sizes! I&#x27;m obsessed with the results. I recommend it for anyone who loves to wash their face... It&#x27;s like a mini facial everyday.</li>
            <li> Works great to get smooth skin!</li>
            <li> During the winter I have extremely dry, flaky skin, and I needed a skin care product that would get rid of all the dead skin. I tried this product and now I&#x27;m absolutely hooked!! It is quite different than any other exfoliant I&#x27;ve ever used. It is a powder that turns into a paste when mixed with water. I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m rubbing sandpaper across my face and its gentle enough to use everyday. Use this product!! You won&#x27;t have any regrets with anything in this skin care line. My skin is firm and glowy  like it was when I was in my twenties.</li>
            <li> I could feel the difference in the texture of my skin the first time i used it. My face felt soft and moisturized. I&#x27;ve  been using it daily for a couple of weeks. I think It&#x27;s making a difference in my overall appearance, but time will tell for sure.</li>
            <li> This is the best scrub ever!!!!!! Your skin looks great and clean&lt;br /&gt;After using it!!! Dermalogica is the best skin company out there</li>
            <li> Great brand / the best for my skin.  Super fast shipping and good price - thank you!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s gentle on the skin yet it has exfoliating property. My skin feels really smooth after using it. It lasts long too. This will now be my daily exfoliating product</li>
            <li> This is a must have product for men/women ages 16-84+. Easy on the skin, can be used as a daily exfoliant. Great company and product.</li>
            <li> I thought this one was pretty unique, it&#x27;s actually a powder that you put on your hands and then add water to it and apply to the face. The product is made to smooth skin, clear dead cells, and remove any buildup and debris on the face. It smells kind of like oranges too, and I really enjoy using this!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in my monthly Birchbox</li>
            <li> Love the way it exfoliates my skin!!</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying dermalogica products from amazon.  I am not sold on this microfoliant.  Why,my opinion is based on 2 points.  First,by smell of purchased product compared to previously purchased microfoliant product.  There is a subtle difference.  Second, there is a difference in appearance of the scrub. This product doesnt look the same. I am just not sold on this scrub.  I have been buying from dermalogica for years.  My skin doesnt feel exfoliated compared to the salon purchased product.</li>
            <li> It doesnt work well for me. and it was expensive. it seems it does not exfoliate at all. try the st ives for a better option at a much cheaper price. you can find it in stores. dermalogica microfoliant didnt work well for me but good luck [[ASIN:B0017MO8AS St. Ives Timeless Skin Daily Microdermabrasion 4 oz (113 g)]]</li>
            <li> Skin will never feel as clean as it will after you use this cleansing product..!&lt;br /&gt;Other cleansers sometimes leave a film or slickness on the skin after use, however this product makes your skin feel literally squeaky-clean.  My skin feels extra soft and supple after use.  I have sensitive skin and this product doesn&#x27;t agitate it.&lt;br /&gt;Costly for sure, but the bottle I have seems to last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: Be sure to collect enough foliant powder into your palm, just enough to create a thin &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; to get best results.</li>
            <li> I have only had this product in my possession for a week and I am already blown away with its performance and very premature yet impressive results. I use once a day along with my wash, tone and moisturize regimen and my skin is brighter,my acne scars are slightly lighter and my skin isn&#x27;t red, irritated or peeling. It&#x27;s like the added \\&quot;boost\\&quot; in the results I need for skin clarity and even texture. This formula is so unique because unlike scrubs and other exfoliators there are no abrasive ingredients like walnut shell powder or other small granules. Yet once I rinse off the product my face feels squeaky clean (like 60 seconds!).   I am a college student so this product exceeds my budget. However, I wish I would have come upon quality cleansing products like this when I was younger because I wasted a ton of money and did a lot of irreversible damage to my skin by using drug store/infomercial products.   Lastly, if you check out the main ingredients and research them online, you realize you are buying the best of the best. The product has also won many awards, which is what originally got me interested. HOwever, the product has worked its best when I use a broad spectrum UVA/UVB SPF.</li>
            <li> This product is top notch.  I apply it using the Olay Prox Advanced Rotating Cleaning Brush [[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System 0.68 Fl Oz, 1-Count]]] and my skin is crazy smooth.  Only problem is, Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant is absurdly expensive. When I told my husband that a 2.6 oz bottle was $43.00, he said if people bought that they should never complain about the cost of gas. It&#x27;s so true but I have found an alternative.  Is it exactly the same as Dermalogica? NO. I have been using St. Ives Fresh Skin Apricot Scrub [[ASIN:B000UVY8IE St. Ives, Fresh Skin Apricot Scrub, 6oz]]. When applying St. Ives, you will notice the texture is much different than Dermalogica but you get the same results and it&#x27;s a fraction of the cost. I use it every night before bed using the Olay rotating brush I mentioned earlier.  St. Ives say to only use it 3-4 times a week but I use it every night and follow it up with Dermalogic Multi-Active Toner and Dermalogic Ultracalming Serum Concentrate.  I bite the bullet on these two items because I haven&#x27;t found anything that even comes close to performing as they do. If you have the money by all means go for it, but if your like me and have to be a little creative sometimes give it a shot.</li>
            <li> Very gentle but effective exfoliant.  I have been using it daily and without issue on my skin, which usually has a high histamine response (flares up quickly when scratched), for years.  Some reviews complained about mixing with too much water; here&#x27;s my advice: wet hands only (don&#x27;t cup water), shake some product into your palm, use fingers on opposite hand to mix into paste, and apply with both hands to face &amp; throat.  That way, you don&#x27;t lose any product down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vendor service was straightforward and quick; no issues with the purchase, and the delivery was in simple but sufficiently protective packaging - and it was fast.  Would buy from them again.</li>
            <li> This is a DAILY and GENTLE exfoliant.  Sprinkle a little in your wet hand and rub into a paste.  Then work it into your damp or wet face.  Rinse.  This product is in my top 5 beauty staples.  I will never be without.</li>
            <li> This product is great!! It really does what it says I would definitely recommend it it leaves skin softer cleaner and definitely luminous</li>
            <li> My sister purchased this product due to so many great reviews about it,thinking it would help us both out with acne that we get time to time. However after using this product for about a week we both broke out all over the forehead and chin into these tiny bumps that weren&#x27;t even pimples! I do not recommend. My go to product for acne breakouts is moisturizing with organic coconut oil and applying organic tea tree oil after.</li>
            <li> I am a sensitive person, to the point where even my skin is sensitive.  Seriously.  Harsh soaps can really do a number on my skin, heck even many powdered laundry detergents irritate my skin (not a problem with my homemade detergent however!!), so I really have to pay attention to how products affect my face.  It is almost inevitable that Winter brings on the dry, flaky, cracked skin.  This winter has been mild, yet still the face on my skin got so dry.  Nothing seemed to be helping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew my problem; I needed to exfoliate.  But with sensitive skin, this can be tricky, and often results in even drier, and now angry red, skin.  So, you can imagine my excitement when I received in my Birchbox a sample of Demalogia Microfoliant.  This is a dry powder that you mix with water to form a gritty paste.  You rub it into the your face with your fingertips for about 60 seconds, and wipe clean.  The result is brighter, exfoliated skin.  But would it work on my touchy t-zone?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was that it does not take much of this product.  I was sent a sample of almost half an ounce, and three weeks later I have barely made a dent in it.  When you use your wet hands to make the paste, it feels slightly gritty, but as you massage it with wet fingertips, it forms a nice foam.  There are no artificial colors or fragrances, a huge bonus for me because of my skin sensitivities, but it does contain tea tree oil which gives it a light, clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a tremendous difference after just one use.  My skin felt smooth, soft, and energized.  I moisturized and my skin felt dewy (not oily or greasy) all day.  My makeup never dried, flaked, or cracked at all.  This stuff is amazing!  After multiple uses, I noticed my skin was clearer, and my pores were less noticeable.  Now that my skin is in much better condition, I only use this product every other day, in part to make my sample last longer, and in part because I do not want to over exfoliate my skin and cause irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fantastic product that works well for me, and I would highly recommend it.  I reviewed this product through a sample service for which I pay.  I was in no way compensated for this review.te my skin and cause irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fantastic product that works well for me, and I would highly recommend it.  I reviewed this product through a sample service for which I pay.  I was in no way compensated for this review.</li>
            <li> This product is dry and water is added to apply it. I was not aware of this when I bought the product. It works well however it makes my face too dry. Also, I bought another product through Amazon and had to pay TWO shipping cost. It cost me as much as I paid for both products to ship each one individually. I will never buy any other products except books through Amazon.</li>
            <li> After viewing a trusted youtube video on this, I decided to give it a try.  I could not be more pleased!  This is the best exfoliating scrub I have ever used.  It is gentle, thorough, and it takes very little product to get great results, so it lasts a long time. My skin is soft, and it looks healthy after using this. What a difference from the drugstore exfoliant I was using (which feels like gravel compared to this microfine product)! By the way, the person who recommended the product owned a Clarisonic and preferred this product over it!  I agree, and the results are well worth it.  A bit pricey, but you definitely get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> Always loved Dermalogica products! I have VERY sensitive skin and never had a negative reaction to this product.</li>
            <li> I received this in a monthly beauty sample box. I am pleasantly surprised. It leaves my skin soft, bright, I feel like I had a spa treatment. I plan on buying a full size. And I hope that the rest of the line is as good as this wash.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years, it lathers great and keeps my face soft and nice.  I keep It in the shower and use in the mornings.  Does not dry or strip face, just subtly microfoliates.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that i was first introduced during a facial i had. I bought this product from the facial salon the day of the facial and have been using it ever since. It makes your skin feel so fresh, clean and smooth. It gives you just the right amount of daily exfoliation without drying out your skin. I highly recommend this product for all ages and skin types.</li>
            <li> Works well if you use the correct amount. I use in conjunction with Mary Kay products and have be pleased with the outcome.</li>
            <li> I am 40, with sensitive dry skin (due to starting hormone changes) and rosacea and I can&#x27;t live without this product!  I use it everyday and my face is smooth and balanced, not dry or tight. I discovered it a couple of years ago, but did not start using it daily until last year, when I got smart and started getting it from Amazon instead of trying to find a salon that carried it.  I don&#x27;t have itchy rosacea breakouts anymore, or any breakouts for that matter.  I also use the eye cream, too, and I find that a great product, as well.</li>
            <li> swear by this product, I buy one ever 3 months or so. the most natural based on rice powder. leaves a clean and smooth feeling on skin. good for sensitive skin and breakout prone.     higher in price but once u use it. you&#x27;ll never go back to crap brands like st. ives. that are basically like using a high school chemistry class on your face.</li>
            <li> Great product. Because of the price I gave it 4 stars. More affordable pricing I would have given it 5</li>
            <li> love this product, makes my skin feel very soft</li>
            <li> Great for everyday use.  Not too harsh.</li>
            <li> Ok not the best product cleanser.</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit skeptical because of the fact that the microfoliant is a powder and I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be messy or hard to use as a cleanser.  But I was wrong.  The mircofoliant is seriously amazing!  I got it in my Birchbox (a company that sends you beauty samples for $10 a month) and loved it so much I purchased the full size from there website.  It is easy to use and you only need a tiny bit. It smells kinda citrusy, very fresh and not too strong. But my favorite part about it is how it makesy my skin feel.  After use my skin felt incredibly soft, like a baby. I have very oily skin which is prone to breakouts. This doesn&#x27;t dry out my face and also helps with my breakouts. Although the price is somewhat high, it is incredible worth it! Before I was using cleansers such as Lush&#x27;s Ocean Salt and Yes to Carrots cleanser and this beats out both. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I love to use it everyday in the morning. I guess you could make it, smells like rice flour, but I like the convenience of this bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I was told about this product from a beautiful lady at the spa I go to and love it.  I recieved the microfoliant quickly and highly recommend this seller..</li>
            <li> not what I expected but this product is great and definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really like Dermalogica products.  This product exfoliates your face and you can use it everyday.  It softens the skin nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two months now and I absolutely cannot and will not live without it. My skin is so clear and soft, I almost cannot believe it. It is very rare that a product actually works and this one certainly surpasses expectations!!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff. I like the way it cleans, but I always get the powder up my nose and it freaks me out. Don&#x27;t get it wet, or it will clump and ruin it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year and recently purchased this item on Amazon. Using the Daily Microfoliant is like having a daily mini facial. It smoothes my skin and gives me a healthy glow. I use this every morning without fail!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reviewing this for the product but have not purchased from Amazon. I get this at a local retailer. I&#x27;m a male, have combination, olive tone skin that isn&#x27;t sensitive or acne prone.  This is one of my favorite facial cleansers that I&#x27;ll use throughout the year. It exfoliates/cleanses my skin very well but doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling super tight/dry. I find that this helps to keep my skin dry/matte all day. I suggested it to a friend who has porcelain (aka very white) and sensitive skin. She also loves this product. So, it&#x27;s safe to say that this is appropriate for anyone, with any skin type.  If you like the powder and mildness of this, an equally great product (for less $) is DHC Washing Powder.</li>
            <li> I used to do chem peels to deal with hyperpigmented skin due to breakouts. I bought this as a general exploration of DM products and must say it&#x27;s one of the products I will keep buying again and again. The texture threw me off at first. It&#x27;s like a gritty rice powder you have to put on your wet face. Messy, right? Well, it works miracles: makes my skin supple through long term gentle exfoliation, makes it perfect for moisturizing and makeup. This and the clearing gel have helped so much fade out spots (no acne to cause them). I use it in the am and in the pm (or after sports during the day) and it hasn&#x27;t irritated or dried my skin ever. Don&#x27;t scrub away hard: just gentle until the beads turn into lather. Avoid the eyes esp if you wear lenses and try not to inhale!</li>
            <li> This is my Holy Grail exfoliater. It removes oil, make up, dead skin cells, all gently without leaving any redness or dryness. I use is 1-2x a week and it helps keep my pregnancy breakouts at bay. It is so much better than Origins Modern Friction. A little goes a long way so a bottle lasts a long time. The best part is that I don&#x27;t get super oily after using it. It doesn&#x27;t strip like other exfoliating products which only makes you produce more oil. For my combination skin this is a must have.</li>
            <li> have used this wonderful product for years now; it is gentle enough for sensitive skin yet does a good job of removing surface particles and all</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough about how wonderful this product is!  It has changed my facial cleansing routine!  After a facial I was given a sample of the Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant.  After a few days I was hooked and ordered it.  The bottle is a generous size and will last a LONG time.  You only need a small amount and after cleansing, my face feels soft and fresh.  It is also helping keep my breakouts under control.  Thank you Dermalogica!</li>
            <li> I have Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant in the past, and have always been thrilled with the product.&lt;br /&gt;This shipment was unacceptable however.&lt;br /&gt;We ordered two 2.6-Ounce bottles of Microfoliant.&lt;br /&gt;When they arrived, the silver outer boxes had been opened, before being shipped.&lt;br /&gt;This means the tamper proof seal had been manually removed on both boxes.&lt;br /&gt;I am not accusing the seller of doing anything specific, but there is no good reason for removing a tamper proof seal before shipping a product, and many bad reasons.&lt;br /&gt;I love amazon, but I recommend buying this product elsewhere!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff I just bought a second bottle, I usally use it in the morning.. it makes my skin look fresh and it feels smooth, its worth the price.. I love it I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> This stuff works,  I will admit that. My skin looked brighter and smoother after using this product. However, I developed contact dermatitis in the skin around both of my eyes. For a month after discontinuing this wash, that skin was tight, peeling, BLEEDING, and itchy until I got a prescription to heal it.</li>
            <li> This was my first Dermalogica purchase and I love it! I bought this based on the reviews and I am so glad I did! I was skeptical but thought I would give it a try. I have used so many different skin care products from low end to high end items but the Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant is the best exfoliant I have used! If you are on the fence about this purchase.....go for it! It is really easy to use and though it is a very fine powder and you may question it&#x27;s ability to do a good job your face will feel amazing afterwards.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good. But it&#x27;s not for the oil skin</li>
            <li> This is not genuine dermalogica . I used to work in a spa and sale the dermalogica. The real one is wonderful. This is fake product. I will return it.</li>
            <li> I began using this scrub a couple years ago and am now addicted to it.....I use it pretty much every day and it has really helped with my troubled forehead areas.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, oily, dry, pain-in-the-butt skin. It is often plagued by blackheads and pimples, but dry spots crop up too, and I have issues finding something that is gentle and effective. I started using the dermalogica medibac skin set about 2 and a half weeks ago, and I purchased a travel sized bottle of this shortly after to t. It is amazing! At first I was worried about drying out my skin, so I only used it every other day for a few uses. After noticing that it wasn&#x27;t irritating my skin, but leaving it smooth and soft, I decided to try using it everyday. Well, I have used it everyday for about a week, and it is fabulous! I have been struggling with my skin since middle school, and it has never felt better!     If you are worried about the price, try the travel size first. I purchased a small one for 7.75 on Amazon from Skin Care Investments here[...]</li>
            <li> You can do this one easy, and it works. No side effect, no redness, no nothing just works it&#x27;s magic. I have been using this line for about 4 months now and I am extremely happy with the outcome. A very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Let me tell all of you something, not proactive..and nothing you buy from the store compares to this amazing product..not many people know about dermalogica simply cause its everyones beauty secret. Iam 20 years old and recommend this to anyone with oily acne prone skin. Well worth your money for a gorgeous smooth face!!!</li>
            <li> This expensive rice powder did absolutely nothing for my skin. Please try out sample products before wasting money on full-size products. I have problem skin -oily/combo/acne... and after using this, I noticed my face felt \\&quot;clean\\&quot; but that&#x27;s about it. I can get the same clean feeling from a $5 Queen Helene or Garnier scrub. Only buy this if you&#x27;ve tried it, and it has worked miraculously on your skin. I felt like it was rubbing rice powder on my face, and it felt really clean after, but that&#x27;s it.... no actual change in my skin tone, nothing. Something like this should provide more effective results that can be seen and felt AFTER initial use (long term results). Save your $$.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product and swear by it but really wish it wasn&#x27;t so gosh darn expensive!! I love how it dissipates slowly the more you scrub &amp; use it so as to not cause too much microdermabrasion. I hunted at Sephora for a cheaper version that does the same and found it from a company called Bliss but twas only $10 cheaper &amp; didn&#x27;t dissipate in the same manner as the Dermolgica product &amp; only $10 isn&#x27;t enough to cause me to switch. Brand loyalty + the tried &amp; true method!</li>
            <li> I have a combination skin, so I use this product with dermal clay cleanser and it is perfect for me. After using it my skin looks so clean and feels amazingly soft. I will never go back to other products. Even my old acne spots are despairing.</li>
            <li> Awesome for sensitive skin.  Surprised it contains so many great ingredients to improve skin brightness and clarity.  I highly recommend this as an exfoliant for anyone.</li>
            <li> This was not a genuine Dermalogica product.  I returned it for a refund immediately with no issues. Definitely do not recommend.</li>
            <li> I use this  microfoliant on my face every day.  It makes my skin smooth and soft to the touch.  It is a great product and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. Try it and you&#x27;ll be a convert too. Perfect everyday exfoliant with no irritation.</li>
            <li> Brightens skin love this product!</li>
            <li> Oooooo this product is a Winner!  As an Esthetician, I love being able to offer clients something that shows instant results, and this product does.&lt;br /&gt;Rated Favorite Product in many women&#x27;s magazines, it&#x27;s great that the general public can now purchase it on their own rather than going to a spa.&lt;br /&gt;**A key note that they don&#x27;t tell you (since it&#x27;s meant to be a Professionally-bought product where the practitioner already has been trained in it)&lt;br /&gt;is that it is activated with Steam.  I keep an air-tight container of it in the shower, put it on first, do my thing, and manipulate it here &amp; there while showering.  -Then- rinse it off.**  ; )</li>
            <li> Been using Dermalogica products for years and the only problem with this microfoliant is that it absorbs moisture and I can never get a full use out of the bottle no matter how careful I am to avoid any excess water getting to it.</li>
            <li> definitely the best option for a soft face cleansing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for years and there is nothing like it.</li>
            <li> I recommend Dermalogica&#x27;s Microfoliant product to help you experience that &amp;#34;deep clean&amp;#34; feeling and to fight away flaky skin, especially the flaky skin I see after using certain acne fighting products. This product feels like a gently abrasive yet calming oatmeal exfoliant designed for your face. If that sounds weird, don&#x27;t be scared - I mean it in the best possible way! Love this product.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Very gentle on my combination skin.  It improved the look and quality of my skin dramatically.  Will use this forever!</li>
            <li> This product is pricy, but it lasts forever. I got a travel-sized sample from my February Birchbox that my boyfriend and I have been using since February, and five months later we&#x27;re still not out yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the results--oh the results. It exfoliates your face very gently, and leaves glowing skin behind. My skin is prone to scarring--hence the few pimples I get a month tend to leave dark marks for what seems like forever. Not anymore. This product is ace at fading pimple scars. It just works so well at everything it claims to do. My skin is now so smooth and glowing and my pimple scars are so generally faded that I can feel ok about leaving the house without foundation. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the best way to use it is in the shower. Just dump a bit in very wet hands and rub together until it lathers, and apply.</li>
            <li> If you buy anything of dermalogica, you must absolutely have this in your mix.  Besides a cleanser, this product is a must have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does keep your skin looking fresh as it gently exfoliates, and my skin texture and tone has improved.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve relied on Dermalogica&#x27;s Daily Microfoliant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I don&#x27;t use it daily, I enjoy the soft, silky skin on my face and glow it leaves.</li>
            <li> Another great product from Dermalogica. How could I go wrong! They make me love my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I keep telling everyone this is not my skin before Dermalogica.</li>
            <li> Comes in a powdery form &amp; is simple &amp; easy to use.  Add water to make a fine paste.  A little goes a long way.  Does a good job exfoliating without stripping oils away.  Gentle.</li>
            <li> This mild  microfoliant is a must for everyone.  It can be used daily as the title suggests without fear of stripping the oil and natural moisture from the skin.</li>
            <li> Just an all-around great, gentle exfoliator that helps reveal more glowing skin and speeds cell regeneration. Excellent if you get periodic breakouts -- or if you just want healthier, more youthful looking skin. Must follow with at least a light-weight moisturizer, as it can leave skin just a bit too squeaky-clean, tight, and slightly dehydrated.  Amazing combined with your favorite high-end cleanser and Dermalogica Active Moist hydrating lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Hands down my most favorite facial product.  HANDS DOWN.  It is worth every penny.  My skin always feels like I just had a professional facial.  That&#x27;s exaggerating but it practically feels like I just had a facial.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many of these types of products and many price points and this one is the best!</li>
            <li> Not a genuine product and it wasn&#x27;t sealed. Very disappointed...</li>
            <li> Amazing! Does wonders</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my facialist. It is downright amazing. You do not need to really rub it in- a gentle massage with do. Afterwards, your skin will be so smooth. I&#x27;ve tried other exfoliants, but they made my face breakout. This one doesn&#x27;t though, which is a BIG PLUS. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> best product ever....purchase every other month.</li>
            <li> An aesthetist recommended this product to me during a facial. It is gentle on my skin and I use it a few times a week on my face. I really like the product. It is just expensive.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this, and had to buy the full size. I love it. It makes my skin feel so clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday for years!! Save the salon facial.. this does the job of exfoliation in gentle way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too fine, too &amp;#34;micro.&amp;#34; Does not appear to make any difference. Ineffective.</li>
            <li> Very effective and long lasting - you only need a small amount to clean your face. Noticeable difference after the first try. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to remove dead skin and makes your skin glow.</li>
            <li> I use Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant twice a day. It helps keep my problem skin clear of blemishes. It&#x27;s slightly gritty and doesn&#x27;t foam up like most products, but once you get used to that, I think you&#x27;ll like it</li>
            <li> its exactly what others have said, works great, my skin feels great.  it isn&#x27;t so abrasive that it leaves your skin red and scratched.  its perfect</li>
            <li> I bought this product from an Ulta store and found that Amazon&#x27;s price is much lower. It is an amazing product!! As a teenager, I barely suffered from acne but as I crossed into my late 20s, I found that I am experiencing serious shifts in  my skins overall balance and oil production. As someone who deals with adult acne (without prescription medication), I found that this product works wonders on my skin. I also have very sensitive skin which irritates easily and I have never had a problem with this product. Realistically, no my acne is not solved and I never break out, but I do notice some improvements in the frequency of my breakouts. The exfoliant is really fine and it works into a nice thick paste which  leaves your skin feeling clean but not tight at all. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve finally found my favorite exfoliant. I started off with the travel size container, but soon splurged on the full size container because I love it so much. You don&#x27;t need much to clean and scrub your face - it lathers up rapidly. You can feel the scrubbing particles at first, but the large pieces dissolve quickly and then you are scrubbing on a micro basis. I have yet to feel that I can overuse or over-scrub my face, all the ingredients are extremely gentle. The combo of chemical and mechanical exfoliants leave my skin baby soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, just a little mixed with water and then rub it on your face and it does a great job.  In the winter you should use this probably only 2 or 3 times a week,  summer probably every day...</li>
            <li> seriously. This is one product I will not go without. I use it every day in the shower (just make sure you keep the bottle outside the shower or it cakes up around the holes.) It is especially great a few days after a peel when the dead skin is ready to come off and it just rolls it away. I also use the Skin Prep Scrub with it once a week, just put the scrub over the microfoliant for a double exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I have very noticeable pores and have always had issues with black heads on my nose.  I went to get a facial with my sister and they used this product and it was awesome.  My face feels baby smooth and even better my pores are smaller.  The particles seem to clean the pores and exfoliate the dead, skin, and oil.  I bought myself a bottle pricy, but worth it.  Also make sure you rinse your face well or you will have white stuff on it. This product works better than my expensive face brush.</li>
            <li> I started using Dermalogica Daily Mircrofoliant years ago and liked it. Over the years I&#x27;ve tried others, but always went back to it because it works so well on my face. When I don&#x27;t use it, or use another brand, my face isn&#x27;t as smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel as clean. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I normally purchase Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant however, this particular order the granules did not dissolve well and the &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; were rough on my face.  I could not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this exfoliant. It works great and it last a long time. I know it is expensive but it lasts you a while if you use it correctly .It helps minimize shine and really exfoliates gently.</li>
            <li> I love using the Dermalogica Microfoliant.  The only drawback I had is that it does take a while before you have a noticeable difference.  However, once I kept using it, it does brighten my complexion.  If you have an uneven skin tone, you will need to use this in combination with another product.  But my overall rating is good, because I definitely plan to keep buying this.</li>
            <li> I love that I found this on Amazon! Costs a bit less than going to the salon where the price is $50! It is an excellent product that works on your pores with exfoliation with cleansing results! I have used this product for years &amp; still love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product, makes my skin really clean like after a facial. However, I still use products with anti acne ingredients to make sure I don&#x27;t break out.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after using the cleanser but  my skin became red and irritated after a few days of use. I discontinued using it because a week later my skin still looks as though I had a reaction to something. It&#x27;s red and dry but only on the right side of my face. I still use the Dermalogica cleanser daily which is a milder product</li>
            <li> I have been using Dermalogica products for the past ten years since I was 45. That is when I noticed the aging process kicking in. Which is no fun, but to slow the process down I started using Dermalogica because of their quality and the results I started seeing immediately, which was a more supple and glowing skin. Microfoliant is a rice based cleanser which doesn&#x27;t stripe your skin natural oils. You don&#x27;t have to take my word, as in practically every beauty magazine when it comes time to rate beauty products, this one usually comes in #1.</li>
            <li> This stuff exfoliates like nothing I&#x27;ve ever tried before. It&#x27;s super gentle, and it works better than more abrasive products. I always have bright, glowing skin the moment I rinse this microfoliant off! I could not recommend this product more highly.</li>
            <li> The stuff works great! My husband, son and myself used it and loved it so much that we give each other facial... lol</li>
            <li> Great stuff, have used it for years.  Love love love!  Makes my skin glow even though it&#x27;s 51 years old :)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like having to mix with water</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and can&#x27;t really tolerate most acne or skin products. This stuff has an awkward, grainy texture that you can definitely feel working. It smoothed my skin a bit, but I ended up with more skin issues than I had before using it. Definitely do not use every day, if you must buy it!</li>
            <li> I have rosacea...not the redness but the pustule/papular kind and have to be very careful with my skin.  This stuff cleans out my pores without irritating anything.  I also mix it with my DHC oil cleanser occasionally and that works very well too.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this it looks like its a fake one, Original one has a plastic seal (this one does not) around the bottle and when I tried it on my skin it feels absolutely different than I bought directly from Dermalogica.com.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and have used it for years.  It exfoliates very nicely (not rough), cleanses very well, washes away easily and leaves a very soft feel to my skin.  Thank you, Dermalogica &amp; Amazon!</li>
            <li> Gentle enough to use every day, and makes my skin noticeably brighter and smoother.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Excellent scrub-not rough- does not hurt your face when using it.</li>
            <li> Read rave reviews about this daily scrub and was excited to try but have not really seen any improvements or benefits on my skin. Keep it in my shower now and use every now and then. Blah.</li>
            <li> I love Dermalogica products especially the cleansers.  I&#x27;ve used other exfoliant products but none compare to the Daily Microfoliant by Dermalogica.  I wash my face daily with the Dermalogica cleanser and then use a small amount of microfoliant mixed with a little water to make my face fresh, clean and bright.  I will never try another product.  Yes, it is pricey but it lasts for a long time and it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I love using this product combined with La Roche-Posay Purifying Foaming Gel they go great together. I know they are totally different products but so ususally I wash my face first with the Foaming Gel, then pair it with the Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant... and WOW! my skin feels and looks fantastic! I don&#x27;t however use the Dermalogica product everyday, I feel it would dry my skin.</li>
            <li> great product, visibly improved my skin texture in a week</li>
            <li> My facial aesthetician recommends it and I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years now. It&#x27;s a great texture without being too harsh and would be easy to use everyday although I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The only exfoliant that doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li> This was a great price and It works wonders. I used to have acne bad, and started using this and it really helped. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is one product that I use daily and can&#x27;t go without.  I have tried other scrubs but this is the only one that I can use every day, that doesn&#x27;t cause micro tears, that is super gentle and REALLY removes the dead flakes that you would normally have.  My skin has never been smoother, softer, or look better.  Love love love this product!  (Wish it was less costly though)</li>
            <li> this is one of my favorite products to use daily in addition to face wash. I feel that the gently microfoliant really improves my face to reveal younger and less-acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> great price, great service, great product , everything is great I strongly recommend service and product... this is a very good product for your face</li>
            <li> Top line, very effective product. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My favorite exfoliation product! Amazing improvement in my skins apperance!  I wonder how I lived with out it.  Now my husband even uses it and loves it.</li>
            <li> I use Glytone as a cleanser and this is a great back up when my face have minor breakouts.  I love this product!</li>
            <li> Combining it with the clay cleanser now, not sure how well they will work together. We&#x27;ll see how they do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for the past 7 years and think it&#x27;s wonderful.  Very gentle on sensitive skin so it can be daily without drying or redness issues.  I&#x27;m amazed how long the 2.6 oz. lasts; when used daily and according to directions the product lasts 4 to 5 months in my case. My skin has a glow and is always fresh looking.</li>
            <li> I use dermalogica Daily Microfoliant every day and love the silky smooth feel of my 58 year old skin. I have very sensitive skin and it actually soothes any redness or irritation that I sometimes get from food sensitivities. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit painful to have to mix the product first. I&#x27;ll admit I prefer to use a product directly out of the packaging. But it&#x27;s great to know you are activating the ingredients on the spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The enzymes and salicylic acid gently polish the skin leaving it feeling and looking more radiant. This product contains a long list of ingredients. The main active ingredients being Rice-based enzymes, papain and Salicylic Acid. The synergy of active ingredients really works to dissolve excess surface cells. This product is so gentle, you could use it every day. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Stopped using this product for a few months and didn&#x27;t realize how fresh it makes my face look and feel after I restarted.  My skin is partly oily and it calmed down the break outs and evened the color.</li>
            <li> I use this every day.  It GENTLY exfoliates without scratching or irritating my skin.  Love it!  My only complaint?  Difficult to determine when the container is running on empty as it has that little weight thingy in it to keep from clumping.  My solution is to just make sure I always have another on hand.</li>
            <li> Have used this for over 20 years. It brightens and tightens by causing cell turnover w/o stripping the skin. So gentle, but with results!!!  Try it and you will love it. No fuss and no mess!  Sprinkle the powder in your hand and add water. A fresh alternative to soap, and lotion cleansers!!!  You will glow!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for  ten months. I use every morning. This is my second order. Last for several months.</li>
            <li> great service and product</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any changes in my skin&#x27;s appearance since I started using it, but Dermalogica is a typically a good product and I&#x27;m satisfied with it so far.</li>
            <li> I love Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant and have been using it for years. It&#x27;s great for travelling and a quick skin pick me up without being too abrasive on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping was appreciated!</li>
            <li> Have used it for years</li>
            <li> I love this product, and the Dermologica product line.  My skin looks and feels so much better.  As of 8/2014, I&#x27;ve been using Dermologica products for about 6 weeks.  I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a difference in my skin.  I look forward to using this line for a long time!</li>
            <li> its a great product, makes your skin very soft and clean... thank u for product and great service.. also makes a great gift.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s made any dramatic improvement on my skin, but it&#x27;s a nice exfoliator that seems to be pretty gentle. Some can be too abrasive. This gets the job done without being harsh.</li>
            <li> wonderful and it worked! helped fade my sunspot and smooth my skin without being abrasive. Last forever so it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is about this stuff, but it makes my skin feel so smooth after I use it. It also helps prevent breakouts. I will buy it again!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used dermalogica microfoliant to exfoliate my skin after washing it for a couple years.  It makes your skin look great, tighter with fewer/smaller pores and almost polished.  I use it in the morning and the evening, most days.  Might seem expensive but it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened the box I realized that the bottle had clearly been opened and used before.  There was no seal on the bottle.</li>
            <li> Product is excellent because it really works the way it is described.  It exfoliates the skin without drying it out.  I have also used this product before purchasing it online.  The price is very good [...]</li>
            <li> Never fails me this product is amazing.. Gentle exfoliator lathers up and feels great.. Will continue to use and recommend to people</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered with acne prone and sensitive ALL my life! I cannot use benzoyl peroxide or anything with a fragrance. This microfoliant is life changing! I recommend using it with the dermalogica face wash and lotion recommended for your skin type for optimal results. You&#x27;ll DEF see full results in 8 wks ;)</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about this product... it has done wonders for me! i bought this on amazon after seeing my skin care specialist and she told me to stop using scrubs and instead use this product. She gave me a sample and when i got home i was so surprised on how well it worked. Dont be put off by it being in powder form.. its simple to use and safe on your skin. Its gentle enough to use daily, although i use it every other day. I would recommend this product to someone who is trying to get that youthful glow back and also get rid of a few fine lines along the way. Im very very pleased. Also i saved almost half buying it on amazon.. cant beat that!! :)</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Exactly what I wanted! Great price</li>
            <li> The reviews were really great for this product. It&#x27;s supposed to be one of the best exfoliators on the market. I am very happy with the results. My skin looks great. Not harsh and very effective at making my skin glow.</li>
            <li> This microfoliant definitely the best of the best. It&#x27;s definitely pricey, but completely worth it. It improves my skin quality expodentially!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I might be the only one thinking this, but i seriously had no idea that this product came in powder form!! I have never used an exfoliant like this and was shocked to see that it was a powder that you mix with water.  I have used many different products because my skin is acne prone.  It feels just as good as the philosophy exfoliant and it is much cheaper, it is only my third day using it and I love it! so definitely buy it! Just remember its a POWDER!</li>
            <li> This paired with the dermalogica special cleaning gel makes your face feel so soft! I love it.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Not exactly easy to use, but I do like it. It&#x27;s hard to get a good consistency with the water and powder.</li>
            <li> Great product, I&#x27;ve been using it for years... No matter what I try, I always come back to Dermalogica. I&#x27;m 58years old &amp; this works great to clear the dead skin &amp; soften skin before I moisturize. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I Recommend this product I Have Sensitive Skin And i Like it .. I&#x27;m gone Try More dermalogica products 5 🌟</li>
            <li> All Dermalogica products are great !</li>
            <li> I suffer from chronic ingrown hairs on my bikini area because I have extremely sensitive skin. I recieved this product as a sample and it worked great on my face, so I decided to try it on my bikini area too. It is the only thing I have ever used that clears up ingrown hairs and razer bumps (I moisturize with glycolic acid lotion afterwards, that helps a lot too). It is amazing and I recommend it! Although, it is crazy expensive!</li>
            <li> I had been a huge fan of Glotherapeutics pumpkin scrub, but my facialist was out last time I went. While looking online for a replacement, the Dermalogica brand caught my eye. Everyone had such good things to say, and I&#x27;m happy to add my own praise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is such an interesting product; it&#x27;s a powder that turns to a paste in your wet hands. As you massage it in, you feel the grit gently working on your skin, until  the product finally turns smooth. Feels soooo good! It rinses clean and I immediately noticed, after putting on my regular old moisturizer, that my skin was way softer and mega-dewy. Plus, it&#x27;s definitely gentle enough to use every day, although I prefer every other day just to preserve product (that bottle isn&#x27;t full to the brim)! Compared to harsher scrubs (like my beloved glotherapeutics!) that are only once-a-week, it&#x27;s nice to have something that I can use whenever I want my skin looking fab (date night, anyone?) without worrying about overworking it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One minor item, not even worth taking off a star, bcs I didn&#x27;t bother complaining. But the packaging arrived totally trashed. the box was ripped open, and I was actually a little concerned that the product itself had been tampered with. Is the bottle only supposed to be half full with product??? I came very close to trying to send it back, but the seller&#x27;s return policy seemed cumbersome so I just decided to keep it. Like I said, since I didn&#x27;t open a dialogue with the seller (and since ultimately, my review is for the product... I don&#x27;t want to be one of those reviewers who criticizes the product due to something that is not the product&#x27;s fault!), I&#x27;m not taking off a star or anything. But I might see if my facialist carries these products instead of buying on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This item shipped quickly but the box was not sealed and item was open.  All Dermalogica items come sealed with a silver sticker and I can see where it was removed from.  When I contacted the seller they assured me it was new, but did not offer to exchange it for a sealed product.  I am hesitant to use it...wasted money.</li>
            <li> I am usually the chick who HATES putting down more than $10 for any kind of face wash/cosmetic products...but this is SO WORTH IT.  Wanna know why my skin looked like crap before? Because I was using CRAPPY PRODUCTS!!  I am only 20, I don&#x27;t have severe acne, only an occasional breakout here or there, so WHY was I using products that usually say \\&quot;cure break outs\\&quot; in the title? Well....just like everyone else...I didn&#x27;t wanna spend $30 on face wash, so I settled for noxema, neutrogena, ect...&lt;br /&gt;Even the products that didn&#x27;t have acne medication still dried out my skin -- and when I looked at the back of the bottle at the ingredients...guess what! They ALL HAD THE SAME INGREDIENTS!! Long story short, I end up spending, just like everyone else, $10 here, $10 there, $10 $10 $10 $10 $10 every month trying out new products from walgreens or cvs that NEVER WORK and give me the same results -- dry skin and redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all of that being said....this product is SO WORTH the $30 because in the long run I end up spending hundreds of dollars a year trying to find the right face wash anyway! I just used this product in the shower, and the moment I washed it off I could FEEL my skin transforming.  It was softer, smoother, and virtually bump-free. And when I looked in the mirror I was so excited to see that most of my redness/blemishes were gone!  NOTE: that is not to say that I still didn&#x27;t have a pimple here or there, but fixing your skin after years of failed products and bad make-up will often take a while.  Nonetheless, the reason I bought this product is because I have very dry skin that flakes and clogs my pores, and redness around my t-zone and nose area that constantly bother me.  My redness has virtually disappeared, and my t-zone isn&#x27;t showing any flakes like it usually does once I dry off my face after washing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is AWESOME -- and I highly suggest it.  Sure, it may be $30, but your gonna end up spending OVER $30 on trying new products every year, so you might as well just invest in a good product that actually works!  Plus, it is in powder form, so you are more conscious of how much you use -- and since it is so effective, you only need to use a little bit each time, so I&#x27;m guessing this is going to last me quite a while (i&#x27;d say atleast 4 months)</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time and love it; it&#x27;s gentle yet feels very effective; I like having a product that is safe to use daily. I use it with my clarsonic brush!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant for years now but have always purchased directly from Dermalogica. I ordered over Amazon for the better price, but the product seems different from my past purchases. It was in a sealed box and the sticker and the print matched exactly, but the powder wasn&#x27;t as gritty as the one purchased directly from Dermalogica. Since I had to open the box and try the microfoliant to find this out, I am out the $40. Sometimes it is better to purchase direct from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Good facial cleanser and will last you for 4 months</li>
            <li> This is a VERY gentle exfoliant for your skin. It left my skin feeling very smooth and firm, which it&#x27;d never felt like that. The only downside I experienced was that it made my skin shine (glowing, I guess?) about 10 times more than normal.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, love it, have already reordered</li>
            <li> Nice and gentle on the face, can be used daily.</li>
            <li> must have if you dont have it you r missing alot</li>
            <li> LOVE IT and all Dermalogica products!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It takes away my flaky, dry patches. I have smooth, soft skin after using it.</li>
            <li> Read rave review of this product in NY Times; tried it; loved it.  Use it only 2-3 times a week, but immediate results in smoother, clearer skin.  Have used now for about a year and consider it a must-have skin care product.</li>
            <li> I love this.  I&#x27;ve been having some problems with my skin lately and I&#x27;ve been trying to exfoliate a lot.  I&#x27;ve sampled quite a few exfoliators and one thing I like about this one is that it can be used daily.  And I *have* been using it daily.  It&#x27;s gentle enough for that, and it&#x27;s also quite effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just shake some out in your hand, rub your hands together with a bit of water, and then apply it to your face.  The little beads/particles do kind of dissolve/get foamy, and it takes a bit of practice to determine the right amount.  Don&#x27;t get it too wet before you put it on your face, though, or you&#x27;ll end up wasting some.  I just gently rub it around on my face in a circular motion, then rinse.  It&#x27;s not at all harsh and I am really seeing some fast results in terms of skin turnover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can see the full ingredients list in one of the product images (zoom in to read the tiny print).  This is a little pricier than I&#x27;d normally pay for a product, but I&#x27;ve been having such great results, and my sample container has lasted for at least two weeks already (so a little goes a long way), that I&#x27;m probably going to be picking this up again soon.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 2 years and absolutely happy with it. I use it for exfoliating just once a week and have seen results in the texture of my skin and intend to continue using for a long time.  Another great product from Dermalogica.</li>
            <li> I love their products. My face feels so clean and refreshed after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;It is great to have as a daily procedure. Your skin will feel so good after using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and it cleans without over drying.  the little microbeads (made from rice) really clean a days worth of makeup off completely without stripping/drying.  this entire line is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Great everyday use product. Has a light exfoliation and cleans skin well of makeup. It was recommended by an estetician and I love it.</li>
            <li> This stuff can cost upward of 80 bucks in my country. On my short visit to USA I was able to source it at the cheapest price with the most reliable and super fast and inexpensve shipping as well. I know the poduct well. Anyone who tries it is an immediate convert.</li>
            <li> Bought this product after reading about it in an article and then seeing the great reviews. Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference at first but after a few weeks, my skin was clearer, smoother, and more  \\&quot;glowy\\&quot;. I really noticed a difference when I stopped using it for a few days...my skin was just not as soft and smooth as before. Be patient and keep using this daily and you&#x27;ll be very pleased with the results!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product!!  It makes your skin feel so soft and smooth...definately recommend this to anyone!!  It may be a little pricey, but well worth it!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I have very dry sensitive skin. Most products for acne make me break out worse because they are too harsh for my skin. This product is gentle but effective at the same time. I have used it for about 2 weeks now and I see a big difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product! My skin feels clean after and soft.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. It has instant results.</li>
            <li> When I was using this weekly, on the day I used it, people always commented on how pretty my skin looked. Now in my 50&#x27;s I&#x27;ve developed some dark pigmentation on my cheeks (I think from sun damage) and have tried expensive treatments and lighteners without much change. Three weeks ago I started using this product every morning after cleansing, in the shower, just on my cheeks and the pigment has lightened. It&#x27;s quick and you don&#x27;t have to use much, so a container lasts a long time. When I wasn&#x27;t using it everyday, a container would last a year or more. I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It buffs off dead skin without harming your face and being too rough.  My face is soft and has a nice glow after using it.</li>
            <li> Fast and efficient delivery. I am already a fan/user of the Dermalogica microfoliant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product several years ago.  I started to try others to compare.  So far this is the best.  It&#x27;s gentle enough to use every day.  My skin feel very clean &amp; exfoliate after each time I use it.  I will continue to use this products.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a daily scrub that wasn&#x27;t going to be too harsh on my skin. The apricot scrub felt like it was doing more harm than good. A friend of mine turned me on to this product and now I use it every morning! I love it! If you feel like you&#x27;re looking a little dull and need something to freshen up your skin try this! Warning: You have to be consistent with it. If you don&#x27;t use it daily then you won&#x27;t notice much of a difference.</li>
            <li> Does an excellent job of cleaning!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product until I used it at a friend&#x27;s house. I then immediately purchased my own. I don&#x27;t normally like powder style scrubs, my aversion came from using &#x27;Japanese Washing Grains&#x27; by The Body Shop when I was a teenager, but this product gives you a fine scrub that leaves your skin very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product so far has lasted well but I don&#x27;t store it in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lost one point because it leaves my skin very shiny afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Dermalogica fan and this exfoliant is great. Mild enough for everyday use and my skin looks great - I have rather oily skin and this keeps it under control.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE it! This product as been amazing to my skin. It has cleared it up almost instantly. I use it daily and following the instructions to leave it on only 60 seconds. Delivery was fast and packaging was good.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff. Kinda pricey but works well if you are using a product with retinol and can&#x27;t scrub with a loofah. Doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin at all and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product daily for about a year and a half, and I just purchased my 3rd bottle in that time. Literally can&#x27;t go a day without it. Makes my skin feel smooth and soft, providing a nice even base (after moisturizer) for applying makeup. Does not irritate my blemish-prone skin, but helps keep my skin more clear. This was my first Dermalogica purchase, and it sold me on the brand. Now, all of my skincare products are Dermalogica. But this remains my favorite. It&#x27;d be a bit expensive for me to purchase in stores, but I have always found it on Amazon and saved a nice chunk of money.</li>
            <li> First of all, I have been using this product for a long time and used to love it.  This WAS the best exfoliator I had ever tried.  However, when I went to buy it this last time from a seller on Amazon, its not an exfoliator at all.  It just becomes a paste when its gets wet. It was nothing like what I have ordered in the past.  I don&#x27;t know if I got a fake product or Dermalogica changed it, but I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Love Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant.  Have used it for years.  40% Off is a good dealer and product is genuine.  Will order with them again.  5 stars !!!</li>
            <li> the product is very mild, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I have acne occasionally and my face is smooth and healthy looking after every use, I&#x27;m expecting better results for a long term use.</li>
            <li> This product is effective yet gentle on my skin. I love that it doesn&#x27;t have any perfume or color and that it super easy to use.  My skin feels clean and new after each use.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily I love how it exfoliates without drying out my skin</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Keeps your skin soft and blemish free, also goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I don&#x27;t even use it everyday. I also use Pure Vitamin C+ anti-aging night cream, and with both of these my skin started looking better in a week. I really like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month or so and I have noticed a real difference in my skin.  Actually, I noy a result from the very first use but over time it just gets better.  The most interesting thing is that my clients have noticed a difference too.  My skin is smoother and the fine lines are gone...  Seriously GONE!&lt;br /&gt;The product is a powder and you add water to your hands to create a lather.  Be sure to get not just your face but your neck too.  If you miss a spot you will notice it very soon...  I missed the middle bottom of my neck and the skin was rough and a little scaly.  I simply used the product for a couple of days and problem resolved.  If you have sensitive skin this is perfect for you, it is completely non-abrasive.&lt;br /&gt;I will now be using this nearly every day as part of my skin regime.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It can be used daily and it exfoliates while cleansing. Your skin feels soft and refreshed after using.</li>
            <li> I know this was recommended by the local spa after a facial, but for me it just did not work.  There are so many other products at our local drug store that carry a much more sensitive line.</li>
            <li> I still have the bottle.  I use twice a week mixing with a creamy cleanser.  I use a fourth of the recommended amount.  It is a powdery pasty bit but does the trick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this gentle exfoliant for years now, and it is effective for my sensitive skin.  If I scrub too hard, I have a red face for hours, so I have to be gentle, and with this product, I end up with a nice, smooth face.</li>
            <li> A very good finish after skin wash.  It seems to even out the skin tones, it isn&#x27;t harsh and doesn&#x27;t cause redness.  A little bit goes a very long way.  Economical.</li>
            <li> Great product, exfoliates gently without over drying or inflaming my skin. Since I am battling severe dryness in the winter months, this product does the trick , taking dead skin off without over drying the healthy skin.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years. Great and gentle product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! A bit pricey but my face always feels great after using it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff!  When I bought it, I was turned off by the fact that it was in powder form but I realize that this is what makes it such a mild product. I love the way that it smells and feels against my skin! If you are struggling with acne as I am, you will need something to go along with this product as I still notice that breakouts due to my oily skin.  Bottom line is when you use this stuff, you feel like you&#x27;re doing something good for your skin. I&#x27;m going to try their other products as well.</li>
            <li> This is simply the best Exfoliator product. After doing a lot of outdoor activities, my face felt sticky and oily, I washed my face with this microfoliant and I felt huuuge different. My face feels very smooth and so clean! It opens up the clogged pores to reduce acne and it cleans well all the blackheads around you nose. Very happy with this.</li>
            <li> I use it daily it works beautifully with the right cleanser and depends on your skin type.</li>
            <li> Really great product. I had cosmetologist procedure scheduled and after using this product for a week I feel like I have no need to visit cosmetologist any time soon. Highly recommend for oily skin.</li>
            <li> I love this exfoliating powder that turns into a paste when you add a few drops of water. It is effective, but gentle enough to use daily, even with my dry skin.  The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it is a bit pricey for an exfoliator.</li>
            <li> The biggest difference between enzyme based exfoliation and granular exfoliation. It is much more gentile on the skin! I highly recommend for any type of skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best scrub I have ever used. My skin just feels wonderful when I use this - I sure hope this product doesn&#x27;t go away. I would be crushed... My husband has bad actinic keratosis (sun damage) on his scalp and has started using it (3-2015). He really likes the the product.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years, MUCH cheaper than the spa!  Course powder added to a little water in your palm mixes into a &#x27;paste&#x27; and gently exfoliates your skin.  Gentle enough for every day use.  When I get a facial and they ask what I use, they always tell me that (even if their spa doesn&#x27;t use it) Dermalogica is the best and usually are the products that they used while they were in school.  Don&#x27;t use any other brand and my skin looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> This is such a reliable exfoliant, I can&#x27;t live with out it. I have used it for 4 years once a day, sometimes twice in the summer. I am 64 and every one who I recommend Dermalogica, gets hooked on it as well. I don&#x27;t need makeup. This product is able to carefully remove the accumulation of dead cells on ones skin and reveals the new bright and clear skin ready to absorb the cream of your choice. Use on the face, neck and decollete. Hands and elbows too! Use it faithfully and see surface spots disappear as well. Saves you from using extra cream and makes your skin look healthy. Your expensive cream will do no good to your skin if you are wearing 10 layers of dead cells!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! I love using this on my face</li>
            <li> I first tried this when it came in a Birchbox. I still keep the sample bottle around for travel. It&#x27;s something I like to have around that much. I have pretty normal skin, I have pretty rare breakouts every few months, but they clear up quickly. I live in the desert, and that keeps my skin on the drier side, especially in winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use the microfoliant about twice a week, but it keeps my skin feeling clean, soft, and smooth. It&#x27;s a very fine grain powder and you only need a tiny bit (I use about the size of a dime on my face). The powder almost feels silky feeling. It gets rid of rough patches right away and isn&#x27;t too harsh or drying. I can use my regular moisturizer with this, and my face looks and feels really nice! There is really no fragrance with this product, it&#x27;s nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price does seem steep, however, this stuff lasts a long time. I have had my bottle for over a year, and still have no regrets with my purchase. This is my go to exfoliator.</li>
            <li> Dermologica Daily Microfoliant love this product, clearer pores and improved texture after one use, highly recommend the entire product line!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to find this on amazon. These are super expensive at a regular retail store. Works great, I ise it twice a week and my facial skin has been smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dry powder and mixes water well to make light paste.  Scrubs without over drying your skin and makes skin feels soft.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy, as I planned to use the product in the shower, and it is a powder. Despite some initial dispensing mishaps on my part, I have had no issues using this in the shower, and it is amazing stuff.  Exfoliates well without over drying.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have used dermalogica Daily Microfoliant for many years and have been so pleased with the results.  I no longer get blackheads or little white bumps on my skin.  My skin has both oily and dry patches:  this product treats both areas successfully and without irritation.</li>
            <li> FIRST TIME INTRODUCED WAS AT THE SPA... AND LOVED THE DERMALOGICA LINE ... IT FEELS LIKE A MINI SPA TREAT EVERY DAY... I USE THIS ONCE A WEEK.. WILL LAST A LONG TIME SINCE NOT MUCH IS NEEDED.. WORKS GREAT</li>
            <li> Cant go wrong with this !</li>
            <li> This gentle exfoliant has been a treasure for my sensitive skin. I got so many compliments because of the smoothness it leaves, I practically glow! I&#x27;m African American and most products out there for skin and hair are harsh, so when an esthetician suggested it, I tried it and loved the results. The only downside is the ACTUAL amount of product in the bottle; there must be an anti-humidity absorbent inside that makes you think there is a lot more, but it&#x27;s empty. A little of this goes a looong way. The Esthi also suggested leaving it on like a mask for 5-8 minutes, once a month, and it does a more thorough breakdown of dead cells.</li>
            <li> Definitely exfoliates.  Since it comes in powder form and you have to mix it with water, it is hard to get a good consistency.  This product will over exfoliate quickly so if you have sensitive skin be careful.  Product has no smell which is a good thing.  I</li>
            <li> After 3 surgeries in 6 weeks my skin had had it. Dermalogica has helped renew it. The change has been awesome! So glad I found it.</li>
            <li> This is a great exfoliator.  These tiny rice grains of rice gently scrub off dead skin and does so in a gentle way.  This exfoliator is to be added with other products or used alone.  You can sprinkle a little into your daily cleanser and do this all in one step.  I find if I use this alone you have to work it over your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about this is that doesn&#x27;t contain fragrance, or what seems to be a lot of extra and unnecessary extras.  Every time I use this exfoliant my skin feels soft and smooth when I am done.  A little goes a long way, and it take a long time before this runs out.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It makes my face silky smooth and my make-up goes on beautifully.  I have very sensitive skin and this product does not irritate it at all.  There are very few skin products that I can say that about.</li>
            <li> I am 45 years old with oily skin. I began using this product in hopes it would help smooth out my skin, control my oil and make my skin look healthier and fresh.  It does all of that!</li>
            <li> Amazing exfoliant for sensitive skin.  It&#x27;s odd at first....a fine powder that you add water to and gently wash your face, then rinse.  I use it most often in the shower, ideal for decollate and face.  It&#x27;s made for everyday use, but I limit it to 3x a week depending on my skin.  I&#x27;ve never seen another product quite like it and been using it for years.</li>
            <li> To me this is an essential item for my daily beauty regime, which to be honest is very minimal. It&#x27;s such a great exfoliant, not too big so won&#x27;t stretch your pores and this size lasts me usually a year. So great purchase. Love it</li>
            <li> This product completely met my expectations. I first learned about this product during a facial. The aesthetician said it is an easy way to clean your face in the morning. She and even her husband use it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this gentle exfoliant in the mornings for several weeks now and my skin feels clean but not dry. The 2.6 oz package will last you for months because you only need to use a little bit every day.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a good deal and has lasted me well over a year! You just pour a little bit onto your palm and gently smooth it on your face. It&#x27;s not a harsh scrub which makes it gentle enough for everyday use. Good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Arrived in NY a couple of days after placing the order on standard shipping. Great daily exfoliant, for soft, healthy looking skin! My mom loves this product, so I went on Amazon looking for a cheaper option than the official website itself. Product was in good condition. She uses it daily, and so far has not had any skin problems. So if u have already used this product, rest assured that getting it cheaper here, you are not getting a faulty product.</li>
            <li> The only exfoliant I use. Love this. DON&#x27;T accidentally get water into this container- keep it out of your shower!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been enjoying Dermalogica products for a while now. I use their pre cleanser, cleanser and moisturizer. Having acne-prone combination oily skin, I was still slightly breaking out and my acne scars weren&#x27;t fading very well. I&#x27;ve heard about the daily microfoliant for a while now and finally decided to try it. It&#x27;s been two weeks and seriously, it&#x27;s amazing!!! Not only is my skin brighter and more even toned, I&#x27;ve noticed I haven&#x27;t had one zit for a week and a half now (which for me is a miracle). I&#x27;m hoping with another two weeks, my acne scars will have faded completely, however I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased and will definitely repurchase. I also received it from amazon probably 2 days after ordering which is great. Try it!!!</li>
            <li> Came on time, Exactly what i have expected from the product, and a realy good price, with short supply time. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is a great microfoliant.  It&#x27;s very gentle and turns into a paste that doesn&#x27;t feel gritty yet it still exfoliates my skin well without any irritation and I have very sensitive skin!  It rinses off well and my skin feels soft and smooth.  I use it at least once a week without issue and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> have been purchasing this product from a local beauty supply for 20% more for the last 4 years. A container lasts about 10 months if you use it once a day and the quality of my skin is so improved, they could charge half again as much and I would scrape together the money to get it. The discounted cost on Amazon is irresistible but if it runs out here, I will go back to my local shop and pay the higher price if necessary. This is the crack of skin care products. You won&#x27;t be able to stand your life without it.</li>
            <li> This brand is amazing and have used it for so long.</li>
            <li> I broke out each and every time I used it. My friend swears by it though</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like scrubs even though we are told that we have to use it. This product makes me feel good about exfoliating. The end.</li>
            <li> This is the best! My dermatologist&#x27;s assistant used this on my sensitive skin several years ago, and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since. A little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t be put off by the price. The powder is very fine - not at all harsh or granular like most exfoliants, but it does the job very well. I pour a small amount into one hand, add water, a little at a time, then rub the resulting &#x27;paste&#x27; onto my face.  I add more water and continue rubbing gently, then rinse it all off.  My skin feels softer, cleaner and smoother - I&#x27;ve never experienced redness or irritation. When I use this in the morning, before moisturizing and putting on make-up, I can literally see the difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years now and I love the results. My skin is cleaner and brighter and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years long before I went on Amazon.  Buying it at a lower price just makes me love it more!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It&#x27;s great for guys.  I especially like it on the days I shave.  Using it before shaving gives you a really clean/close shave.  You only need a little of the power in your hands , it goes a long way.  Would not be without this stuff.  I use in conjunction with the Dermal Clay Cleanser and the Age Smart Resurfacing Cleanser.  Amazon is hands down the cheapest to get all Dermalogica products.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from a spa first, and instantly fell in love with it - it was truly a microfoliant, basically dissolved and lathered when you scrubbed it in your hands so once you washed your face it was smooth and creamy.  Always looking for a better deal, I bought my second bottle from amazon - the product I received from Amazon turns into more of a gritty paste when I use it, and it just plain doesn&#x27;t make my face feel clean.  From now on I&#x27;ll be buying the real deal!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff so much, dermalogica products are the best! I use at night to get the crud off and wake up with smooth skin in the morning, that&#x27;s not greasy. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Light not harsh on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive up front but it lasts for close to a year! I just took some in a travel case on a camping trip. Will always do that from noe on. It&#x27;s lighter and less sloppy than liquid facial soap. My face is smooth as can be!</li>
            <li> One oft favorite exfoliating products. It leaves skin feeling soft and looking refreshed!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for +10 years and I continue to use it for my face. It works amazing and i don&#x27;t think i can ever change into a different product! love love love</li>
            <li> this stuff is awesome.. .the little micro balls are actually balls unlike other products, making it awesome for your pores.. i love it! and havent found another microfoliant that is as gentile or works as great as this!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! My face feels soft &amp; clean after using it. I recommend this as a part of your daily facial cleansing.</li>
            <li> This microfoliant is very nice.  It doesn&#x27;t have any strange smells, I can use it often and my face is left feeling clean and certainly smoother.  I wish it could be cheaper but I expected this price as it is Dermalogica.  My complaint to users out there is make sure you do not scrub too hard or you&#x27;ll end up with some dry and pealing patches on your skin.  Also - based on a past experience with a bottle of this -  be sure to not get water near the opening, especially if you are opening the bottle while wet in the shower.  If water gets into it, it will cause the product to stick and develop a thick film over time, essentially ruining the rest of the contents.</li>
            <li> Make sure you read the ingredients list.  This product contains several highly allergenic ingredients!  Hydrolyzed wheat protein tops the list, but the rest of them aren&#x27;t that friendly either.  Instead of the beautiful, glowing skin I was dreaming of, I got a rash and a burning sensation that lasted for two days.</li>
            <li> I tried a sample and loved it and was happy to find at this price. It is very gentle, but you may ecperimce some redness the first few days. Quickly shipped.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin that gets dry and flaky, especially in cold weather.  I normally use more gritty product to exfoliate, and of course my face is always red and inflamed looking afterward.  I assumed it was the price I had to pay to make my skin look presentable.  It was a little weird because this product is in powder form and has to be moistened and then applied.  My first thought was that it wasn&#x27;t gritty enough and I had just wasted my money, but I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong..  As soon as I rinsed it off and saw and felt my skin, I was pleasantly surprised.  It was baby soft and glowing with not a red, irritated spot in sight.  It&#x27;s gentle, yet powerful.  I have now ordered more of the Dermalogica line and am anxious to try them out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d used ProActiv&#x27;s cleanser for years. This is a more luxurious alternative. I love the inclusion of oatmeal. I think you can feel that and the green tea in there. Also, I apprecate that it&#x27;s a powder since you add water and thereby get more product for your dough. Yay.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews about this product, and was excited to buy since I really like Dermalogica products, but....I dont feel that this really works for me. I&#x27;ve used it to exfoliate as the reviews say, but all it does is turn into a paste and I still have dry skin on my face. I really had high hopes for this, but I&#x27;ve had it since last fall and still have a full bottle.</li>
            <li> Gental but effective! Makes skin glow and stay smooth, especially great for dry winter months in Utah. I use this with their Special Cleansing Gel and Skin Smoothing Cream.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this product by my granddaughter who has a license in cosmetology.  I was looking for something to help remove the brown spots on my face from sun damage.  she said this is a great exfoliant and with use could lighten the spots.  It hasn&#x27;t &#x27;yet&#x27;, but it does make my face feel very clean after use and perhaps with daily use in a few weeks I might see a change.  If so, I will edit this review to a nicer outcome.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I ordered this product on Amazon and it did not seem the same as usual.  The powder dissolved into a paste more quickly and it didn&#x27;t exfoliate as well for me.  My husband and I both use this product and immediately noticed the difference.  I really like the cheaper price on Amazon, but I will order from the Dermalogica website from now on.  Maybe it was just a fluke with my particular order, but I&#x27;m not going to chance it because I normally LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt or looked so good. I recommend this product to everyone. It evens the skin tone and leave the face feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I have only been recently introduced to this product and now could not live without it.  It leaves the skin feeling soft but does not dry out the skin like other exfoliants.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It works well and is gentle on sensitive skin.  Leave on for 5 mins for extra exfoliation.</li>
