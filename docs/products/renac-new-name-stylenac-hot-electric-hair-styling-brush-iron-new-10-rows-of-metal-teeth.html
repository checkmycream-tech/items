            <li>I am very excited about finding it on amazon...found it by accident</li>
            <li>When I first started using them the product held up good</li>
            <li>Is a wonderful tool when used with extreme care.</li>
            <li>The teeth on it makes it easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Because itmheatsmall around and the prongs also heat it curls your hair so easily.  </li>
            <li>I did not like the new update to a product that I loved before the improvements.  </li>
            <li>I have used the renac hot comb for more than 20 years and have liked it very much.  </li>
            <li>This one heats like a cheap curling iron in the discount stores.  </li>

            <li>I hope this product remains available as I will be lost without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most curling irons have plastic teeth and don&#x27;t get real hot or stay hot</li>
            <li>(Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply was where I originally got it)and by the time I needed another, I didn&#x27;t know the brand name.  </li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t work like original Renac.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m very pleased with the replacement curling brush.  </li>
            <li>I have short hair and this is the most effective curling iron, I have ever used.</li>
            <li>You have shown your true colors.</li>
            <li>but now I&#x27;m lucky to get 6 months.  </li>
            <li>I can hold it on my hair for 5 minutes and it barely gets warm.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; do get very hot</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get as hot!  </li>
            <li>With it you can create a smooth straight look or a curly style.  </li>
            <li>It works like a charm and is worth its weight in gold.</li>
            <li>The bristles heat up for faster curling and the curls are more natural than \\&quot;formed\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>This product is the only one that I really liked that was in the curling iron category.  </li>
            <li>I used to make one last a good 2-3 years and now if I get a year out of one I am lucky - the new one I have</li>
            <li>They do burn out pretty quick.</li>
            <li>I liked the old one because it was hot and would curl my hair fast.  </li>
            <li>Because I loved my Renac so much, I took a chance and ordered the Stylenac replacement, realizing many long-time users like myself were not pleased.  </li>
            <li>When my last one quit, after 10 years, I was afraid I would not be able to get this wonderful product any more.  </li>

            <li>It is so hot you can even hold it in your hair to use it</li>

            <li>I have been only using this curling iron for over 20 years as my hair is fine</li>
            <li>It does get too hot on high settings.</li>
            <li>This iron works well and does not burn my hair as straight irons do.  </li>
            <li>Thanks again Amazon for carrying this product.</li>
            <li>Very well made.  </li>
            <li>It does what we want at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I think if a product is new and barely used it should be free to send it in for repair or replacement.</li>
            <li>I mean super-hot and for me, that&#x27;s a good thing.  </li>
            <li>Its great......I like it better than other styling brushes because it gets hotter than any others I have used.  </li>
            <li>My first one was purchased when I was about 19 or 20 years old.  </li>
            <li>This is ashame b/c this product would sell in bigger Beauty Supply store chains if product was made more reliable especially for the cost.</li>
            <li>The HOT setting and short hair just doesnt work as the iron bristles get extremely hot and you will either burn your fingers and hair or both while trying to wrap hair around barrel.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>so this did take a little more awareness on my part as the teeth also heat on this brush.  </li>
            <li>What an incredible disappointment.</li>
            <li>I prefer it because the teeth get hotter than a normal curling iron.</li>
            <li>* \\&quot;New 10 Rows Of Metal Teeth\\&quot;]]  </li>
            <li>Time to start shopping for a new brand.</li>
            <li>I hope I can come across a new one sometime soon.</li>
            <li>B0001ZI0W4 Renac ( New Name Stylenac )</li>
            <li>and it gives my hair a very natural look.  </li>
            <li>This new product, the Stylenac, does not seem to heat up as hot as the prior product.</li>
            <li>The brush was hot enough.  </li>
            <li>The new brush looks like the old Renac brush and that is where the comparison ends.  </li>
            <li>This frequently heralds a change in the product.  </li>
            <li>It  is a slightly different color and does not seem to heat up quite as fast.  </li>
            <li>The teeth of the barrell do not grab the hair as it should and the swivel cord is posoitional as far as keeping the product turned</li>
            <li>They have about 50-60% heat as the old style.</li>
            <li>I used the old syle Renac brush for over 25 years as did 4 members of my family.  </li>
            <li>This brush is junk compared to the old.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint, I&#x27;m not fond of pink, so I preferred the original orange color :)</li>
            <li>Not really sure why this can&#x27;t be fixed, surely the same type of cord could be used that are used on telephone cords.  </li>
            <li>You do have to be careful in its use as it does get very hot, but there are various temp settings to choose from.</li>
            <li>I ordered two of the new style not realizing they are not the same brush anymore.</li>
            <li>I buy no other brand.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure though if it is an actual defect or it is really cheap.</li>
            <li>prongs are not the same as the old models  </li>
            <li>I prefer the \\&quot;original\\&quot; Renac, which apparently I cannot order anymore.  </li>
            <li>I used one in highschool for several years until it broke and my Dad (who is an electrician fixed it</li>
            <li>This was so not worth the money, it did not heat up all that hot</li>
            <li>Several reviewers said that it got really hot that you had to be careful not to burn your head.  </li>
            <li>The only curling iron that works with my fine, thick hair.  </li>
            <li>The new brush heats up less than half as hot as the old stlye.  </li>
            <li>I am having to pay $12.00 to send in a new product that is less than a month old.</li>

            <li> The new brush looks like the old Renac brush and that is where the comparison ends.  </li>
            <li> This frequently heralds a change in the product.  </li>
            <li> It  is a slightly different color and does not seem to heat up quite as fast.  </li>
            <li> The teeth of the barrell do not grab the hair as it should and the swivel cord is posoitional as far as keeping the product turned</li>
            <li> They have about 50-60% heat as the old style.</li>
            <li> I used the old syle Renac brush for over 25 years as did 4 members of my family.  </li>
            <li> This brush is junk compared to the old.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint, I&#x27;m not fond of pink, so I preferred the original orange color :)</li>
            <li> Not really sure why this can&#x27;t be fixed, surely the same type of cord could be used that are used on telephone cords.  </li>
            <li> You do have to be careful in its use as it does get very hot, but there are various temp settings to choose from.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of the new style not realizing they are not the same brush anymore.</li>
            <li> I buy no other brand.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure though if it is an actual defect or it is really cheap.</li>
            <li> prongs are not the same as the old models  </li>
            <li> I prefer the \\&quot;original\\&quot; Renac, which apparently I cannot order anymore.  </li>
            <li> I used one in highschool for several years until it broke and my Dad (who is an electrician fixed it</li>
            <li> This was so not worth the money, it did not heat up all that hot</li>
            <li> Several reviewers said that it got really hot that you had to be careful not to burn your head.  </li>
            <li> The only curling iron that works with my fine, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> The new brush heats up less than half as hot as the old stlye.  </li>
            <li> I am having to pay $12.00 to send in a new product that is less than a month old.</li>
            <li> When I first starting using it I could get at least 3 years out of it</li>
            <li> If these last as long as the last one I had, They should outlive me.</li>
            <li> I have used this Hot Styling Brush Iron for at least 25 years.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit fragile and I have  sometimes dropped it after getting tangled in the long cord.  </li>
            <li> Some of them can be tightened back up but come loose again.</li>
            <li> I usually end up taping it to the high position.  </li>
            <li> As another person reviewed, it will burn your head, so you need at least 3-4 inches of hair to really appreciate it.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed Amazon offered one after my long search.  </li>
            <li> My curling brush at home took a long time to heat up and never seemed to hold the style as well.  </li>
            <li> but this one came in Pink (like picture above) but</li>
            <li> The screws don&#x27;t stay tight and are not long enough.  </li>
            <li> This last one the screws came loose only after a couple of weeks and the black plastic tip unscrewed and fell off after about 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> I purchased one last August and in less than 1 year had to purchase another one.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful and not set it down on your head, just like you would a regular curling iron.</li>
            <li> be careful when using there is no protection from the brush and your scalp.</li>
            <li> Not a high quality product!  </li>
            <li> so you must be careful when using the Stylenac.&lt;br /&gt;Phyllis Sunshine</li>
            <li> It is the only electric curling brush that will heat up enough to curl my thick hair.  </li>
            <li> She always had REAL thick hair and this gets sooo hot</li>
            <li> I was never talented enough to use this thing without burning myself somehow but proper training is all you need.</li>
            <li> It was changed to stylenac, which I was not aware of when I ordered.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other brands when I didn&#x27;t want to take the time to locate this item, and nothing comes close to holding a candle to Renac.</li>
            <li> they are sharp and catch on the hair  my wife has been using these for years</li>
            <li> All of the screws come loose after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> I tightened all screws as soon as I received the product since several reviewers had complained about it falling about.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this for a friend who had previously used a Renac Styling Brush Iron.</li>
            <li> , it was just like your typical Con Air brush at Walmart for $20.</li>
            <li> The black tip often wobbles.  </li>
            <li> It is a little pricey,</li>
            <li> What a shame someone had to \\&quot;dumb it down\\&quot; in order to make a bigger profit.</li>
            <li> I just find it very hard to use a regular curling iron</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> and it lasted another couple of everyday use.  </li>
            <li> same old craftmenship :( .  </li>
            <li> I  am only disappointed with the craftmenship as they are constantly coming apart.  </li>
            <li> My hair is gray and hard to manage so the  heat helps me style it.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for at least 25 years and it&#x27;s not made as well as it used to be.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to see that the company has been sold to some other entity.  </li>
            <li> Some curling irons will not work for my very thick hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just a little disappointed.  </li>
            <li> The cord on the styling brush get twisted</li>
            <li> But its not going well :(  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I could not find a retail store that still sold them, so I resorted to the internet.</li>

            <li> [[ASIN:B0001ZI0W4 Renac Hot Electric Hair Styling Brush Iron * \\&quot;New 10 Rows Of Metal Teeth\\&quot;]]  Every woman should have one or two of these.  I have used this Hot Styling Brush Iron for at least 25 years.  When my last one quit, after 10 years, I was afraid I would not be able to get this wonderful product any more.  However, I was so delighted when I found a supplier, that I ordered three.  If these last as long as the last one I had, They should outlive me.</li>
            <li> Love this electric curling brush.  Have gone through 3 of them and having difficulty finding it again.</li>
            <li> I have been a hairdresser for 40 years and have used this product for alot of those years and still do. I buy 2 at a time in case something should happen to one.  And keep one in an overnight bag for trips. All the teeth are heated which gives you a nice uniform curl. Just be careful and not set it down on your head, just like you would a regular curling iron. I can&#x27;t say enough about this iron it is wonderful. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Several reviewers said that it got really hot that you had to be careful not to burn your head.  It is so hot you can even hold it in your hair to use it you burn your hands!</li>
            <li> I have used the renac hot comb for more than 20 years and have liked it very much.  It is a bit fragile and I have  sometimes dropped it after getting tangled in the long cord.  This then has compromised the function of the  comb.  When that happened, I just ordered another one and paid the price.  I am sorry to see that the company has been sold to some other entity.  This frequently heralds a change in the product.  I am hoping that will not be the case.  It  is a slightly different color and does not seem to heat up quite as fast.  I will hope for the best.  If it does not  measure up, I will be looking for something else.</li>
            <li> I have used and love my renac for years - the new ones don&#x27;t seem to heat and hold up as well as the old ones - I used to make one last a good 2-3 years and now if I get a year out of one I am lucky - the new one I have is already not heating properly.</li>
            <li> I have used the Renac for many years and was completely happy and dependent on it.  This new product, the Stylenac, does not seem to heat up as hot as the prior product. The specs read the same but I don&#x27;t think they are. It still works just okay but I definitely need the heat to style my hair.  I&#x27;m just a little disappointed.  Why do companies have to change an already good thing?  The new color is cool but I wouldn&#x27;t change it for the heat. Please return to the former product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 20 years and just now realized it is being marketed under a different manufacturer name.  I absolutely love this product.  It is the only electric curling brush that will heat up enough to curl my thick hair.  I am so thrilled I have found this curling brush again!!</li>
            <li> I have used the Renac for years and loved it.  I was no longer able to buy it at the beauty supply, so I ordered on line.  It was changed to stylenac, which I was not aware of when I ordered.  This looks like the same curling iron, except for the color, but it does not heat enough to curl my hair.  I can hold it on my hair for 5 minutes and it barely gets warm.  I liked the old one because it was hot and would curl my hair fast.  This one heats like a cheap curling iron in the discount stores.  The heating element is not the same.</li>
            <li> my favorite curling iron.  This is my 4th one!  It is a MUST have for women with short hair!!  I have 1 at home &amp; one in my gym bag</li>
            <li> I sent this product back!  My hair is fairly short &amp; the metal teeth burned my head.</li>
            <li> I am having to pay $12.00 to send in a new product that is less than a month old. Screw that holds it together came out. I tried to re insert the screw but won&#x27;t work. I think if a product is new and barely used it should be free to send it in for repair or replacement.</li>
            <li> This is the most indispensable haircare item I own.  It is well made, sturdy and dependable. I use it everyday.  With it you can create a smooth straight look or a curly style.  You do have to be careful in its use as it does get very hot, but there are various temp settings to choose from.</li>
            <li> I have used the Renac brush for over 20 years.  It gets hot...I mean super-hot and for me, that&#x27;s a good thing.  I have tried other brands when I didn&#x27;t want to take the time to locate this item, and nothing comes close to holding a candle to Renac.</li>
            <li> prongs are not the same as the old models  they are sharp and catch on the hair  my wife has been using these for years</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a replacement hot metal teeth comb curling iron for 15 years. I was amazed Amazon offered one after my long search.  This iron works well and does not burn my hair as straight irons do.  I am very pleased with this product and very happy it could be found on Amazon. It arrived as estimated in very good packaging the seller did great.  Thanks again Amazon for carrying this product.</li>
            <li> Love the Renac curling iron and the delivery and packaging was terrific. I&#x27;d buy from them again.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist uses this styling brush and I always have liked the way my hair looks when she uses it.  My curling brush at home took a long time to heat up and never seemed to hold the style as well.  This styling brush is much better.  I was used to only the rod heating up so this did take a little more awareness on my part as the teeth also heat on this brush.  I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product.  I purchased one last August and in less than 1 year had to purchase another one.  The cord on the styling brush get twisted and once you begin to untwist it, it starts to lose the connection and ultimately stops working.  Not really sure why this can&#x27;t be fixed, surely the same type of cord could be used that are used on telephone cords.  I prefer the \\&quot;original\\&quot; Renac, which apparently I cannot order anymore.  Please fix the cord and I am sure that once the one I have malfunctions, I will buy another one.</li>
            <li> I like the Renac curling iron.  This is my 3rd or 4th one.  The others were in an orange box with same company name and look just like this.  Most curling irons have plastic teeth and don&#x27;t get real hot or stay hot but Renac has all metal comb/teeth and they get real hot and do an awesome job.  I  am only disappointed with the craftmenship as they are constantly coming apart.  The screws don&#x27;t stay tight and are not long enough.  My first one was purchased when I was about 19 or 20 years old.  My Dad kept putting it back together for me.  When that one finally aggrivated me enough ,I found and bought  another one and had the same problems.  Went online for next one; ordered, priced same as in prior store purchases and thought would be cheaper by now especially online, but not and use to it. Had to get another one but this one came in Pink (like picture above) but same old craftmenship :( .  This is ashame b/c this product would sell in bigger Beauty Supply store chains if product was made more reliable especially for the cost.</li>
            <li> It does get too hot on high settings. Bought as a birthday gift for my mom, who likes her hair short. She can&#x27;t use it when she just had it cut because it burns her sculpt, but after her hair grows back out a bit she can use it fine.</li>
            <li> I did not like the new update to a product that I loved before the improvements.  The teeth of the barrell do not grab the hair as it should and the swivel cord is posoitional as far as keeping the product turned on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not like the improved product and would hope that the company could go back to the way it was before.</li>
            <li> mom&#x27;s favorite. got for her. I use hot rollers. She always had REAL thick hair and this gets sooo hot it&#x27;s like a chi - curling iron. be careful when using there is no protection from the brush and your scalp. yikes! I was never talented enough to use this thing without burning myself somehow but proper training is all you need. good luck.</li>
            <li> The only curling iron that works with my fine, thick hair.  I&#x27;ve used this product for over 30 years (and worn out several during that time!)</li>
            <li> I LOVE my Renac but wished the barrel was smaller.  It works like a charm and is worth its weight in gold.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve made this curling iron for at least 20 years. I used one in highschool for several years until it broke and my Dad (who is an electrician fixed it and it lasted another couple of everyday use.  I couldn&#x27;t find another one (Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply was where I originally got it)and by the time I needed another, I didn&#x27;t know the brand name.  I am very excited about finding it on amazon...found it by accident and I will be ordering another.  The bristles heat up for faster curling and the curls are more natural than \\&quot;formed\\&quot;.  As another person reviewed, it will burn your head, so you need at least 3-4 inches of hair to really appreciate it.  Very well made.  Thank you Cache!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Durable BUT I would recommend anyone using it with short hair to use it on LOW setting.  The HOT setting and short hair just doesnt work as the iron bristles get extremely hot and you will either burn your fingers and hair or both while trying to wrap hair around barrel.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for my hair, gets really hot and that is what I need to curl my hair. Some curling irons will not work for my very thick hair</li>
            <li> I have used the renac styling brush for years.  I ordered two of the new style not realizing they are not the same brush anymore. Both of them are junk.  They have about 50-60% heat as the old style. All of the screws come loose after a few uses.  Some of them can be tightened back up but come loose again. The company I used to get these from no longer carry them. They have been in business for over 75 years. Hmmmm.... after using these I can only guess why a reputable company won&#x27;t sell them anymore. Time to start shopping for a new brand.</li>
            <li> I have been using this particular curling brush for years and find that it is the best product for my hair.  I buy no other brand.  The metal brushes work far superior to the other plastic versions that are on the market.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a friend who had previously used a Renac Styling Brush Iron. She was very disappointed because it did not grip her hair. I have returned this item.</li>
            <li> I ordered one for me and one for my friend.  Have used it several times and she has used hers, also.</li>
            <li> Best curling iron ever!</li>
            <li> I still have one I&#x27;ve used since the mid 80&#x27;s. It looses it&#x27;s heat faster now but still works good. Is a wonderful tool when used with extreme care. I hope I can come across a new one sometime soon. just in case!</li>
            <li> Wonderful, I love this type of styling brush and can only find it in Renac.&lt;br /&gt;Have used this type product for years and would like the cord to be attached to the unit so it does not break in the connecting spot.  Thank you.  It is a little pricey,</li>
            <li> Used renac for years and years.  Each brush lasted 2-3 years each. this one wobbled as soon as it came&lt;br /&gt;out of the box and the screws came out within a week.  The brush was hot enough.  It seared my hand as it fell apart.  Shame on Renac for selling out to Chinese workmanship and lowering its quality while keeping the price the same. You have shown your true colors.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t work like original Renac.  It will not go through the hair and do what you want it to do.  Doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> I have used the Renac Styling Brush for 25 years.  It is the only one that I will ever use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Julie Davis&lt;br /&gt;Ponce Inlet, Florida</li>
            <li> This was so not worth the money, it did not heat up all that hot, it was just like your typical Con Air brush at Walmart for $20. I do not recommend buying this product- I am not sure though if it is an actual defect or it is really cheap. We will see how the return process is and I will let you know how it goes once I return.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 30 years and I think it is fabulous. The best curling brush ever made and easy to use. When I first started using them the product held up good and they were fabulous, But for the last couple of years they don&#x27;t. As soon as I purchase one it starts falling apart. The screws fall out and it goes off and on when you move the wires. This last one the screws came loose only after a couple of weeks and the black plastic tip unscrewed and fell off after about 4 weeks. The wire started going on and off about 3 weeks. I love it and cant use anything else. It works. But please fix the product !!!!! I just find it very hard to use a regular curling iron but I am trying to train myself so that maybe I can stop purchasing this one. But its not going well :(  PLEASE FIX THIS PRODUCT !!!!!! You have a great curling brush if you would just fix it.</li>
            <li> HAVE USED THIS CURLING IRON FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS. MY LAST IRON HAD THE ORANGE HANDLE AND IT LASTED FOR TWENTY YEARS.</li>
            <li> Its great......I like it better than other styling brushes because it gets hotter than any others I have used.  My hair is gray and hard to manage so the  heat helps me style it.</li>
            <li> I used the old syle Renac brush for over 25 years as did 4 members of my family.  We all agree we will never buy this brush again.  The new brush looks like the old Renac brush and that is where the comparison ends.  The new brush heats up less than half as hot as the old stlye.  The on/off switch does not slide smoothly.  This brush is junk compared to the old.  What an incredible disappointment.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0001ZI0W4 Renac ( New Name Stylenac ) Hot Electric Hair Styling Brush Iron * \\&quot;New 10 Rows Of Metal Teeth\\&quot;]]I was leary about purchasing the Renac replacement after using the original Renac curling brush for over 30 years.  Because I loved my Renac so much, I took a chance and ordered the Stylenac replacement, realizing many long-time users like myself were not pleased.  I tightened all screws as soon as I received the product since several reviewers had complained about it falling about.  So far I&#x27;m very pleased with the replacement curling brush.  My only complaint, I&#x27;m not fond of pink, so I preferred the original orange color :)</li>
            <li> I agree with the others who say it&#x27;s not like it used to be.  Doesn&#x27;t get as hot!  Not a high quality product!  The on/off push button has not worked on the last 2 I bought.  I usually end up taping it to the high position.  The black tip often wobbles.  What a shame someone had to \\&quot;dumb it down\\&quot; in order to make a bigger profit.</li>
            <li> This product is the only one that I really liked that was in the curling iron category.  The teeth on it makes it easy to use.  I was disappointed when I could not find a retail store that still sold them, so I resorted to the internet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what we always use. It does what we want at a reasonable price. They do burn out pretty quick.</li>
            <li> Over heats and does NOT have an auto shut off or multiple temps.  Tip melted and hair got over heated.</li>
            <li> I love how this device curls the hair almost effortlessly.  I have short hair and this is the most effective curling iron, I have ever used. The &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; do get very hot so you must be careful when using the Stylenac.&lt;br /&gt;Phyllis Sunshine</li>
            <li> Have had a Renac for years and have loved it.  So glad they are still making these. If you have curly hair this is the brush for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for at least 25 years and it&#x27;s not made as well as it used to be. When I first starting using it I could get at least 3 years out of it but now I&#x27;m lucky to get 6 months.  The cord doesn&#x27;t swivel properly and it causes the wiring to short out and the power goes on and off and the heating element doesn&#x27;t hold onto the heat.  I will continue to buy them, but I wish they could do something about the wiring in the cord.</li>
            <li> I have been only using this curling iron for over 20 years as my hair is fine and it gives my hair a very natural look.  I hope this product remains available as I will be lost without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good job! This item was purchased through Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this before , and then my mother wanted it.  She love it too.  Because itmheatsmall around and the prongs also heat it curls your hair so easily.  And the curl holds up for a couple days.</li>
            <li> I have used a Renac for about 20 years.  I prefer it because the teeth get hotter than a normal curling iron.</li>
