            <li>The product is excellent.</li>
            <li>The seller was great.  </li>
            <li>Great price on a great product.</li>
            <li>Good product but over-priced.</li>
            <li>Perfect and exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>Makes for a nice, relaxing bath...</li>
            <li>I use it with peppermint oil and find that I sleep better..</li>
            <li>I have severe Arthritis, Fibromyalgia, and other joint-muscle problems and Epsom salts with Lavender oil give me the greatest relief.</li>
            <li>There was a mix up with my order but they took care of it very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Large size is nice.</li>
            <li>My wife is using the epsom salts and baking soda for baths and she is marvelling at how relaxed and pain free she feels after doing them, so</li>
            <li>This is the best bargain for the price - My husband has some health issues and this really helped him get through a tough time of body aches and pains, it helped him to relax and sleep better at night.</li>
            <li>Good for feet after a long day.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described!</li>
            <li>Love the large size, easy open lid and included measuring cup.</li>
            <li>I love epsom salt and use it almost daily.  </li>
            <li>I buy this in a large tub because I mix it with water and put it on my flowering plants, palms and flowering trees.</li>
            <li>Straight forward epsom salt.</li>
            <li>This is good epsom salt, but it is the same one that Sam&#x27;s Club sells for about $10 less than offered here.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my wife- direct from sam&#x27;s club, and as another reviewer stated it was much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I place a high recomendation on the product, but very low on the value.</li>
            <li>I use this product daily, but I buy the same product locally for under eight dollars...at a certain club store.  </li>

            <li> I was forced to buy at much higher cost.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> At Sam&#x27;s it&#x27;s about six and a half dollars or so.</li>
            <li> Container is sturdy and even came with a little scoop with measurement lines.</li>
            <li> Definitely too expensive,  the difference in price is incomprehensible.</li>

            <li> Good product but over-priced. I use this product daily, but I buy the same product locally for under eight dollars...at a certain club store.  Definitely too expensive,  the difference in price is incomprehensible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s epsom salt. What else is there to say?</li>
            <li> Love the large size, easy open lid and included measuring cup.</li>
            <li> I think not good not bad product. I do not think I will buy it anymore but was not upset while had it.</li>
            <li> This is good epsom salt, but it is the same one that Sam&#x27;s Club sells for about $10 less than offered here. At Sam&#x27;s it&#x27;s about six and a half dollars or so.</li>
            <li> I love epsom salt and use it almost daily.  For bathing, and making bath bombs.  The seller was great.  There was a mix up with my order but they took care of it very quickly.  Would not hesitate to order from them again ever!&lt;br /&gt;For some use suggestions, check out;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> Great price on a great product. I buy this in a large tub because I mix it with water and put it on my flowering plants, palms and flowering trees. Works great!</li>
            <li> Makes for a nice, relaxing bath...I use it with peppermint oil and find that I sleep better..&lt;br /&gt;Great price...fast delivery...</li>
            <li> I bought this to fertilize my peppers and tomatoes.  It&#x27;s a lot of salt and I won&#x27;t run out for years and years.</li>
            <li> This is the best bargain for the price - My husband has some health issues and this really helped him get through a tough time of body aches and pains, it helped him to relax and sleep better at night.</li>
            <li> item as described, thanx</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my horses so we could soak their legs/feet. Large size is nice. Convenient. Straight forward epsom salt.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife- direct from sam&#x27;s club, and as another reviewer stated it was much cheaper. However, our Sams no longer has it, os I was forced to buy at much higher cost. I did discover that The Costco has a 12lb box for about 8 dollars cheaper than this. I also located an online seller that does bulk bags (50lbs) for around sixty cents/lb. just search epsom salts and check the sellers (cannot post the link). My wife is using the epsom salts and baking soda for baths and she is marvelling at how relaxed and pain free she feels after doing them, so I place a high recomendation on the product, but very low on the value. more people need to know about the benefits long forgotten on epsom salts, but but they should not be so expensive.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described! Container is sturdy and even came with a little scoop with measurement lines. Perfect and exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> I use this in baths and wraps to sooth aching muscles. Good for feet after a long day.</li>
            <li> I have severe Arthritis, Fibromyalgia, and other joint-muscle problems and Epsom salts with Lavender oil give me the greatest relief. There&#x27;s no worry about side effects like medications have. I will recommend this!</li>
            <li> The product is excellent. Exactly as expected. Will purchase again.</li>
