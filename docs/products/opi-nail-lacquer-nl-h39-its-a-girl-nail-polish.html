            <li>The perfect shear pink.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Great, arrived individually secured in bubble wrap to prevent any damage.  </li>

            <li>Quick delivery just in time for the party.</li>
            <li>Responsive and quick-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say the photo in the product pic is pretty accurate in color and smoothness</li>
            <li>I finally ordered my own, so now I always get what I want....</li>
            <li>a new color of OPI nail polish for me...was easily purchased Online and very reasonable in cost</li>
            <li>I love OPI nail polish &amp; was looking for a pretty light pink polish.</li>
            <li>So pretty.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Provided expedited shipping for my large order.</li>
            <li>Its a very light pink and works well for every day</li>
            <li>It also dries much quicker.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It lasts very well,too.</li>
            <li>I received my order fast and well packaged.</li>
            <li>The only downside it that the color fades quickly.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>this pink is more of an adult color than what the young girls are wearing.</li>
            <li>but this gives the equivalent smoothness and beautiful, subtle pink finish.</li>
            <li>you can see many small bubbles on your nails.</li>
            <li>The polish seemed old!</li>
            <li>Its not to light and not to dark.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty pink color!</li>
            <li>OPI is the best in almost all colors.&lt;br /&gt;Usually put on the base, then nail polish</li>
            <li>The texture is so smooth and so completely different from all of my other nail polishes.</li>
            <li>It takes a few coats because it is a very light pink.</li>
            <li>This is such a soft color!</li>
            <li>Especially with some clear glitter tapped on the tips.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s neutral enough to work in a professional setting.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re looking for a vibrant  pink, I&#x27;d pick this one.</li>

            <li> This is a great color if you want to stay in the nude family of colors - great on short nails.  Not too pink that it won&#x27;t work in a professional setting.  I will buy this color again.</li>
            <li> Great light polish and very shiny which make it even better. Shipping didn&#x27;t take long either. Good seller! Highly recommended</li>
            <li> GREAT!!!  So pretty.  Using it as favors for my baby girl&#x27;s baby girl shower.</li>
            <li> This is the best color... its so beautiful.</li>
            <li> What a great idea for a baby shower favor when we know a girl is on her way! ðŸ’…</li>
            <li> Used at a Baby Shower.  Were a big hit</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a soft pink that was on the shear side and this was the one. I will order thus color again. this pink is more of an adult color than what the young girls are wearing.</li>
            <li> OPI is the best. And this color is amazing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot brighter than shown. Nice summer color p</li>
            <li> It shines &amp; hardens like acrylic nails but gives me the nature feel of my own nails. The color is perfect for hot summer days.</li>
            <li> I HATE fake nails but this gives the equivalent smoothness and beautiful, subtle pink finish. The texture is so smooth and so completely different from all of my other nail polishes. It can be layered for more pigmentation. I&#x27;d say the photo in the product pic is pretty accurate in color and smoothness and I&#x27;d guess the nails in the pic had about two or three coats. It also dries much quicker.</li>
            <li> This bottle seems to be darker than my last bottle of It&#x27;s a girl.  For whatever reason.</li>
            <li> Love the color, one of my favorites. Especially with some clear glitter tapped on the tips.</li>
