            <li> Her hair turned into a knotted mess!  </li>
            <li> and it was not effective.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Leaves a wonderful feel and look to hair</li>
            <li> I love the way this smells and it makes my hair extremely soft. I use Mizani Relaxer and this compliments that relaxer quite well. A little bit goes a long way, so you definitely get your monies worth with this. Some people are turned off by having to pay shipping costs from the seller, but it is sometimes cheaper than trying to purchase the same thing from beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent on my hair. I am an African American, who choses to use a chemical relaxer (Mizani Brand) on my hair, and this product is fantastic in making sure all of the chemical is washed from my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended this product to family and friends.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for my hair at all.  I have very thick curly hair and it was not effective.</li>
            <li> This product smells DIVINE. My hubs loves when I get a butter blend relaxer because my hair smells yummy all week. To get the full effect of this system find a pro hairstylist trained in this system. This is not for a BOX PERM. I go to a mixed salon &amp; when the Caucasian stylists walk past the sink they always say how lovely this shampoo smells.</li>
            <li> Great neutralizing shampoo. Makes hair feel silky soft and smooth while washing chemicals out.&lt;br /&gt;Really aids to remove all chemicals from hair. Must follow up with a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Great economic size bottle. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> It says it has the color indicator in it...it&#x27;s not noticeable at all. But it does neutralize very efficiently. Normally I&#x27;ll spend a good hour washing &amp; rewashing my hair until it stops showing up pink with other neutralizers (I have long hair). With this: I&#x27;ll put it in, let it sit, rinse, then wash again with my neutralizer that does have the indication color. And my relaxer is pretty much neutralized, but I wash again just to be safe. This product really gets the job done efficiently.</li>
            <li> this is some good stuff, works well with the perm. I will recommend it for anyone perming at home or in shop</li>
            <li> Its wonderful for sensitive scalp, so far I&#x27;m enjoying.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. Works great with the relaxer.</li>
            <li> Much better than the isoplus neutralizing shampoo I buy at the beauty supply store. The Isoplus leaves your hair with that &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; feeling that strips your hair of its oils. This Mizani is the BUSINESS, although I stop using their perm because it is too strong for my hair it leaves my hair feeling unbelievably soft and it smells realllllly good!</li>
            <li> The Butter Blend Neutralizing shampoo is a nice compliment to the relaxed system.  I also use this at other times, if I have product buildup in my hair.  This is a huge bottle and is reasonably priced.  It makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> would recommend after using the relaxer butter blend. I lo e the color indicator letting you know if relaxer is still in hair</li>
            <li> I have have to give this product and it&#x27;s &amp;#34;partner in crime&amp;#34; a mixed review.  Both my child and I are of mixed race, myself,  &amp;#34;Heinz 57&amp;#34;, my child half  &amp;#34;Heinz 57&amp;#34; and 1/2 Ashkanazi.  When I used this on my hair, which is coarse and curly, it worked pretty well. I didn&#x27;t wan t it to be &amp;#34;bone straight&amp;#34; so I was fine with my results. When I used it on my daughter&#x27;s hair which is curly and soft, Oh My Goodness. I rinsed the relaxer out and shampooed with the Mizani shampoo and applied a conditioner......... Her hair turned into a knotted mess!  I mean the curls folded in on themselves and it was like one solid mass of hair!  Took me a solid week, no kidding a week to work through the curls, un-knot them a section at a time.  It was HORRIBLE!!!!  There were some areas that I simply couldn&#x27;t untangle and I had to cut the knots out!  Fortunately these sections were only a few,, four at most, so that my daughter only lost perhaps 2 inches of hair in thee areas. Needless to say I Will Not Be Using This Product On My Child&#x27;s Hair, nor on my own.  In conclusion,  2 stars for the  OK results on my hair,  - 99  for the DISASTROUS results on my child&#x27;s!  Very, Very, Very Unsatisfied!</li>
            <li> It smells like butter. Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I love this product line. I makes my hair soft but helps it to hold body and shine. Very good for detangling and is the best thing to used after applying the Mizani BB relaxer system. This shampoo and the conditioner that goes along with it smell great.</li>
            <li> Great neutralizer! It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair hard like other neutralizing shampoos. I use all mizani products for best results. You will have a beautiful end result.</li>
            <li> great product I have seen remarkable changes in my hair since beginning to use Mizani Products.  My hair is a silkier feeling and my relaxer is lasting longer.</li>
            <li> Great product. My hair felt so soft and manageable afterwards, and it soothed my scalp aches after relaxing.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works fine, I like it.</li>
            <li> If you live in a hard water area this is the product for you. Have you been perming your hair and no matter how much or how often you perm it just wont straighten your hair. Try using this shampoo and two weeks later getting a perm You will see a difference. This products adds back shine to ur hair because it rids ur strands of the calcium build up that causes your hair to go dull. It smells good and Its also a color coded neutralizing shampoo for after perms. This is a must in any hair regiment. If you are using products that contain mineral oil. you will love this</li>
            <li> I like this product very much, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  I recommend it highly and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> Mizani Butter Blend Balance Hair Neutralizing and Chelating Shampoo is the bomb!!! It works very well after relaxing your hair. The relaxer washes out easily and it leaves your hair soft and moisturized. I luv the smell. It smells like coconuts and honey. It dosn&#x27;t strip your hair like some other brands. It leaves the hair 100% clear of relaxer residue. It also takes the relaxer smell out of your hair immed. Its best to use the entire Butter Blend system all together when you are relaxing your hair. The results will be fantastic. Also, Make sure you wash your hair at least 2 to 3 times after relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for the best neutralizing shampoo that treats your hair like gold, this is the product for you. My search is done.</li>
            <li> Great scent and works really well.  I only use it when i relax my hair and it leaves my hair soft and smelling nice.</li>
            <li> This product is just what I was looking for. The price is right on Amazon!</li>
            <li> This neutralizing shampoo made my hair feel better than any I have ever used. I have very hard water where I live and when I used this my hair was so soft.</li>
            <li> Discovered the Mizani products recently and have used it twice now. I think it works very well with my hair type which is thick and curly. My hair is very soft and managable using the Mizani products. No complaints.</li>
