            <li>Well worth the price love this product</li>
            <li>Having read different articles on how best to gently treat it, I read about this product and thought I&#x27;d try it.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, has a fresh fruity scent and makeup applies easily over it.</li>

            <li>I am a huge fan of the complete Yurrku line.</li>

            <li>I didn&#x27;t care for this lotion it actually felt like cheap dollar store lotion</li>
            <li>The design of the bottle allow me to apply the cream on those dry spots easily and inconspicuously.  </li>
            <li>I will use it completely and see if things change.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had sensitive dry skin and as I&#x27;ve aged, darn it, it&#x27;s only gotten more so.</li>

            <li>I have tried many products over the past years to decrease the ever increasing lines in my neck and upper chest with no success.</li>
            <li>The packaging is exquisite, although I hate the thought of throwing away that beautiful box - it seems like such a waste of paper :-(.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Did not work for me. Tried two full bottles.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this cream. I&#x27;ve always had sensitive dry skin and as I&#x27;ve aged, darn it, it&#x27;s only gotten more so. Having read different articles on how best to gently treat it, I read about this product and thought I&#x27;d try it. Being skeptical, I first purchased the small &amp;#34;trial&amp;#34; size and let me tell you, it&#x27;s totally lived up to everything I read and then some! My skin feels like it did 20 years ago and it&#x27;s gotten rid of a couple of brown spots already! All this even before I purchased this larger size. I&#x27;ll never use anything else on my face!</li>
            <li> I bought this product primarily to try to fade my freckles and age spots.  It is a lovely product, smells wonderful, glides on easily.  I have been using it for a month and have not noticed any fading...</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  It is great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Fortunately my order of Kakadu Day Cream arrived just in time as I packed for a trip.  I had run out, and felt like I didn&#x27;t want to travel without the pump bottle because it is so convenient for flights and TSA rules allow this 1.7 oz size as a carry-on. I needed a remedy for the discomfort of skin dryness in-flight.  The design of the bottle allow me to apply the cream on those dry spots easily and inconspicuously.  My husband also likes it --he likes the non-greasy texture an subtle fresh scent.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works, I have been trying everything that comes out for brown spots for years.    I cannot tell you how good this stuff really works, wish I would have taken pictures.    I like to reasearch to save myself money....Kakadu is a huge dose of vit C, it is the same ingredient a Dr. in Bevery Hills is selling in a cream.  He is charging hundreds of dollars. I know for me $ 48.00 is a lot of money, but because I did my research I thought I would give it a try.   I will never be without it again. I even put it on auto delivery because soon it will be in short supply..</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this lotion it actually felt like cheap dollar store lotion I will not use it again.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> What a great new product. A little goes a long way, goes on smoothly, not greasy and feels very light on my skin, even reduces the dark spots on my face.

The price is very fair and economical compared to other similar moisturizers and when I researched the Kakadu Plum found that it is a super fruit full of vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;Love the pump, easy to use without contaminating the ingredients and very easy to use the amount you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use the Yurrku Utopia Night Cream and highly recommend; can&#x27;t believe how soft and great my skin feels in the morning.</li>

            <li> Works well. Skin absorbent no smell</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised good product</li>
            <li> I have tried many products over the past years to decrease the ever increasing lines in my neck and upper chest with no success. These products have almost eliminated all visible lines.</li>

            <li> This product is supposed to diminish sun spots, but not sure if it does.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for awhile now.  I haven&#x27;t notice any of my brown spots fading and actually have one that has gotten darker.  I will use it completely and see if things change.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. It goes on smooth, has a fresh fruity scent and makeup applies easily over it. Great find.</li>
            <li> Moisturises wonderfully and evens tone. Only need tiny amount and can apply every other day</li>
            <li> Well worth the price love this product</li>
            <li> Thank you Australia!&lt;br /&gt;Yurrku Kakadu Day Cream is a great product! I am so incredibly thankful to find a facial care line that my skin loves. I am a huge fan of the complete Yurrku line. I have aging sensitive skin, travel, and I am outside in all kinds of weather. I have tried most all of the clean products in the natural marketplace and I can rarely use any of the facial care lines. Never mind the results, I am just trying to avoid skin issues!&lt;br /&gt;My skin loves Yurrku. And I am getting wonderful results! My skin over-all looks better and even my age spots are lightening. I had an odd looking “blemish” on my face for the last two years and it is healing.&lt;br /&gt;The Kakadu Day Cream gentle, smooth and moisturizing. My skin absorbs it well.&lt;br /&gt;After seeing my results, my family is now all trying Yurrku. They all have different skin types and Yurrku is working well for all.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works yet--been using it for two days. The smell is awful. The pump is not working correctly either.  It did arrive quickly.</li>
