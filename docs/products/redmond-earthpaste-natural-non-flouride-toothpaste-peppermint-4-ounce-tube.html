            <li>We love earthpaste!!!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t taste very good and we switched to Tom&#x27;s of Maine.</li>
            <li>Having ordered this elsewhere before, I was happy to see it on Amazon - the very best place to buy EVERYTHING.  </li>
            <li>Good consistency and taste also!</li>
            <li>and I loved it!</li>
            <li>And of course, the good feeling i get from using it!</li>
            <li>This is some good stuff!  </li>
            <li>, it puts good bacteria in your gut from the Redmond clay!</li>
            <li>and I feel good about letting them use it!  </li>
            <li>Taste is good; cleaning effect is excellent.</li>
            <li>its very good product and is good for you too.  </li>
            <li>Great for you with none of the junk.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I bought this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now, and my teeth look great</li>
            <li>This product is great except for the Xylitol.</li>
            <li>It tastes great, it does whiten my teeth, and it&#x27;s all natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons?  </li>
            <li>, my dentist said my teeth have shown great improvement and asked if I used the fluoride he subscribed.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste does a great job and tastes great as well.</li>
            <li>Peppermint is a great flavor.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Does a great job at cleaning your teeth and refreshes for breath.</li>
            <li>Smells yummi and works great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, great product.</li>
            <li>Leaves a great mouth feel, teeth feel smoother too.</li>
            <li>Parents are touting this xylitol as a great addition to their children&#x27;s oral health since it will not cause tooth decay, but neither does arsenic</li>
            <li>Not onlly am I happy with it</li>
            <li>Great taste, and</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!!</li>
            <li>Try it, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing tooth paste!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great for some people, but it just doesn&#x27;t work for our family!</li>
            <li>Tastes great and so good for my teeth.</li>
            <li>Nice!</li>
            <li>toothpaste tastes great- nice and minty- cleans beautifully, and my teeth have never been whiter.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product is actually very awesome, I love how my mouth feels after I brush my teeth</li>
            <li>Good toothpaste</li>
            <li>in all: good flavor, good feel.  </li>
            <li>and I feel like it does a good job cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;ingredients wise.</li>
            <li>and it tastes good too, so</li>
            <li>I thought I was getting a good tooth paste, it comes in</li>
            <li>From Utah, like all the money hungry organic type companies, but they make a good product.</li>
            <li>This product was a good alternative to toothpaste out there.</li>
            <li>it feel good in your mouth?</li>
            <li>it taste good?</li>
            <li>would be a good buy.</li>
            <li>good stuff.....</li>
            <li>This is a good toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good toothpaste without fluoride or glycerin or foaming agents like sodium laurel sulfate-</li>
            <li>good stuff.</li>
            <li>Their line of paste is good for all.</li>
            <li>Love love love this!!!</li>
            <li>Taste is mi Ty and great:)</li>
            <li>was very pleased with the service and the product</li>
            <li>However, I was pleased to hear my teeth and gums were in great shape.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>We love our EarthPaste!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I love to brush my teeth with it!</li>
            <li>and Im pretty impressed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great Healthy Product!</li>
            <li>bought 3 and love!</li>
            <li>Love this toothpaste!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind sharing this one with them, as it is safe!</li>
            <li>At first it was great!</li>
            <li>, it does the job safely!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that there is nothing harmful in the ingredients!</li>
            <li>I love this paste!  </li>
            <li>I like the pleasant, refreshing peppermint flavor.</li>
            <li>This company sent me the product VERY quickly and everything looked great.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant taste and leaves my teeth feeling very clean and slippery.  </li>
            <li>but it did have a nice minty taste.</li>
            <li>Nice scent.</li>
            <li>I am looking into making my own recipe with some of the ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be making my own toothpaste from now on.</li>
            <li>It polishes my teeth well and has wonderful wouldnt hurt you if you ate the whole tube of it ingredients.</li>
            <li>My dentist is thrilled.</li>
            <li>I wanted to provide an honest review based on my lifestyle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to get away from all the chemicals in EVERYTHING so rather than making my own toothpaste, I decided to buy a healthier paste and decided on this one.  </li>
            <li>I am now trying to make my own</li>
            <li>3 nice flavors.</li>
            <li>It truly is a wonderful feeling and no matter how much you brush</li>
            <li>Either go on Etsy and get some or find a recipe and make your own.</li>
            <li>On top of that, this toothpaste gives an extremely good polished feel to your teeth.</li>
            <li>Looks kind of tan/brown .....</li>
            <li>My own teeth are whiter and stronger than ever.</li>
            <li>I have made my own toothpaste for a while now</li>
            <li>The peppermint is really nice tasting.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this, have heard good things about it, but I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It takes some getting use too because it doesn&#x27;t have a foaming agent and it kind of disappears in your month, but it cleans great and it leaves your mouth fresh and pepperminty!</li>
            <li>tastes great and gets teeth nice and clean.</li>
            <li>Clean teeth- happy teeth</li>
            <li>Nope, it kind of feels like very fine dirt with a bit of peppermint.</li>
            <li>Truly, I could easily have loved this toothpaste and switched permanently.</li>
            <li>Best natural toothpaste I have used!  </li>
            <li>Earthpaste is the BEST natural toothpaste you will find!</li>
            <li>Excellent alternative to other market brands and works great.</li>
            <li>Excellent natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li>But the fact that its all natural and has no flouride makes my hippie self very happy!</li>
            <li>Best natural ingredients</li>
            <li>I have used almost every natural, organic toothpaste on the market, but until I ordered Earthpaste, I hadn&#x27;t found the best.  </li>
            <li>This is the best and tooth paste - like natural tooth paste! :)</li>
            <li>I purchased Earthpaste, based on the good reviews, and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>awesome taste, texture, natural and chemical free toothpaste!</li>
            <li>Best option next to making your own.</li>
            <li>By far the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever owned, love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Gets teeth clean and tastes good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seriously, the best not only natural toothpaste, but literally the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used in my life!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll admit I don&#x27;t LOVE this one as much as I loved the original Tom&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I am so happy to find a natural toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t have fluoride!!!!</li>
            <li>This is a very good natural toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>one is much better off just buying rather than trying to make.</li>
            <li>so it gives it more of a &amp;#34;paste-y&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, although I love the fact it&#x27;s non-toxic compared to many on the market.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>This is my favorite flavor.</li>
            <li>tastes better than it looks &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, I think it feels like it works well and has a refreshing feeling because of the peppermint oil.</li>
            <li>Now I have more bleeding and sores and nothing is helping.</li>
            <li>Otherwise worked okay.</li>
            <li>did see it clam that it was safe to swallow, but knowing that there is lead in it, even trace amounts</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>I found it :)</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s definitely a better choice than some of what&#x27;s on store shelves.</li>
            <li>However, this toothpaste gets my teeth SUPER clean, and the taste is great.</li>
            <li>But I can&#x27;t say I really love the product.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Requires a bit more than you&#x27;re used to since there is no foaming agent</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t update this (since I have only used this once), you can assume that I&#x27;m still very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I also haven&#x27;t gotten any more cavities.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>There are no nasty additives or fluoride.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite toothpastes.</li>
            <li>Buy it you will love it after a week.</li>
            <li>it helps remineralize the teeth with a healthy diet.</li>
            <li>No lead is okay.  </li>
            <li>I have always used toothpaste with all the chemicals and floride in it, so I was sure that this would be a joke.</li>
            <li>I bought these products not to make my hair look like the commercialized beauties we see on magazines or TV but to be healthy.</li>
            <li>I thought for sure that my teeth would start to darken after I stopped using my crest whitening toothpaste</li>
            <li>I even feel like my teeth look more presentable-</li>
            <li>I notice it and think it looks better than when I was using my whitening toothpaste.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I grew to love it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li>, I love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about my three year swallowing it when she brushes.</li>
            <li>:) Makes my teeth look whiter, will be buying more once I run out.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love knowing that my children can swallow</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been switching to more &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; products, but was hesitant to change my toothpaste because I didn&#x27;t want to be in pain.</li>
            <li>but many products make</li>
            <li>your life significantly more difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff works BETTER.</li>
            <li>My favorite is peppermint, followed by cinnamon and wintergreen.</li>
            <li>My teeth love it :)</li>
            <li>I would give this two stars if there weren&#x27;t cheaper and better options out there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I made the switch to this stuff.  </li>
            <li>As it stands now I will not be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>Glad this product exists.</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>, this is better).</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t be sure.</li>
            <li>The taste is okay</li>
            <li>If you consume even more than 12grams of added sugar (cane sugar, syrup, table sugar)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like the flavor to texture.  </li>
            <li>I bought this toothpaste for my daughter since it&#x27;s safe to swallow</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>I resisted change, but am so glad I took the chance and tried this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the peppermint better than the wintergreen.</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste but will quit using it.</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my teeth feel after brushing.</li>
            <li>My toddlers love to brush their teeth</li>
            <li>Will probably mix with Jason Naturals (a much better taste) just to use it up.</li>
            <li>It takes some time to get use to putting water on your toothbrush followed by the paste, and seeing brown instead of white when rinsing out, but this toothpaste is the best.</li>
            <li>My favorite toothpaste of all.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone, in fact I&#x27;ve already ordered more to give to my sister.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, but probably won&#x27;t buy again.  </li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>Earthpaste is now a family favorite</li>
            <li>I ABSOLUTELY LOVE</li>
            <li>This paste immediately became my favorite.  </li>
            <li>PLEASE, CAN THIS TUBE HAVE A FLIP TOP?  </li>
            <li>Most of the time now, we leave the cap off, and this dries the paste out.  </li>
            <li>and I do not believe it is safe to swallow.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure that would not be an alternative they would consider.</li>
            <li>It is ok.</li>
            <li>Love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste does just what a toothpaste should and nothing more.  </li>
            <li>My favorite is the lemon.  </li>
            <li>My teeth have never felt cleaner and my morning breath appears better, to me at least.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>NOTHING whitens better than this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>And I haven&#x27;t had any canker sore, which most brands of toothpastes caused.</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>and he said it was safe for the enamel on my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to love this toothpaste, but after using it for a while, my teeth were turning yellow/brown.  </li>
            <li>I now feel that I am able to brush better and more thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clay, so it&#x27;s going to be more water based.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I have been using this toothpaste for about a month and love it.</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>and I sadly won&#x27;t be able to use this</li>
            <li>I love this brand of toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>And I love the salty-minty taste.</li>
            <li>If anything, it exacerbated the problem, as the force of the jet would push my gums up higher, and the water getting underneath the gum line didn&#x27;t feel too pleasant.</li>
            <li>This tooth paste has a nice clean taste.</li>
            <li>Mouth sure feels clean!  </li>
            <li>It leaves your mouth feeling very clean, as well.</li>
            <li>My teeth and mouth don&#x27;t feel very clean after using it.  </li>
            <li>When I look at how good a toothpaste is, I first want to know if it makes my teeth squeak.</li>
            <li>I picked this up after trying to make my own clay toothpaste, and quickly discovered that this falls in the category of things</li>
            <li>feeling but if you&#x27;re not ready for homemaking your toothpaste yet, it&#x27;s a great minty option with good wholesome ingredients.</li>
            <li>- can&#x27;t get much better than 6 ingredients (1 being water, 2 being oils, 1 sweetener, clay, and salt), and for such a good price.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a great buy, and I&#x27;ll be stocking up on more right</li>
            <li>It tastes fine and the texture is okay.</li>
            <li>and then when you&#x27;re done...the cleanest clean ever!</li>
            <li>It tastes wonderfully minty as well, and left my teeth feeling clean.</li>
            <li>I will probably buy it again, as I am moving to be more chemical free.  </li>
            <li>I must say that this product has surprised me greatly</li>
            <li>is the most important part.</li>
            <li>Now I can get a great cleaning even with a soft brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Fantastic non-fluoride, healthy toothpaste that is minty without being salty.</li>
            <li>Been looking for a natural toothpaste and this one is great.</li>
            <li>Toothpaste has been the latest thing to switch and so far I am absolutely loving this stuff!</li>
            <li>but it is worth buying because it&#x27;s honestly your health</li>
            <li>I finally feel I am using a product that is actually good for me &amp; my teeth!</li>
            <li>It leaves your mouth feeling clean and it has no nasty chemicals.</li>
            <li>It leaves my teeth feeling clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>I love how clean my mouth feels when I use this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>, I feel like my teeth are actually clean, I love the flavor</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and the clay taste is merged with the peppermint</li>
            <li>I liked the toothpaste so much that I bought more.  </li>
            <li>Taste is strong but NOT overpowering.</li>
            <li>The peppermint isn&#x27;t strong but masks a lot of the &amp;#34;muddy&amp;#34; taste I was expecting.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t find it too strong...</li>
            <li>I do find the flavor to be a bit strong.</li>
            <li>At first, I really liked this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a pretty descent toothpaste and a nice transition away from the crest products I had been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hands down this is one of the best toothpaste you can buy from market</li>
            <li>The taste is fine</li>
            <li>It cleans fine</li>
            <li>The taste, texture etc is fine.  </li>
            <li>This product may not be appropriate for consumption by children or pregnant women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t comfortable scrubbing my hair or any part on my body (for that matter) with strong chemicals that were never meant for my body which my body in turn - rejects anyways.</li>
            <li>This product may  not be appropriate for consumption by CHILDREN or pregnant</li>
            <li>So far this toothpaste has been pleasant to use.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick!</li>
            <li>I love thats its healthy and safe and all natural!</li>
            <li>I just hope they don&#x27;t sell the company to some huge no-name corporation that changes the product ingrediants.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve read that the Wintergreen mint is stronger than this one--the peppermint isn&#x27;t blasting through your mouth like regularly available toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>If you can get paste these couple of things though I think you&#x27;d really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>The mint flavor is not too strong and my teeth feel so clean after brushing.  </li>
            <li>EarthPaste isn&#x27;t cheap, and I&#x27;m still getting used to its taste (to me the menthol is stronger than the mint).</li>
            <li>others have said, it leaves your teeth SLIPPERY SMOOTH.</li>
            <li>I went fluoride free over a year ago because of the sensitivity and pain I had.</li>
            <li>you want strong, smooth, clean teeth with no chemicals and a light peppermint taste, you&#x27;ve found your oral hygiene match with this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite used to the taste now and enjoy it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I run my tongue over my teeth they are smooth like I had just visited the dentist.</li>
            <li>the Toms, Jason or Natures Gate brand of (Fluoride Free) Toothpaste.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s the point of fluoride free if you&#x27;re getting lead poisoning instead??</li>
            <li>Any chance earthpaste will come out with an unflavored or light flavored paste?</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t see how volcanic ashes are going to keep me cavity free.</li>
            <li>I only read great things about the clay.</li>
            <li>No foaming (no chemicals added), easily rinses and leaves your teeth squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>Foaming toothpaste has always made me gag, so this alternative is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It is a good product because is natural and doesn&#x27;t had any processed products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more of this!!</li>
            <li>It takes some getting used to but my teeth feel very clean and fresh after I brush.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel very clean after &amp; I feel that the tea tree oil gives my mouth an antiseptic advantage for naturally fresh breath.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to receive this product since I&#x27;m trying to find a replacement to my fluoride free paste that stopped being made.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean and smooth after using it.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>The mouth-feel of this is very nice, it makes your teeth feel spotlessly clean to the point where you can&#x27;t go back.</li>
            <li>No more films teeth in the morning and best of all</li>
            <li>I wasnt too sure about this product at first.</li>
            <li>(They normally use Jack &amp; Jill blueberry paste so they wouldn&#x27;t have liked it anyway.)</li>
            <li>The taste didn&#x27;t bother me, but like most others, I wasn&#x27;t aware of the lead warning until receiving the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that this company was able to make an all natural toothpaste, but it is made from earth (aka dirt), which turns your toothbrush brown, and I ended up getting a cavity after 30 years of being cavity free.</li>
            <li>It leaves your teeth feeling clean and polished.</li>
            <li>your tongue there is no reason your mouth will not feel&lt;br /&gt;fresh and clean after using this</li>
            <li>My mouth feels so clean after using this product.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel so clean.  </li>
            <li>Although it feels clean and is working</li>
            <li>My teeth feel really clean after I brush</li>
            <li>It does not foam, which I know, is clean after I use this</li>
            <li>It leaves your teeth feeling amazingly clean.  </li>
            <li>In fact the taste is quite minty mild and has a smooth consistency.</li>
            <li>Cheaper and tastier and yes, squeaky clean teeth.</li>
            <li>Overall, this toothpaste is enjoyable, health-conscious and effective, but has room for improvement.</li>
            <li>But it seemed like no matter what my mouth just didn&#x27;t feel completely clean.</li>
            <li>It did a great job polishing my teeth while still being gentle on my sensitive gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very different from so many others that I&#x27;ve tried before making my own from scratch.</li>
            <li>This makes my teeth feel really clean.</li>
            <li>It leaves your teeth feeling totally clean.  </li>
            <li>Teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li>Much better than I expected and good whitening</li>
            <li>I like the toothpaste and my teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li>However, I was very surprised how effective it is in whitening your teeth.</li>
            <li>I decided to create my own natural toothpaste instead!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this paste twice so far, and am in love!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very smooth - almost creamy - and feels very nice.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li>So nice to finally find a product (sans the fluoride and SLS) that makes your mouth feel minty AND CLEAN!</li>
            <li>listed in this toothpaste; just good ol&#x27; fashioned clay, essential oils and xylitol.</li>
            <li>While there were things I loved about this toothpaste, I could never recommend a toothpaste that actually stains teeth.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t quite get a good coating on my teeth either; however, I attribute this to years of using regular toothpaste products.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this one, but it&#x27;s jus not working for us.&lt;br</li>
            <li>no burns if it goes under your tongue, which is nice for sensitive mouths.</li>
            <li>It kills rats in sizes equal to two pieces of gum and our loved family dog</li>
            <li>But thanks because I like this even better than when Tom&#x27;s was the ticket.  </li>
            <li>Not bad for clay toothpaste</li>
            <li>If this meets Stephanie&#x27;s tight criteria, then it has to be good!</li>
            <li>Mouth and teeth feel extremely clean and smooth after the first tube.  </li>
            <li>absolutely love this paste and feel so much better about using this than a &#x27;regular&#x27; paste full of chemicals and fluoride.</li>
            <li>teeth feel clean and my breath fresh after brushing and rinsing with water.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So fresh, so clean.</li>
            <li>My breath is fresh and my teeth are clean and polished.</li>
            <li>Not for women nursing or pregnant.</li>
            <li>I was told that my sensitivity would return quickly if I stopped using Sensodyne.</li>
            <li>Secondly, I want to make sure it&#x27;s healthy.</li>
            <li>mild flavor and works well.  </li>
            <li>I love how there are no nasty chemicals in it such as glycerin or fluoride.</li>
            <li>I am super picky about my toothpaste and have been since I was a kid.</li>
            <li>I have tried many, many different kinds.  </li>
            <li>Like that it is more healthy than traditional brands.</li>
            <li>Earthpaste is truly the most natural and free of chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been adopting aspects of healthy living steadily into my lifestyle.  </li>
            <li>This is my first fluoride free toothpaste experiment.  </li>
            <li>Tried this toothpaste with my Ion Toothbrush that I recently purchased and I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>So I got the peppermint one and the very first time I tried it</li>
            <li>But all in all I love this toothpaste, my husband loves this toothpaste ( he normal brushes his teeth with hydrogen peroxide and baking soda) and I can&#x27;t wait to adopt our kids so they can use it.</li>
            <li>The taste is OK, but the residue adheres to the bowl of the sunk like concrete.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it much, but its a good alternative, especially if you don&#x27;t have the ingredients or time to make your own natural type.</li>
            <li>After trying many different dental pastes, this is the most natural and safe way to go.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this, and at first, I really did.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re considering teeth-whitening treatments at a dentist or have yellowing that won&#x27;t go away, try this first!</li>
            <li>When I first discovered this toothpaste I was so excited about it.</li>
            <li>If you want to try it, go ahead, but first, buy lemon or cinnamon flavor for kids!</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s best is that it doesn&#x27;t dry out your mouth and tongue like traditional toothpastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>From the first use to now, my teeth always feel clean.</li>
            <li>But with earth paste my teeth felt clean all day and my husband even made a comment how my breath did not smell for the first time in like 6 months.</li>
            <li>It tastes amazing and it doesn&#x27;t feel gritty at all.  </li>
            <li>If the long-term effects are what I am hoping, it will be worth the price.</li>
            <li>I am always looking for a natural toothpaste that does not contain SLS, that offers a good taste, and does the job.  </li>
            <li>For the people who don&#x27;t feel their mouth is fresh they</li>
            <li>This stuff is so truly natural and safe that it is edible.</li>
            <li>wanted to try a more natural alternative to toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice to find something I am not allergic to that actually works well.</li>
            <li>We like that it has many natural things in it.</li>
            <li>A distinct salty taste, from the baking soda I guess.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll know in a couple months when I return to the dentist if it helped my teeth to be able to heal my cavities naturally.</li>
            <li>It was the complete lack of effective cleaning that really lost me.</li>
            <li>No artificial anything.</li>
            <li>Mouth didn&#x27;t feel or taste as fresh.</li>
            <li>This is another favorite website of mine for all things natural.</li>
            <li>I really liked the peppermint and cinnamon flavors, I went through 3 tubes total.</li>
            <li>And there are natural ones that foam more.</li>
            <li>Plus its got a nice minty flavor and isn&#x27;t gritty.</li>
            <li>I feel confident that I will continue to use this toothpaste because of the natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>cleans teeth well, leaves mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>Peppermint is my favorite so far.  </li>
            <li>My favorite all natural toothpaste</li>
            <li>I had read about people having success with oral irrigation, so I installed a showerhead-adapted model in my shower.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to receive this toothpaste, because I have been looking for a natural tooth paste that was free of sulfates, glycerin, and fluoride.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m pretty sure the fine clays in the toothpaste are what provides the extra cleaning and whitening</li>
            <li>I also make my own Redmond Clay based toothpaste, but I still enjoy trying other brands time and again just to change things up.</li>
            <li>This is a good way to care for your teeth without all the foaming agents and chemical processing other toothpastes have.</li>
            <li>I can eat and drink right away</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was written right on the box.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so clean and are much whiter.</li>
            <li>I like that the ingredients are all natural and safe to consume, although I probably would not eat much menthol if I can help it!</li>
            <li>I tried it because I&#x27;m interested in transitioning to more natural bath and body care.</li>
            <li>use a normal amount of paste, and it seems to do just fine.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a bit high, compared to what I have always paid for toothpaste in the past--but I&#x27;ve always waited for sales that made cheap toothpastes even cheaper and then bought a boxful.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s earthpaste that helped, or just the fact that I transitioned away from my crest products, but either way I&#x27;m happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No fake foam, taste clean, doesn&#x27;t leave too much minty smell in the mouth.</li>
            <li>Nothing better than being pure and washing with natural products.</li>
            <li>This seemed like the perfect toothpaste since it only has a few ingredients.</li>
            <li>The extra cost is well worth it, as this product is so much better for you.</li>
            <li>Most natural toothpastes leave my teeth feeling like they aren&#x27;t very well cleaned.  </li>
            <li>We like this very much ....</li>
            <li>I am so excited for their new kids flavor Lemon Twist.</li>
            <li>but you need to be aware that it may contain lead.</li>
            <li>He agreed that the staining was most likely caused by the toothpaste.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s exactly what this toothpaste reminds me of with the addition of a peppermint oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(they really are whiter, too!).</li>
            <li>No chemicals that I&#x27;m aware.  </li>
            <li>At first I was worried about the whitening ability of this toothpaste because of it&#x27;s color, but I feel my teeth is whiter and cleaner.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>My teeth look healthy and white.  </li>
            <li>Initially I wanted to use more and more because it didn&#x27;t feel like I had enough on my toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;m pretty accustomed to the &#x27;no foam&#x27; and don&#x27;t feel the need to use a lot of toothpaste.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is another brand at one of the smaller health food stores that I like better.  </li>
            <li>Was an avid Sensodyne Pro Namel user for years.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was the warning printed on the label about the product containing trace amounts of lead...</li>
            <li>The only reason why I rated this product 2 stars instead of 1 is because obviously many people like it.</li>
            <li>I cannot make any claims for rebuilding enamel, but the lack in sensitivity I&#x27;ve been having is supporting evidence.</li>
            <li>Exactly What i Wanted.</li>
            <li>I feel like my teeth are much cleaner and they look whiter!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s safe enough to swallow.</li>
            <li>after getting used to it, I like it SOOO much better than regular toothpase.</li>
            <li>I used this paste for the first time today, but I just didn&#x27;t feel like the toothpaste reached all of my teeth since it doesn&#x27;t foam.</li>
            <li>I had to brush twice and put tons of paste on my toothbrush in order to feel somewhat confident that all my teeth got enough of the paste.</li>
            <li>It has an intense mint flavor that makes my mouth feel extremely fresh.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Noticed this as I was brushing my teeth with it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, it does a great job cleaning (unlike another boutique paste, Squiggle, which sucks.)</li>
            <li>I love the simple ingredients, nothing toxic.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like putting things in my mouth that aren&#x27;t considered safe to eat, especially not to give to my kids either.</li>
            <li>Three days into using this exclusivity I was pleasantly surprised to still be comfortable.  </li>
            <li>After finishing my first tube, I am now ordering another.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend it but is you want a refreshing mint flavor....get the wintergreen.</li>
            <li>My mouth is not filled with bubbles and grit, which is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>It is truly natural, detergent and fluoride free and leaves my teeth feeling very clean and white without any pain.  </li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s natural and safe to swallow unlike other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; toothpastes.</li>
            <li>Not only is the ingredient list short, it eliminated my tooth sensitivity, but it quite possibly may be the most effective paste I&#x27;ve ever used (used to be a regular user of the Arm &amp; Hammer baking soda line for that nice polish</li>
            <li>It is natural and my mouth feels clean.</li>
            <li>I will update this if I have a less than favorable dentist visit in the future, but so far I am very happy with Earthpaste!</li>
            <li>will likely go unused because I love earthpaste so much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also not uncomfortably minty, but enough that my teeth feel clean and my breath smells fresh.</li>
            <li>I love that such a simple product can do such an effective job.</li>
            <li>Back to my tried and true Desert Essence!</li>
            <li>Would certainly recommend this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Great flavor, Long lasting, Natural</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had the dry mouth that some reviewers have mentioned, but thanks to their reviews, I just make sure to rinse with water after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And, I was surprised at how much whiter my teeth are after even just the first use!  </li>
            <li>The ingredient list is totally clean, the product consistency is good and consistent, and (despite looking like a small tube) it goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am pretty sure that ceasing the use of conventional toothpaste with flouride has contributed to the improvement of my health.</li>
            <li>A warning is on the back of the tube; not the detailed description on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>Really like this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Did your mom ever make you brush your teeth with straight baking soda when you were a kid?&lt;br /&gt;Mine</li>
            <li>and I was really unsure if I would like it.  </li>
            <li>It takes a bit to get used to how much to use since there is no foaming.  </li>
            <li>Overall, great product, just not a great fit for me.</li>
            <li>I want to like this toothpaste, I really do.</li>
            <li>I also would have appreciated if Amazon showed the warning about there being lead in it (trace amounts, but still..).</li>
            <li>I really like this paste.  </li>
            <li>Fast Shipping!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am trying to remove as much chemical from my day to day life.</li>
            <li>I was absolutely blown away.</li>
            <li>I really like the peppermint Earthpaste.</li>
            <li>so I started using Sensodyne which was very helpful.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner.</li>
            <li>Its not the nicest looking toothpaste in the world, and tends to get all over the sink, but I really like this brand.  </li>
            <li>I use a sonicare toothbrush, and often I would have to skip the tooth or turn the power off and scrub gently, because the nerve pain was shooting.</li>
            <li>so I immediately whipped out the Toms (Fluoride Free) toothpaste that I have been using for years and brushed my teeth.</li>
            <li>My teeth are much whiter than when I started using Earthpaste</li>
            <li>It may be free of chemicals in regular toothpastes but it has trace amounts of lead!</li>
            <li>I really like the winter mint flavor for this toothpaste as well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t taste the peppermint as much as I thought I would</li>
            <li>So I really wanted to like this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I really like this Earthpaste.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very affordable.</li>
            <li>I think its the ease of use from a tube that they really need.  </li>
            <li>That being said I&#x27;m very concerned about the claim of \\&quot;natural\\&quot; when it comes to this toothpaste</li>
            <li>Most Xylitol contains GMO&#x27;s, the process by which it is made is crushed fibers of sugar cane [birchwood or corn..]  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now enjoy using this one in between using my homemade baking soda toothpastes because it&#x27;s non-abrasive (the dentist says that you&#x27;re not supposed to brush your teeth daily with baking soda because it scratches away at the enamel by using it too often).</li>
            <li>Bummed, because I really wanted to like it.</li>
            <li>Note: I like how they say on the back label &amp;#34;feel free to swallow or spit Earthpaste out after brushing&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Why would anyone use lead in there mouth, I don&#x27;t care how much.</li>
            <li>Which is also why it&#x27;s important to always put the cap back on after using it</li>
            <li>It cleans very well, leaves my mouth feeling refreshed and there&#x27;s no foaming agents, flouride or sugar.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this toothpaste once so far, but I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>so I have been following up with baking soda, and actually, my teeth feel way cleaner with just good old baking soda.  </li>
            <li>After two weeks of using this toothpaste I noticed my gums were sensitive and even one of my top teeth was starting to hurt.</li>
            <li>I tried to switch from commercial toothpaste to a more natural toothpaste before this</li>
            <li>It has some occasional gritty specs, but I kind of grew to like it.  </li>
            <li>but this is a good substitute in the mean time.</li>
            <li>EXCEPT I&#x27;ve noticed my mouth becoming BONE dry at night.  </li>
            <li>We are trained our whole entire life if something doesn&#x27;t suds than it is not getting it clean, even toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I was inspired by this product to research bentonite clay and start incorporating more of it in my health and beauty in other ways too.  </li>
            <li>Better by miles than Crest and all those other poisons.</li>
            <li>I was excited when I found this in my local health food store, because it seemed to be what I had been searching for.</li>
            <li>Why would anyone presume it&#x27;s okay to put harmful chemicals and other additives in your mouth at the frequency</li>
            <li>I was a devoted Tom&#x27;s of Maine customer for years, back when they still sold the toothpaste in the metal tubes and had the original formula.</li>
            <li>I tried it with both a regular and sonic toothbrush, and my teeth did not feel exceptionally clean.  </li>
            <li>update December 19, 2013:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not noticed any reenamelization of teeth, however, no decay has occurred and they are still white and clean.</li>
            <li>Cons: Earthpaste does have a strange, kind of slimy texture, really is similar to liquidy mud, and doesn&#x27;t bubble.</li>
            <li>Earthpaste has been my first foray into natural toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>This is my first experience with an all natural toothpaste</li>
            <li>My teeth also feel nice and slick.</li>
            <li>It Was New, Wrapped And Delivered Fast.</li>
            <li>I have some odd allergies that keep me from using most toothpastes.</li>
            <li>About a year and a half ago, I noticed the gums on my top two incisors were receding.</li>
            <li>Finally a toothpaste safe enough for my house.</li>
            <li>This might taste good to some, but we tried to use it only a few times.  </li>
            <li>A quick trip to Earthpastes website and a look in the FAQ section immediately explained and relieved my concerns about the lead warning but the fact that it seems to aggravate the gums so badly is a definite reason not to buy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching high and low for a natural, fluoride free toothpaste that everyone will use.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I found it through an organic beauty blog that highly reccommended it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I highly recommend buying a tube of Earth Paste and trying it out to see if it is for you.</li>
            <li>Color of toothpaste highly disagreeable.  </li>
            <li>The price is quite high as well.  </li>
            <li>Just remove if it is naturally occurring!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s also not as strong as some of the other clay toothpaste alternatives that are out there.  </li>
            <li>The thinner, non-foaming consistency takes a little getting used to; the first week I was stopping in the middle of brushing to add more toothpaste because I didn&#x27;t feel like I had covered my whole mouth.</li>
            <li>None are bad, but I think mint is the best.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate the natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>They are not receding as much as before and are not overly red but a healthy pink tone now.</li>
            <li>I feel a gunk built up on my teeth already with normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I found that I preferred this type of consistency over normal</li>
            <li>I personally feel it&#x27;s worth the investment</li>
            <li>With no foaming ingredient, it, of course, isn&#x27;t something we get normally.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently switched back to my old toothpaste and it works a lot better for me.</li>
            <li>The paste itself is normal toothpaste consistency.  </li>
            <li>I love that it has so few ingredients in it.</li>
            <li>The taste is also just fine, it&#x27;s minty and sweet, but not nearly as sweet as the commercial toothpastes.</li>
            <li>I knew that it was a better option than other tooth pastes because it is completely all natural.</li>
            <li>My teeth are smooth and shiny afterward, even without the glycerin other toothpastes include.  </li>
            <li>Personally I thought changing my toothpaste wouldn&#x27;t make much of a difference in life at all, but it&#x27;s really provided a lot of benefits in our life.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t consider that important enough to detract from this terrific product.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t know whether it is totally effective until a few months from now, but the taste and consistency are not too much different from &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I got this to incorporate as part of my regimen for helping to heal my recently diagnosed hypothyroidism and I must say I like this brand very much.</li>
            <li>Its expensive and is gone too quickly but other than that its great.</li>
            <li>No more of that, decided to either chew bark or find a better toothpaste.</li>
            <li>most toothpastes have bleachers or other additives to make them white.</li>
            <li>Finally something that the whole family can use!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m actually very tempted right now to brush my teeth a third time...using commercial toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Not sure if anyone else has had this reaction, and honestly I can&#x27;t find ANY articles or reviews that say something similar to my experience.</li>
            <li>This leaves my mouth feeling clean without all the strange additives in traditional toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Only downside is that it takes a little more scrubbing to remove residue from the sink.</li>
            <li>Since I started using Earth Paste my teeth have not once experienced pain from heat or cold.</li>
            <li>and then I cough to clear my airway.</li>
            <li>I looked in to alternatives to colgate and crest because the regular toothpastes were causing my teeth to be really heat/cold sensitive.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are not only natural, but edible, whole and beneficial.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this toothpaste because I needed a natural toothpaste that would not irritate my rosacea.</li>
            <li>I have never had any staining on my teeth before and was quite surprised to find this occurring.</li>
            <li>I do miss the foaming action, but I expected this, because it&#x27;s a natural toothpaste with no artificial foam-producing additives.  </li>
            <li>They started bleeding and I developed some canker sores after about a week of use.</li>
            <li>And not naming names, but all those hard-to-pronounce ingredients simulating natural products made me wonder just what I was trying not to accidentally swallow.</li>
            <li>For starters, I have ALWAYS had sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Well, I have to say that I dont have nearly as sensitive teeth since using this product.</li>
            <li>And I know using this all natural product</li>
            <li>I was actually surprised by this.</li>
            <li>Wanted to go all natural and was recommended this by a paleo blogger.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li>I scanned the barcode to read reviews on Amazon, and saw that some people had experience a reduction in pain with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>My 2 year old brushes with it too.</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive teeth or gums</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just soft feeling...</li>
            <li>#34;Mmm, toothpaste is yummy!&amp;#34; (They&#x27;re 2 years old)</li>
            <li>No fluoride, all natural.</li>
            <li>My 6 year old son and toddler daughter suffer from tooth decay caused by Celiac Disease.  </li>
            <li>It might be natural....</li>
            <li>Now if I could just convince my 9 year old.</li>
            <li>I am always on the lookout for a non-fluoride, natural toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying again and also giving as a gift to family members who are looking for a natural, quality toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, this toothpaste was recommended by a natural product company called Bubble &amp; Bee.  </li>
            <li>I had no trouble adapting to the change, which I can&#x27;t always say at 65 years old.  </li>
            <li>I have receded gums because of crowns in my mouth and the exposed dental tissue is extremely sensitive.  </li>
            <li>ALL toothpastes, including Tom&#x27;s of Maine and The Natural Dentist make me cringe with pain as I brush.  </li>
            <li>, it contains Xylitol and there is nothing natural about Xylitol</li>
            <li>I developed a toothpaste allergy.</li>
            <li>Smoother than any of the &#x27;natural&#x27; toothpastes I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted an all natural toothpaste</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know how helpful it is in &amp;#34;restructuring&amp;#34; enamel, but I feel confident that the ingredients at least aren&#x27;t damaging it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it about a week now so far and see no need to ever use anything else again.</li>
            <li>As others have noted, the natural color and fact that it doesn&#x27;t foam may take some getting used to for some, but these things don&#x27;t phase me at all.</li>
            <li>The end product is a bleached, powdery blend of sugar alcohols that taste sweet on the tongue but are not absorbed by the body.</li>
            <li>but since I am used to making my own, I found its consistency too thin.</li>
            <li>It does taste good and I am hoping it will indeed remineralize my teeth and gums and help me prevent expensive dental treatments.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only bought this, originally, because it was the most expensive toothpaste on the shelf</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t clean well and was messy.</li>
            <li>It is a little hard to get used to not having the foam, but so far good.</li>
            <li>Okay so I was a little skeptical when I bought it even though it has had phenomenal reviews from everyone.</li>
            <li>And overall, I really do like it, especially because it is natural.  </li>
            <li>my teeth are almost back to normal.</li>
            <li>Al that is needed is a normal ribbed and smal flip-open cap that flips open with one&#x27;s thumb.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m a serious coffee drinker, so white hasn&#x27;t ever really been an option, but this toothpaste has done better, already, than toothpastes that promise whitening effects, and I&#x27;ve only had it a couple days.)  </li>
            <li>I tried a few other natural pastes, but wasn&#x27;t satisfied.</li>
            <li>This is our new toothpaste of choice, and I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>It will now be my new regular brand.  </li>
            <li>So I finally figured it was time to look for something new.  </li>
            <li>I actually didn&#x27;t want to like it, but it is much healthier than the regular toothpastes.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s a bit pricey compared to the 99 cent tubes of paste my dad used to pick up at Walmart and even Tom&#x27;s, but one tube lasts our 2 person family close to 6 months, and when you think about the importance of oral care and it&#x27;s impact on your daily wellbeing, I&#x27;d much rather spend the occasional 7 bucks then deal with dental</li>
            <li>I switched back to Sensodyne after using this because my teeth developed a mild sensitivity to cold (have experienced this in the past).</li>
            <li>Finally, an all natural toothpaste fluoride-free and glycerin-free!</li>
            <li>I am a major fan of bentonite clay and it&#x27;s healing properties</li>
            <li>It is slightly more watery than other brands and might splatter a little.</li>
            <li>This paste makes a bit of a mess in the sink but it is so worth it.  </li>
            <li>However, I still give it 5 stars because I have consistently bought it over the last 2 years and have been unable to find anything better.</li>
            <li>As soon as I switched back to conventional toothpaste, my teeth returned to their original, whiter color, though only after awhile.</li>
            <li>I realize this is my issue and likely comes from my lifelong use of more foamy toothpastes, but it turns out I like something that foams a little bit.</li>
            <li>The stains had to be removed professionally but my teeth have now been restored to their former color.</li>
            <li>this was the only toothpast I could find that is truely natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve finally found a natural toothpaste that whitens my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I gave this toothpaste the old college try for over a week until I couldn&#x27;t bear how gross my mouth felt upon waking anymore.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using a soft bristle toothbrush to prevent gum erosion, but was not feeling the same smoothness as I used to.</li>
            <li>It sits in my bathroom next to another natural toothpaste</li>
            <li>I have another tube of a different natural toothpaste I was going to try that</li>
            <li>Screwing and unscrewing this open and closed every time is a REAL PAIN!  </li>
            <li>I may attempt to make my own toothpaste, as it isn&#x27;t difficult with coconut oil</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been desperate to find a good substitute and, thank goodness,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need fake lather and weird chemical flavors/fragrances in my toothpaste, I just need it to clean my teeth and get out of there.&lt;br /&gt;Earthpaste does a great cleaning job and tastes just dandy!&lt;br /&gt;Side</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how similar it is to commercial toothpaste, without the problems I have with it.</li>
            <li>As far as the product is concerned the one thing you have to remember is that it&#x27;s not &#x27;foamy&#x27; like the traditional commercial toothpastes.  </li>
            <li>The descriptions on this website and on the box itself list only \\&quot;essential oils,\\&quot; which naturally I assumed was the peppermint oil that gives it flavor.  </li>
            <li>I usually always have a tube of this on hand for those lazy days that I don&#x27;t feel like making my own toothpaste for the house.</li>
            <li>I noticed whiter teeth after just a few brushings and my teeth still feel just as clean as with regular toothpaste all day long.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave an extreme minty feel in your mouth like other toothpastes, but it is something you will quickly gets used to.</li>
            <li>so I can not figure out why they have decided to add such a compound to the product other than it&#x27;s only positive quality ...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Earthpaste for almost 3 weeks and so far my teeth are not sensitive.</li>
            <li>I am passionate about natural health, though, and have read claims about glycerin coating your teeth.</li>
            <li>I have been using sensitive toothpaste off and on for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li>First of all it is a hydrogenated with the catalyst nickel, can you say Heavy Metal?  </li>
            <li>The peppermint flavor is more subtle than I expected, but I like it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overwhelming with the mint flavor, but just enough to give you the fresh</li>
            <li>So, who knows if this success is due to the toothpaste or other factors, but I&#x27;d like to think this played a role in my dental hygiene.</li>
            <li>It tastes a little different, but that didn&#x27;t bother me after the first couple times I brushed with it.</li>
            <li>I only use a very small amount of Earthpaste and my teeth always feel completely clean.  </li>
            <li>My teeth also felt half as clean as usual, and a few days after using this product consistently, I began having a severe ongoing tooth ache.</li>

            <li> , my dentist said my teeth have shown great improvement and asked if I used the fluoride he subscribed.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste does a great job and tastes great as well.</li>
            <li> Peppermint is a great flavor.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Does a great job at cleaning your teeth and refreshes for breath.</li>
            <li> Smells yummi and works great.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, great product.</li>
            <li> Leaves a great mouth feel, teeth feel smoother too.</li>
            <li> Parents are touting this xylitol as a great addition to their children&#x27;s oral health since it will not cause tooth decay, but neither does arsenic</li>
            <li> Not onlly am I happy with it</li>
            <li> Great taste, and</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!!</li>
            <li> Try it, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing tooth paste!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great for some people, but it just doesn&#x27;t work for our family!</li>
            <li> Tastes great and so good for my teeth.</li>
            <li> Nice!</li>
            <li> toothpaste tastes great- nice and minty- cleans beautifully, and my teeth have never been whiter.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product is actually very awesome, I love how my mouth feels after I brush my teeth</li>
            <li> Good toothpaste</li>
            <li> in all: good flavor, good feel.  </li>
            <li> and I feel like it does a good job cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;ingredients wise.</li>
            <li> and it tastes good too, so</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a good tooth paste, it comes in</li>
            <li> From Utah, like all the money hungry organic type companies, but they make a good product.</li>
            <li> This product was a good alternative to toothpaste out there.</li>
            <li> it feel good in your mouth?</li>
            <li> it taste good?</li>
            <li> would be a good buy.</li>
            <li> good stuff.....</li>
            <li> This is a good toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good toothpaste without fluoride or glycerin or foaming agents like sodium laurel sulfate-</li>
            <li> good stuff.</li>
            <li> Their line of paste is good for all.</li>
            <li> Love love love this!!!</li>
            <li> Taste is mi Ty and great:)</li>
            <li> was very pleased with the service and the product</li>
            <li> However, I was pleased to hear my teeth and gums were in great shape.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> We love our EarthPaste!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> I love to brush my teeth with it!</li>
            <li> and Im pretty impressed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great Healthy Product!</li>
            <li> bought 3 and love!</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind sharing this one with them, as it is safe!</li>
            <li> At first it was great!</li>
            <li> , it does the job safely!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that there is nothing harmful in the ingredients!</li>
            <li> I love this paste!  </li>
            <li> I like the pleasant, refreshing peppermint flavor.</li>
            <li> This company sent me the product VERY quickly and everything looked great.  </li>
            <li> It has a pleasant taste and leaves my teeth feeling very clean and slippery.  </li>
            <li> but it did have a nice minty taste.</li>
            <li> Nice scent.</li>
            <li> I am looking into making my own recipe with some of the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be making my own toothpaste from now on.</li>
            <li> It polishes my teeth well and has wonderful wouldnt hurt you if you ate the whole tube of it ingredients.</li>
            <li> My dentist is thrilled.</li>
            <li> I wanted to provide an honest review based on my lifestyle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to get away from all the chemicals in EVERYTHING so rather than making my own toothpaste, I decided to buy a healthier paste and decided on this one.  </li>
            <li> I am now trying to make my own</li>
            <li> 3 nice flavors.</li>
            <li> It truly is a wonderful feeling and no matter how much you brush</li>
            <li> Either go on Etsy and get some or find a recipe and make your own.</li>
            <li> On top of that, this toothpaste gives an extremely good polished feel to your teeth.</li>
            <li> Looks kind of tan/brown .....</li>
            <li> My own teeth are whiter and stronger than ever.</li>
            <li> I have made my own toothpaste for a while now</li>
            <li> The peppermint is really nice tasting.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this, have heard good things about it, but I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It takes some getting use too because it doesn&#x27;t have a foaming agent and it kind of disappears in your month, but it cleans great and it leaves your mouth fresh and pepperminty!</li>
            <li> tastes great and gets teeth nice and clean.</li>
            <li> Clean teeth- happy teeth</li>
            <li> Nope, it kind of feels like very fine dirt with a bit of peppermint.</li>
            <li> Truly, I could easily have loved this toothpaste and switched permanently.</li>
            <li> Best natural toothpaste I have used!  </li>
            <li> Earthpaste is the BEST natural toothpaste you will find!</li>
            <li> Excellent alternative to other market brands and works great.</li>
            <li> Excellent natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li> But the fact that its all natural and has no flouride makes my hippie self very happy!</li>
            <li> Best natural ingredients</li>
            <li> I have used almost every natural, organic toothpaste on the market, but until I ordered Earthpaste, I hadn&#x27;t found the best.  </li>
            <li> This is the best and tooth paste - like natural tooth paste! :)</li>
            <li> I purchased Earthpaste, based on the good reviews, and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> awesome taste, texture, natural and chemical free toothpaste!</li>
            <li> Best option next to making your own.</li>
            <li> By far the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever owned, love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Gets teeth clean and tastes good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously, the best not only natural toothpaste, but literally the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used in my life!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll admit I don&#x27;t LOVE this one as much as I loved the original Tom&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to find a natural toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t have fluoride!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a very good natural toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> one is much better off just buying rather than trying to make.</li>
            <li> so it gives it more of a &amp;#34;paste-y&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, although I love the fact it&#x27;s non-toxic compared to many on the market.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> This is my favorite flavor.</li>
            <li> tastes better than it looks &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, I think it feels like it works well and has a refreshing feeling because of the peppermint oil.</li>
            <li> Now I have more bleeding and sores and nothing is helping.</li>
            <li> Otherwise worked okay.</li>
            <li> did see it clam that it was safe to swallow, but knowing that there is lead in it, even trace amounts</li>
            <li> Glad</li>
            <li> I found it :)</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s definitely a better choice than some of what&#x27;s on store shelves.</li>
            <li> However, this toothpaste gets my teeth SUPER clean, and the taste is great.</li>
            <li> But I can&#x27;t say I really love the product.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Requires a bit more than you&#x27;re used to since there is no foaming agent</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t update this (since I have only used this once), you can assume that I&#x27;m still very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I also haven&#x27;t gotten any more cavities.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> There are no nasty additives or fluoride.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite toothpastes.</li>
            <li> Buy it you will love it after a week.</li>
            <li> it helps remineralize the teeth with a healthy diet.</li>
            <li> No lead is okay.  </li>
            <li> I have always used toothpaste with all the chemicals and floride in it, so I was sure that this would be a joke.</li>
            <li> I bought these products not to make my hair look like the commercialized beauties we see on magazines or TV but to be healthy.</li>
            <li> I thought for sure that my teeth would start to darken after I stopped using my crest whitening toothpaste</li>
            <li> I even feel like my teeth look more presentable-</li>
            <li> I notice it and think it looks better than when I was using my whitening toothpaste.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I grew to love it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li> , I love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about my three year swallowing it when she brushes.</li>
            <li> :) Makes my teeth look whiter, will be buying more once I run out.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love knowing that my children can swallow</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been switching to more &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; products, but was hesitant to change my toothpaste because I didn&#x27;t want to be in pain.</li>
            <li> but many products make</li>
            <li> your life significantly more difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff works BETTER.</li>
            <li> My favorite is peppermint, followed by cinnamon and wintergreen.</li>
            <li> My teeth love it :)</li>
            <li> I would give this two stars if there weren&#x27;t cheaper and better options out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I made the switch to this stuff.  </li>
            <li> As it stands now I will not be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> Glad this product exists.</li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> , this is better).</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t be sure.</li>
            <li> The taste is okay</li>
            <li> If you consume even more than 12grams of added sugar (cane sugar, syrup, table sugar)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just glad</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like the flavor to texture.  </li>
            <li> I bought this toothpaste for my daughter since it&#x27;s safe to swallow</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> I resisted change, but am so glad I took the chance and tried this product.  </li>
            <li> I love the peppermint better than the wintergreen.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste but will quit using it.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my teeth feel after brushing.</li>
            <li> My toddlers love to brush their teeth</li>
            <li> Will probably mix with Jason Naturals (a much better taste) just to use it up.</li>
            <li> It takes some time to get use to putting water on your toothbrush followed by the paste, and seeing brown instead of white when rinsing out, but this toothpaste is the best.</li>
            <li> My favorite toothpaste of all.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone, in fact I&#x27;ve already ordered more to give to my sister.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, but probably won&#x27;t buy again.  </li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> Earthpaste is now a family favorite</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE</li>
            <li> This paste immediately became my favorite.  </li>
            <li> PLEASE, CAN THIS TUBE HAVE A FLIP TOP?  </li>
            <li> Most of the time now, we leave the cap off, and this dries the paste out.  </li>
            <li> and I do not believe it is safe to swallow.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure that would not be an alternative they would consider.</li>
            <li> It is ok.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste does just what a toothpaste should and nothing more.  </li>
            <li> My favorite is the lemon.  </li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt cleaner and my morning breath appears better, to me at least.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> NOTHING whitens better than this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> And I haven&#x27;t had any canker sore, which most brands of toothpastes caused.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> and he said it was safe for the enamel on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to love this toothpaste, but after using it for a while, my teeth were turning yellow/brown.  </li>
            <li> I now feel that I am able to brush better and more thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clay, so it&#x27;s going to be more water based.  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste for about a month and love it.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> and I sadly won&#x27;t be able to use this</li>
            <li> I love this brand of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> And I love the salty-minty taste.</li>
            <li> If anything, it exacerbated the problem, as the force of the jet would push my gums up higher, and the water getting underneath the gum line didn&#x27;t feel too pleasant.</li>
            <li> This tooth paste has a nice clean taste.</li>
            <li> Mouth sure feels clean!  </li>
            <li> It leaves your mouth feeling very clean, as well.</li>
            <li> My teeth and mouth don&#x27;t feel very clean after using it.  </li>
            <li> When I look at how good a toothpaste is, I first want to know if it makes my teeth squeak.</li>
            <li> I picked this up after trying to make my own clay toothpaste, and quickly discovered that this falls in the category of things</li>
            <li> feeling but if you&#x27;re not ready for homemaking your toothpaste yet, it&#x27;s a great minty option with good wholesome ingredients.</li>
            <li> - can&#x27;t get much better than 6 ingredients (1 being water, 2 being oils, 1 sweetener, clay, and salt), and for such a good price.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a great buy, and I&#x27;ll be stocking up on more right</li>
            <li> It tastes fine and the texture is okay.</li>
            <li> and then when you&#x27;re done...the cleanest clean ever!</li>
            <li> It tastes wonderfully minty as well, and left my teeth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> I will probably buy it again, as I am moving to be more chemical free.  </li>
            <li> I must say that this product has surprised me greatly</li>
            <li> is the most important part.</li>
            <li> Now I can get a great cleaning even with a soft brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Fantastic non-fluoride, healthy toothpaste that is minty without being salty.</li>
            <li> Been looking for a natural toothpaste and this one is great.</li>
            <li> Toothpaste has been the latest thing to switch and so far I am absolutely loving this stuff!</li>
            <li> but it is worth buying because it&#x27;s honestly your health</li>
            <li> I finally feel I am using a product that is actually good for me &amp; my teeth!</li>
            <li> It leaves your mouth feeling clean and it has no nasty chemicals.</li>
            <li> It leaves my teeth feeling clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> I love how clean my mouth feels when I use this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> , I feel like my teeth are actually clean, I love the flavor</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and the clay taste is merged with the peppermint</li>
            <li> I liked the toothpaste so much that I bought more.  </li>
            <li> Taste is strong but NOT overpowering.</li>
            <li> The peppermint isn&#x27;t strong but masks a lot of the &amp;#34;muddy&amp;#34; taste I was expecting.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t find it too strong...</li>
            <li> I do find the flavor to be a bit strong.</li>
            <li> At first, I really liked this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a pretty descent toothpaste and a nice transition away from the crest products I had been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hands down this is one of the best toothpaste you can buy from market</li>
            <li> The taste is fine</li>
            <li> It cleans fine</li>
            <li> The taste, texture etc is fine.  </li>
            <li> This product may not be appropriate for consumption by children or pregnant women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t comfortable scrubbing my hair or any part on my body (for that matter) with strong chemicals that were never meant for my body which my body in turn - rejects anyways.</li>
            <li> This product may  not be appropriate for consumption by CHILDREN or pregnant</li>
            <li> So far this toothpaste has been pleasant to use.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick!</li>
            <li> I love thats its healthy and safe and all natural!</li>
            <li> I just hope they don&#x27;t sell the company to some huge no-name corporation that changes the product ingrediants.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read that the Wintergreen mint is stronger than this one--the peppermint isn&#x27;t blasting through your mouth like regularly available toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> If you can get paste these couple of things though I think you&#x27;d really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> The mint flavor is not too strong and my teeth feel so clean after brushing.  </li>
            <li> EarthPaste isn&#x27;t cheap, and I&#x27;m still getting used to its taste (to me the menthol is stronger than the mint).</li>
            <li> others have said, it leaves your teeth SLIPPERY SMOOTH.</li>
            <li> I went fluoride free over a year ago because of the sensitivity and pain I had.</li>
            <li> you want strong, smooth, clean teeth with no chemicals and a light peppermint taste, you&#x27;ve found your oral hygiene match with this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite used to the taste now and enjoy it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I run my tongue over my teeth they are smooth like I had just visited the dentist.</li>
            <li> the Toms, Jason or Natures Gate brand of (Fluoride Free) Toothpaste.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s the point of fluoride free if you&#x27;re getting lead poisoning instead??</li>
            <li> Any chance earthpaste will come out with an unflavored or light flavored paste?</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t see how volcanic ashes are going to keep me cavity free.</li>
            <li> I only read great things about the clay.</li>
            <li> No foaming (no chemicals added), easily rinses and leaves your teeth squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li> Foaming toothpaste has always made me gag, so this alternative is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It is a good product because is natural and doesn&#x27;t had any processed products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more of this!!</li>
            <li> It takes some getting used to but my teeth feel very clean and fresh after I brush.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel very clean after &amp; I feel that the tea tree oil gives my mouth an antiseptic advantage for naturally fresh breath.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this product since I&#x27;m trying to find a replacement to my fluoride free paste that stopped being made.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean and smooth after using it.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> The mouth-feel of this is very nice, it makes your teeth feel spotlessly clean to the point where you can&#x27;t go back.</li>
            <li> No more films teeth in the morning and best of all</li>
            <li> I wasnt too sure about this product at first.</li>
            <li> (They normally use Jack &amp; Jill blueberry paste so they wouldn&#x27;t have liked it anyway.)</li>
            <li> The taste didn&#x27;t bother me, but like most others, I wasn&#x27;t aware of the lead warning until receiving the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that this company was able to make an all natural toothpaste, but it is made from earth (aka dirt), which turns your toothbrush brown, and I ended up getting a cavity after 30 years of being cavity free.</li>
            <li> It leaves your teeth feeling clean and polished.</li>
            <li> your tongue there is no reason your mouth will not feel&lt;br /&gt;fresh and clean after using this</li>
            <li> My mouth feels so clean after using this product.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean.  </li>
            <li> Although it feels clean and is working</li>
            <li> My teeth feel really clean after I brush</li>
            <li> It does not foam, which I know, is clean after I use this</li>
            <li> It leaves your teeth feeling amazingly clean.  </li>
            <li> In fact the taste is quite minty mild and has a smooth consistency.</li>
            <li> Cheaper and tastier and yes, squeaky clean teeth.</li>
            <li> Overall, this toothpaste is enjoyable, health-conscious and effective, but has room for improvement.</li>
            <li> But it seemed like no matter what my mouth just didn&#x27;t feel completely clean.</li>
            <li> It did a great job polishing my teeth while still being gentle on my sensitive gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very different from so many others that I&#x27;ve tried before making my own from scratch.</li>
            <li> This makes my teeth feel really clean.</li>
            <li> It leaves your teeth feeling totally clean.  </li>
            <li> Teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li> Much better than I expected and good whitening</li>
            <li> I like the toothpaste and my teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li> However, I was very surprised how effective it is in whitening your teeth.</li>
            <li> I decided to create my own natural toothpaste instead!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this paste twice so far, and am in love!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very smooth - almost creamy - and feels very nice.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> So nice to finally find a product (sans the fluoride and SLS) that makes your mouth feel minty AND CLEAN!</li>
            <li> listed in this toothpaste; just good ol&#x27; fashioned clay, essential oils and xylitol.</li>
            <li> While there were things I loved about this toothpaste, I could never recommend a toothpaste that actually stains teeth.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t quite get a good coating on my teeth either; however, I attribute this to years of using regular toothpaste products.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this one, but it&#x27;s jus not working for us.&lt;br</li>
            <li> no burns if it goes under your tongue, which is nice for sensitive mouths.</li>
            <li> It kills rats in sizes equal to two pieces of gum and our loved family dog</li>
            <li> But thanks because I like this even better than when Tom&#x27;s was the ticket.  </li>
            <li> Not bad for clay toothpaste</li>
            <li> If this meets Stephanie&#x27;s tight criteria, then it has to be good!</li>
            <li> Mouth and teeth feel extremely clean and smooth after the first tube.  </li>
            <li> absolutely love this paste and feel so much better about using this than a &#x27;regular&#x27; paste full of chemicals and fluoride.</li>
            <li> teeth feel clean and my breath fresh after brushing and rinsing with water.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So fresh, so clean.</li>
            <li> My breath is fresh and my teeth are clean and polished.</li>
            <li> Not for women nursing or pregnant.</li>
            <li> I was told that my sensitivity would return quickly if I stopped using Sensodyne.</li>
            <li> Secondly, I want to make sure it&#x27;s healthy.</li>
            <li> mild flavor and works well.  </li>
            <li> I love how there are no nasty chemicals in it such as glycerin or fluoride.</li>
            <li> I am super picky about my toothpaste and have been since I was a kid.</li>
            <li> I have tried many, many different kinds.  </li>
            <li> Like that it is more healthy than traditional brands.</li>
            <li> Earthpaste is truly the most natural and free of chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been adopting aspects of healthy living steadily into my lifestyle.  </li>
            <li> This is my first fluoride free toothpaste experiment.  </li>
            <li> Tried this toothpaste with my Ion Toothbrush that I recently purchased and I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> So I got the peppermint one and the very first time I tried it</li>
            <li> But all in all I love this toothpaste, my husband loves this toothpaste ( he normal brushes his teeth with hydrogen peroxide and baking soda) and I can&#x27;t wait to adopt our kids so they can use it.</li>
            <li> The taste is OK, but the residue adheres to the bowl of the sunk like concrete.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it much, but its a good alternative, especially if you don&#x27;t have the ingredients or time to make your own natural type.</li>
            <li> After trying many different dental pastes, this is the most natural and safe way to go.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this, and at first, I really did.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re considering teeth-whitening treatments at a dentist or have yellowing that won&#x27;t go away, try this first!</li>
            <li> When I first discovered this toothpaste I was so excited about it.</li>
            <li> If you want to try it, go ahead, but first, buy lemon or cinnamon flavor for kids!</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s best is that it doesn&#x27;t dry out your mouth and tongue like traditional toothpastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> From the first use to now, my teeth always feel clean.</li>
            <li> But with earth paste my teeth felt clean all day and my husband even made a comment how my breath did not smell for the first time in like 6 months.</li>
            <li> It tastes amazing and it doesn&#x27;t feel gritty at all.  </li>
            <li> If the long-term effects are what I am hoping, it will be worth the price.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for a natural toothpaste that does not contain SLS, that offers a good taste, and does the job.  </li>
            <li> For the people who don&#x27;t feel their mouth is fresh they</li>
            <li> This stuff is so truly natural and safe that it is edible.</li>
            <li> wanted to try a more natural alternative to toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice to find something I am not allergic to that actually works well.</li>
            <li> We like that it has many natural things in it.</li>
            <li> A distinct salty taste, from the baking soda I guess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll know in a couple months when I return to the dentist if it helped my teeth to be able to heal my cavities naturally.</li>
            <li> It was the complete lack of effective cleaning that really lost me.</li>
            <li> No artificial anything.</li>
            <li> Mouth didn&#x27;t feel or taste as fresh.</li>
            <li> This is another favorite website of mine for all things natural.</li>
            <li> I really liked the peppermint and cinnamon flavors, I went through 3 tubes total.</li>
            <li> And there are natural ones that foam more.</li>
            <li> Plus its got a nice minty flavor and isn&#x27;t gritty.</li>
            <li> I feel confident that I will continue to use this toothpaste because of the natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> cleans teeth well, leaves mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> Peppermint is my favorite so far.  </li>
            <li> My favorite all natural toothpaste</li>
            <li> I had read about people having success with oral irrigation, so I installed a showerhead-adapted model in my shower.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to receive this toothpaste, because I have been looking for a natural tooth paste that was free of sulfates, glycerin, and fluoride.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m pretty sure the fine clays in the toothpaste are what provides the extra cleaning and whitening</li>
            <li> I also make my own Redmond Clay based toothpaste, but I still enjoy trying other brands time and again just to change things up.</li>
            <li> This is a good way to care for your teeth without all the foaming agents and chemical processing other toothpastes have.</li>
            <li> I can eat and drink right away</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was written right on the box.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean and are much whiter.</li>
            <li> I like that the ingredients are all natural and safe to consume, although I probably would not eat much menthol if I can help it!</li>
            <li> I tried it because I&#x27;m interested in transitioning to more natural bath and body care.</li>
            <li> use a normal amount of paste, and it seems to do just fine.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit high, compared to what I have always paid for toothpaste in the past--but I&#x27;ve always waited for sales that made cheap toothpastes even cheaper and then bought a boxful.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s earthpaste that helped, or just the fact that I transitioned away from my crest products, but either way I&#x27;m happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No fake foam, taste clean, doesn&#x27;t leave too much minty smell in the mouth.</li>
            <li> Nothing better than being pure and washing with natural products.</li>
            <li> This seemed like the perfect toothpaste since it only has a few ingredients.</li>
            <li> The extra cost is well worth it, as this product is so much better for you.</li>
            <li> Most natural toothpastes leave my teeth feeling like they aren&#x27;t very well cleaned.  </li>
            <li> We like this very much ....</li>
            <li> I am so excited for their new kids flavor Lemon Twist.</li>
            <li> but you need to be aware that it may contain lead.</li>
            <li> He agreed that the staining was most likely caused by the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s exactly what this toothpaste reminds me of with the addition of a peppermint oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (they really are whiter, too!).</li>
            <li> No chemicals that I&#x27;m aware.  </li>
            <li> At first I was worried about the whitening ability of this toothpaste because of it&#x27;s color, but I feel my teeth is whiter and cleaner.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> My teeth look healthy and white.  </li>
            <li> Initially I wanted to use more and more because it didn&#x27;t feel like I had enough on my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m pretty accustomed to the &#x27;no foam&#x27; and don&#x27;t feel the need to use a lot of toothpaste.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is another brand at one of the smaller health food stores that I like better.  </li>
            <li> Was an avid Sensodyne Pro Namel user for years.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was the warning printed on the label about the product containing trace amounts of lead...</li>
            <li> The only reason why I rated this product 2 stars instead of 1 is because obviously many people like it.</li>
            <li> I cannot make any claims for rebuilding enamel, but the lack in sensitivity I&#x27;ve been having is supporting evidence.</li>
            <li> Exactly What i Wanted.</li>
            <li> I feel like my teeth are much cleaner and they look whiter!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s safe enough to swallow.</li>
            <li> after getting used to it, I like it SOOO much better than regular toothpase.</li>
            <li> I used this paste for the first time today, but I just didn&#x27;t feel like the toothpaste reached all of my teeth since it doesn&#x27;t foam.</li>
            <li> I had to brush twice and put tons of paste on my toothbrush in order to feel somewhat confident that all my teeth got enough of the paste.</li>
            <li> It has an intense mint flavor that makes my mouth feel extremely fresh.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Noticed this as I was brushing my teeth with it for the first time.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, it does a great job cleaning (unlike another boutique paste, Squiggle, which sucks.)</li>
            <li> I love the simple ingredients, nothing toxic.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like putting things in my mouth that aren&#x27;t considered safe to eat, especially not to give to my kids either.</li>
            <li> Three days into using this exclusivity I was pleasantly surprised to still be comfortable.  </li>
            <li> After finishing my first tube, I am now ordering another.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend it but is you want a refreshing mint flavor....get the wintergreen.</li>
            <li> My mouth is not filled with bubbles and grit, which is a good thing.  </li>
            <li> It is truly natural, detergent and fluoride free and leaves my teeth feeling very clean and white without any pain.  </li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s natural and safe to swallow unlike other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; toothpastes.</li>
            <li> Not only is the ingredient list short, it eliminated my tooth sensitivity, but it quite possibly may be the most effective paste I&#x27;ve ever used (used to be a regular user of the Arm &amp; Hammer baking soda line for that nice polish</li>
            <li> It is natural and my mouth feels clean.</li>
            <li> I will update this if I have a less than favorable dentist visit in the future, but so far I am very happy with Earthpaste!</li>
            <li> will likely go unused because I love earthpaste so much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not uncomfortably minty, but enough that my teeth feel clean and my breath smells fresh.</li>
            <li> I love that such a simple product can do such an effective job.</li>
            <li> Back to my tried and true Desert Essence!</li>
            <li> Would certainly recommend this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Great flavor, Long lasting, Natural</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the dry mouth that some reviewers have mentioned, but thanks to their reviews, I just make sure to rinse with water after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And, I was surprised at how much whiter my teeth are after even just the first use!  </li>
            <li> The ingredient list is totally clean, the product consistency is good and consistent, and (despite looking like a small tube) it goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am pretty sure that ceasing the use of conventional toothpaste with flouride has contributed to the improvement of my health.</li>
            <li> A warning is on the back of the tube; not the detailed description on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Really like this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Did your mom ever make you brush your teeth with straight baking soda when you were a kid?&lt;br /&gt;Mine</li>
            <li> and I was really unsure if I would like it.  </li>
            <li> It takes a bit to get used to how much to use since there is no foaming.  </li>
            <li> Overall, great product, just not a great fit for me.</li>
            <li> I want to like this toothpaste, I really do.</li>
            <li> I also would have appreciated if Amazon showed the warning about there being lead in it (trace amounts, but still..).</li>
            <li> I really like this paste.  </li>
            <li> Fast Shipping!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am trying to remove as much chemical from my day to day life.</li>
            <li> I was absolutely blown away.</li>
            <li> I really like the peppermint Earthpaste.</li>
            <li> so I started using Sensodyne which was very helpful.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner.</li>
            <li> Its not the nicest looking toothpaste in the world, and tends to get all over the sink, but I really like this brand.  </li>
            <li> I use a sonicare toothbrush, and often I would have to skip the tooth or turn the power off and scrub gently, because the nerve pain was shooting.</li>
            <li> so I immediately whipped out the Toms (Fluoride Free) toothpaste that I have been using for years and brushed my teeth.</li>
            <li> My teeth are much whiter than when I started using Earthpaste</li>
            <li> It may be free of chemicals in regular toothpastes but it has trace amounts of lead!</li>
            <li> I really like the winter mint flavor for this toothpaste as well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t taste the peppermint as much as I thought I would</li>
            <li> So I really wanted to like this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I really like this Earthpaste.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very affordable.</li>
            <li> I think its the ease of use from a tube that they really need.  </li>
            <li> That being said I&#x27;m very concerned about the claim of \\&quot;natural\\&quot; when it comes to this toothpaste</li>
            <li> Most Xylitol contains GMO&#x27;s, the process by which it is made is crushed fibers of sugar cane [birchwood or corn..]  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now enjoy using this one in between using my homemade baking soda toothpastes because it&#x27;s non-abrasive (the dentist says that you&#x27;re not supposed to brush your teeth daily with baking soda because it scratches away at the enamel by using it too often).</li>
            <li> Bummed, because I really wanted to like it.</li>
            <li> Note: I like how they say on the back label &amp;#34;feel free to swallow or spit Earthpaste out after brushing&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Why would anyone use lead in there mouth, I don&#x27;t care how much.</li>
            <li> Which is also why it&#x27;s important to always put the cap back on after using it</li>
            <li> It cleans very well, leaves my mouth feeling refreshed and there&#x27;s no foaming agents, flouride or sugar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this toothpaste once so far, but I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> so I have been following up with baking soda, and actually, my teeth feel way cleaner with just good old baking soda.  </li>
            <li> After two weeks of using this toothpaste I noticed my gums were sensitive and even one of my top teeth was starting to hurt.</li>
            <li> I tried to switch from commercial toothpaste to a more natural toothpaste before this</li>
            <li> It has some occasional gritty specs, but I kind of grew to like it.  </li>
            <li> but this is a good substitute in the mean time.</li>
            <li> EXCEPT I&#x27;ve noticed my mouth becoming BONE dry at night.  </li>
            <li> We are trained our whole entire life if something doesn&#x27;t suds than it is not getting it clean, even toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I was inspired by this product to research bentonite clay and start incorporating more of it in my health and beauty in other ways too.  </li>
            <li> Better by miles than Crest and all those other poisons.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I found this in my local health food store, because it seemed to be what I had been searching for.</li>
            <li> Why would anyone presume it&#x27;s okay to put harmful chemicals and other additives in your mouth at the frequency</li>
            <li> I was a devoted Tom&#x27;s of Maine customer for years, back when they still sold the toothpaste in the metal tubes and had the original formula.</li>
            <li> I tried it with both a regular and sonic toothbrush, and my teeth did not feel exceptionally clean.  </li>
            <li> update December 19, 2013:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not noticed any reenamelization of teeth, however, no decay has occurred and they are still white and clean.</li>
            <li> Cons: Earthpaste does have a strange, kind of slimy texture, really is similar to liquidy mud, and doesn&#x27;t bubble.</li>
            <li> Earthpaste has been my first foray into natural toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> This is my first experience with an all natural toothpaste</li>
            <li> My teeth also feel nice and slick.</li>
            <li> It Was New, Wrapped And Delivered Fast.</li>
            <li> I have some odd allergies that keep me from using most toothpastes.</li>
            <li> About a year and a half ago, I noticed the gums on my top two incisors were receding.</li>
            <li> Finally a toothpaste safe enough for my house.</li>
            <li> This might taste good to some, but we tried to use it only a few times.  </li>
            <li> A quick trip to Earthpastes website and a look in the FAQ section immediately explained and relieved my concerns about the lead warning but the fact that it seems to aggravate the gums so badly is a definite reason not to buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching high and low for a natural, fluoride free toothpaste that everyone will use.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I found it through an organic beauty blog that highly reccommended it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I highly recommend buying a tube of Earth Paste and trying it out to see if it is for you.</li>
            <li> Color of toothpaste highly disagreeable.  </li>
            <li> The price is quite high as well.  </li>
            <li> Just remove if it is naturally occurring!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s also not as strong as some of the other clay toothpaste alternatives that are out there.  </li>
            <li> The thinner, non-foaming consistency takes a little getting used to; the first week I was stopping in the middle of brushing to add more toothpaste because I didn&#x27;t feel like I had covered my whole mouth.</li>
            <li> None are bad, but I think mint is the best.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate the natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> They are not receding as much as before and are not overly red but a healthy pink tone now.</li>
            <li> I feel a gunk built up on my teeth already with normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I found that I preferred this type of consistency over normal</li>
            <li> I personally feel it&#x27;s worth the investment</li>
            <li> With no foaming ingredient, it, of course, isn&#x27;t something we get normally.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently switched back to my old toothpaste and it works a lot better for me.</li>
            <li> The paste itself is normal toothpaste consistency.  </li>
            <li> I love that it has so few ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> The taste is also just fine, it&#x27;s minty and sweet, but not nearly as sweet as the commercial toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I knew that it was a better option than other tooth pastes because it is completely all natural.</li>
            <li> My teeth are smooth and shiny afterward, even without the glycerin other toothpastes include.  </li>
            <li> Personally I thought changing my toothpaste wouldn&#x27;t make much of a difference in life at all, but it&#x27;s really provided a lot of benefits in our life.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t consider that important enough to detract from this terrific product.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t know whether it is totally effective until a few months from now, but the taste and consistency are not too much different from &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I got this to incorporate as part of my regimen for helping to heal my recently diagnosed hypothyroidism and I must say I like this brand very much.</li>
            <li> Its expensive and is gone too quickly but other than that its great.</li>
            <li> No more of that, decided to either chew bark or find a better toothpaste.</li>
            <li> most toothpastes have bleachers or other additives to make them white.</li>
            <li> Finally something that the whole family can use!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m actually very tempted right now to brush my teeth a third time...using commercial toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Not sure if anyone else has had this reaction, and honestly I can&#x27;t find ANY articles or reviews that say something similar to my experience.</li>
            <li> This leaves my mouth feeling clean without all the strange additives in traditional toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Only downside is that it takes a little more scrubbing to remove residue from the sink.</li>
            <li> Since I started using Earth Paste my teeth have not once experienced pain from heat or cold.</li>
            <li> and then I cough to clear my airway.</li>
            <li> I looked in to alternatives to colgate and crest because the regular toothpastes were causing my teeth to be really heat/cold sensitive.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are not only natural, but edible, whole and beneficial.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this toothpaste because I needed a natural toothpaste that would not irritate my rosacea.</li>
            <li> I have never had any staining on my teeth before and was quite surprised to find this occurring.</li>
            <li> I do miss the foaming action, but I expected this, because it&#x27;s a natural toothpaste with no artificial foam-producing additives.  </li>
            <li> They started bleeding and I developed some canker sores after about a week of use.</li>
            <li> And not naming names, but all those hard-to-pronounce ingredients simulating natural products made me wonder just what I was trying not to accidentally swallow.</li>
            <li> For starters, I have ALWAYS had sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Well, I have to say that I dont have nearly as sensitive teeth since using this product.</li>
            <li> And I know using this all natural product</li>
            <li> I was actually surprised by this.</li>
            <li> Wanted to go all natural and was recommended this by a paleo blogger.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li> I scanned the barcode to read reviews on Amazon, and saw that some people had experience a reduction in pain with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old brushes with it too.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive teeth or gums</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just soft feeling...</li>
            <li> #34;Mmm, toothpaste is yummy!&amp;#34; (They&#x27;re 2 years old)</li>
            <li> No fluoride, all natural.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old son and toddler daughter suffer from tooth decay caused by Celiac Disease.  </li>
            <li> It might be natural....</li>
            <li> Now if I could just convince my 9 year old.</li>
            <li> I am always on the lookout for a non-fluoride, natural toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying again and also giving as a gift to family members who are looking for a natural, quality toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, this toothpaste was recommended by a natural product company called Bubble &amp; Bee.  </li>
            <li> I had no trouble adapting to the change, which I can&#x27;t always say at 65 years old.  </li>
            <li> I have receded gums because of crowns in my mouth and the exposed dental tissue is extremely sensitive.  </li>
            <li> ALL toothpastes, including Tom&#x27;s of Maine and The Natural Dentist make me cringe with pain as I brush.  </li>
            <li> , it contains Xylitol and there is nothing natural about Xylitol</li>
            <li> I developed a toothpaste allergy.</li>
            <li> Smoother than any of the &#x27;natural&#x27; toothpastes I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted an all natural toothpaste</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how helpful it is in &amp;#34;restructuring&amp;#34; enamel, but I feel confident that the ingredients at least aren&#x27;t damaging it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it about a week now so far and see no need to ever use anything else again.</li>
            <li> As others have noted, the natural color and fact that it doesn&#x27;t foam may take some getting used to for some, but these things don&#x27;t phase me at all.</li>
            <li> The end product is a bleached, powdery blend of sugar alcohols that taste sweet on the tongue but are not absorbed by the body.</li>
            <li> but since I am used to making my own, I found its consistency too thin.</li>
            <li> It does taste good and I am hoping it will indeed remineralize my teeth and gums and help me prevent expensive dental treatments.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only bought this, originally, because it was the most expensive toothpaste on the shelf</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t clean well and was messy.</li>
            <li> It is a little hard to get used to not having the foam, but so far good.</li>
            <li> Okay so I was a little skeptical when I bought it even though it has had phenomenal reviews from everyone.</li>
            <li> And overall, I really do like it, especially because it is natural.  </li>
            <li> my teeth are almost back to normal.</li>
            <li> Al that is needed is a normal ribbed and smal flip-open cap that flips open with one&#x27;s thumb.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m a serious coffee drinker, so white hasn&#x27;t ever really been an option, but this toothpaste has done better, already, than toothpastes that promise whitening effects, and I&#x27;ve only had it a couple days.)  </li>
            <li> I tried a few other natural pastes, but wasn&#x27;t satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is our new toothpaste of choice, and I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> It will now be my new regular brand.  </li>
            <li> So I finally figured it was time to look for something new.  </li>
            <li> I actually didn&#x27;t want to like it, but it is much healthier than the regular toothpastes.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a bit pricey compared to the 99 cent tubes of paste my dad used to pick up at Walmart and even Tom&#x27;s, but one tube lasts our 2 person family close to 6 months, and when you think about the importance of oral care and it&#x27;s impact on your daily wellbeing, I&#x27;d much rather spend the occasional 7 bucks then deal with dental</li>
            <li> I switched back to Sensodyne after using this because my teeth developed a mild sensitivity to cold (have experienced this in the past).</li>
            <li> Finally, an all natural toothpaste fluoride-free and glycerin-free!</li>
            <li> I am a major fan of bentonite clay and it&#x27;s healing properties</li>
            <li> It is slightly more watery than other brands and might splatter a little.</li>
            <li> This paste makes a bit of a mess in the sink but it is so worth it.  </li>
            <li> However, I still give it 5 stars because I have consistently bought it over the last 2 years and have been unable to find anything better.</li>
            <li> As soon as I switched back to conventional toothpaste, my teeth returned to their original, whiter color, though only after awhile.</li>
            <li> I realize this is my issue and likely comes from my lifelong use of more foamy toothpastes, but it turns out I like something that foams a little bit.</li>
            <li> The stains had to be removed professionally but my teeth have now been restored to their former color.</li>
            <li> this was the only toothpast I could find that is truely natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally found a natural toothpaste that whitens my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I gave this toothpaste the old college try for over a week until I couldn&#x27;t bear how gross my mouth felt upon waking anymore.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using a soft bristle toothbrush to prevent gum erosion, but was not feeling the same smoothness as I used to.</li>
            <li> It sits in my bathroom next to another natural toothpaste</li>
            <li> I have another tube of a different natural toothpaste I was going to try that</li>
            <li> Screwing and unscrewing this open and closed every time is a REAL PAIN!  </li>
            <li> I may attempt to make my own toothpaste, as it isn&#x27;t difficult with coconut oil</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been desperate to find a good substitute and, thank goodness,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need fake lather and weird chemical flavors/fragrances in my toothpaste, I just need it to clean my teeth and get out of there.&lt;br /&gt;Earthpaste does a great cleaning job and tastes just dandy!&lt;br /&gt;Side</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how similar it is to commercial toothpaste, without the problems I have with it.</li>
            <li> As far as the product is concerned the one thing you have to remember is that it&#x27;s not &#x27;foamy&#x27; like the traditional commercial toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> The descriptions on this website and on the box itself list only \\&quot;essential oils,\\&quot; which naturally I assumed was the peppermint oil that gives it flavor.  </li>
            <li> I usually always have a tube of this on hand for those lazy days that I don&#x27;t feel like making my own toothpaste for the house.</li>
            <li> I noticed whiter teeth after just a few brushings and my teeth still feel just as clean as with regular toothpaste all day long.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave an extreme minty feel in your mouth like other toothpastes, but it is something you will quickly gets used to.</li>
            <li> so I can not figure out why they have decided to add such a compound to the product other than it&#x27;s only positive quality ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Earthpaste for almost 3 weeks and so far my teeth are not sensitive.</li>
            <li> I am passionate about natural health, though, and have read claims about glycerin coating your teeth.</li>
            <li> I have been using sensitive toothpaste off and on for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> First of all it is a hydrogenated with the catalyst nickel, can you say Heavy Metal?  </li>
            <li> The peppermint flavor is more subtle than I expected, but I like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overwhelming with the mint flavor, but just enough to give you the fresh</li>
            <li> So, who knows if this success is due to the toothpaste or other factors, but I&#x27;d like to think this played a role in my dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> It tastes a little different, but that didn&#x27;t bother me after the first couple times I brushed with it.</li>
            <li> I only use a very small amount of Earthpaste and my teeth always feel completely clean.  </li>
            <li> My teeth also felt half as clean as usual, and a few days after using this product consistently, I began having a severe ongoing tooth ache.</li>
            <li> I was never able to get that perpetually clean feeling back, so I started trying other brands that were glycerin and fluoride</li>
            <li> Not good for pregnant woman or kids</li>
            <li> My gums, on the other hand, are completely torn apart.</li>
            <li> It is all natural and does not contain surfactants that other mainstream toothpastes contain.</li>
            <li> I put off getting a dental cleaning for a year due to moving and busy lifestyle, and was worried that I would have a cavity.</li>
            <li> Apparently I&#x27;m not the only person who likes this.</li>
            <li> But the absence of toxic chemicals is what sold me.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend and you can get it a little cheaper on Vitacost.  </li>
            <li> I strive to keep my house as chemical and natural as possible, but sometimes I find it&#x27;s just not worth the effort.</li>
            <li> we brush our teeth and not expect this action to have an impact on their health later down the road?</li>
            <li> First off, the appearance and texture are very different from conventional toothpastes, since they don&#x27;t use any of the foaming or coloring agents, so that might take a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> Two weeks later I threw the half tube of sensitive toothpaste in the bin.  </li>
            <li> long lasting</li>
            <li> And because the toothpaste is made from essential oils, the oils cling to the gums longer, continuing to do their job long after the toothbrush leaves the mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m slowly making the switch to all natural products, and in doing my research, I found that this was one of the only toothpastes on the market that was truly natural.</li>
            <li> Interestingly enough, when I went in for a mandated dental checkup, the dental technician commented that it was unusual for him to see teeth like mine with such thick dentin.</li>
            <li> I have used it for over a month and my teeth are less sensitive.</li>
            <li> I really dont like the brown color that you spit out after you brush, but that would be my only complaint about this product.</li>
            <li> One tube with a single ribbon of paste (I admit, I only brush once a day when I get up in the morning)</li>
            <li> I have been loyal to the Young Living Thieves Dentarome Ultra for several years, but it&#x27;s been increasingly OUT OF STOCK and difficult to order, as well as ridiculously overpriced with insanely high shipping costs.  </li>
            <li> After reading other reviews, I knew it wasn&#x27;t going to be an issue of grittiness or taste for me (though it might be for my family; I might try different flavors to get them away from commercial products) but I was worried about Xylitol.  </li>
            <li> A little gritty but only contains clay and essential oil.  </li>
            <li> I was really surprised how this ugly brown paste could make my teeth feel so clean, I am sold!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strange.</li>
            <li> I also suffered from minor tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on a toothpaste carousel, trying to find something natural, with few ingredients - and nothing created in a lab.</li>
            <li> If you eat a lot of starchy carbohydrate foods, this might not work for you either in the long term.</li>
            <li> The color is a bit strange, but I was prepared for that after reading a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was a life long Crest user, but wanted to start using something that had fewer chemicals, and no fluoride.  </li>
            <li> There is no natural in Xylitol.  </li>
            <li> Peppermint is not very flavorful, so I may order the Wintergreen next time, as was suggested by another reviewer.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take long at all to get used to.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t have glycerin -- I&#x27;m not sure that there are any other glycerin-free toothpastes out there -- what a difference the exclusion of that ingredient makes!</li>
            <li> My teeth became very sensitive several years ago (to hot, cold, acidic food, even air sometimes)</li>
            <li> A real plus, a lot less messy, for electric toothbrushing.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few other natural toothpastes, but I have always had to use the sensitive a few times a week</li>
            <li> I used to get spots on my teeth from fluoride and a dry mouth, and with this it whitens and cleans so well without giving me spots or a dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m talking dry.  </li>
            <li> Lately, I&#x27;ve been in the process of transitioning all of my personal care products from \\&quot;natural\\&quot; stuff to truly natural products.</li>
            <li> It was different than conventional.</li>
            <li> With conventional toothpaste, even when I did brush at night before bed, I still had a yuchy white film all over my teeth when I got up in the morning.</li>
            <li> This is definitley different from your average toothpaste, and takes some getting used to as it doesnt foam.</li>
            <li> good toothpaste, no fluoride or other crap.</li>
            <li> At the time I had been using this paste for about a year in addition to regularly drinking raw milk and occasionally taking fermented cod liver oil.</li>
            <li> It is also very different than commercial toothpaste when you brush as there is very little paste when you spit.</li>
            <li> I am not trying to bash crest products, but crest is the only brand of toothpaste I have been using for the past 12 years, therefore the only thing I had to compare earthpaste to.</li>
            <li> I typically had phases of sensitivity and normality with the tooth, so I waited, hoping it was going to last.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The American Cancer Society website says this about tea tree oil, the hidden ingredient: \\&quot;Tea tree oil is toxic when swallowed.</li>
            <li> Finally a good toothpaste that isn&#x27;t bad for you!</li>
            <li> Was skeptical at first but know I&#x27;m sold!</li>
            <li> I found that my gums bleed a little sometimes when I use this, but overall seem healthier than before I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I was aware of this prior to buying but thought I&#x27;d give it a shot because of conventional toothpaste&#x27;s questionable ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> which just means you don&#x27;t wet your brush before brushing.</li>
            <li> Minus one star for the price; they seem to charge a lot for a tube of dirt.</li>
            <li> There was absolutely no type of lather or foam.  </li>
            <li> Took them 3 tries.</li>
            <li> The paste is brown, like the earth and really, no taste.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find the transition rough at all.  </li>
            <li> , those are things you can&#x27;t find in your regular everyday toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> so I made a mental note to keep my kids from using it.</li>
            <li> Be careful when you squeeze, however.</li>
            <li> BUT my husband and children never really cared for it.  </li>
            <li> like there&#x27;s minimal toothpaste.</li>
            <li> the flavor is to be expected, but I did not feel that my teeth were cleaned.  </li>
            <li> However it&#x27;s not very pepperminty.</li>
            <li> This was money well spent, and I see no reason to ever return to store-bought fluoride toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It has been reported to cause drowsiness, confusion, hallucinations, coma, unsteadiness, weakness, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach upset, blood cell abnormalities, and severe rashes.</li>
            <li> The taste is not strong and the product does not foam like regular toothpaste making it easier to brush with.</li>
            <li> If you want to use a natural toothpaste that is free of the nasty, harsh chemicals that normal toothpaste has, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t last me as long as a tube of conventional toothpaste, and for the price I am not sure I can continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> Never going back to conventional toothpaste!!</li>
            <li> I use coconut oil with my bentonite clay, in addition to the other ingredients</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with my other brand even though it has Carrageenan.</li>
            <li> It took some getting used to, but now I can&#x27;t imagine using any other toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I need the flouride in other toothpaste which this does not have.</li>
            <li> This product contains trace amounts of lead, a substance know to the State of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm.</li>
            <li> In fact, we prefer it to all other brands of mainstream toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> I had a tooth whitening appointment, not just regular tooth cleaning, booked a few months after my trip, which I ended up cancelling since the stains on my teeth had disappeared!  </li>
            <li> I would use this toothpaste over all other brands.  </li>
            <li> This product contains trace amounts of led, a substance known to the State of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm.</li>
            <li> I was a bit wary of the taste since this is the first clay-based toothpaste I have tried.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t changed a thing about my routine other than the tooth paste.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try the other flavors as well.  </li>
            <li> My teeth just feel stronger than when I used other toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a non toxic toothpaste other than Tom&#x27;s</li>
            <li> and I always reach for the other and not this one.  </li>
            <li> The taste was weird at first since there is no sweetener.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, and worried about the taste but</li>
            <li> Once I got past the puckering harshness of that paste (compared to the commercial stuff I grew up with)</li>
            <li> I do use this one, maybe 1x/wk, but mostly just to not have it go bad and have wasted money on it.</li>
            <li> Being genetically gifted with poor tooth enamel, I am inherently skeptical about any toothpaste&#x27;s claim to whiten teeth.  </li>
            <li> a multi-step chemical reaction that involves the use of sulfuric acid, calcium oxide, phosphoric acid and active charcoal.</li>
            <li> But be careful, it makes a mess in your sink.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a toothpaste without a big negative.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The fluoride controversy is confusing, but fluoride didn&#x27;t seem to be helping me; I was still getting cavities despite following my dentist&#x27;s recommendation to use fluoride toothpaste, fluoride mouthwash, and prevident along with flossing, using a rubber tip and proxabrush, and cleanings every 3 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to wait until my exam next spring to see if Earthpaste makes a difference, but as long as it doesn&#x27;t make things much worse</li>
            <li> However, Tom&#x27;s of Maine got bought out by some conglomerate a couple years ago and changed their formula to something icky and closely resembling commercial toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I have a love hate relationship with this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a molar where the gums receded a bit and the little gap between enamel and gum is extremely sensitive/painful.</li>
            <li> I was hooked; I could even skip brushing my teeth every other day!</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste, it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of things I can barely pronounce (or even worse, know what they are and consider them questionable to put in my mouth).  </li>
            <li> Takes a few days to get used to the taste, but now I won&#x27;t use any other paste.</li>
            <li> Nothing I tried got rid of the brown and black stains on my teeth.</li>
            <li> However, since I have tried to change my lifestyle and use less chemicals, I thought I would give this a try.</li>
            <li> I have a slight build up of plaque in some places</li>
            <li> Less mouth peeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all about being healthier and using less chemicals</li>
            <li> I think if the price was a dollar or two less</li>
            <li> I typically use Desert Essence Wintergreen and Neem toothpaste (which I would give 5 stars)</li>
            <li> I tend to have really bad breath specially since I am a smoker and after I have one cigarette</li>
            <li> It cleans the teeth well and is not full of unwanted chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I would have given 5 stars if the price were just a little less.</li>
            <li> I have dry mouth, will the clay and salt affect my mouth negatively?</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t foam up which took me a little bit to get used to.</li>
            <li> so it will take a little getting used to and it will have a tendency to want to slide off your toothbrush...</li>
            <li> I always seem to have a new cavity every time I go to the dentist, they easily yellow, and I get bad sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I NEVER have problems with my gums or canker sores (unless I eat very unhealthy), and I wanted to give my mouth some time to get used to this new paste, so thought that this might be a temporary reaction.</li>
            <li> I just press it on a little with my finger &amp; wet it under some slow flowing water.  </li>
            <li> Not really, I can smell the peppermint, but I can hardly taste it.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line?</li>
            <li> First couple uses after the transition from &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; toothpaste to Earthpaste were a bit unpleasant</li>
            <li> When it came in I was reading the box while telling my family about it, because I wanted to tell them how few ingredients were in it.</li>
            <li> While my teeth were getting healthier, they were still missing some minerals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This took me a few uses to get used to.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never had your teeth squeak, you&#x27;re missing out.</li>
            <li> The fact that the peppermint flavor is spiked with a heavy salt flavor wasn&#x27;t the deal breaker.</li>
            <li> A few people were complaining about the tooth and gum sensitivity</li>
            <li> This has happened over the years with a few products I used to use i.e. Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s, Tom&#x27;s of Maine.</li>
            <li> will update in a few months re:</li>
            <li> Heavy mineral lead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan quite yet.</li>
            <li> My understanding is that this is a sweetening agent, but I was worried that this would mean I was going to end up with that non-sugar sweetener aftertaste that ALL non-sugar sweeteners have (even sucralose, which would be my preference if I had to reach for something other than sugar or honey).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We where looking for something that was not full of chemicals we should not be consuming!</li>
            <li> I bought an expensive, many-in-one brand the other day and it dried my throat so much and had such a bad aftertaste that I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste irritated my tongue pretty badly after a while.</li>
            <li> Tried it for a few weeks,  couldn&#x27;t get past the feeling I was brushing with mud.  </li>
            <li> So, I decided to try this, but fully expected to have to go back to my Sensodyne due to the painful sensitivity</li>
            <li> It is a bit weird to spit the paste out and see brown instead of white (the toothpaste is</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I am having an allergic reaction to it.</li>
            <li> I usually have to get floride rubbed on my gums for receeding gum lines when I go to the dentist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is noticable to others, but when looking in the mirror</li>
            <li> Sending all 8 of them back and getting my money back!. :(</li>
            <li> I read several reviews when I purchased this and expected the toothpaste to be very difficult to get used to since there are no foaming agents</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the toothpaste caused this, but i have a feeling it did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it the past year or so</li>
            <li> I am not much satisfied with it, but I will continue using it coz</li>
            <li> And no more sensitivity or bleeding gums.</li>
            <li> I bought this and did not see the small print label.  </li>
            <li> The slippery, wide and large cap is terrible and a waste of plastic.  </li>
            <li> but there is hardly any taste.</li>
            <li> A bit hard to get used to...</li>
            <li> comparing it with the evil toothpastes available in&lt;br /&gt;the market.</li>
            <li> I decided to continue use for at least two or three weeks.</li>
            <li> Lately I have been coughing after brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> One point of interest with some of the negative reviews was the &amp;</li>
            <li> and I was always afraid of them getting a hold of my &#x27;regular&#x27; toothpaste.</li>
            <li> If you do research, you&#x27;ll understand what I mean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and has little flavor and is a weird consistency.</li>
            <li> Apparently Xylitol makes me really sick and for some people is tied to inflammatory response in the gut.</li>
            <li> and I like the subtle peppermint taste.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to take fluoride seriously you have to take all things bad for human consumption seriously.</li>
            <li> Last night around 3:30 in the morning my gums hurt so bad</li>
            <li> When I saw my dentist, he was shocked at the amount of staining that took place since my last visit.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars due to the artificial sweetner.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I&#x27;ve only used it a handful of times because I just learned that there is 11.9 parts per million lead in the clay that that is the base of the toothpaste...  </li>
            <li> Not happy</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t want to eat all the crap I just brushed off my mouth too, ew, hah.</li>
            <li> I know this tooth paste is not supposed to taste like main stream toothpaste but for my liking, it just tasted and felt awful when using.  </li>
            <li> None of the artificial taste that comes with ordinary toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> It looks like mud, I have to use a ton of it to feel like it&#x27;s cleaning my teeth, my kids hate it, and it seems to dry my mouth</li>
            <li> but I find this product a bit weird...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after about a month of use I began to notice stains on my teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;4 stars for being expensive</li>
            <li> Be wary.</li>
            <li> you cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> Sorry I do not have the name of that one.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve only used it a handful of times since buying it because it tastes terrible...  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong?</li>
            <li> Cold fruit and ice was something I always avoided because of tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li> my teeth are still dirty.</li>
            <li> so I could continue to drink cold water.  </li>
            <li> Bad idea.</li>
            <li> Too bad I had problems with shipping it here.</li>
            <li> My teeth are whiter, my mouth feels cleaner, it&#x27;s combated bad breath and helps my breath to stay fresher longer.  </li>
            <li> Not too bad.  </li>
            <li> Goodbye Tom&#x27;s of Maine, too bad you changed your recipe and without telling us either.  </li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I will try another one &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> Try it, you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The lead content bothers me but it is a clay base</li>
            <li> No residual toothpaste taste to make the OJ taste like crap.  </li>
            <li> and I hated it.</li>
            <li> He was disappointed when I said I hadn&#x27;t touched fluoride, but the results were speaking for themselves!</li>
            <li> but I thought it was too nasty to use.</li>
            <li> but the tube is terrible.  </li>
            <li> this product is horrible.</li>
            <li> This stuff was horrible.  </li>
            <li> The lack of foam takes some getting used to, but it isn&#x27;t terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I picked this up after trying to make my own clay toothpaste, and quickly discovered that this falls in the category of things one is much better off just buying rather than trying to make. The ingredient list is totally clean, the product consistency is good and consistent, and (despite looking like a small tube) it goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having tried a couple flavors now, I definitely recommend the mint. None are bad, but I think mint is the best. It leaves your mouth feeling very clean, as well. This is our new toothpaste of choice, and I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Excellent natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li> We love our EarthPaste! My teeth feel so clean and are much whiter. I think next time I would prefer the lemon flavor, as there is no added sweetener. I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Good toothpaste but you need to be aware that it may contain lead. A warning is on the back of the tube; not the detailed description on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Not bad for clay toothpaste but since I am used to making my own, I found its consistency too thin. I use coconut oil with my bentonite clay, in addition to the other ingredients so it gives it more of a &amp;#34;paste-y&amp;#34; feeling but if you&#x27;re not ready for homemaking your toothpaste yet, it&#x27;s a great minty option with good wholesome ingredients.</li>
            <li> This leaves my mouth feeling clean without all the strange additives in traditional toothpaste.  It is a bit weird to spit the paste out and see brown instead of white (the toothpaste is clay based so has a clay color to it).</li>
            <li> They sell this at Walgreens now and I was so stoked to see it here on Amazon! Love that it&#x27;s natural and safe to swallow unlike other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; toothpastes. There&#x27;s no SLS or &amp;#34;Flavor&amp;#34;, etc. listed in this toothpaste; just good ol&#x27; fashioned clay, essential oils and xylitol.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t love this toothpaste. It&#x27;s thick and has little flavor and is a weird consistency. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, although I love the fact it&#x27;s non-toxic compared to many on the market. I&#x27;ll stick with my other brand even though it has Carrageenan.</li>
            <li> i think xylotool hurts teeth.  does not whiten at all.</li>
            <li> Others might disagree with my opinion but I find this product a bit weird... I decided to create my own natural toothpaste instead! Baking soda &amp; Coconut oil! Try it, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> This is definitley different from your average toothpaste, and takes some getting used to as it doesnt foam. But the fact that its all natural and has no flouride makes my hippie self very happy! I guess im a mud mouth now. :)</li>
            <li> Love love love this!!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite flavor. It took some getting used to, but now I can&#x27;t imagine using any other toothpaste. My kids use it too!</li>
            <li> tastes better than it looks &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> I ordered this toothpaste because I needed a natural toothpaste that would not irritate my rosacea. At first, I really liked this toothpaste. It was different than conventional. It does not foam but it did have a nice minty taste. Truly, I could easily have loved this toothpaste and switched permanently. Unfortunately, after about a month of use I began to notice stains on my teeth. I have never had any staining on my teeth before and was quite surprised to find this occurring. Nothing I tried got rid of the brown and black stains on my teeth. This toothpaste was the only change in my oral care. When I saw my dentist, he was shocked at the amount of staining that took place since my last visit. He agreed that the staining was most likely caused by the toothpaste. The stains had to be removed professionally but my teeth have now been restored to their former color. While there were things I loved about this toothpaste, I could never recommend a toothpaste that actually stains teeth.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t foam which you&#x27;ll need to get used to. Nice scent. Makes my teeth whiter than the &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; toothpastes. I&#x27;ve started &amp;#34;dry brushing&amp;#34; which just means you don&#x27;t wet your brush before brushing. This helps your saliva gland to work. Was skeptical at first but know I&#x27;m sold!</li>
            <li> Really like this toothpaste. It doesn&#x27;t foam up which took me a little bit to get used to. It leaves your teeth feeling clean and polished. I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> Earthpaste has been my first foray into natural toothpaste.  After reading other reviews, I knew it wasn&#x27;t going to be an issue of grittiness or taste for me (though it might be for my family; I might try different flavors to get them away from commercial products) but I was worried about Xylitol.  My understanding is that this is a sweetening agent, but I was worried that this would mean I was going to end up with that non-sugar sweetener aftertaste that ALL non-sugar sweeteners have (even sucralose, which would be my preference if I had to reach for something other than sugar or honey).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read that the Wintergreen mint is stronger than this one--the peppermint isn&#x27;t blasting through your mouth like regularly available toothpaste.  (this might be a bonus for me, as my child screams about regular toothpaste burning her mouth if we&#x27;re not using her toddler toothpaste.)  It&#x27;s there, it&#x27;s pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all: good flavor, good feel.  I do miss the foaming action, but I expected this, because it&#x27;s a natural toothpaste with no artificial foam-producing additives.  My teeth are smooth and shiny afterward, even without the glycerin other toothpastes include.  And, I was surprised at how much whiter my teeth are after even just the first use!  (I&#x27;m a serious coffee drinker, so white hasn&#x27;t ever really been an option, but this toothpaste has done better, already, than toothpastes that promise whitening effects, and I&#x27;ve only had it a couple days.)  I haven&#x27;t had the dry mouth that some reviewers have mentioned, but thanks to their reviews, I just make sure to rinse with water after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering the price... it&#x27;s a bit high, compared to what I have always paid for toothpaste in the past--but I&#x27;ve always waited for sales that made cheap toothpastes even cheaper and then bought a boxful.  If the long-term effects are what I am hoping, it will be worth the price.</li>
            <li> Did your mom ever make you brush your teeth with straight baking soda when you were a kid?&lt;br /&gt;Mine Did... and that&#x27;s exactly what this toothpaste reminds me of with the addition of a peppermint oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I think it feels like it works well and has a refreshing feeling because of the peppermint oil. It takes some getting used to both because of the look and the feeling. It is brown - there&#x27;s no getting around that! Also, it doesn&#x27;t foam like the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothpaste. If you can get paste these couple of things though I think you&#x27;d really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste, it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of things I can barely pronounce (or even worse, know what they are and consider them questionable to put in my mouth).  The taste is fine and I feel like it does a good job cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> I found that my gums bleed a little sometimes when I use this, but overall seem healthier than before I purchased it. They are not receding as much as before and are not overly red but a healthy pink tone now. I like the pleasant, refreshing peppermint flavor. I like that the ingredients are all natural and safe to consume, although I probably would not eat much menthol if I can help it! This is my first fluoride free toothpaste experiment.  My teeth feel clean and smooth after using it. I can eat and drink right away and it doesn&#x27;t disturb the flavor of my breakfast. It didn&#x27;t last me as long as a tube of conventional toothpaste, and for the price I am not sure I can continue to buy it. I am looking into making my own recipe with some of the ingredients.  I was inspired by this product to research bentonite clay and start incorporating more of it in my health and beauty in other ways too.  I would have given 5 stars if the price were just a little less.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for a natural toothpaste that does not contain SLS, that offers a good taste, and does the job.  This product is it! It cleans the teeth well and is not full of unwanted chemicals.  Would certainly recommend this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Great for you with none of the junk. Good consistency and taste also!</li>
            <li> awesome taste, texture, natural and chemical free toothpaste!</li>
            <li> For the people who don&#x27;t feel their mouth is fresh they&lt;br /&gt;are comparing it with the evil toothpastes available in&lt;br /&gt;the market. Please read all the ingredients and decide for&lt;br /&gt;you self.&lt;br /&gt;Hands down this is one of the best toothpaste you can buy from market&lt;br /&gt;ingredients wise. If you floss, brush your teeth properly and also&lt;br /&gt;clean your tongue there is no reason your mouth will not feel&lt;br /&gt;fresh and clean after using this toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars for being expensive otherwise I would definitely&lt;br /&gt;give it 5 stars!!!</li>
            <li> My mouth feels so clean after using this product.  I will probably buy it again</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with an all natural toothpaste and I was really unsure if I would like it.  I am so happy I bought this.  It tastes amazing and it doesn&#x27;t feel gritty at all.  It takes a bit to get used to how much to use since there is no foaming.  My teeth feel so clean.  I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I need the flouride in other toothpaste which this does not have.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this, and at first, I really did. I&#x27;m slowly making the switch to all natural products, and in doing my research, I found that this was one of the only toothpastes on the market that was truly natural. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now, and my teeth look great (they really are whiter, too!). My gums, on the other hand, are completely torn apart. They started bleeding and I developed some canker sores after about a week of use. I NEVER have problems with my gums or canker sores (unless I eat very unhealthy), and I wanted to give my mouth some time to get used to this new paste, so thought that this might be a temporary reaction. I decided to continue use for at least two or three weeks. I started rinsing my mouth with coconut oil (for it&#x27;s antibacterial and antimicrobial properties) after brushing. That cleared my mouth up for a couple of weeks, but has now stopped working. Now I have more bleeding and sores and nothing is helping. Not sure if anyone else has had this reaction, and honestly I can&#x27;t find ANY articles or reviews that say something similar to my experience. Overall, great product, just not a great fit for me. I&#x27;ll be making my own toothpaste from now on.</li>
            <li> This product is great except for the Xylitol. If you don&#x27;t mind it, then it is probably. I tried their suggestion of swallowing instead of spitting. Bad idea. Apparently Xylitol makes me really sick and for some people is tied to inflammatory response in the gut. Be wary. Otherwise worked okay. Better by miles than Crest and all those other poisons.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to receive this toothpaste, because I have been looking for a natural tooth paste that was free of sulfates, glycerin, and fluoride. This seemed like the perfect toothpaste since it only has a few ingredients. When it came in I was reading the box while telling my family about it, because I wanted to tell them how few ingredients were in it. That&#x27;s when I noticed the warning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[California Residents Proposition 65] Warning: This product contains trace amounts of lead, a substance know to the State of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm. This product may not be appropriate for consumption by children or pregnant women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was written right on the box. If I had been in a store I would have place it back on the shelf and walked away. Nowhere on Amazon&#x27;s listing did I see it say anything about lead.(If it does forgive me, I overlooked it)I did see it clam that it was safe to swallow, but knowing that there is lead in it, even trace amounts, I would never swallow this toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you are at all concerned with lead, trace amounts or not, then I recommend not buying this item. Since I never opened mine, I am sending it back.</li>
            <li> The lead content bothers me but it is a clay base, clay is dirt, dirt contains things like lead. I have yet to find a toothpaste without a big negative.</li>
            <li> Finally a toothpaste safe enough for my house. We got rid of all the toxic stuff after watching Chemerical the documentary. This stuff is so truly natural and safe that it is edible. Highly recommend. Best option next to making your own.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste irritated my tongue pretty badly after a while. I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s probably the tea tree oil that did it. After using this product for about 3 weeks I began to notice the tongue abrasion and pain. It could also be the xylitol that acted as an irritant. I admire this company&#x27;s organic philosophy, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Finally, an all natural toothpaste fluoride-free and glycerin-free! I love to brush my teeth with it! Glad I found it :)</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste.  My children like this toothpaste.  In fact, we prefer it to all other brands of mainstream toothpastes.  The mint flavor is not too strong and my teeth feel so clean after brushing.  The only con is this paste does not whiten teeth.</li>
            <li> No chemicals that I&#x27;m aware.  Mouth and teeth feel extremely clean and smooth after the first tube.  No side effects.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> And not naming names, but all those hard-to-pronounce ingredients simulating natural products made me wonder just what I was trying not to accidentally swallow. I bought an expensive, many-in-one brand the other day and it dried my throat so much and had such a bad aftertaste that I stopped using it. No more of that, decided to either chew bark or find a better toothpaste. EarthPaste isn&#x27;t cheap, and I&#x27;m still getting used to its taste (to me the menthol is stronger than the mint). But it&#x27;s definitely a better choice than some of what&#x27;s on store shelves.</li>
            <li> First off, the appearance and texture are very different from conventional toothpastes, since they don&#x27;t use any of the foaming or coloring agents, so that might take a little getting used to. However, this toothpaste gets my teeth SUPER clean, and the taste is great. Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> I want to like this toothpaste, I really do. And overall, I really do like it, especially because it is natural.  My teeth sometimes feel gritty or unclean after use. I can&#x27;t quite get a good coating on my teeth either; however, I attribute this to years of using regular toothpaste products.  I will probably buy it again, as I am moving to be more chemical free.  But I can&#x27;t say I really love the product.</li>
            <li> This tooth paste has a nice clean taste. It polishes my teeth well and has wonderful wouldnt hurt you if you ate the whole tube of it ingredients. There is also no flouride or glycerin so that your teeth casn re-enamel.</li>
            <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miny&lt;br /&gt;All natural&lt;br /&gt;Not harsh&lt;br /&gt;No SLS&lt;br /&gt;No Flouride&lt;br /&gt;No Dyes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Requires a bit more than you&#x27;re used to since there is no foaming agent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching high and low for a natural, fluoride free toothpaste that everyone will use.  I really wanted to love this one, but it&#x27;s jus not working for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros?  It tastes great, it does whiten my teeth, and it&#x27;s all natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons?  It looks like mud, I have to use a ton of it to feel like it&#x27;s cleaning my teeth, my kids hate it, and it seems to dry my mouth out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sigh.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great for some people, but it just doesn&#x27;t work for our family!</li>
            <li> This might taste good to some, but we tried to use it only a few times.  It didn&#x27;t taste very good and we switched to Tom&#x27;s of Maine.</li>
            <li> At first I was worried about the whitening ability of this toothpaste because of it&#x27;s color, but I feel my teeth is whiter and cleaner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this toothpaste once so far, but I LOVE it. It&#x27;s not overwhelming with the mint flavor, but just enough to give you the fresh feel.&lt;br /&gt;So no burns if it goes under your tongue, which is nice for sensitive mouths. It&#x27;s very smooth - almost creamy - and feels very nice.&lt;br /&gt;Like others have said, it leaves your teeth SLIPPERY SMOOTH. Even my boyfriend commented on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see us switching to anything else - can&#x27;t get much better than 6 ingredients (1 being water, 2 being oils, 1 sweetener, clay, and salt), and for such a good price.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a great buy, and I&#x27;ll be stocking up on more right away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I don&#x27;t update this (since I have only used this once), you can assume that I&#x27;m still very happy with this product. ;)</li>
            <li> It has a disclaimer showing that it may have traces of lead. Lately I have been coughing after brushing my teeth. I thought nothing of it, until I stopped brushing my teeth with Earthpaste. I noticed no coughing. It&#x27;s strange. It feels like my throat is restricted and then I cough to clear my airway. It is natural and my mouth feels clean. I am not sure if I am having an allergic reaction to it.</li>
            <li> I looked in to alternatives to colgate and crest because the regular toothpastes were causing my teeth to be really heat/cold sensitive. Since I started using Earth Paste my teeth have not once experienced pain from heat or cold. I also haven&#x27;t gotten any more cavities.  The mouth-feel of this is very nice, it makes your teeth feel spotlessly clean to the point where you can&#x27;t go back. The taste is also just fine, it&#x27;s minty and sweet, but not nearly as sweet as the commercial toothpastes. Minus one star for the price; they seem to charge a lot for a tube of dirt.</li>
            <li> I love it.  My teeth look healthy and white.  The ingredients are not only natural, but edible, whole and beneficial.  It tastes great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, the best not only natural toothpaste, but literally the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used in my life!</li>
            <li> I went fluoride free over a year ago because of the sensitivity and pain I had. While my teeth were getting healthier, they were still missing some minerals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In steps Earthpaste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want strong, smooth, clean teeth with no chemicals and a light peppermint taste, you&#x27;ve found your oral hygiene match with this toothpaste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my dentist said my teeth have shown great improvement and asked if I used the fluoride he subscribed. He was disappointed when I said I hadn&#x27;t touched fluoride, but the results were speaking for themselves!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m just too programed from traditional foaming toothpaste, but this did not feel like it cleaned my teeth at all.  There was absolutely no type of lather or foam.  I tried it with both a regular and sonic toothbrush, and my teeth did not feel exceptionally clean.  I also would have appreciated if Amazon showed the warning about there being lead in it (trace amounts, but still..). I am struggling to use this toothpaste.  I am a major fan of bentonite clay and it&#x27;s healing properties but this just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste does a great job and tastes great as well. There are no nasty additives or fluoride. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Being genetically gifted with poor tooth enamel, I am inherently skeptical about any toothpaste&#x27;s claim to whiten teeth.  I only bought this, originally, because it was the most expensive toothpaste on the shelf and I was charging it to the airline in revenge for losing my luggage.  But back to the toothpaste!  I had a tooth whitening appointment, not just regular tooth cleaning, booked a few months after my trip, which I ended up cancelling since the stains on my teeth had disappeared!  Five years of gross brown tooth stains, gone in a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a science-y standpoint, I&#x27;m pretty sure the fine clays in the toothpaste are what provides the extra cleaning and whitening power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re considering teeth-whitening treatments at a dentist or have yellowing that won&#x27;t go away, try this first!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite toothpastes. Buy it you will love it after a week. No more films teeth in the morning and best of all it helps remineralize the teeth with a healthy diet.</li>
            <li> No lead is okay.  I wish there was a warning before purchasing.</li>
            <li> this was the only toothpast I could find that is truely natural. FINALLY! and it tastes good too, so you cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste ever.  Might be my imagination but I think my teeth are getting whiter since&lt;br /&gt;using this toothpaste.  Mouth sure feels clean!  Taste is strong but NOT overpowering.</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a good tooth paste, it comes in and I read the ingredients, and it has lead! Lead! I thought was banned?</li>
            <li> Tried this toothpaste with my Ion Toothbrush that I recently purchased and I am very pleased with the results. The taste is not strong and the product does not foam like regular toothpaste making it easier to brush with. I have begin to notice brighter teeth and my gums look and feel healthier.</li>
            <li> wanted to try a more natural alternative to toothpaste. Although it feels clean and is working well i still miss the foaming of toothpaste. also don&#x27;t like that there is a warning on the tube saying there may be traces of lead. Not for women nursing or pregnant.</li>
            <li> I really like this paste.  It doesn&#x27;t foam, so if that bothers you don&#x27;t try it.  It does have the &amp;#34;contains lead&amp;#34; warning, but regular toothpaste has harmful chemicals and it doesn&#x27;t warn you.  I would use this toothpaste over all other brands.  Great purchase!</li>
            <li> good toothpaste, no fluoride or other crap. earth and salt.  should be like 2 dollars, but they want their money. From Utah, like all the money hungry organic type companies, but they make a good product.</li>
            <li> I wasnt too sure about this product at first. I have always used toothpaste with all the chemicals and floride in it, so I was sure that this would be a joke. However, since I have tried to change my lifestyle and use less chemicals, I thought I would give this a try. Im very impressed. For starters, I have ALWAYS had sensitive teeth. I usually have to get floride rubbed on my gums for receeding gum lines when I go to the dentist. I was nervous to try a toothpaste without floride, as I was always told you needed it. Well, I have to say that I dont have nearly as sensitive teeth since using this product. I have used it for over a month and my teeth are less sensitive. This toothpaste does not foam, as there is not any SLS in it. It is also very different than commercial toothpaste when you brush as there is very little paste when you spit. I really dont like the brown color that you spit out after you brush, but that would be my only complaint about this product. My teeth feel really clean after I brush and I like the subtle peppermint taste. I must say that this product has surprised me greatly and Im pretty impressed. I will order again.</li>
            <li> The fewest ingredients i have ever seen in a toothpaste</li>
            <li> I have some odd allergies that keep me from using most toothpastes. It&#x27;s so nice to find something I am not allergic to that actually works well. My dentist is thrilled. Too bad I had problems with shipping it here. Took them 3 tries.</li>
            <li> Nothing better than being pure and washing with natural products. I bought these products not to make my hair look like the commercialized beauties we see on magazines or TV but to be healthy. And I know using this all natural product that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll get. I wasn&#x27;t comfortable scrubbing my hair or any part on my body (for that matter) with strong chemicals that were never meant for my body which my body in turn - rejects anyways. Fast Shipping!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Healthy Product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Redmond Earthpaste in Peppermint for about two months now. I tried it because I&#x27;m interested in transitioning to more natural bath and body care. I found it through an organic beauty blog that highly reccommended it. I received nothing in return for this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed:&lt;br /&gt;1. Neutral taste. The peppermint isn&#x27;t strong but masks a lot of the &amp;#34;muddy&amp;#34; taste I was expecting. I&#x27;m quite used to the taste now and enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;2. It cleans my teeth. From the first use to now, my teeth always feel clean. I prefer the feeling of my teeth after using this compared to my Crest 3D whitening toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;3. It doesn&#x27;t foam. This took me a few uses to get used to. Initially I wanted to use more and more because it didn&#x27;t feel like I had enough on my toothbrush. Now, I&#x27;m pretty accustomed to the &#x27;no foam&#x27; and don&#x27;t feel the need to use a lot of toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;4. Maintains the whiteness of my teeth. I was actually surprised by this. I thought for sure that my teeth would start to darken after I stopped using my crest whitening toothpaste but they didn&#x27;t. I even feel like my teeth look more presentable- I have a slight build up of plaque in some places and I found this helps reduce the plaque in those areas. I&#x27;m not sure if this is noticable to others, but when looking in the mirror I notice it and think it looks better than when I was using my whitening toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;5. Less mouth peeling. The skin inside of my mouth used to peel quite often and I would have to scrape it out with my fingers. Since using earthpaste, I haven&#x27;t had to do this. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s earthpaste that helped, or just the fact that I transitioned away from my crest products, but either way I&#x27;m happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a pretty descent toothpaste and a nice transition away from the crest products I had been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: I am not trying to bash crest products, but crest is the only brand of toothpaste I have been using for the past 12 years, therefore the only thing I had to compare earthpaste to. To me, earthpaste treats my mouth nicer than Crest- but this review could be very different if I compared it to a different brand. I wanted to provide an honest review based on my lifestyle.</li>
            <li> First couple uses after the transition from &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; toothpaste to Earthpaste were a bit unpleasant but I grew to love it.  You&#x27;ll forget all about foaming agents and that gum numbing sensation.  Peppermint is a great flavor.</li>
            <li> Contains trace amounts of LEAD!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT? WARNING: This product contains trace amounts of led, a substance known to the State of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm. This product may  not be appropriate for consumption by CHILDREN or pregnant woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sigh. So disappointed. Sending all 8 of them back and getting my money back!. :(</li>
            <li> There is another brand at one of the smaller health food stores that I like better.  Sorry I do not have the name of that one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to get away from all the chemicals in EVERYTHING so rather than making my own toothpaste, I decided to buy a healthier paste and decided on this one.  It&#x27;s OK.  The paste is brown, like the earth and really, no taste.  It does not foam, which I know, is clean after I use this so I have been following up with baking soda, and actually, my teeth feel way cleaner with just good old baking soda.  I won&#x27;t purchase this again.  I may attempt to make my own toothpaste, as it isn&#x27;t difficult with coconut oil or I&#x27;ll just use baking soda.  It&#x27;s definitely cheaper!</li>
            <li> I am trying to remove as much chemical from my day to day life. This product was a good alternative to toothpaste out there. I am now trying to make my own but this is a good substitute in the mean time.</li>
            <li> Best natural ingredients, I love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about my three year swallowing it when she brushes.</li>
            <li> Was an avid Sensodyne Pro Namel user for years. Wanted to go all natural and was recommended this by a paleo blogger. Best product I have found. I even swallow it after brushing for added health benefits. I noticed whiter teeth after just a few brushings and my teeth still feel just as clean as with regular toothpaste all day long. Doesn&#x27;t foam like regular toothpaste, but you won&#x27;t miss the bubbles.</li>
            <li> Great product. Arrived as promised.  I&#x27;ve used this several times and my daughter is using too.  We like that it has many natural things in it.</li>
            <li> I tried it and I loved it! :) Makes my teeth look whiter, will be buying more once I run out.</li>
            <li> It takes some getting use too because it doesn&#x27;t have a foaming agent and it kind of disappears in your month, but it cleans great and it leaves your mouth fresh and pepperminty! I love thats its healthy and safe and all natural!</li>
            <li> Okay so I was a little skeptical when I bought it even though it has had phenomenal reviews from everyone. We are trained our whole entire life if something doesn&#x27;t suds than it is not getting it clean, even toothpaste. So I got the peppermint one and the very first time I tried it I was absolutely blown away. My mouth actually feels cleaner than it has in years and even cleaner than when I go to the dentist. I tend to have really bad breath specially since I am a smoker and after I have one cigarette I feel a gunk built up on my teeth already with normal toothpaste. But with earth paste my teeth felt clean all day and my husband even made a comment how my breath did not smell for the first time in like 6 months. I am actually upset that I didn&#x27;t find this toothpaste way sooner. But all in all I love this toothpaste, my husband loves this toothpaste ( he normal brushes his teeth with hydrogen peroxide and baking soda) and I can&#x27;t wait to adopt our kids so they can use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally found a natural toothpaste that whitens my teeth.  It leaves your teeth feeling amazingly clean.  I&#x27;m very impressed and will be purchasing Earthpaste again.</li>
            <li> Awesome!!!! Love it. Will use forever. Even my picky hubby likes it. Taste is mi Ty and great:) bought 3 and love!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing tooth paste!  My husband says it&#x27;s the best one he&#x27;s ever used. It leaves your mouth feeling clean and it has no nasty chemicals.</li>
            <li> I really like the peppermint Earthpaste. I&#x27;ve tried all the flavors and I think this is the strongest flavor. My children prefer the lemon or wintergreen. They are a bit milder. Its expensive and is gone too quickly but other than that its great. I love knowing that my children can swallow and I know they aren&#x27;t taking in fluoride. I will buy when I feel like I have the money to spend.</li>
            <li> I know this tooth paste is not supposed to taste like main stream toothpaste but for my liking, it just tasted and felt awful when using.  I kept using it for a couple of weeks hoping it would change my mind.  No one in my family would use it so I had to throw it away.</li>
            <li> My teeth became very sensitive several years ago (to hot, cold, acidic food, even air sometimes) so I started using Sensodyne which was very helpful. I&#x27;ve been switching to more &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; products, but was hesitant to change my toothpaste because I didn&#x27;t want to be in pain. I decided to give Earthpaste a try and hope for the best. I was told that my sensitivity would return quickly if I stopped using Sensodyne. I&#x27;ve been using Earthpaste for almost 3 weeks and so far my teeth are not sensitive. I will update my review if my teeth become sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fluoride controversy is confusing, but fluoride didn&#x27;t seem to be helping me; I was still getting cavities despite following my dentist&#x27;s recommendation to use fluoride toothpaste, fluoride mouthwash, and prevident along with flossing, using a rubber tip and proxabrush, and cleanings every 3 months. I&#x27;ll have to wait until my exam next spring to see if Earthpaste makes a difference, but as long as it doesn&#x27;t make things much worse I&#x27;d rather use something natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth feel clean and my breath fresh after brushing and rinsing with water. The thinner, non-foaming consistency takes a little getting used to; the first week I was stopping in the middle of brushing to add more toothpaste because I didn&#x27;t feel like I had covered my whole mouth. The peppermint flavor is more subtle than I expected, but I like it.</li>
            <li> I got this toothpaste on a whim after going on a natural/health kick. I strive to keep my house as chemical and natural as possible, but sometimes I find it&#x27;s just not worth the effort. I&#x27;m all about being healthier and using less chemicals but many products make your life significantly more difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not Earth Paste! I read several reviews when I purchased this and expected the toothpaste to be very difficult to get used to since there are no foaming agents and it tastes a bit different. I didn&#x27;t find the transition rough at all.  The lack of foaming agent actually wasn&#x27;t as drastic as I thought. I found that I preferred this type of consistency over normal toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the most important part. This stuff works BETTER. My teeth feel so much cleaner. When I run my tongue over my teeth they are smooth like I had just visited the dentist. I also suffered from minor tooth sensitivity. Cold fruit and ice was something I always avoided because of tooth sensitivity. After using this toothpaste all my sensitivity has disappeared which is a benefit I wasn&#x27;t expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even my husband likes this stuff and he is not into the all natural/crunchy stuff at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I highly recommend buying a tube of Earth Paste and trying it out to see if it is for you. Personally I thought changing my toothpaste wouldn&#x27;t make much of a difference in life at all, but it&#x27;s really provided a lot of benefits in our life. We won&#x27;t be going back!</li>
            <li> Its not the nicest looking toothpaste in the world, and tends to get all over the sink, but I really like this brand.  Does a great job at cleaning your teeth and refreshes for breath.</li>
            <li> I was a bit wary of the taste since this is the first clay-based toothpaste I have tried. In fact the taste is quite minty mild and has a smooth consistency. I like the lack of foaming. A real plus, a lot less messy, for electric toothbrushing. A definite keeper!</li>
            <li> It is all natural and does not contain surfactants that other mainstream toothpastes contain. The texture is a bit gritty and off putting. The taste is OK, but the residue adheres to the bowl of the sunk like concrete.</li>
            <li> A distinct salty taste, from the baking soda I guess.</li>
            <li> Excellent toothpaste. 3 nice flavors. Bought it for my son. Him and I have used them for several months. We tried all 3 flavors. My favorite is peppermint, followed by cinnamon and wintergreen. We are repeat consumers. The reddish color of the clak may take time to get used to for some, but that is just aesthetics of habit/familiarity a s most toothpastes have bleachers or other additives to make them white. I gave it 4 stars due to the artificial sweetner. Would prefer for it to have stevia leaf extract.</li>
            <li> This is the best and tooth paste - like natural tooth paste! :)&lt;br /&gt;I like the texture, flavor, all of it. And of course, the good feeling i get from using it! My teeth love it :)</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would heal the ulcers in my mouth but such is not the case.  It does taste good and I am hoping it will indeed remineralize my teeth and gums and help me prevent expensive dental treatments.&lt;br /&gt;(****Note: The item in the picture I am seeing is not for Redmond Earthpaste, but is for hair supplements, I believe).</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s natural but I thought it was too nasty to use.</li>
            <li> By far the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever owned, love this stuff. I use this in conjunction Nature&#x27;s Answer Perio Wash - wintermint or&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002OXCKW2 B002OXCKW2]]&lt;br /&gt;So fresh, so clean.</li>
            <li> I would give this two stars if there weren&#x27;t cheaper and better options out there. When I look at how good a toothpaste is, I first want to know if it makes my teeth squeak. If you&#x27;ve never had your teeth squeak, you&#x27;re missing out. It truly is a wonderful feeling and no matter how much you brush, Earthpaste isn&#x27;t going to do it for you. Secondly, I want to make sure it&#x27;s healthy. No fluoride is the obvious one. This paste technically is \\&quot;healthy.\\&quot; That being said, I would rather use Close-Up or Crest than this junk.&lt;br /&gt;Does it feel good in your mouth? Nope, it kind of feels like very fine dirt with a bit of peppermint. Yum, yum, minty dirt.&lt;br /&gt;Does it taste good? Not really, I can smell the peppermint, but I can hardly taste it.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line? Either go on Etsy and get some or find a recipe and make your own. All it takes is some coconut oil, some calcium magnesium powder, baking soda, and peppermint oil. Cheaper and tastier and yes, squeaky clean teeth.</li>
            <li> This is some good stuff!  Great flavor, Long lasting, Natural, those are things you can&#x27;t find in your regular everyday toothpaste.  I&#x27;m so glad I made the switch to this stuff.  My teeth are whiter, my mouth feels cleaner, it&#x27;s combated bad breath and helps my breath to stay fresher longer.  I&#x27;ll know in a couple months when I return to the dentist if it helped my teeth to be able to heal my cavities naturally.</li>
            <li> Color of toothpaste highly disagreeable.  Taste is offensive.  Dispensing of toothpaste is dissatisfactory, toothpaste falls off toothbrush.  Will not order again.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product but am left wanting.  It cleans fine but there is hardly any taste. The peppermint oil must be on a microscopic level because I can&#x27;t taste anything. The price is quite high as well.  I think if the price was a dollar or two less and it had enough peppermint oil for a human to detect it would be a good buy. As it stands now I will not be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is probably the best ever to some people but I just don&#x27;t like it. I typically use Desert Essence Wintergreen and Neem toothpaste (which I would give 5 stars) but I saw this on Amazon and bought it. The first thing I noticed was the warning printed on the label about the product containing trace amounts of lead...so I made a mental note to keep my kids from using it. (They normally use Jack &amp; Jill blueberry paste so they wouldn&#x27;t have liked it anyway.) The fact that the paste is brown doesn&#x27;t bother me a bit. The fact that the peppermint flavor is spiked with a heavy salt flavor wasn&#x27;t the deal breaker. It was the complete lack of effective cleaning that really lost me. I gave this toothpaste the old college try for over a week until I couldn&#x27;t bear how gross my mouth felt upon waking anymore. Back to my tried and true Desert Essence!</li>
            <li> Great! Love this toothpaste! Tastes great and so good for my teeth. Glad this product exists.</li>
            <li> Works great! Love that&#x27;s it&#x27;s natural. No artificial anything.</li>
            <li> good stuff.....I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on a toothpaste carousel, trying to find something natural, with few ingredients - and nothing created in a lab. I was excited when I found this in my local health food store, because it seemed to be what I had been searching for. I scanned the barcode to read reviews on Amazon, and saw that some people had experience a reduction in pain with sensitive teeth. I&#x27;ve had a molar where the gums receded a bit and the little gap between enamel and gum is extremely sensitive/painful. I use a sonicare toothbrush, and often I would have to skip the tooth or turn the power off and scrub gently, because the nerve pain was shooting. After a short time using this tooth paste, I noticed that my tooth was not hurting anymore when I brushed. I typically had phases of sensitivity and normality with the tooth, so I waited, hoping it was going to last. And it has. I haven&#x27;t had pain in months. On top of that, this toothpaste gives an extremely good polished feel to your teeth. Not only is the ingredient list short, it eliminated my tooth sensitivity, but it quite possibly may be the most effective paste I&#x27;ve ever used (used to be a regular user of the Arm &amp; Hammer baking soda line for that nice polish, this is better). Give it a shot. You&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> Earthpaste is the simplest, best-tasting toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever tried. It has a simple list of basic ingredients. Only downside is that it takes a little more scrubbing to remove residue from the sink. I don&#x27;t consider that important enough to detract from this terrific product. I purchased online because my local store is always out of stock. Apparently I&#x27;m not the only person who likes this.</li>
            <li> Had I known that there is trace amounts of lead in this product I would not have purchased it. I will be returning to amazon immediately!</li>
            <li> It tastes fine and the texture is okay.</li>
            <li> was very pleased with the service and the product</li>
            <li> So nice to finally find a product (sans the fluoride and SLS) that makes your mouth feel minty AND CLEAN!</li>
            <li> I wanted a product that didnt have lots of toxins, but it makes my teeth throb. Another reviewer said this was because of the salt.</li>
            <li> The best toothpaste!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> After two weeks of using this toothpaste I noticed my gums were sensitive and even one of my top teeth was starting to hurt. Last night around 3:30 in the morning my gums hurt so bad I wen&#x27;t downstairs and checked out some of the 1 star reviews on this product. A few people were complaining about the tooth and gum sensitivity so I immediately whipped out the Toms (Fluoride Free) toothpaste that I have been using for years and brushed my teeth. about 7 hours later (time of writing) my teeth are almost back to normal. I believe it&#x27;s the salt contained in the product but I can&#x27;t be sure. Either way i&#x27;m discontinuing use of this product and using my Toms toothpaste once again. I tried Earthpaste because of the fact that it doesn&#x27;t contain Glycerin but I&#x27;ll take the vegetable glycerin in Toms any day over the agony last night. The only reason why I rated this product 2 stars instead of 1 is because obviously many people like it. One point of interest with some of the negative reviews was the &amp;#34;product contains lead&amp;#34; which startled me a bit when I opened the package. A quick trip to Earthpastes website and a look in the FAQ section immediately explained and relieved my concerns about the lead warning but the fact that it seems to aggravate the gums so badly is a definite reason not to buy. Just stick with the Toms, Jason or Natures Gate brand of (Fluoride Free) Toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I have a history with teeth problems. I always seem to have a new cavity every time I go to the dentist, they easily yellow, and I get bad sensitivity. I have been using Sensodyne with whitening. I am passionate about natural health, though, and have read claims about glycerin coating your teeth. So, I decided to try this, but fully expected to have to go back to my Sensodyne due to the painful sensitivity I get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for over a month, I can say I will definitely keep using this. My teeth are much whiter than when I started using Earthpaste and I have not been experiencing any sensitivity. I cannot make any claims for rebuilding enamel, but the lack in sensitivity I&#x27;ve been having is supporting evidence. I will update this if I have a less than favorable dentist visit in the future, but so far I am very happy with Earthpaste!</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste! Would buy again!</li>
            <li> The taste is okay but the tube is terrible.  It lets air back in and spurts back out when you squeeze it.</li>
            <li> A bit hard to get used to... Especially when it looks like mud. Mouth didn&#x27;t feel or taste as fresh. I&#x27;m not a huge fan quite yet. Hopefully that&#x27;ll change.</li>
            <li> No fake foam, taste clean, doesn&#x27;t leave too much minty smell in the mouth.</li>
            <li> So far this toothpaste has been pleasant to use. Won&#x27;t know whether it is totally effective until a few months from now, but the taste and consistency are not too much different from &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; toothpaste. Be careful when you squeeze, however. It is slightly more watery than other brands and might splatter a little. Just shake it a bit before use. And it goes without saying, you should have a relatively sugar-free diet when using a product like this. If you consume even more than 12grams of added sugar (cane sugar, syrup, table sugar) a day, you might not benefit from Earth Paste. If you eat a lot of starchy carbohydrate foods, this might not work for you either in the long term.</li>
            <li> mild flavor and works well.  brown color may take some adjustment.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this product since I&#x27;m trying to find a replacement to my fluoride free paste that stopped being made.  Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve only used it a handful of times since buying it because it tastes terrible...  Fortunately, I&#x27;ve only used it a handful of times because I just learned that there is 11.9 parts per million lead in the clay that that is the base of the toothpaste...  so, it will be going in the trash.  I&#x27;m just glad I didn&#x27;t let my kids use any of it.  What&#x27;s the point of fluoride free if you&#x27;re getting lead poisoning instead??</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste. It re-mineralizes your teeth as you brush. Takes a few days to get used to the taste, but now I won&#x27;t use any other paste. My 2 year old brushes with it too.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste does not get tarter and film off of your teeth plus it stains the bathroom sink.  I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> gritty taste and texture</li>
            <li> This is a very good natural toothpaste.  I did a lot of research and was hesitant because of the clay...I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like the flavor to texture.  I used to use nature&#x27;s gate but I was uncertain of some of the ingredients...I know what every ingredient is in this toothpaste.  This does not foam...so it will take a little getting used to and it will have a tendency to want to slide off your toothbrush...I just press it on a little with my finger &amp; wet it under some slow flowing water.  I do like the traditional peppermint flavor and I don&#x27;t find it too strong...it is perfect for me.  I do not have sensitive teeth or gums so I can&#x27;t speak to that.  And you don&#x27;t notice it&#x27;s clay...it&#x27;s just soft feeling...no &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; or muddy feeling in your mouth.  Overall...I highly recommend and you can get it a little cheaper on Vitacost.  Also, if you like this or if you don&#x27;t for that matter...you may want to try the peppermint toothpaste on facenaturals.com.  This is another favorite website of mine for all things natural.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothpaste for my daughter since it&#x27;s safe to swallow n she&#x27;s only 2 n can&#x27;t spit. I hadn&#x27;t tried it but just ordered one for myself n I am so disappointed. I feel like after I use this my teeth are still dirty. It dissolves before I am even done brushing! Still using it cos not gonna throw away six dollar toothpaste but def won&#x27;t be ordering again. I ordered both peppermint n lemon and both equally lack proper cleaning.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it much, but its a good alternative, especially if you don&#x27;t have the ingredients or time to make your own natural type. Definitely a different texture!</li>
            <li> When I first discovered this toothpaste I was so excited about it. It came in the mail, on time and all, and I immediately tried it out. The taste didn&#x27;t bother me, but like most others, I wasn&#x27;t aware of the lead warning until receiving the product. My teeth also felt half as clean as usual, and a few days after using this product consistently, I began having a severe ongoing tooth ache. I haven&#x27;t changed a thing about my routine other than the tooth paste. I ended up having an infection in one of my teeth and i need it removed. I&#x27;m not sure if the toothpaste caused this, but i have a feeling it did. I have not felt pain like this in my mouth before.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  LOVE it.  It will now be my new regular brand.  Can&#x27;t wait to try the other flavors as well.  I have been loyal to the Young Living Thieves Dentarome Ultra for several years, but it&#x27;s been increasingly OUT OF STOCK and difficult to order, as well as ridiculously overpriced with insanely high shipping costs.  So I finally figured it was time to look for something new.  I resisted change, but am so glad I took the chance and tried this product.  LOVE IT!!  Are there SIX stars to give?</li>
            <li> Exactly What i Wanted. It Was New, Wrapped And Delivered Fast.</li>
            <li> Might have lead.. Not good for pregnant woman or kids</li>
            <li> It took them a bit of time to get used to it but now they say, &amp;#34;Mmm, toothpaste is yummy!&amp;#34; (They&#x27;re 2 years old) And I&#x27;m happy that they&#x27;re not getting a bunch of junky chemicals!</li>
            <li> I love the peppermint better than the wintergreen. I feel like my teeth are much cleaner and they look whiter! I just order another tube of the peppermint. No fluoride, all natural.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how awesome this paste is. I knew that it was a better option than other tooth pastes because it is completely all natural. However, I was very surprised how effective it is in whitening your teeth. Nice!</li>
            <li> Cons: Earthpaste does have a strange, kind of slimy texture, really is similar to liquidy mud, and doesn&#x27;t bubble. I was aware of this prior to buying but thought I&#x27;d give it a shot because of conventional toothpaste&#x27;s questionable ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It works! I put off getting a dental cleaning for a year due to moving and busy lifestyle, and was worried that I would have a cavity. However, I was pleased to hear my teeth and gums were in great shape. So, who knows if this success is due to the toothpaste or other factors, but I&#x27;d like to think this played a role in my dental hygiene. It tastes wonderfully minty as well, and left my teeth feeling clean. Also, this toothpaste lasted me for about 6 months of daily use and seemed to outlast its competitors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional note: I switched back to Sensodyne after using this because my teeth developed a mild sensitivity to cold (have experienced this in the past). Earthpaste could benefit from expanding their collection to include a sensitivity treating toothpaste. Overall, this toothpaste is enjoyable, health-conscious and effective, but has room for improvement.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste but will quit using it. The label says It CONTAINS LEAD! Are you kidding me? It may be free of chemicals in regular toothpastes but it has trace amounts of lead!</li>
            <li> This is a good toothpaste. I just hope they don&#x27;t sell the company to some huge no-name corporation that changes the product ingrediants. This has happened over the years with a few products I used to use i.e. Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s, Tom&#x27;s of Maine.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to find a natural toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t have fluoride!!!! I got this to incorporate as part of my regimen for helping to heal my recently diagnosed hypothyroidism and I must say I like this brand very much. Yes, it does initially take some getting used to with the clay color etc but it is worth buying because it&#x27;s honestly your health you&#x27;re investing in when you buy this product. Why would anyone presume it&#x27;s okay to put harmful chemicals and other additives in your mouth at the frequency we brush our teeth and not expect this action to have an impact on their health later down the road? If you do research, you&#x27;ll understand what I mean. I really like the winter mint flavor for this toothpaste as well. I personally feel it&#x27;s worth the investment and I will purchase this brand again.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste. I tried to switch from commercial toothpaste to a more natural toothpaste before this and I hated it. It didn&#x27;t clean well and was messy. This is the same consistency as regular toothpaste. I used to get spots on my teeth from fluoride and a dry mouth, and with this it whitens and cleans so well without giving me spots or a dry mouth. It&#x27;s also not uncomfortably minty, but enough that my teeth feel clean and my breath smells fresh. I was pleasantly surprised at how similar it is to commercial toothpaste, without the problems I have with it.</li>
            <li> This is the only toothpaste that my family uses! I love how it makes my teeth feel after brushing. My teeth have never been cleaner or whiter! I love how there are no nasty chemicals in it such as glycerin or fluoride. It&#x27;s safe enough to swallow. I am so excited for their new kids flavor Lemon Twist.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste will take getting used to.  With no foaming ingredient, it, of course, isn&#x27;t something we get normally.  Plan to take with us on PCT hike this summer. I don&#x27;t taste the peppermint as much as I thought I would but my teeth feel cleaner and I&#x27;ve only been using it a week!</li>
            <li> I read a review on a website about this product and wanted to give it a try. I tried a few other natural pastes, but wasn&#x27;t satisfied. The color is a bit strange, but I was prepared for that after reading a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this paste and feel so much better about using this than a &#x27;regular&#x27; paste full of chemicals and fluoride. My toddlers love to brush their teeth and I was always afraid of them getting a hold of my &#x27;regular&#x27; toothpaste. I don&#x27;t mind sharing this one with them, as it is safe! I just ordered/received my second tube of this and I will continue to purchase it as well as recommend it to others. The extra cost is well worth it, as this product is so much better for you.</li>
            <li> Having ordered this elsewhere before, I was happy to see it on Amazon - the very best place to buy EVERYTHING.  This paste makes a bit of a mess in the sink but it is so worth it.  None of the artificial taste that comes with ordinary toothpaste.  I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> this product is horrible.</li>
            <li> It is a good product because is natural and doesn&#x27;t had any processed products.</li>
            <li> We like this very much .... We have only started using it a short while ago.  The taste, texture etc is fine.  Looks kind of tan/brown ..... We where looking for something that was not full of chemicals we should not be consuming!</li>
            <li> I like this product...next time I will buy the one without Xylitol.</li>
            <li> I am super picky about my toothpaste and have been since I was a kid. I like earthpaste because it doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals and additives. It leaves my teeth feeling clean and healthy. I do find the flavor to be a bit strong. Any chance earthpaste will come out with an unflavored or light flavored paste?</li>
            <li> BUT! after getting used to it, I like it SOOO much better than regular toothpase. The fact that it&#x27;s eco-friendly is a big bonus too!</li>
            <li> So I really wanted to like this toothpaste. I&#x27;ve been using it the past year or so and I&#x27;m not impressed at all. At first it was great! I really liked the peppermint and cinnamon flavors, I went through 3 tubes total. But it seemed like no matter what my mouth just didn&#x27;t feel completely clean. I was also hoping this would help out in preventing cavities, and I still ended up getting one. I&#x27;ve recently switched back to my old toothpaste and it works a lot better for me.</li>
            <li> Tried it for a few weeks,  couldn&#x27;t get past the feeling I was brushing with mud.  Will probably mix with Jason Naturals (a much better taste) just to use it up.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old son and toddler daughter suffer from tooth decay caused by Celiac Disease.  After using Earthpaste for about 6 weeks, I see the enamel returning on their damaged teeth. My own teeth are whiter and stronger than ever. I LOVE this product!!</li>
            <li> It takes some time to get use to putting water on your toothbrush followed by the paste, and seeing brown instead of white when rinsing out, but this toothpaste is the best. Taste is good; cleaning effect is excellent. I love that such a simple product can do such an effective job. Well done!</li>
            <li> Great! My teeth just feel stronger than when I used other toothpaste.</li>
            <li> My mouth no longer feels yuch when I get up in the morning and I am pretty sure that ceasing the use of conventional toothpaste with flouride has contributed to the improvement of my health. One tube with a single ribbon of paste (I admit, I only brush once a day when I get up in the morning) has lasted me 5 months. With conventional toothpaste, even when I did brush at night before bed, I still had a yuchy white film all over my teeth when I got up in the morning. Not anymore!</li>
            <li> I used this paste for the first time today, but I just didn&#x27;t feel like the toothpaste reached all of my teeth since it doesn&#x27;t foam. I had to brush twice and put tons of paste on my toothbrush in order to feel somewhat confident that all my teeth got enough of the paste. Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong? I feel like I am just brushing with bristles and no toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I checked out the website and it says that it doesn&#x27;t make any anti-cavity claims...so basically there is no evidence that this concoction actually benefits/cleans your teeth. It might be natural....but that&#x27;s not going to protect my teeth. I don&#x27;t even know what Redmond clay is....I googled it and I don&#x27;t see how volcanic ashes are going to keep me cavity free. I did send an email to the company with my concerns so I will update this review once I hear back from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m actually very tempted right now to brush my teeth a third time...using commercial toothpaste.</li>
            <li> how can i use something that has lead in it. Just remove if it is naturally occurring!!</li>
            <li> I like that it does not have a lot of harmful chemicals and it taste great!  I will buy again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this paste twice so far, and am in love! It has an intense mint flavor that makes my mouth feel extremely fresh. My teeth also feel nice and slick. It did a great job polishing my teeth while still being gentle on my sensitive gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using a soft bristle toothbrush to prevent gum erosion, but was not feeling the same smoothness as I used to. This paste changed all of that. Now I can get a great cleaning even with a soft brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a normal amount of paste, and it seems to do just fine. The paste spreads to all of my teeth without feeling like I need to apply more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to try out all the flavors!</li>
            <li> I love how clean my mouth feels when I use this toothpaste. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Feels like it&#x27;s not working and then when you&#x27;re done...the cleanest clean ever!</li>
            <li> Fantastic non-fluoride, healthy toothpaste that is minty without being salty.</li>
            <li> My favorite toothpaste of all.  Smells yummi and works great.  Clean teeth- happy teeth</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a non toxic toothpaste other than Tom&#x27;s and this is the best! It takes some getting used to but my teeth feel very clean and fresh after I brush. I was really surprised how this ugly brown paste could make my teeth feel so clean, I am sold! Now if I could just convince my 9 year old.</li>
            <li> If you want to use a natural toothpaste that is free of the nasty, harsh chemicals that normal toothpaste has, this is the product for you. It doesn&#x27;t leave an extreme minty feel in your mouth like other toothpastes, but it is something you will quickly gets used to. What&#x27;s best is that it doesn&#x27;t dry out your mouth and tongue like traditional toothpastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I am always on the lookout for a non-fluoride, natural toothpaste.  I have tried many, many different kinds.  I really like this Earthpaste.  It has a pleasant taste and leaves my teeth feeling very clean and slippery.  I will be buying again and also giving as a gift to family members who are looking for a natural, quality toothpaste.  Additionally, this toothpaste was recommended by a natural product company called Bubble &amp; Bee.  If this meets Stephanie&#x27;s tight criteria, then it has to be good!</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and my teeth are whiter, I feel like my teeth are actually clean, I love the flavor and it&#x27;s very affordable. Plus, there are no worries about swallowing fluoride... yuk! And I also like that you are encouraged to swallow it, it puts good bacteria in your gut from the Redmond clay! I would recommend this to anyone, in fact I&#x27;ve already ordered more to give to my sister.</li>
            <li> Contains trace amounts of lead&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noticed this as I was brushing my teeth with it for the first time.  Not happy</li>
            <li> I have dry mouth, will the clay and salt affect my mouth negatively?</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good toothpaste without fluoride or glycerin or foaming agents like sodium laurel sulfate- which Tom&#x27;s has in it.&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste tastes great- nice and minty- cleans beautifully, and my teeth have never been whiter.&lt;br /&gt;I will update in a few months re: reenamelization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit update December 19, 2013:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not noticed any reenamelization of teeth, however, no decay has occurred and they are still white and clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth and mouth don&#x27;t feel very clean after using it.  It&#x27;s OK, but probably won&#x27;t buy again.  Like that it is more healthy than traditional brands.</li>
            <li> I have a love hate relationship with this toothpaste. I cannot use toothpaste which contains SLS. However, I have mixed feelings about this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I love this EXCEPT I&#x27;ve noticed my mouth becoming BONE dry at night.  I&#x27;m talking dry.  I put 3 stars for now.  Otherwise, it does a great job cleaning (unlike another boutique paste, Squiggle, which sucks.) I went back to Crest last night and did not have the problem (I&#x27;ve had for weeks since about the same time I started using this.)  Will continue and monitor/amend review if it&#x27;s not the paste.  Seems it is. Please comment if you find you have the same issue.</li>
            <li> YAY!! Finally something that the whole family can use!  I have made my own toothpaste for a while now BUT my husband and children never really cared for it.  I think its the ease of use from a tube that they really need.  Anyway...Earthpaste is now a family favorite and I feel good about letting them use it!  Shipping was quick! Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I was a life long Crest user, but wanted to start using something that had fewer chemicals, and no fluoride.  I had no trouble adapting to the change, which I can&#x27;t always say at 65 years old.  Leaves a great mouth feel, teeth feel smoother too.</li>
            <li> This is one star JUST so that the merchant may notice my review and read it!  I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PASTE!  it is the best paste I have ever used! I have receded gums because of crowns in my mouth and the exposed dental tissue is extremely sensitive.  ALL toothpastes, including Tom&#x27;s of Maine and The Natural Dentist make me cringe with pain as I brush.  This is the ONLY paste that does not hurt my teeth.  I happened to buy it because I needed detergent-free products in my house (my baby has eczema and eczema is linked to contact with detergent-containing products and detergent-laced house-hold dust).  This paste immediately became my favorite.  It is truly natural, detergent and fluoride free and leaves my teeth feeling very clean and white without any pain.  The ONLY GRIPE:  PLEASE, CAN THIS TUBE HAVE A FLIP TOP?  Screwing and unscrewing this open and closed every time is a REAL PAIN!  Especially for the kids!  Most of the time now, we leave the cap off, and this dries the paste out.  The slippery, wide and large cap is terrible and a waste of plastic.  Al that is needed is a normal ribbed and smal flip-open cap that flips open with one&#x27;s thumb.  One-hand needed only!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have scoured the internet looking for any ill effects of this clay since so many bentonite clays have recently been said to contain arsenic and lead, but this clay seems to have never been found to be one we need to worry about.  I only read great things about the clay. That being said I&#x27;m very concerned about the claim of \\&quot;natural\\&quot; when it comes to this toothpaste, it contains Xylitol and there is nothing natural about Xylitol and I do not believe it is safe to swallow. First of all it is a hydrogenated with the catalyst nickel, can you say Heavy Metal?  Most Xylitol contains GMO&#x27;s, the process by which it is made is crushed fibers of sugar cane [birchwood or corn..]  a multi-step chemical reaction that involves the use of sulfuric acid, calcium oxide, phosphoric acid and active charcoal. The end product is a bleached, powdery blend of sugar alcohols that taste sweet on the tongue but are not absorbed by the body. The substance then can upset the balance of the gut.  It kills rats in sizes equal to two pieces of gum and our loved family dog would also find it&#x27;s ingestion fatal. This company sounds like they pride themselves on the quality of product so I can not figure out why they have decided to add such a compound to the product other than it&#x27;s only positive quality ... it won&#x27;t cause cavities.  If you&#x27;re going to take fluoride seriously you have to take all things bad for human consumption seriously. I found my information in many places but these two hit all of what&#x27;s wrong with xylitol  crunchybetty.com/xylitol-should-we-stop-calling-it-natural  and  thehealthyhomeeconomist.com/xylitol-not-as-sweet-as-its-cracked-up-to-be/  copy, paste, search, read!  Parents are touting this xylitol as a great addition to their children&#x27;s oral health since it will not cause tooth decay, but neither does arsenic and I&#x27;m sure that would not be an alternative they would consider. There is no natural in Xylitol.  I had to rate in order to comment but in no way should it be considered as though I&#x27;m not intending to ingest I am on the fence to even support Xylitols use by purchasing.</li>
            <li> I developed a toothpaste allergy. We haven&#x27;t figured out which ingredient is setting me off yet, but I also have a problem with mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been desperate to find a good substitute and, thank goodness, Earth Paste is here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works just as well as the commercial stuff. My breath is fresh and my teeth are clean and polished. I really don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it.</li>
            <li> It is ok. I am not much satisfied with it, but I will continue using it coz it doesn&#x27;t have SLS in it.</li>
            <li> I usually always have a tube of this on hand for those lazy days that I don&#x27;t feel like making my own toothpaste for the house. Not onlly am I happy with it and it does the job, it does the job safely!</li>
            <li> Best natural toothpaste I have used!  Most natural toothpastes leave my teeth feeling like they aren&#x27;t very well cleaned.  I only use a very small amount of Earthpaste and my teeth always feel completely clean.  It tastes a little different, but that didn&#x27;t bother me after the first couple times I brushed with it.</li>
            <li> My kid doesn&#x27;t like this flavor and the consistency. If you want to try it, go ahead, but first, buy lemon or cinnamon flavor for kids! I tried it once and I didn&#x27;t like the texture, I didn&#x27;t feel that the toothpaste was cleaning my teeth.. It feels like sandy.. I will try another one &#x3D;( and my husband didn&#x27;t want me to try it anymore because of the proposition 65 warning.</li>
            <li> Not too bad.  took me a while to get use to it.  its very good product and is good for you too.  cant find this too often.  takes a while to get use to the texture.  good stuff.</li>
            <li> One of the best non homemade toothpaste out there on the market.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste! It&#x27;s very different from so many others that I&#x27;ve tried before making my own from scratch. I&#x27;m now enjoy using this one in between using my homemade baking soda toothpastes because it&#x27;s non-abrasive (the dentist says that you&#x27;re not supposed to brush your teeth daily with baking soda because it scratches away at the enamel by using it too often). I also make my own Redmond Clay based toothpaste, but I still enjoy trying other brands time and again just to change things up.</li>
            <li> This makes my teeth feel really clean. I love the simple ingredients, nothing toxic. It even says on the package that you can swallow it if you wish. I don&#x27;t like putting things in my mouth that aren&#x27;t considered safe to eat, especially not to give to my kids either. The peppermint is really nice tasting. The texture is smoother than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! My sister saw (with dental x-rays) a cavity decrease in size after using this for several months. So I switched from my regular paste to this and immediately noticed that my mouth just felt cleaner. I like it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I have used almost every natural, organic toothpaste on the market, but until I ordered Earthpaste, I hadn&#x27;t found the best.  Earthpaste is truly the most natural and free of chemicals.  It leaves your teeth feeling totally clean.  I will never use another toothpaste and will recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> After trying many different dental pastes, this is the most natural and safe way to go. The list amount of chemicals and poisons like fluoride (neurotoxin - which effects your brain) in your mouth the longer and healthier you will be. Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste.  Great taste, and I really appreciate the natural ingredients.  My dentist is amazed at the results.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this, have heard good things about it, but I don&#x27;t. It sits in my bathroom next to another natural toothpaste and I always reach for the other and not this one.  It does feel like it cleans my teeth, however I don&#x27;t like that it feels like there&#x27;s nothing there while I&#x27;m brushing. I feel like I have to use a lot and it still feels like there&#x27;s minimal toothpaste. I realize this is my issue and likely comes from my lifelong use of more foamy toothpastes, but it turns out I like something that foams a little bit. And there are natural ones that foam more. I do use this one, maybe 1x/wk, but mostly just to not have it go bad and have wasted money on it. Likely won&#x27;t buy it again. Bummed, because I really wanted to like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been adopting aspects of healthy living steadily into my lifestyle.  For some reason one of the last things I&#x27;ve changed is our toothpaste.  This toothpaste does just what a toothpaste should and nothing more.  I don&#x27;t need fake lather and weird chemical flavors/fragrances in my toothpaste, I just need it to clean my teeth and get out of there.&lt;br /&gt;Earthpaste does a great cleaning job and tastes just dandy!&lt;br /&gt;Side Note: I like how they say on the back label &amp;#34;feel free to swallow or spit Earthpaste out after brushing&amp;#34;.  I get that you can eat the stuff but I don&#x27;t want to eat all the crap I just brushed off my mouth too, ew, hah.</li>
            <li> Goodbye Tom&#x27;s of Maine, too bad you changed your recipe and without telling us either.  But thanks because I like this even better than when Tom&#x27;s was the ticket.  My favorite is the lemon.  It does not foam but who needs all that foam anyway?</li>
            <li> I have been using sensitive toothpaste off and on for as long as I can remember.  I was halfway through a tube when this arrived in the mail.  I have tried a few other natural toothpastes, but I have always had to use the sensitive a few times a week so I could continue to drink cold water.  This changed everything.  Three days into using this exclusivity I was pleasantly surprised to still be comfortable.  Two weeks later I threw the half tube of sensitive toothpaste in the bin.  My teeth have never felt cleaner and my morning breath appears better, to me at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flavor - Minty but not overpowering. This doesn&#x27;t burn my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;The texture - this may be clay, but it is not at all gritty.  Smoother than any of the &#x27;natural&#x27; toothpastes I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also passed the husband test.  He was apprehensive when I gave it to him but was a convert immediately.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste.  I&#x27;ll admit the brownish color took some getting used to.  But the absence of toxic chemicals is what sold me.  And no more sensitivity or bleeding gums. Plus its got a nice minty flavor and isn&#x27;t gritty.</li>
            <li> NOTHING whitens better than this toothpaste.  Try it, you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Teeth feel clean. I actually didn&#x27;t want to like it, but it is much healthier than the regular toothpastes. And I haven&#x27;t had any canker sore, which most brands of toothpastes caused.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  A little gritty but only contains clay and essential oil.  Checked with my dentist and he said it was safe for the enamel on my teeth.  Gets teeth clean and tastes good. If you are used to a gel or cream paste, the consistency will be a surprise.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product, I do realize it is earthpaste, so the flavor is to be expected, but I did not feel that my teeth were cleaned.  I would not buy this product again!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this toothpaste, but after using it for a while, my teeth were turning yellow/brown.  As soon as I switched back to conventional toothpaste, my teeth returned to their original, whiter color, though only after awhile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that this company was able to make an all natural toothpaste, but it is made from earth (aka dirt), which turns your toothbrush brown, and I ended up getting a cavity after 30 years of being cavity free. Not going to use this again.</li>
            <li> After finishing my first tube, I am now ordering another.  I feel confident that I will continue to use this toothpaste because of the natural ingredients.  It does take awhile to get used to the paste because it is so different from what I had been using.  My mouth is not filled with bubbles and grit, which is a good thing.  I now feel that I am able to brush better and more thoroughly.  Peppermint is not very flavorful, so I may order the Wintergreen next time, as was suggested by another reviewer.</li>
            <li> Redmond toothpaste has lead in it. Heavy mineral lead. I bought this and did not see the small print label.  It states on there website that lead is in all foods. Google lead and food. See what comes up. Why would anyone use lead in there mouth, I don&#x27;t care how much. Show me a scientific journal about lead in all fruits and vegetables please. And someone is giving it to there kids. Ridiculous</li>
            <li> Much better than I expected and good whitening</li>
            <li> This company sent me the product VERY quickly and everything looked great.  This product is actually very awesome, I love how my mouth feels after I brush my teeth it&#x27;s also not as strong as some of the other clay toothpaste alternatives that are out there.  As far as the product is concerned the one thing you have to remember is that it&#x27;s not &#x27;foamy&#x27; like the traditional commercial toothpastes.  It&#x27;s clay, so it&#x27;s going to be more water based.  Which is also why it&#x27;s important to always put the cap back on after using it, you don&#x27;t want to lose that moisture.  It&#x27;s easy to use and the clay taste is merged with the peppermint so you don&#x27;t taste the clay at all.  Very good toothpaste! :)  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I prefer this to Tom&#x27;s for example.  My teeth feel very clean after &amp; I feel that the tea tree oil gives my mouth an antiseptic advantage for naturally fresh breath.  The taste was weird at first since there is no sweetener.  But I began to like it.  The paste itself is normal toothpaste consistency.  It has some occasional gritty specs, but I kind of grew to like it.  I will buy again</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is wonderful. Excellent alternative to other market brands and works great. Their line of paste is good for all.</li>
            <li> Earthpaste is the BEST natural toothpaste you will find! I was skeptical at first, and worried about the taste but now my husband and I will only use this! Never going back to conventional toothpaste!!</li>
            <li> I liked the toothpaste so much that I bought more.  This is a good way to care for your teeth without all the foaming agents and chemical processing other toothpastes have.</li>
            <li> tastes great and gets teeth nice and clean. I love that it has so few ingredients in it. No worries about flouride or any chemical additives.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more of this!!</li>
            <li> cleans teeth well, leaves mouth feeling fresh. long lasting</li>
            <li> This stuff was horrible.  It wouldn&#x27;t foam or stick to my teeth.  All it did was clump up and stick to the crevices.  I finally threw it out.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste for about a month and love it. It cleans very well, leaves my mouth feeling refreshed and there&#x27;s no foaming agents, flouride or sugar. I have also noticed that my gums are healthier since switching from Colgate to earthpaste. They used to bleed almost every time I brushed my teeth but haven&#x27;t since switching. I have another tube of a different natural toothpaste I was going to try that will likely go unused because I love earthpaste so much.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  Peppermint is my favorite so far.  I love the fact that there is nothing harmful in the ingredients!</li>
            <li> I like the toothpaste and my teeth feel clean. It is a little hard to get used to not having the foam, but so far good.</li>
            <li> Been looking for a natural toothpaste and this one is great. No foaming (no chemicals added), easily rinses and leaves your teeth squeaky clean.  No residual toothpaste taste to make the OJ taste like crap.  Try it you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> There is a warning that it contains trace amounts of lead which may cause cancer. I wanted an all natural toothpaste and I sadly won&#x27;t be able to use this</li>
            <li> My toddler loves this toothpaste and hasn&#x27;t protested toothbrushing time since I got it for her!</li>
            <li> We love earthpaste!!!</li>
            <li> I was a devoted Tom&#x27;s of Maine customer for years, back when they still sold the toothpaste in the metal tubes and had the original formula. Once I got past the puckering harshness of that paste (compared to the commercial stuff I grew up with) I was hooked; I could even skip brushing my teeth every other day! However, Tom&#x27;s of Maine got bought out by some conglomerate a couple years ago and changed their formula to something icky and closely resembling commercial toothpaste. I was never able to get that perpetually clean feeling back, so I started trying other brands that were glycerin and fluoride free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll admit I don&#x27;t LOVE this one as much as I loved the original Tom&#x27;s. However, I still give it 5 stars because I have consistently bought it over the last 2 years and have been unable to find anything better. Yes, it&#x27;s a bit pricey compared to the 99 cent tubes of paste my dad used to pick up at Walmart and even Tom&#x27;s, but one tube lasts our 2 person family close to 6 months, and when you think about the importance of oral care and it&#x27;s impact on your daily wellbeing, I&#x27;d much rather spend the occasional 7 bucks then deal with dental problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how helpful it is in &amp;#34;restructuring&amp;#34; enamel, but I feel confident that the ingredients at least aren&#x27;t damaging it. Interestingly enough, when I went in for a mandated dental checkup, the dental technician commented that it was unusual for him to see teeth like mine with such thick dentin. At the time I had been using this paste for about a year in addition to regularly drinking raw milk and occasionally taking fermented cod liver oil. So maybe the paste does something after all!</li>
            <li> I love this brand of toothpaste. However it&#x27;s not very pepperminty. I definitely recommend it but is you want a refreshing mint flavor....get the wintergreen.</li>
            <li> Lately, I&#x27;ve been in the process of transitioning all of my personal care products from \\&quot;natural\\&quot; stuff to truly natural products. Toothpaste has been the latest thing to switch and so far I am absolutely loving this stuff! This is my first time using a toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t have glycerin -- I&#x27;m not sure that there are any other glycerin-free toothpastes out there -- what a difference the exclusion of that ingredient makes! My teeth feel WAY cleaner. I&#x27;ve been using it about a week now so far and see no need to ever use anything else again. I don&#x27;t even feel like I need to use mouthwash. Just this and floss do the trick. As others have noted, the natural color and fact that it doesn&#x27;t foam may take some getting used to for some, but these things don&#x27;t phase me at all. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste ever! Buy it, now!</li>
            <li> My favorite all natural toothpaste</li>
            <li> When initially buying this product it did not show that it contains traces of lead.</li>
            <li> Excellent toothpaste! Doesn&#x27;t take long at all to get used to. But be careful, it makes a mess in your sink.</li>
            <li> I love this paste!  I finally feel I am using a product that is actually good for me &amp; my teeth!</li>
            <li> Love this. Foaming toothpaste has always made me gag, so this alternative is fantastic. And I love the salty-minty taste. My teeth feel smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> Great product! Finally a good toothpaste that isn&#x27;t bad for you!</li>
            <li> About a year and a half ago, I noticed the gums on my top two incisors were receding. I had read about people having success with oral irrigation, so I installed a showerhead-adapted model in my shower. It did its job well, but seemed to do nothing for my gums. If anything, it exacerbated the problem, as the force of the jet would push my gums up higher, and the water getting underneath the gum line didn&#x27;t feel too pleasant. I then considered my toothpaste, a standard-issue white foaming paste with proclaimed whitening properties, and a massive dose of fluoride. I purchased Earthpaste, based on the good reviews, and I was not disappointed. My gums now look excellent, as do my teeth. The lack of foam takes some getting used to, but it isn&#x27;t terrible. My mouth feels cleaner, and my breath is fresher, for longer. And because the toothpaste is made from essential oils, the oils cling to the gums longer, continuing to do their job long after the toothbrush leaves the mouth. This was money well spent, and I see no reason to ever return to store-bought fluoride toothpaste.</li>
            <li> The box says that you may swallow this toothpaste. The descriptions on this website and on the box itself list only \\&quot;essential oils,\\&quot; which naturally I assumed was the peppermint oil that gives it flavor.  But turns out the toothpaste contains tea tree oil, which is not listed on the box or the web description, only on the tube itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The American Cancer Society website says this about tea tree oil, the hidden ingredient: \\&quot;Tea tree oil is toxic when swallowed. It has been reported to cause drowsiness, confusion, hallucinations, coma, unsteadiness, weakness, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach upset, blood cell abnormalities, and severe rashes. It should be kept away from pets and children.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just threw it away.</li>
