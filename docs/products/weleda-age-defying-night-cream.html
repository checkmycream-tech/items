            <li>This night cream works really well at moisturizing the skin and fine lines without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t really improved anything, like fine lines.</li>
            <li>bought this moisturiser in Israel, at about 40% discount, which summed up to about 20$ and was totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this because they use some natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>There are other similar products out there, but the Weleda brand works best.</li>
            <li>Smell dissipates pretty quickly after application.  </li>
            <li>The Wild Rose is for the older woman.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would have more of a rose scent, but it smells only slightly of roses and more of grass.</li>
            <li>It melts right into the skin and feels silky.</li>
            <li>Weleda is a reliable company and I really enjoy their products, especially the Wild Rose line.</li>

            <li>Overall, good product and all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>It absorbs right it and makes the skin really soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a change in my skin within the first week of using Weleda.</li>
            <li>You will wake up to a smooth, soft and baby looking skin in the morning.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t use it daily, because the smell is just over the top.  </li>
            <li>It truly makes my skin feel nourished and smooth and it has all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I enjoy them all for their natural, organic ingredients and their moisturizing performance.</li>
            <li>but all this product did was make my skin more dry.</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit strong, but it goes away soon enough.</li>
            <li>It definitely is that -- goes on smooth and thick, but soaks in nicely and quickly.  </li>
            <li>I like the smell even if a little stronger than I would have liked.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about how fantastic this cream is and how hooked I am.</li>
            <li>It really smells like rose.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazon sells it cheaper than Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>If you use too much it feels greasy (a dab</li>
            <li>I really like how my face looks and feels in the morning after I have applied it the evening before and</li>
            <li>Calms the skin, and really re-hydrates.</li>
            <li>I love other weleda products and this one was not an exception.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>A high quality product.  </li>
            <li>might be that i had really high expectations.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I should have listen to the other reviewer regarding the strong smell of this cream.</li>
            <li>These products work with the natural rythm of your skins CRF ( cell renewal factor ), and are not abrassive ;they will not strip your skin of its natural oils , and will work in conjunction with your acid mantle in providing the ultimate protection from free radicals .</li>
            <li>It smells like natural, handpicked roses and the formula is gentle and nourishing to the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have normal skin</li>
            <li>The cream itself is free of petroleums and other junk that you don&#x27;t want on your skin.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin so soft and it was super dry since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li>They also have skin food cream for the hands and dry cold winters it is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Please try them, your skin will thank you for using these natural products withing a week .</li>
            <li>I&#x27; m sensitive on the fragrance.</li>
            <li>I go back and forth about how much I like this night cream.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure this would be a thick enough cream -- really wanted something moisturizing to put on at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>hitting 40 in the very near future and find that my skin is drier, except the t-zone, which has now just normal.</li>
            <li>This product is probably great for babies with dry skin but for the average adult it is very heavy, greasy and per my dermatologist, pore clogging.</li>
            <li>Overall I really like product but wish it would have a lasting moisturizing effect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a major deal breaker for a night cream as you would have to tolerate it while falling asleep.</li>
            <li>I am super sensitive, and this is very hydrating without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li>I am a 30 year old female with combination skin.</li>
            <li>And it hasn&#x27;t done any harm to my combination, acne prone, sensitive skin, so that&#x27;s a big plus.  </li>
            <li>the size of a pea is enough for your whole face) but my skin is so dry it absorbs that in no time.</li>
            <li>My skin feels really soft and i can definitely tell that it is smoother (especially on the forehead).</li>
            <li>If you have young kids or babies, their calendula cream is a must for soothing their skin or minor rashes etc.</li>
            <li>I wish I&#x27;d discovered this before I spent the last 20 years paying for high end dept store moisturizers.</li>
            <li>and I have dry sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I just didn&#x27;t see much difference and it left my skin a little greasy feeling...</li>

            <li> Makes my skin so soft and it was super dry since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> They also have skin food cream for the hands and dry cold winters it is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Please try them, your skin will thank you for using these natural products withing a week .</li>
            <li> I&#x27; m sensitive on the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I go back and forth about how much I like this night cream.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure this would be a thick enough cream -- really wanted something moisturizing to put on at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> hitting 40 in the very near future and find that my skin is drier, except the t-zone, which has now just normal.</li>
            <li> This product is probably great for babies with dry skin but for the average adult it is very heavy, greasy and per my dermatologist, pore clogging.</li>
            <li> Overall I really like product but wish it would have a lasting moisturizing effect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a major deal breaker for a night cream as you would have to tolerate it while falling asleep.</li>
            <li> I am super sensitive, and this is very hydrating without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> I am a 30 year old female with combination skin.</li>
            <li> And it hasn&#x27;t done any harm to my combination, acne prone, sensitive skin, so that&#x27;s a big plus.  </li>
            <li> the size of a pea is enough for your whole face) but my skin is so dry it absorbs that in no time.</li>
            <li> My skin feels really soft and i can definitely tell that it is smoother (especially on the forehead).</li>
            <li> If you have young kids or babies, their calendula cream is a must for soothing their skin or minor rashes etc.</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d discovered this before I spent the last 20 years paying for high end dept store moisturizers.</li>
            <li> and I have dry sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t see much difference and it left my skin a little greasy feeling...</li>
            <li> I purchased this foolishly after reading a review from a certain female comic who shall remain nameless.  </li>
            <li> I recently bought this product after having tried Weleda&#x27;s skin food for my dry elbows.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, this is for you.  </li>
            <li> My husband has extremely dry skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;i have really dry skin.</li>
            <li> Unless you have a really dry skin.</li>
            <li> I am 25 years old and I only breakout very little if I am about to get my period, but when I use this product I break out all over all the time!</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> I get cystic acne and use diluted Panoxyl face wash every other day which works, but can severely dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> In just a few days my skin was noticeably younger looking, and with no irritation.</li>
            <li> For a few years I&#x27;ve been using Weleda facial toner, moisture lotions and creams, and some body oils.  </li>
            <li> You only need to use a small amount for it to cover well.  </li>
            <li> Also feels a little greasy but not unusual for a night cream.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap, but it doesn&#x27;t break the bank either.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a rather small bottle for 20 bucks</li>
            <li> wanted something to hydrate my skin during the night, but usually wake up still with not so moist skin.</li>
            <li> usually end up needing a corn nuts size (if anyone knows what that is).</li>
            <li> After trying a ridiculous number of moisturizers from the cheapest to the terribly expensive, I feel I have finally hit the jackpot, and couldn&#x27;t be happier.    </li>
            <li> I have always had VERY dry skin, which unfortunately has become prematurely wrinkly skin with age.</li>
            <li> I particularly enjoy this during the winter months when my skin is flaking off and nasty.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s thick in consistency, which I like a lot.  </li>
            <li> The tube is very small, but it goes a looooong way.</li>
            <li> and I usually use this in the cold, harsh winter.</li>
            <li> and the texture is very thick</li>
            <li> Annoyed by the scent.</li>
            <li> and I broke out like crazy.</li>
            <li> But if you don&#x27;t like that, this will be annoying to you.  </li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to use an awful lot.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Smells amazing and works great on my really dry skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in the appearance of my skin, but it did smell good.</li>
            <li> Weleda products are amazing. Very moisturizing and the scent is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Exelent product ! I will recommended .</li>
            <li> Hello,  I have to say , Weleda carries the best products at an affordable price !!! Please try them, your skin will thank you for using these natural products withing a week . I noticed a change in my skin within the first week of using Weleda. I am never changing my skin care products again . These products work with the natural rythm of your skins CRF ( cell renewal factor ), and are not abrassive ;they will not strip your skin of its natural oils , and will work in conjunction with your acid mantle in providing the ultimate protection from free radicals . I will never leave Weleda!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product gave my skin a youthful glow.  Wish it came larger than 1 oz--I use it sparingly and it only lasts about 30 days.  Overall, good product and all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Weleda is a reliable company and I really enjoy their products, especially the Wild Rose line. It smells like natural, handpicked roses and the formula is gentle and nourishing to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;It is a rather small bottle for 20 bucks but the cream is very good and you don&#x27;t have to use an awful lot. It melts right into the skin and feels silky. The rose smell is natural and a bit stronger. I love it though and I find it relaxing.</li>
            <li> This is the best you can do for your skin at night time! You will wake up to a smooth, soft and baby looking skin in the morning. I can&#x27;t say enough about how fantastic this cream is and how hooked I am. I love many Weleda products, but this is my all time favorite. The tube is very small, but it goes a looooong way. You only need a little bit. Tube is also made of metal, not plastic. The cap is plastic, but recyclable, I believe. The cream itself is free of petroleums and other junk that you don&#x27;t want on your skin. And of course you can&#x27;t beat Amazon.com price. I suggest you subscribe for delivery every 3-6 months and save even more. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, this is for you.  If you have oily skin and are looking for a good moisturizer, this is for you.  My husband has extremely dry skin and this takes care of it.  I have combination/oily and acne-prone skin and this does not cause breakouts at all.  Have been using this for about a year and will always continue to do so.  I do not like the scent of &amp;#34;rose&amp;#34; at all, but this is so awesome I will put up with the scent.</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent, thick, and ultra-moisturizing. I love this stuff. It&#x27;s not cheap, but it doesn&#x27;t break the bank either. I particularly enjoy this during the winter months when my skin is flaking off and nasty. It helps. I even use it in the daytime.</li>
            <li> Has a nice rose scent but it may be too strong for some people. Does go on greasy but it is as expcted with a night cream. Overall I really like product but wish it would have a lasting moisturizing effect.</li>
            <li> The cream smells nothing like a rose - more like a cracked heel ointment. It&#x27;s a major deal breaker for a night cream as you would have to tolerate it while falling asleep.</li>
            <li> This cream is okay.  It is definitely hydrating.  I just didn&#x27;t see much difference and it left my skin a little greasy feeling...and I have dry sensitive skin.  I like the Wild Rose day cream...just not this night cream.</li>
            <li> What a wonderful moisturiser!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using WELEDA products for years,they are always great- and this one is no exeption.&lt;br /&gt;The texture of the moisturiser is somewhat liquidy- but not runny -which allows it to be absorbed easily in the skin.&lt;br /&gt;It smoothes the skin and moisturises it for hours.&lt;br /&gt;The gentle Rose scent is very pleasant, and lingers for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this moisturiser in Israel, at about 40% discount, which summed up to about 20$ and was totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> great..after one week I use it my skin looks better! A high quality product.  Especially for irritated skin. Suggested to everyone</li>
            <li> This product has a STRONG smell.  I get it.  It says rose.  It&#x27;s going to smell like rose.  But man.  It really smells like rose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s thick in consistency, which I like a lot.  But if you don&#x27;t like that, this will be annoying to you.  It doesn&#x27;t disappear into your skin, but definitely sits there.  Again, I like that.  But it&#x27;s all a matter of preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it though.  If I have a day where my skin is super irritated, it feels really nice to smooth on after washing my face.  I couldn&#x27;t use it daily, because the smell is just over the top.  But good product.</li>
            <li> Weleda is my one of favorite brand, I would buy any product from them, because they have better practice in natural skincare products, I like this product, except price,  it&#x27;s not too strong smell. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this item because the next morning after using the night cream, I see a big difference in smoothness with my skin&#x27;s texture. The seller had my item arrive promptly and in perfect condition. I love Weleda products!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure this would be a thick enough cream -- really wanted something moisturizing to put on at the end of the day.  It definitely is that -- goes on smooth and thick, but soaks in nicely and quickly.  Skin feels great. It does have a rather strong rosey smell, so if that might bother you, beware.  Smell dissipates pretty quickly after application.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this foolishly after reading a review from a certain female comic who shall remain nameless.  This product is probably great for babies with dry skin but for the average adult it is very heavy, greasy and per my dermatologist, pore clogging.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the purchase. I love other weleda products and this one was not an exception. Smells great and works magic.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife. She loves this product and has been using it for years. Amazon sells it cheaper than Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price</li>
            <li> I recently bought this product after having tried Weleda&#x27;s skin food for my dry elbows. I have always had VERY dry skin, which unfortunately has become prematurely wrinkly skin with age. After trying a ridiculous number of moisturizers from the cheapest to the terribly expensive, I feel I have finally hit the jackpot, and couldn&#x27;t be happier.    If you use too much it feels greasy (a dab the size of a pea is enough for your whole face) but my skin is so dry it absorbs that in no time. I should also mention I break out at the drop of a hat... not only does this product smell WONDERFUL, it has soothed my breakouts. In just a few days my skin was noticeably younger looking, and with no irritation. Now that I have found this, I can&#x27;t imagine ever buying anything else. Hooray!</li>
            <li> Love it.. smells a little off but great product</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get passed the smell to use it enough to know if it is any good. Annoyed by the scent.</li>
            <li> If you are one whose dry skin benefits from some oil, this cream is great. I really like how my face looks and feels in the morning after I have applied it the evening before and the scent is so wonderful, not synthetic or perfumy.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong and it is a bit oily which is why I took off a star.  But I have been very pleased with the results-skin looks healthy and glows.</li>
            <li> I only give this product a 4 star instead of 5 because I prefer the Iris line. However, I&#x27;m told that because of my age I should probably switch. Iris feels thicker, more hydrating, and I also prefer the scent but Wild Rose is nice too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27; m sensitive on the fragrance. I do enjoy the rose scent. I think I will stick with this brand for a while. Overall, it;s a quality product.</li>
            <li> This is great night cream. Calms the skin, and really re-hydrates. It helps with scarring too.</li>
            <li> Execellent product. Same as brick and mortor product. Purchase here based on convenience having it delivered.</li>
            <li> good moisturizer for night time.</li>
            <li> This night cream works really well at moisturizing the skin and fine lines without being greasy.  You only need to use a small amount for it to cover well.  It absorbs right it and makes the skin really soft and smooth.  It has a lovely rose scent as well.  Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I am a 30 year old female with combination skin. I get cystic acne and use diluted Panoxyl face wash every other day which works, but can severely dry out my skin. This has been a miracle worker. I use this about three nights a week and it has balanced out my skin to a place of normalcy I haven&#x27;t seen in years. I believe this is great as part of a balanced regime, whichever may work for you.</li>
            <li> Super price for a really great product!! I am super sensitive, and this is very hydrating without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> product not suits for my skin type and the weather in south bay of san francisco bay area region i guess. and the texture is very thick</li>
            <li> I should have listen to the other reviewer regarding the strong smell of this cream. It doesn&#x27;t smell anything like rosé. But rather smell like some chemical stuff.</li>
            <li> Really rich, excellent night cream. I have normal skin and I usually use this in the cold, harsh winter. It truly makes my skin feel nourished and smooth and it has all natural ingredients. I enjoy the rose smell.</li>
            <li> A very nice night cream that truly removes wrinkles. There are other similar products out there, but the Weleda brand works best. The cream also smells amazing, it is a true rose scent and not synthetic.</li>
            <li> I go back and forth about how much I like this night cream. The smell is a bit strong, but it goes away soon enough. The texture is good and it does what it needs to do, and keeps my facial skin hydrated. It hasn&#x27;t really improved anything, like fine lines. But maybe its preventing them. And it hasn&#x27;t done any harm to my combination, acne prone, sensitive skin, so that&#x27;s a big plus.  I&#x27;ll continue to use it until I find something better.</li>
            <li> I thought it would have more of a rose scent, but it smells only slightly of roses and more of grass. Plus it&#x27;s a bit greasy.  Not my favorite, but ok.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a month now and I love it. My skin feels really soft and i can definitely tell that it is smoother (especially on the forehead). I like the smell even if a little stronger than I would have liked. Also feels a little greasy but not unusual for a night cream.  Great product for a good price</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Makes my skin so soft and it was super dry since I was a teenager. I love the smell too. Every time I put it on my son or my husband tell me I smell like roses.</li>
            <li> Smells great and like the essential oils in it.</li>
            <li> For a few years I&#x27;ve been using Weleda facial toner, moisture lotions and creams, and some body oils.  I enjoy them all for their natural, organic ingredients and their moisturizing performance.</li>
            <li> Great product. Amazing smell . Goes on smooth and layers well on too of serums.</li>
            <li> This night treatment is the best I&#x27;ve tried so far. However, wished that it has been designed in a bigger size.</li>
            <li> might be that i had really high expectations.&lt;br /&gt;i have really dry skin. hitting 40 in the very near future and find that my skin is drier, except the t-zone, which has now just normal. wanted something to hydrate my skin during the night, but usually wake up still with not so moist skin. really wanted to LOVE it. i&#x27;ll be using up this product, which i suspect will happen soon since the tube is only 1oz and i end up needing more than a corn kernel size. usually end up needing a corn nuts size (if anyone knows what that is).</li>
            <li> This product is way too greasy feeling and I broke out like crazy. I am 25 years old and I only breakout very little if I am about to get my period, but when I use this product I break out all over all the time! Also, I have normal/dry skin but all this product did was make my skin more dry.</li>
            <li> I love this night cream, it does everything the reviews say and I am very pleased with the results</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d discovered this before I spent the last 20 years paying for high end dept store moisturizers. This, and the day cream, are a fraction of the cost and work even better. They are light enough but do a great job of moisturizing, and the smell is so pleasant and light without being chemical or overpowering. Thank you Weleda! If you have young kids or babies, their calendula cream is a must for soothing their skin or minor rashes etc. Works on grown ups too!</li>
            <li> Weleda is from Germany, have used it for years.  The Wild Rose is for the older woman.  Unless you have a really dry skin. Weleda has lighter creams.  I love this because they use some natural ingredients.  They also have skin food cream for the hands and dry cold winters it is wonderful.  Love Weleda!!</li>
