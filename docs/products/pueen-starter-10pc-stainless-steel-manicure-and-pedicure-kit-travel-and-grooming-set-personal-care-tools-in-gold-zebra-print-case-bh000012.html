            <li>Good kit, worth the money, easy to use and to travel with</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is absolutely worth the price I paid for it, and I would pay more - that&#x27;s how nice it is.</li>
            <li>I find most things from there are made cheaply.</li>
            <li>The cuticle clippers easily removed years aggravation and bleeding.</li>
            <li>Nothing in this set will bend easily.</li>
            <li>It is a lovely product for the special woman in your life.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>received this within 2 days of ordering it, so seller is a fast shipper, which is a nice bonus!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The case fit and fastener works</li>
            <li>great but quality pieces low price</li>
            <li>The stainless is very strong.</li>
            <li>lol, I put it in a little purse where I keep my nail enamels and stuff for my nails :)</li>
            <li>It holds it all nicely, stays closed, and it is nice to look at.&lt;br</li>
            <li>saw this and thought my husband would like it, and with Father&#x27;s Day right around the corner - it was a no brainer!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather be ready than have to buy more.  </li>
            <li>This was good enough that I didn&#x27;t hesitate to give it as a gift.</li>
            <li>set sight unseen, but I wasn&#x27;t able to find anything I liked for a reasonable price in my local stores.  </li>
            <li>It actually was better than I thought it would be!</li>
            <li>I hope the company makes it right by sending a correctly made one.</li>
            <li>fine (so far).</li>
            <li>I have purchased many clippers and sets, and all of the items were low quality.</li>
            <li>the first</li>
            <li>Would have preferred if most tools were about 10%-15% bigger.  </li>
            <li>I bought a set of 2 stainless Tweezers and paid $30 for just them, and they are made exactly like the toolss in this set.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, I always take it to my salon since I dont like to use the one they use with everyone else because I dont want to get fungus on my feet or nails, so yes this is worth buying, it is a littleee small but serves it purpose very well and has everything you need and pieces are sharp in a good way :) , just make sure to put everything else back the way it goes so it can close, for me it works because I put it right back after use in the right spot and the case has glitter on and is covered with plastic</li>
            <li>This item is very cheaply made and is not very useful.</li>
            <li>set contains tools I&#x27;ll probably never use (double-side blackhead remover loop, anyone?), but I really don&#x27;t care since it has all the tools I *do* want.  </li>
            <li>The clippers are so much sharper than any</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>He LOVES it!&lt;br /&gt;All of the items in this set are very well made.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many have been thrown away from either breaking or not being sharp</li>
            <li>U have everything in this small case ,for manicure and pedicure,and easy 2 travel with, and the stainless stel super</li>
            <li>everything looks nice and fits well in small compact area.  </li>
            <li>The elastic holding the tools in place is strong, not the cheap elastic that will break after a few times of taking them out &amp; putting back in.</li>
            <li>The clippers are sharp and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>All of the tools are made of relatively thick (appropriate for the given tool) stainless steel.  </li>
            <li>Besides, I may find that I do need certain tools in the future.  </li>
            <li>of us used some of the items to cut our nails etc, and found the clippers to be very sharp, which is great because you don&#x27;t want to cut a nail and have to go back and cut the rest because the blades weren&#x27;t sharp enough to do it</li>
            <li>The vinyl (\\&quot;vegan leather\\&quot;) is far shinier than the photo</li>
            <li>The only thing that surprised me was the padded vinyl exterior.  </li>
            <li>I have only used the nail clippers so far.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re slightly OCD where tool care is concerned (&amp;#34;A place for everything and everything in its place&amp;#34;), then this is for you.</li>
            <li>The other tools seem well made, I like the stainless steel quality.  </li>

            <li> U have everything in this small case ,for manicure and pedicure,and easy 2 travel with, and the stainless stel super</li>
            <li> purchased because my wife always lost our nail clippers etc.  everything looks nice and fits well in small compact area.  i take it traveling or just leave in the bathroom so everything is always in order</li>
            <li> Not great quality like some of the other reviewers were commenting but not terrible for the price and it is compact with the case.</li>
            <li> good product good price arrived promptly well packaged thank you</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about buying a manicure set sight unseen, but I wasn&#x27;t able to find anything I liked for a reasonable price in my local stores.  I decided to try this set based on reviews, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  All of the tools are made of relatively thick (appropriate for the given tool) stainless steel.

The only thing that surprised me was the padded vinyl exterior.  The vinyl (\\&quot;vegan leather\\&quot;) is far shinier than the photo shows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set contains tools I&#x27;ll probably never use (double-side blackhead remover loop, anyone?), but I really don&#x27;t care since it has all the tools I *do* want.  Besides, I may find that I do need certain tools in the future.  I&#x27;d rather be ready than have to buy more.  The case measures 6.25\\&quot; x 3.25\\&quot; x .75\\&quot;, and all the tools are full-size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</li>
            <li> Ordered this as a Christmas gift for my teenage daughter and she loves it. She really likes the smiley faces on the nail clippers, very nice quality.</li>
            <li> The clippers are so much sharper than any I have bought in the stores. I&#x27;m really pleased with the quality and weight of the tools and the beauty of the case.</li>
            <li> This is a great value for the money. The clippers are very sharp and works well. I may not use all the items in the set but it is a great price for everything you get.</li>
            <li> The product looks okay. But it does not work for me. It is not what I was looking for. I may return it.</li>
            <li> Received in time.  Overall, the quality is really bad.  Tried a couple of times, and now it&#x27;s sitting inside my drawer.</li>
            <li> Great set of tools for the mani pedi. Very sharp though so be careful. I cut my self a couple of times already.</li>
            <li> I bought for my sister´s birthday, and she was very happy, I bought for my sisters in law. It´s a good gift</li>
            <li> I have only used the nail clippers so far.  The other tools seem well made, I like the stainless steel quality.  Sure, you can pay much more, but why would you want to?</li>
            <li> This is a very nice mani/pedi set. Everything is made with stainless steel and seems to be in very good quality.</li>
            <li> Although the quality of the tOOLS appear.to be ok the case was not well made. The scissor holder has already come off, the clasp doesn&#x27;t snap well, and there are already loose strings on the holders for  a couple other tools.  I hope the company makes it right by sending a correctly made one.</li>
            <li> Good construction. The cuticle clippers easily removed years aggravation and bleeding. My cuticles had cuticles and now my toes and fingers thank you. I hope they last.</li>
            <li> It actually was better than I thought it would be! thanks I am thinking about ordering another one they are that nice.</li>
            <li> Good kit, worth the money, easy to use and to travel with, I always take it to my salon since I dont like to use the one they use with everyone else because I dont want to get fungus on my feet or nails, so yes this is worth buying, it is a littleee small but serves it purpose very well and has everything you need and pieces are sharp in a good way :) , just make sure to put everything else back the way it goes so it can close, for me it works because I put it right back after use in the right spot and the case has glitter on and is covered with plastic so it will be durable and its not like you are going to carry this around like a purse lol, I put it in a little purse where I keep my nail enamels and stuff for my nails :)</li>
            <li> I have purchased many clippers and sets, and all of the items were low quality. I can&#x27;t tell you how many have been thrown away from either breaking or not being sharp enough.&lt;br /&gt;I saw this and thought my husband would like it, and with Father&#x27;s Day right around the corner - it was a no brainer! He LOVES it!&lt;br /&gt;All of the items in this set are very well made. The stainless is very strong. There are 10 pieces to this set, so you don&#x27;t have t go looking for anything when doing your Mani/Pedi&#x27;s! All of the clippers/scissors are extremely sharp. Nothing in this set will bend easily. The case everything is in is also really nice. The elastic holding the tools in place is strong, not the cheap elastic that will break after a few times of taking them out &amp; putting back in. It holds it all nicely, stays closed, and it is nice to look at.&lt;br /&gt;Both of us used some of the items to cut our nails etc, and found the clippers to be very sharp, which is great because you don&#x27;t want to cut a nail and have to go back and cut the rest because the blades weren&#x27;t sharp enough to do it the first time.&lt;br /&gt;It is absolutely worth the price I paid for it, and I would pay more - that&#x27;s how nice it is. I bought a set of 2 stainless Tweezers and paid $30 for just them, and they are made exactly like the toolss in this set.&lt;br /&gt;I received this within 2 days of ordering it, so seller is a fast shipper, which is a nice bonus!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend!!</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift. It is a lovely product for the special woman in your life.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased .</li>
            <li> Good selection of tools and implements.  I like the feel and quality of the materials.  Would have preferred if most tools were about 10%-15% bigger.  Feels like I&#x27;m doing micro surgery when using them. The case fit and fastener works fine (so far). The configuration of tool placement is very efficient and impressive. I couldn&#x27;t have designed it better.  I you&#x27;re slightly OCD where tool care is concerned (&amp;#34;A place for everything and everything in its place&amp;#34;), then this is for you.</li>
            <li> This came in a very nice compact case and was much better quality than I thought it would be since it was Made in China. I find most things from there are made cheaply. This was good enough that I didn&#x27;t hesitate to give it as a gift.</li>
            <li> Received product. Looks great and, by and large, items appear to be quality made. However, the carrying case lid latch doesn&#x27;t function so that the lid doesn&#x27;t snap close, in fact it will not close at all. The latch catch does not mate with it&#x27;s slot properly. Refund policy unsatisfactory.</li>
            <li> great but quality pieces low price</li>
            <li> This item is very cheaply made and is not very useful. Don&#x27;t bother buying this item, you will be very disappointed</li>
            <li> What a nice manicure set! It has everything you could ever need all in a nice case. It is so handy for travel as well as having by my chair. I highly recommend! I plan on purchasing again for some gifts.</li>
