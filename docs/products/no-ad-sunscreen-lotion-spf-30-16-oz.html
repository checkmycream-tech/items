            <li>No-Ad 30 is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Now, if resistance to being sweated off or washed off while swimming is a concern, then this stuff may be the greatest.....</li>
            <li>Perfect for those who burn through sunblock the way my household does.</li>
            <li>Remember to reapply every 80 mins if you have fair skin!</li>

            <li>No-Ad is a great suncreen.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a happy customer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great stuff, no perfume and is a great moisturizer</li>
            <li>Very good brand that we use most often!</li>
            <li>Great for my boyfriend&#x27;s fair skin.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be a good product</li>
            <li>This is just another case of a good product being eliminated by the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>I may have opted for the spf 45 from this brand as I have fair</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is a good value and it kept me from getting burnt while on a cruise.</li>
            <li>- Good price&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Have always loved the No-Ad sun products.</li>
            <li>feels good not sticky</li>
            <li>NO-AD is a good product.</li>
            <li>really good protection.</li>
            <li>I also won&#x27;t say a product is good when It isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t like the product, I won&#x27;t say it is good.  </li>
            <li>Good buy</li>
            <li>This is the best sunscreen I have ever found, no watery eyes, easy and smooth, and does what it is supposed to do, protects from the sun</li>
            <li>Because I use the 30 on my face and the 15 everywhere else, I never burn but get a nice tan.  </li>
            <li>We should be honest about everything, because lies catch up to you.  </li>
            <li>Goes on nicely and protects well.</li>
            <li>This is by far one of the best sunscreens that i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Works well in the Southwest sunshine - easy to apply, goes on well, portable to reapply and it works!</li>
            <li>Great sunscreen that is safe to use while pregnant, and safe to use on my infant son.</li>
            <li>We normally use factor 15 but decided to use No-AD as it got very good reviews.</li>
            <li>This is great stuff, it works without any sent and not expensive.</li>
            <li>Good Product without any harmful chemicals, shipped quickly</li>
            <li>Better than the hi priced bottles you find all over maui, I take this with me and save a ton of money.</li>
            <li>Love this sunblock.  </li>
            <li>I finally found it here and at a great price too!</li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>I have used No-Add for many years and the best ever is the 30 Sport Lotion in the 16 oz blue bottle.  </li>
            <li>Needs to be re applied after swimming as most brands do.</li>
            <li>I am glad Amazon carries it.  </li>
            <li>I would rather pay more for another brand then deal with my kids and I being in pain.</li>
            <li>I have used No Ad for many, many years--I&#x27;d take an educated guess as to how many, but then you&#x27;d know my age</li>
            <li>Not only is this the cheapest sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used, It is probably the best.  </li>
            <li>Best Sunscreen on Market as I look ahead to ifs arrival in the next week or so!</li>
            <li>What more do you want?</li>
            <li>I am ordering more today.</li>
            <li>It is also quite cheap!  </li>
            <li>I love no ad and use it all the time.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>My favorite sunscreen lotion , went to Mexico w it .</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t cake up either and is easy to wash off in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I knew how strong the punta cana sun was going to be</li>
            <li>NO-AD has the right ingredients for protection and good coverage (I rarely reapply.)  </li>
            <li>Great coverage for general beach and swimming.</li>
            <li>Everything was fine, but I wish the lotion were wrapped in a plastic sleeve.</li>
            <li>Great for extra coverage areas like ears and nose.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see it as available</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, smells like aloe and keeps my skin from burning through all day tournaments in the sun.</li>
            <li>Cheap, works, goes on light, does not make me cry, does not clog skin.  </li>
            <li>Good packaging, sealed properly, early shipping.</li>
            <li>I cannot find it here where I live, so I went online to Amazon.com and found it there and am very glad I did.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Stuff is great, and equal to much higher priced sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>I liked it because it was unscented for me being chemically sensitive and was affordable.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t really need much more than 30 spf.</li>
            <li>This is even with full days on the beach getting in and out of the water.  </li>
            <li>Not all sticky or cakey absorbes quickly.  </li>
            <li>Love this better than your traditional brands!</li>
            <li>Product shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>After you put it on the smell quickly dissipates.</li>
            <li>A friend put me onto this product years ago - and it is super in every respect.  </li>
            <li>I am a red head and have vitiligo, which is the losing of one&#x27;s pigmentation of the skin, and I was light skinned before loss of pigmentation and sunburned very easily.  </li>
            <li>have very light and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The product works as described, the price is right, and it was shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product and is not available in store in my area that I can find.  </li>
            <li>We ordered the whole range and it is our primary sunscreen.</li>
            <li>One of the leaders in the sunscreen game, NO-AD brings the best quality for the money.</li>
            <li>Non greasy with a fresh scent.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes your dry skin pretty good after swimming in the ocean or pool.</li>
            <li>So hard to find good unscented products!</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and exactly as described.</li>
            <li>right after you apply the lotion.</li>
            <li>, right?  </li>
            <li>fantastic product - works much better than the more expensive brands at a bargain price - excellent coverage with a little product</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I first purchased it at WalMart.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen lets you get dark and is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>But for me, that&#x27;s better than the alternatives of sunburn (and possible longer term damage) or allergic reaction.</li>
            <li>does exactly what it says it&#x27;s going to</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ironically, I just visited two Walmarts - they don&#x27;t have it; I have a feeling people was buying this instead of the higher priced stuff - and it has to be taken away.  </li>
            <li>This product is exactly what you think it is.  </li>
            <li>It does burn your eyes if it starts running, but that is the same as most sunscreens.</li>
            <li>i love this sunblock, because protect me all day long and it is no greasy, so i can used without concern</li>
            <li>I burn easily, and this sunscreen is the only one I use.  </li>
            <li>Very god protection, long lasting, and good price</li>
            <li>I just want to tell you that I am not the kind of person who will say something that is not true about any product.</li>
            <li>I bought 4 bottles but was very dissapointed because of the odor and will throw them away.</li>
            <li>Very convenient for me.</li>
            <li>I used it on my face and did not break as well as my whole body.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s works well, without all the added fragrances, and is very affordable.  </li>
            <li>I have been using No-Ad for about 5 years now and it really does the trick.  </li>
            <li>thankfully Amazon helped me attain this highly recommend product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It goes on thick and provides an amazing protective coating on you skin for being outdoors in the sun.</li>
            <li>This itching burning suffering is unbearable, I can&#x27;t wear sleeves take a hot shower or barely sleep.  </li>
            <li>I have been using No-Ad for a few years now, and have been consistently pleased.</li>
            <li>I applied a normal amount of this no ad spf30 to my face and arms and legs and it seemed like I had applied something like a 50wt motor oil to my skin....</li>
            <li>right used it for my trip last month to mexico</li>
            <li>Love that it has no strong odor.</li>
            <li>I got the free shipping, and this product came with two other items.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Easy to put on &amp; seems to hold up when outside in the sun for long periods of time.</li>
            <li>Long lasting, easy to apply, not greasy.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen contains more for about the same price as other sunscreens.</li>
            <li>That said, I&#x27;ve tried different sunblocks and they&#x27;ve all caused some level of allergic reaction to my skin, from mild (Banana Boat Kids sunscreen lotion SPF50) to extensive rashes (Target brand sunblock SPF 30).</li>
            <li>#30 is fine when I have a good base.</li>
            <li>Works like the expensive kind and comes in a large size.</li>
            <li>Surprised that it out performed Neutrogena and Olay and Coppertone.</li>
            <li>but motor oil is FAR easier to get OFF.  </li>
            <li>I think I got an old batch.</li>
            <li>No Ad Sunblock is inexpensive enough to lay on thick and get protection that i found was effective.  </li>
            <li>Highly rated in every test I&#x27;ve read, such as Consumer Reports</li>
            <li>I would not use it in very hot zones; Aruba, Jamaica without a good base.</li>
            <li>goes on thick but rubs in easily.</li>
            <li>Little odor one absorbed, doesn&#x27;t attract insects</li>
            <li>I also appreciate that it barely has any scent to it.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients listed on the lable seem to be exactly the same for the blue and green bottles?  </li>

            <li> /&gt;Ironically, I just visited two Walmarts - they don&#x27;t have it; I have a feeling people was buying this instead of the higher priced stuff - and it has to be taken away.  </li>
            <li> This product is exactly what you think it is.  </li>
            <li> It does burn your eyes if it starts running, but that is the same as most sunscreens.</li>
            <li> i love this sunblock, because protect me all day long and it is no greasy, so i can used without concern</li>
            <li> I burn easily, and this sunscreen is the only one I use.  </li>
            <li> Very god protection, long lasting, and good price</li>
            <li> I just want to tell you that I am not the kind of person who will say something that is not true about any product.</li>
            <li> I bought 4 bottles but was very dissapointed because of the odor and will throw them away.</li>
            <li> Very convenient for me.</li>
            <li> I used it on my face and did not break as well as my whole body.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works well, without all the added fragrances, and is very affordable.  </li>
            <li> I have been using No-Ad for about 5 years now and it really does the trick.  </li>
            <li> thankfully Amazon helped me attain this highly recommend product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It goes on thick and provides an amazing protective coating on you skin for being outdoors in the sun.</li>
            <li> This itching burning suffering is unbearable, I can&#x27;t wear sleeves take a hot shower or barely sleep.  </li>
            <li> I have been using No-Ad for a few years now, and have been consistently pleased.</li>
            <li> I applied a normal amount of this no ad spf30 to my face and arms and legs and it seemed like I had applied something like a 50wt motor oil to my skin....</li>
            <li> right used it for my trip last month to mexico</li>
            <li> Love that it has no strong odor.</li>
            <li> I got the free shipping, and this product came with two other items.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Easy to put on &amp; seems to hold up when outside in the sun for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, easy to apply, not greasy.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen contains more for about the same price as other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> That said, I&#x27;ve tried different sunblocks and they&#x27;ve all caused some level of allergic reaction to my skin, from mild (Banana Boat Kids sunscreen lotion SPF50) to extensive rashes (Target brand sunblock SPF 30).</li>
            <li> #30 is fine when I have a good base.</li>
            <li> Works like the expensive kind and comes in a large size.</li>
            <li> Surprised that it out performed Neutrogena and Olay and Coppertone.</li>
            <li> but motor oil is FAR easier to get OFF.  </li>
            <li> I think I got an old batch.</li>
            <li> No Ad Sunblock is inexpensive enough to lay on thick and get protection that i found was effective.  </li>
            <li> Highly rated in every test I&#x27;ve read, such as Consumer Reports</li>
            <li> I would not use it in very hot zones; Aruba, Jamaica without a good base.</li>
            <li> goes on thick but rubs in easily.</li>
            <li> Little odor one absorbed, doesn&#x27;t attract insects</li>
            <li> I also appreciate that it barely has any scent to it.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients listed on the lable seem to be exactly the same for the blue and green bottles?  </li>
            <li> My husband is outside for work all day long and never gets a sunburn.</li>
            <li> I cannot say the same for the other brands I tried during my last trip to mexico.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting&lt;br</li>
            <li> Spent a week in mexico and did not get burned while using this religiously.</li>
            <li> These last bottles I ordered smell a wee bit like deet, but not much.  </li>
            <li> I like it and find it stays on well when I am out on long bike rides in the sun.  </li>
            <li> I spend an large amount of time outdoors, especially on a boat, and getting burned is not a pleasant</li>
            <li> We love the products and find them a lot less expensive than the name brands.</li>
            <li> First it is not as thick as other sunscreens but works just as well.  </li>
            <li> Down side is that will sometimes stain clothes, etc if not dry on skin.</li>
            <li> What a complete waste of money!</li>
            <li> I would not use any other sunblock as long as I can get no ad sunblock.  </li>
            <li> Other brands without the E and aloe seemed to dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> Take it with us on our vacation in Mexico every year and feel it has done everything expected of it.</li>
            <li> A couple of years ago, I had partial leakage.</li>
            <li> So be careful what other items you combine in your order.</li>
            <li> I find other sunscreen lotions leave a drying sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> I like the product but after this trip I think I prefer other lotions over this one.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has always been extremely allergic to perfumes and other additives in sunblocks.  </li>
            <li> I finally had to use heavy duty dish soap with a green scrubby pad to get this stuff off my hands, and the rest of my skin felt sticky all day.    </li>
            <li> It is hard to find locally.  </li>
            <li> No annoying little gummy balls when reapplying at the lake, or annoying white film on the skin.</li>
            <li> It costs less per ounce, is top-rated by a consumer magazine, and has never let me down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The lotion can leave a slightly oiling look to your skin - like forehead, nose, cheeks, for example.</li>
            <li> A few spots on my legs from where I touched my skin with my hands that had the lotion on them.  </li>
            <li> so I tried the green bottle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used NO-AD for a few years now and it works well for me.  </li>
            <li> Fragrance is not too heavy and the lotion is not objectionably greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I like this stuff or not...  </li>
            <li> In the past we&#x27;ve used this without incident.</li>
            <li> but it has an unpleasant ordor like old cocoa butter.  </li>
            <li> a few days ago I developed horrible hives all over my arms which was the only place I applied it.  </li>
            <li> We have used this product for at least 15 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I got a bad bottle or</li>
            <li> Smells weird.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find No-Ad in drug stores -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost impossible to find in the store.  </li>
            <li> So why the bad smell?</li>
            <li> Maybe we got a bad batch but would not consider purchasing again.</li>
            <li> and if people can&#x27;t take the truth, too bad.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed when you purchase this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Broke out terribly using this lotion.</li>
            <li> but it would be disgusting.  </li>
            <li> No-Ad SPF 30 gave me a terrible rash on my arms and hands.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Broke out terribly using this lotion.</li>
            <li> Better than the hi priced bottles you find all over maui, I take this with me and save a ton of money.</li>
            <li> Love this sunblock.  I buy it every year.  It&#x27;s almost impossible to find in the store.  It&#x27;s the only sunblock the always keeps me from getting sunburned.</li>
            <li> i love this sunblock, because protect me all day long and it is no greasy, so i can used without concern</li>
            <li> This is a great product and is not available in store in my area that I can find.  I finally found it here and at a great price too!</li>
            <li> I like this sunscreen for the additional ingredients for your skin. Down side is that will sometimes stain clothes, etc if not dry on skin.</li>
            <li> Very good brand that we use most often!</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen I have ever found, no watery eyes, easy and smooth, and does what it is supposed to do, protects from the sun</li>
            <li> Smells weird. So hard to find good unscented products!</li>
            <li> I have used this product in all the different spf&#x27;s for years.  I liked it because it was unscented for me being chemically sensitive and was affordable.  Well just out of the blue a few days ago I developed horrible hives all over my arms which was the only place I applied it.  A few spots on my legs from where I touched my skin with my hands that had the lotion on them.  I could add a picture but it would be disgusting.  This itching burning suffering is unbearable, I can&#x27;t wear sleeves take a hot shower or barely sleep.  I don&#x27;t know what the reason is.  I just know I am never using any of their products again.  Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> One of the leaders in the sunscreen game, NO-AD brings the best quality for the money. Took this stuff to Thailand and it performed how it should. You don&#x27;t really need much more than 30 spf. Seems to be hypo allergenic as well.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a while, it is the only one that keeps me from burning, if you have not tried it, I suggest it.  I really love it.</li>
            <li> Great for extra coverage areas like ears and nose.</li>
            <li> have used this brand for years!! good product for price!! used to get it at the store but now I order it here!!</li>
            <li> Great bargain.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a good product</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best sunscreens that i&#x27;ve used. I did not know anything about no-ad before but now I am hooked. I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I have used No-Add for many years and the best ever is the 30 Sport Lotion in the 16 oz blue bottle.  I don&#x27;t see it as available anymore so I tried the green bottle but it has an unpleasant ordor like old cocoa butter.  I bought 4 bottles but was very dissapointed because of the odor and will throw them away. This is just another case of a good product being eliminated by the manufacturer.  The ingredients listed on the lable seem to be exactly the same for the blue and green bottles?  So why the bad smell? I have 1 blue 16 oz bottle of the 30 Sport left and I will hoard it.</li>
            <li> I am a sun worshipper but I believe in sunscreen.  NO-AD has been my go-to brand for years now.  Because I use the 30 on my face and the 15 everywhere else, I never burn but get a nice tan.  This is even with full days on the beach getting in and out of the water.  NO-AD has the right ingredients for protection and good coverage (I rarely reapply.)  The price is the best I have found.</li>
            <li> I go through a lot of sunscreen lotion.  I walk almost two miles in the sun on the way home from work.  This sunscreen contains more for about the same price as other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> We normally use factor 15 but decided to use No-AD as it got very good reviews. Two of the three of us broke out in rashes and all three got sun burnt to differing degrees. There is no way we should have been sunburnt with factor 30 and out in the sun for only an hour or two. Maybe we got a bad batch but would not consider purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Did a lot of research before opting for this product. Take it with us on our vacation in Mexico every year and feel it has done everything expected of it.</li>
            <li> Works as well as the much more expensive name brands. Goes on easy and absorbs quickly. Needs to be re applied after swimming as most brands do.</li>
            <li> The product is wonderful on your skin.  Not all sticky or cakey absorbes quickly.  The price is very reasonable.  I first purchased it at WalMart.  It is hard to find locally.  I am glad Amazon carries it.  Very convenient for me.</li>
            <li> Surprised that it out performed Neutrogena and Olay and Coppertone. No annoying little gummy balls when reapplying at the lake, or annoying white film on the skin. Also holds up well for 3 or 4 days of continuous use when camping with no clogging of the pores (yes, it even works great on my face)</li>
            <li> I prefer Sp#45 .I have very light and sensitive skin. #30 is fine when I have a good base.I would not use it in very hot zones; Aruba, Jamaica without a good base.</li>
            <li> Used this when I went to punta cana this summer.  First it is not as thick as other sunscreens but works just as well.  It didn&#x27;t leave my face looking white like a ghost like some sunscreens do.&lt;br /&gt;  I used it on my face and did not break as well as my whole body.  It moisturizes your dry skin pretty good after swimming in the ocean or pool. Contains aloe vera and cocoa butter.&lt;br /&gt;If I knew how strong the punta cana sun was going to be I may have opted for the spf 45 from this brand as I have fair skin.&lt;br /&gt;All in all a great product at a great price.  Remember to reapply every 80 mins if you have fair skin!</li>
            <li> Took this to the water park with us this weekend. Put it on my kids and I, and reapplied it every 30 mins like the bottle says to do. We all ended up sunburned! I&#x27;m not sure if I got a bad bottle or what but I will not be using this sunblock again. I would rather pay more for another brand then deal with my kids and I being in pain.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is a good value and it kept me from getting burnt while on a cruise. I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> - Good price&lt;br /&gt;- Little odor one absorbed, doesn&#x27;t attract insects&lt;br /&gt;- Absorbs quickly&lt;br /&gt;- Long lasting&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;ve been using the No-Ad brand for years. Seems to offer excellent protection.&lt;br /&gt;- Highly rated in every test I&#x27;ve read, such as Consumer Reports</li>
            <li> After a recovered scare with melanoma, my dermatologist recommended No AD products.  This is what his entire family uses.  \\&quot;Why pay the price for name brands when you get the same benefit from No AD,\\&quot; he told me.  We love the products and find them a lot less expensive than the name brands.</li>
            <li> Have always loved the No-Ad sun products. We ordered the whole range and it is our primary sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen lets you get dark and is great for sensitive skin. I lifeguarded for years and we all used this stuff.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, you&#x27;re throwing your money away if you&#x27;re using the big brands of lotion/spray, etc., this works just as well.</li>
            <li> I know that&#x27;s an oxymoron. Stuff is great, and equal to much higher priced sunscreens.  lasts even after being in the water for a while.</li>
            <li> feels good not sticky</li>
            <li> NO-AD is a good product. I like the moisturizing qualities. I find other sunscreen lotions leave a drying sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> No-Ad 30 is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve tried.  Soaks in and stays on, even through sweat or at the pool.  I burn easily, and this sunscreen is the only one I use.  I have been using No-Ad for a few years now, and have been consistently pleased.</li>
            <li> worked great at the beach</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I like this stuff or not...  I applied a normal amount of this no ad spf30 to my face and arms and legs and it seemed like I had applied something like a 50wt motor oil to my skin....but motor oil is FAR easier to get OFF.  My hands and skin where I had applied this sunscreen were sticky and washing with hand soap didnt take this stuff off even after several attempts....I finally had to use heavy duty dish soap with a green scrubby pad to get this stuff off my hands, and the rest of my skin felt sticky all day.    Now, if resistance to being sweated off or washed off while swimming is a concern, then this stuff may be the greatest.....but if you want to get it OFF your skin so you dont feel sticky, then maybe you want to look elsewhere for sunscreen products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, smells like aloe and keeps my skin from burning through all day tournaments in the sun. Perfect for those who burn through sunblock the way my household does.</li>
            <li> I like the product but after this trip I think I prefer other lotions over this one.  Product was oily.</li>
            <li> If you are allergic to sun block, you should consider seeing a doctor to determine the cause. That said, I&#x27;ve tried different sunblocks and they&#x27;ve all caused some level of allergic reaction to my skin, from mild (Banana Boat Kids sunscreen lotion SPF50) to extensive rashes (Target brand sunblock SPF 30). No Ad is the only sunblock lotion I&#x27;ve not experience skin allergic reaction too. One of these days, I&#x27;ll see a doctor to determine the cause of reaction, but for now... I&#x27;m going to keep using No Ad before I go outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion can leave a slightly oiling look to your skin - like forehead, nose, cheeks, for example. Esp. right after you apply the lotion. But for me, that&#x27;s better than the alternatives of sunburn (and possible longer term damage) or allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> Very god protection, long lasting, and good price</li>
            <li> I have used No Ad for many, many years--I&#x27;d take an educated guess as to how many, but then you&#x27;d know my age, right?  It costs less per ounce, is top-rated by a consumer magazine, and has never let me down.</li>
            <li> Got burned! My husband is outside for work all day long and never gets a sunburn. I bought this for him to try and he came home burned! What a complete waste of money!</li>
            <li> Great for my boyfriend&#x27;s fair skin.  I have very sensitive skin and this is all I can use as well.  Doesn&#x27;t cake up either and is easy to wash off in the shower.  Love this better than your traditional brands!</li>
            <li> really good protection. not greasy.</li>
            <li> Not only is this the cheapest sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used, It is probably the best.  Spent a week in mexico and did not get burned while using this religiously. I cannot say the same for the other brands I tried during my last trip to mexico.  I also appreciate that it barely has any scent to it.  goes on thick but rubs in easily.</li>
            <li> Good Product without any harmful chemicals, shipped quickly</li>
            <li> Best Sunscreen on Market as I look ahead to ifs arrival in the next week or so! Oy vey O</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used NO-AD for a few years now and it works well for me.  Easy to put on &amp; seems to hold up when outside in the sun for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> this is the only product my wife will put on the kids period  when our local store stopped carrying it&lt;br /&gt;i just whipped out my iPhone and ordered it BOUGHT TWO</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> does exactly what it says it&#x27;s going to and it&#x27;s priced right used it for my trip last month to mexico</li>
            <li> My daughter has always been extremely allergic to perfumes and other additives in sunblocks.  No-Ad changed this for her.  It&#x27;s works well, without all the added fragrances, and is very affordable.  It is difficult to find No-Ad in drug stores - thankfully Amazon helped me attain this highly recommend product.</li>
            <li> Great deal.  Works like the expensive kind and comes in a large size.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and exactly as described. I have used NoAd for years. It is a great product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  Cheap, works, goes on light, does not make me cry, does not clog skin.  What more do you want?</li>
            <li> Great product and value. Product shipped quickly. We used this on holiday trip in Barbados. No sunburn. Great coverage for general beach and swimming. Highly recommended. We have used this product for at least 15 years.</li>
            <li> fantastic product - works much better than the more expensive brands at a bargain price - excellent coverage with a little product</li>
            <li> I just now chose it; even though I had used it before and nothing else seemed to work as well for me. I am a red head and have vitiligo, which is the losing of one&#x27;s pigmentation of the skin, and I was light skinned before loss of pigmentation and sunburned very easily.  I just want to tell you that I am not the kind of person who will say something that is not true about any product. I also won&#x27;t say a product is good when It isn&#x27;t. I go by my experiences and not what people want me to say. If I don&#x27;t like the product, I won&#x27;t say it is good.  and if people can&#x27;t take the truth, too bad. We should be honest about everything, because lies catch up to you.  I would not use any other sunblock as long as I can get no ad sunblock.  I cannot find it here where I live, so I went online to Amazon.com and found it there and am very glad I did. I am not saying that it will work for everyone, because everyone&#x27;s skin tone is different from mine etc. I am just saying that it works for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using No-Ad for about 5 years now and it really does the trick.  I put it on every morning as part of my regular routine.  It seems to last longer than others I have tried and I like the addition of Vitamin E and Aloe.  Other brands without the E and aloe seemed to dry out my skin.  I put it on before getting in the sun and after to help condition the skin.</li>
            <li> No Ad Sunblock is inexpensive enough to lay on thick and get protection that i found was effective.  Fragrance is not too heavy and the lotion is not objectionably greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 10 years; it&#x27;s my go-to standard for summer sun protection.  Over the years the out-of-the-bottle smell has changed a bit.  These last bottles I ordered smell a wee bit like deet, but not much.  After you put it on the smell quickly dissipates.</li>
            <li> I got the free shipping, and this product came with two other items. Everything was fine, but I wish the lotion were wrapped in a plastic sleeve. A couple of years ago, I had partial leakage. Last year, I believe it came wrapped, but not this year. So be careful what other items you combine in your order.</li>
            <li> In the past we&#x27;ve used this without incident. This time on vacation No-Ad SPF 30 gave me a terrible rash on my arms and hands. A week later and it still itches! I&#x27;ve never had this happen before with any sunscreen (and I&#x27;ve used No-Ad before)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the product it was sealed in plastic, so I know it should not have been faulty and wasn&#x27;t tampered with.</li>
            <li> No burn.  Used under an umbrella on the beach.  Love that it has no strong odor.</li>
            <li> No-Ad is a great suncreen.  Long lasting, easy to apply, not greasy.  Good packaging, sealed properly, early shipping.</li>
            <li> A friend put me onto this product years ago - and it is super in every respect.  I spend an large amount of time outdoors, especially on a boat, and getting burned is not a pleasant experience.&lt;br /&gt;Ironically, I just visited two Walmarts - they don&#x27;t have it; I have a feeling people was buying this instead of the higher priced stuff - and it has to be taken away.  Thank you Amazon for carrying it - I am ordering more today.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed when you purchase this sunscreen. It goes on thick and provides an amazing protective coating on you skin for being outdoors in the sun.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what you think it is.  Sunscreen.  I like it and find it stays on well when I am out on long bike rides in the sun.  The biggest selling point for me is that it was not tested on animals.  It is also quite cheap!  In looking for suncreen this summer I found many were quite expensive.</li>
            <li> I think I got an old batch. It turned all grainy as I tried to run it in. Couldn&#x27;t use it. I love no ad and use it all the time. I&#x27;ve never had this problem before.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It&#x27;s not greasy and since it has no perfume, I can use it on my face.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen that is safe to use while pregnant, and safe to use on my infant son. It does burn your eyes if it starts running, but that is the same as most sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of No-Ad for years.  The product works as described, the price is right, and it was shipped quickly.  I&#x27;m a happy customer.</li>
            <li> Non greasy with a fresh scent. Goes on nicely and protects well. Good buy</li>
            <li> My favorite sunscreen lotion , went to Mexico w it . Love it</li>
            <li> This is great stuff, it works without any sent and not expensive.</li>
            <li> Works well in the Southwest sunshine - easy to apply, goes on well, portable to reapply and it works! Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great stuff, no perfume and is a great moisturizer</li>
    </ol>
