            <li>I been using this stuff for over a year and let me tell you it works good...</li>
            <li>Good for ingrown hair problems.</li>
            <li>The tend skin bottle is in the didn&#x27;t have as good results.</li>
            <li>this works really good to minimize the chances of getting razor burn though it does burn like a bitch</li>

            <li>good product.</li>
            <li>I also read that it can be used before waxing to &amp;#34;loosen&amp;#34; hair and make the process easier, but I will still rely on a good numbing cream for that.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t work as well as good ol&#x27; fashioned exfoliating.</li>
            <li>It got a 4 and not a 5 because of the cost and because it&#x27;s so good</li>
            <li>my bf loved it</li>
            <li>It is a good quality</li>
            <li>It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do,but not that good.</li>

            <li>I am very satisfied with the results I received.</li>
            <li>but it surely burns when I apply it after shaving lol</li>
            <li>Best solution for ingrown hairs, I have tried many products and this by far is the best.</li>
            <li>not everything that works will have a amazing smell and look good...</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve used it and am amazed at how effective it is.</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>Bought this for razor bumps, and honestly it wasn&#x27;t the mirical cure I wanted.</li>
            <li>The razor bumps remain and we will continue searching for an effective product to treat his razor bumps.</li>
            <li>The two or three times I did use it, it seemed effective.</li>
            <li>This is an effective product for anyone suffering from in-grown hairs.</li>
            <li>Does it smell nice?</li>
            <li>I was scared of the burning but it honestly DOES NOT BURN ME...</li>
            <li>is nice to not have to worry about this anymore.    </li>
            <li>So effective with razor bumps, ingrown hair.</li>
            <li>Works well on hormonal bumps nicely</li>
            <li>This is a must for any dude who body builds and wants the perfect ab look with out the irritation included.</li>
            <li>has this nice silky feelin from the glycerin in it once it dries.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and excellent product.</li>
            <li>It is an effective product.</li>
            <li>Honestly, i did not use qtip, i used a tissue because i wanted to put as must as i can</li>
            <li>Im gonna keep using it until the bottle finishes to see how effective this tend skin is.</li>
            <li>I liked using this stuff</li>
            <li>I accepted that my skin just wasn&#x27;t as nice as others&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much Tend Skin for an excellent product!</li>
            <li>I purchased tend skin based on the great reviews, and was so excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>Useful for bikini and leg bumps as well as a good protector for men&#x27;s faces as well!  </li>
            <li>I got this for hubby in sephora for the first time, but I found it here at a better price, we are fan of this product because it works great!.</li>
            <li>I am happy to say that neither of those were true for me.  </li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t perfectly smooth but it&#x27;s a remarkable improvement.</li>
            <li>This is my new &#x27;Grooming&#x27; best friend!!</li>
            <li>It smells very strongly of rubbing alcohol and will make your eyes water a bit, but I use to always break out on my face after waxing, but not anymore.</li>
            <li>This has a very strong smell.</li>
            <li>I ended up trying this out becuz of all the reviews posted however the smell is a very strong alcohol smell which I don&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li>I have never been more satisfied with a product for that function!</li>
            <li>but this is probably the most satisfied I have ever been with a product!</li>
            <li>This is the best product for anyone who has sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>remarkable product....expensive, but worth it!</li>
            <li>Although the smell is not the most pleasant, it fades very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Outstanding product, quick delivery and works just as described, Tend Skin has never disappointed its absolutely perfect effect on helping to eliminate razor bumps and painfu n</li>
            <li>I have used rubbing alcohol on occasion to disinfect and sooth razor bumps as well, which much more cost effective, but does not work as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was the most popular product I read about.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s far from perfect.    </li>
            <li>Excellent action.</li>
            <li>Tend Skin is by far the best product I&#x27;ve used to treat my razor bumps!</li>
            <li>This is way more effective than bikini zone.</li>
            <li>Best price option I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>After a couple of weeks of using morning and night it clear up wonderfully.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best beauty product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Is it the most effective?  </li>
            <li>However some of the bottles no longer have the nice gold tone top and they have a plastic which makes its appearance</li>
            <li>Love love love this stuff!</li>
            <li>It had a strong rubbing alcohol smell but it works!</li>
            <li>I took a chance and finally decided to purchase this product because of the excellent reviews---and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m on the hunt for a good non-clogging moisterizer that may help return the skin to it&#x27;s original hue......</li>
            <li>Works great for women and men - it really is a miracle worker!</li>
            <li>My face seems to be very smooth</li>
            <li>ingrown hair makes the skin softer and smooth love it!  </li>
            <li>I wish this was available in more stores!</li>
            <li>I have very fair and sensitive skin which results in a lot of razor burn.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but this is because the product contains mostly isoprophyl alcohol.</li>
            <li>Time and time again my esthetician would comment on them, suggesting I &amp;#34;drink more water, exfoliate more often, try this ingrown serum&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This is the best for anywhere you get bumps from shaving, or even wherever tiny &amp;#34;fuzz&amp;#34; hair grows.</li>
            <li>Okay this one is for the ladies...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed I just have nice smooth skin.</li>
            <li>It would be much better to have a more soothing product.</li>
            <li>but I know there are many that don&#x27;t rely on alcohol for some of their effect.</li>
            <li>This works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried before.  </li>
            <li>Okay so let me start off my saying</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more after I finish this bottle.</li>
            <li>Make sure you check on the bottle</li>
            <li>I love it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>Give it shot, you&#x27;ll love both.</li>
            <li>Could there be something better?  </li>
            <li>, I wish it had better scents.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff -</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and he was supportive, but we were both concerned about the cost.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product after reading many reviews and am EXTREMELY  satisfied.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I hope it will do a better job.</li>
            <li>My ingrown hair has been more of a challenge.</li>
            <li>This product has allowed me to risk shaving my pate and face/chin more than once a week sometimes without worry of the razor burn or ingrown.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I listened.  </li>
            <li>Glad I listened to my friend.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Just burns like rubbing alcohol n caused more ingrowns.  </li>
            <li>n now ve more problems, discoloration, from use...</li>
            <li>this product is that I spend more money on waxing becos</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>the one I got is not an authentic product.</li>
            <li>get the biggest bottle, its more $$</li>
            <li>ive fallen completely in love with this and the air shave gel</li>
            <li>i love it keeps me from feeling ashames about the below parts</li>
            <li>love this stuff</li>
            <li>Have tried so many things over the years.  </li>
            <li>I have referred it to many and they love it as well.</li>
            <li>I have used it for many years</li>
            <li>Look, I love Tendskin.</li>
            <li>I said sure what is it?</li>
            <li>but it sure is smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just buy witch hazel or rubbing alcohol, they probably work better.</li>
            <li>What I love about it is that it does work to prevent ingrowns but</li>
            <li>A be sure to moisturize along with the tend skin use.</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>Better than Dilapitory shaving products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found this product.</li>
            <li>Must shave more often now.</li>
            <li>I love Tend Skin and have been using it for years.  </li>
            <li>Most of the time I use it for underarms and bikini line, but believe it would work anywhere you needed it.</li>
            <li>I had tried a comparable product and had better results.</li>
            <li>I have tried products like nair and many, many others and the bumps just kept coming.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful septic product that has helped reduce the regular, persistent occurrence of ingrown hairs on my face.  </li>
            <li>Definitely the best product I have tried for these uses.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying four more just to keep around.</li>
            <li>Maybe you will see better results.</li>
            <li>I shave w/a Gillitte Fusion razor if you want to know, but I&#x27;m sure that I could shave with any razor and this stuff would work its magic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for many years now</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products for razor bumps and this product will be a staple in my product selections.</li>
            <li>Love this Size</li>
            <li>and I have tried so many things to make them go away....</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years as I like its results.</li>
            <li>Since using this product, I have not had any more problems with ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>See attached video review for more details.</li>
            <li>Miracle in a bottle for sure.</li>
            <li>No matter how many precautions I take before shaving, I always get bumps.</li>
            <li>Gotta love Amazon for finding better deals :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many things for ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>but it looked like many of the pictures I see for razor bumps, ingrown hairs, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Will be buying more</li>
            <li>Plus the roll-on bottle unscrews at the top</li>
            <li>, i love this</li>
            <li>many whose complaints come before mine, or the manufacturer Or Seller, is laughing all the way to&lt;br /&gt;the bank.</li>
            <li>I tried a lot of different remedies and Tend Skin is the one that works the best.</li>
            <li>This stuff works much better than Neutrogena T-gel shampoo</li>
            <li>I do like the roller version better though.</li>
            <li>For the most stubborn though I have to use it about 3 times a day instead of the one time.</li>
            <li>so I thought okay</li>
            <li>IT WORKS LIKE MAGIC.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t hesitate and keep walking around with an unsightly area get this :)</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Better than I used to be after shaving.</li>
            <li>A friend recommended this product and I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li>After shaving  I put a quarter sized amount of tend skin on a hand towel and use that to apply all over my beard areas (seems to work much better than using your palms).</li>
            <li>Will buy more</li>
            <li>I have been a fan of Tend Skin for more then 10 years now</li>
            <li>This works so much better than products I have purchased at stores.</li>
            <li>Advice - You need to come up with a better applicator/dispenser.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did,</li>
            <li>I have had an issue with Razor bumps off and on over many years.  </li>
            <li>it works wonders and makes your skin smooth!</li>
            <li>If it was milder and smelled better I would use it more often and perhaps see better results.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>The more your skin heals from shaving,</li>
            <li>I chose them because they were having a sale for 2 bottles at a better price than everyone else had for 1 bottle.</li>
            <li>This along with a moisturizer and a loofa in the shower will truthfully get rid of your ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>Phenomenal product.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It sure does burn when applied, but it works so well.</li>
            <li>I find that the using TEND SKIN method works better than using an exfoliating scrub or exfoliant pad to scrub.</li>
            <li>I am totally pleased with Tend Skin.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>This product is like magic put it on after a shave or wax and</li>
            <li>and it seems to work much better.</li>
            <li>I no longer need to feel embarrassed and feel confident after shaving.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen any better results.</li>
            <li>It does however burn a lot more for me than TEND SKIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hopefully this helps someone out in choosing whether or not to buy this product &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>am a pleased customer</li>
            <li>so glad that I&#x27;ve found this product</li>
            <li>and so glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Glad I did...</li>
            <li>what more can I say</li>
            <li>Tend Skin is a million times better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I discovered this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, and I love it.</li>
            <li>The product was okay</li>
            <li>but this works better.</li>
            <li>and It&#x27;s been better than what I was using at the time.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to use a razor, electric shaver or anything like that for years.  </li>
            <li>had read many reviews on Tend Skin, and this product has allowed me to purchase my Braun 7 Series Electric Razor and almost eliminate all razor bumps.  </li>
            <li>so many ingrown</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s safe to say it&#x27;s helping.  </li>
            <li>this product works like magic .</li>
            <li>In all honesty, however, after that 20 seconds my skin already starts to feel better than it did before.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for many years and simply love this product.</li>
            <li>The product was great and works very well.</li>
            <li>This works better than every product.  </li>
            <li>I tried many aftershaves to no avail, I read a review about tend skin and tried it.</li>
            <li>I really love this.</li>
            <li>I love this  and will always try to keep it on hand.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that this stuff is really healthy for the skin, but it does what it promises, and I havent noticed any adverse effects.</li>
            <li>Trend skin has been magical.</li>
            <li>so i guess the tea tree bump oil is slightly better</li>
            <li>The acetylsalicylic acid speeds up exfoliation of the top layer of skin, and is anti-inflammatory; and the alcohol helps prevent infection.</li>
            <li>Much love to the producers.</li>
            <li>Used it a couple times to be sure, but yep, still sucked.</li>
            <li>better pice on Amazon.</li>
            <li>then the lady who waxes me told me to use more than the recommended amount</li>
            <li>Within 5 days my most problematic areas that I had been dealing with for years had magically disappeared.</li>
            <li>Like most after shaves, it does sting.</li>
            <li>I love it and use it everytime I shave.</li>
            <li>So it does work, but it doesnt magically make the bumps dissapear like some say 0_o.  </li>
            <li>but i am satisfied, and i will keep using it.</li>
            <li>Glad I found this product.</li>
            <li>Love this product, must have if you have ingrown hair.</li>
            <li>and I am glad I chose this as well.</li>
            <li>Love it for the bichini area.</li>
            <li>I apply it like I would an aftershave, and that seemed to have better performance.  </li>
            <li>It works better as a preventative than it does a cure.  </li>
            <li>not so grand.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have that many marks anyway,so</li>
            <li>Results are good, although some people overrate this product, there are no miracles, if you set your expectations right, should not disappoint.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anywho, This product does work, and yes it does kinda sting at first and has a not so pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>I just want to give a shout out to the Tend Skin The Skin Care Solution Company for such an outstanding product!!!  </li>
            <li>Great product and I highly recommend it for ladies and gentlemen to try.</li>
            <li>you will be super pleased with your results!</li>
            <li>Soothing and cool with nice smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent $$ on all different brands &amp; I would say this is the best, as best as it can get.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, but make sure to use it consistently!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li>it wasnt as effective, I guess I was just lucky with the one i bought at cvs.</li>
            <li>Bottle goes kind of quick</li>
            <li>make sure you don&#x27;t use a lot at once because it will give off a strong alcohol scent</li>
            <li>It burns like rubbing alcohol upon application, but that goes away very quickly and the results are better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>It does smell strongly of alcohol, but it is mostly alcohol.</li>
            <li>could not live without it the best!</li>
            <li>It has also greatly reduced the acne on my face by drying pimples, exfoliating (also keeping skin very soft), and disinfecting.  </li>
            <li>Nothing very special.</li>
            <li>or sometimes I like to use a little BIO OIL when I have it (BIO OIL, is about $5-$10 for a 2 fl oz bottle, but has proven to me to be VERY effective in moisturizing and great for a variety of skin problems).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but it work better if its applied alone but 10 mins after use then lotion should be fine</li>
            <li>But this is the best stuff I have found, and I have tried so many other products.  </li>
            <li>This is the best product ive ever used after tying so many other products.  </li>
            <li>burn for so many years, but Tend Skin took care of it after the very first application!</li>
            <li>It made a huge difference over night - worked better than I remember the tendskin working.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t eliminate bumps completely for me but greatly reduces them.</li>
            <li>So far so great.</li>
            <li>Works great so far</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and a good product.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I didn&#x27;t purchase it right away, in fact it was</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s more effective on certain skin types than others.  </li>
            <li>The other reviews said it was a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to control that.</li>
            <li>You can see the changes very quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply with a cotton ball</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad i finally got the product after i heard so much great  things about it.</li>
            <li>You will see results very quickly.  </li>
            <li>A friend who is a cosmetologist strongly recommended this product.  </li>
            <li>It has a strong smell but it doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn the skin either, which I thought it would do with the strong smell.</li>
            <li>others have said, it has a really strong smell of alcohol.</li>
            <li>However, you do need to use it in a ventilated are since the smell is slightly strong.</li>
            <li>It smells strongly of rubbing alcohol</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any strong smell and it didn&#x27;t burn when I put it on.</li>
            <li>the solution is  not as strong as it used to be but will work.</li>
            <li>There are no other products out there that can do this and for the price I paid, I am incredibly happy.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend using both a good quality razor as well as</li>
            <li>After reading all the positive reviews on here I decided to give this product a try, and boy am I glad I did!</li>
            <li>he has mentioned to other buddies and they have tried it and love it too!!!</li>
            <li>I tried it out and WOW, what an amazing difference!</li>
            <li>the shipment came extremely fast and I was very pleased</li>
            <li>I am having good results with this product, when many others have done ok but fallen short.</li>
            <li>There are roll on versions but this version you can pour onto a cotton ball and it is pretty effective.</li>
            <li>But with consistent use, this stuff was seriously effective.</li>
            <li>It was average at best when it comes to preventing or getting rid of razor bumps.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t even develop razor bumps anymore because the hair is so fine.</li>
            <li>BUT it helps tremendously!</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and well priced!  </li>
            <li>The bottle being plastic is nicely designed and stores well in the lower bathroom cabinet too large for my medicine cabinet.  </li>
            <li>I love it, thanks!!</li>
            <li>in less than an HOUR I noticed that the bumps that were on my neck after I shaved were GONE, and even more, they STAYED GONE!!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if that makes a huge difference or not.  </li>
            <li>It makes a huge difference in reducing ingrown hair between waxing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year  now, and I can tell you that it has made a huge difference in my appearance.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m a huge fan.</li>
            <li>But i used it twice a day, and followed it with a nice face lotion to prevent my skin from drying and shortly after a week or two i started noticing some amazing differences.    </li>
            <li>both have made a huge difference in my case.</li>
            <li>Made a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>Product arrived just as advertised, and the price for what I got was fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for someone else and they really enjoy the product.</li>
            <li>My skin cleared up in a matter of days and has remained bump free for months.</li>
            <li>Get free and get this stuff.</li>

            <li>razor-burn free.</li>
            <li>I use this often when I shave and it keeps the skin smooth and bumpless.  </li>
            <li>feel smooth as a baby bottom...</li>
            <li>This is a great item, it definitely works on reducing the bumps you get after shaving.</li>
            <li>and now it is FINALLY smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no longer worried about shaving anymore, my face is baby-skin smooth</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic skin care solution and does a noticeable job with clearing up issues after a week of use.</li>
            <li>Smooth skin results.</li>
            <li>I bought these, they have been great, I could only get them on line since where I was heading they didn&#x27;t have them.</li>
            <li>The product worked great to prevent the itching and bumps after hair started growing back.  </li>
            <li>Great for controlling facial razor bumps...can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>I had started to wax, but got a free sample of this.</li>
            <li>I am bump free now.</li>
            <li>Enjoy using this product but proceed with caution.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product all around.</li>
            <li>Well worth the sticker price and just be sure to use it after every shave.</li>
            <li>maybe a couple of time after that and its smooth sailing.</li>
            <li>Overall, great stuff for the price.</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff and it&#x27;s worth the $20 if you have hair bumps...</li>
            <li>Great product that actually works.</li>
            <li>No contact information available from Amazon on who to reach buyer.</li>
            <li>I did enjoy the burn</li>
            <li>It eliminates the bumps and it keeps your skin smooth.  </li>
            <li>No matter what technique I&#x27;m using to remove hair, I know that by applying this product I will have smoother, ingrown hair free skin on about 90-95% of where ever I use it.</li>
            <li>Takes all bumps away within days takes the red out within a day great product  </li>
            <li>I used it after shaving my women parts and it keeps me smooth without any irritation and burning.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hands silky smooth too.</li>
            <li>thought it was free shipping on the item.</li>
            <li>Smooth skin practically guaranteed, in my experience, if used as directed.</li>
            <li>i do see a difference, my bikini area has gotten lighter but not as light as i want it.</li>
            <li>This is such a great cure for the irritation that happens with ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>Great product to use as needed, you can apply to problem spots or apply overall as an aftershave for nicks and to prevent ingrown hairs before they start.</li>
            <li>This not only clears up &amp; prevents razor burn and ingrown hairs, it also works great on blemishes.  </li>
            <li>the price just isn&#x27;t justified .&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far so good, I don&#x27;t like the scents though</li>
            <li>Tend Skin Liquid is a good product for people with sensitive skin after any brand of epilator.</li>
            <li>So I searched daily for another good or better product that could take its place.</li>
            <li>Tend skin clears it right up, and if I stay on top of using it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more so right</li>
            <li>Tend Skin actually works better and is cheaper!!</li>
            <li>The bottle is also very large, it&#x27;s lasted me many months at twice a day usage.</li>
            <li>As a bonus, this is also a wonderful thing to put on your feet before slipping into your favorite shoes because it keeps your feet nice and dry.</li>
            <li>Tend Skin cleans it all up and leaves you with smooth clean skin.</li>
            <li>It has a strong smell of alcohol but it dissipates quickly.  </li>
            <li>And now with this new roll-on design they went over the top!</li>
            <li>a fairly hairy man, my facial hair grows very quickly.</li>
            <li>Well worth it!</li>
            <li>I originally got this product for my husband and his ingrown hairs he gets on his head from shaving.</li>
            <li>It significantly reduces the bumps.</li>
            <li>It seems like you need pretty regular and consistent use to get the best of it.</li>
            <li>This has significantly helped with my ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>This is the only product I have ever tried that is successful at removing and preventing razor bumps.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>I think that makes this unique because it also eliminates redness.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>It significantly decreases the likelihood that you will break out with bumps or a rash after shaving.</li>
            <li>I originally bought Tend Skin just for my razor bumps and used it as a spot treatment.</li>
            <li>At this point I was much better at having a consistent beauty routine</li>
            <li>Just make sure you are consistent.</li>
            <li>I use the roller-ball that came with my original order.</li>
            <li>I bought this to refill my roller ball bottle of this that I originally bought.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for over 3 weeks and my skin has significantly improved.</li>
            <li>but the results are worth it!</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li>The bottle is a great size so it lasts for a long time depending on how often you shave.  </li>
            <li>Tend Skin is definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous razor burn creams and if applied as directed this stuff is the best by far for razor burn!</li>
            <li>This stuff works great, for years i had a mild for of eczema and did not know it, after going to a dermatologist we are treating it differently and using special moisturizer ( amalactin)  to solve my skin irritant problems ( used this everywhere</li>
            <li>This product was very strongly recommended by a trusted cosmetologist and it delivers sweet relief from ingrown hairs &amp; razor burn, very soothing.</li>
            <li>Ok, so i dont normally do reviews, but as you all know Tend Skin has gotten so many good reviews and people that have used it, that i decided to go to my local Walgreens and purchase it for about $17 bucks.</li>
            <li>I have to keep clean shaven and hair</li>
            <li>It does sting a bit but its definitely the best product on the marker so far.</li>
            <li>I tried many similar product but none have been as effective as tend Skin on eliminating and preventing razor bumps.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy who likes his face clean shaven and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried multiple products for razor bumps, and this is by far the best!</li>
            <li>So far my face has been getting better every day most of them are now gone.    </li>
            <li>I must say, after various products this one is by far the best!</li>
            <li>I must say after countless products that I have tried, I find this to be the most effective.</li>
            <li>I prefer a product from my salon that does the same thing with a pleasant aroma</li>
            <li>I use this after shaving my neck with a single blade razor and skin looks great during the day.</li>
            <li>worked!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this if anything changes with long term use but so far, I love, love, love, love this!</li>
            <li>The only time I experienced any burning was after a line up in which I was cut, so with alcohol in the solution you can expect there to be some burning right?</li>
            <li>Cleared my razor bumps right up!</li>
            <li>Used as soon as it arrived as I had some acne giving me fits on the right side of my face!  </li>
            <li>In fact, I think I&#x27;ll do that right now before I forget!</li>
            <li>I used another popular product called Skin Tight a fews back and it worked awesomely.</li>
            <li>I have experimented with many other products for years and this is definitely the best to avoid razor bumps and to maintain smooth skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say, 95% of my skin is nice and clear now.</li>
            <li>About 95% of my ingrowns are healed and I can enjoy freshly shaved legs for a day or two instead of 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>I apply it in front of a fan to cool the burn and that helps.</li>
            <li>The results are true to what is advertised, but you will do the burning flesh dance for about five seconds after application.</li>
            <li>Good size, this one will last me probably 9-12 months.</li>
            <li>I wax my full leg and get a Brazilian...</li>
            <li>Tend Skin solution is a true winner.  </li>
            <li>Its okay doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>I have used this stuff now for years and can&#x27;t say good enough about it.</li>
            <li>and It&#x27;s lasted me a full three months.</li>
            <li>Tend skin is by far the most effective, it REALLY does what it says</li>
            <li>Good price for a man&#x27;s basic grooming needs.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t harm it, gives my face a cool feeling after using I recommend using lotion on the face after 10mins</li>
            <li>For some reason they stopped producing the creme which caused my ingrowns to come back because the liquid was not as good.</li>
            <li>Once the sample was used, I bought the full size bottle ($35).</li>
            <li>But here are facts I found true for my experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell of this one is not nearly as bad as its competition.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product.</li>
            <li>I a reading some of the reviews with the 1 and 2 stars, folks are on here saying the products price is increasing over the years while the product appears to be becoming more diluted &amp; less effective.</li>
            <li>many thanks for quick delivery..</li>
            <li>I love this products it works good on the hidden hairs on my chin area.</li>
            <li>when traveling the roll-on is perfect not to get taken by the mean airport people.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is probably the single most effective solution I have used to fight the unsightly razor bumps and ingrown hair.</li>
            <li>It got to me very quickly and was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>#34;this is nothing but alcohol and acid&amp;#34; but I decided to try it anyway due to all of the great reviews.</li>
            <li>Works great for razor burn and other skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li>I use it on the bikini line and it&#x27;s helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>but I was not as lucky as these people...</li>
            <li>It worked okay, but I still have many ingrown hairs left.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t take a few days like any reasonable person would expect; it worked flawlessly.</li>
            <li>and I must say it helps tremendously</li>
            <li>Came quickly.</li>
            <li>but it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>I use this all the time and it has helped razor bumps tremendously.</li>
            <li>This product provides quick healing and reduces the amount of ingrown hairs I receive.</li>
            <li>This product has reduced them tremendously.</li>
            <li>My son swears this is the best product on the planet and says it&#x27;s the only made that actually does what it&#x27;s suppose to do!  </li>
            <li>I had shaved quickly and was worried that the inconsistent strokes would cause irritation and lead to razor bumps.</li>
            <li>I have tried several things and this definitely works the best</li>
            <li>, I will continue to be a loyal customer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product was delivered fairly quickly and as promised.</li>
            <li>It seems to work although not as well nor not as quickly.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>but its quick.</li>
            <li>Friend pharmacist says that it is just like rubbing alcohol, but I think TEND is just not as powerful (which is good because for the amount of areas I needed to use this product for, I probably would get poisoning from actual rubbing</li>
            <li>It has a very strong rubbing alcohol smell to it, but it seems to be working well so far.  </li>
            <li>Compared to other after shaves that I have tried, this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I very much recommend - 5 stars!</li>
            <li>A fantastic all-around product!</li>
            <li>But overall am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I use to refil the rollerball that came with my very first purchase of Tend Skin at a waxing boutique.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t always find the best deals on ebay, as you have to constantly check back to see if any new bottles were listed, but Amazon has great prices from lots of different sellers.</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of bumps/burn serums etc but never this one till my new waxing place (Waxing the City - which I love btw)</li>
            <li>Tend Skin helps the skin area surrounding my ingrown hairs to be less reddened and inflamed so that pain and swelling is minimized and my appearance has greatly improved.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a slight reduction in ingrown hairs, but nothing to jump up for over joy over.</li>
            <li>This stuff actually does a pretty good job removing razor bumps.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using TEND skin for about 3-4 weeks now and the improvment is remarkable; the \\&quot;terrain\\&quot; has been left free and clear of any irritation or afflictions.  </li>
            <li>He didn&#x27;t really break out at all!!</li>
            <li>was pretty excited since I&#x27;ve tried getting rid of them using home remedies, and that didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Plus I can do it more frequently!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know how this stuff works, but it really does!!</li>
            <li>Notice a change within the first week!</li>
            <li>Trust and believe me, that I definitely will be buying more and recommend others to try this product out!</li>
            <li>and it is an absolute must for me!!</li>
            <li>Having fair skin and dark, thick hair, I was the perfect candidate for this.</li>
            <li>This stuff truly works if you use it consistently!</li>
            <li>This product does exactly as it promises!</li>
            <li>This product was noticeably more effective than typical creams like Bikinizone.</li>
            <li>Not only is it effective but it also works quickly.</li>
            <li>clears skin up well, I have mild psoriasis and this clears it right up.</li>
            <li>After reading so many positive reviews, I was really expecting to be blown away by this product.</li>
            <li>, It is worth the money in the first week all my bumps cleared up!.</li>
            <li>Great product that is a little pricey</li>
            <li>I really didin&#x27;t have a chance to use it as I guess it should have been used, but for the most part the product was pure meh.</li>
            <li>I discovered this a few years ago and it works great to prevent my neck from breaking out in razor burn when I shave.</li>
            <li>Once I started seeing great results, I ended up using it as a toner everyday.</li>
            <li>It smells very skunky by does precisely what it is advertised to do.  </li>
            <li>This is an awesome product that helps reduce redness and swelling from stubborn ingrown hairs (4+ weeks old) around sensitive areas within days with once-daily application and even gets rid of regular pimples on the face overnight (added bonus for me!).</li>
            <li>Great product but a bit harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very creamy and goes on like a light lotion</li>
            <li>This product has helped to keep my skin smooth and razor bump free, it burns like fire for a minute after hair removal but have been razor bump free since starting to use it.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and my skin feels and looks great.</li>
            <li>but I just use a cotton round and that works great for me.</li>
            <li>Great product for a few decades now.</li>
            <li>Burns a bit but worth it.</li>
            <li>As a woman, I use it on bikini line, back of legs &amp; arms &amp; my skin is 100% more smooth because of tend skin.</li>
            <li>those who like to make more natural products: there are DIY recipes out there.</li>
            <li>I have tried a number of products for ingrown hairs on my (bald) scalp and face--both prescription and non-prescription--without success.  </li>
            <li>This product is definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li>So far I have not found anything that works better at melting away bumps.</li>
            <li>It was well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth buying.</li>
            <li>Literally TWO DAYS after using it his skin was clear and baby smooth!</li>
            <li>It stings when I apply it after shaving, but it&#x27;s worth the couple of seconds of swearing.</li>
            <li>I think the pain is worth the results.</li>
            <li>Really hurts when you put on if you have any nics, but nothing better really at taking away the bumps and redness over time.  </li>
            <li>It is well worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>i shaved/waxed), but for what its worth, after shaving this did do the trick</li>
            <li>/&gt;Totally worth it to not have razor burn/bumps anymore.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, this is the only thing I&#x27;ve ever used that has worked and prevented razor bumps.</li>
            <li>but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>but I love this product so much that it doesn&#x27;t bother me as much.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It does burn when you apply after a fresh shave, but it goes away and fanning air helps.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the money</li>
            <li>/&gt;Whether the product is really useful, I cannot say.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it, trust me.</li>
            <li>and it is honestly the only product that ever worked for me.  </li>
            <li>Oedered this because I was tired of having ingrown hairs and product worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li>and WOW he looked so much better.  </li>
            <li>but the results are worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if some of these reviews were paid off or if maybe my body just reacts to it differently, but honestly, this product did NOT work for me...</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth the $$.</li>
            <li>but this one is worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s worth it to have a fab looking bikini area</li>
            <li>If you only use it after you shave, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as effective as i still got</li>
            <li>, if it does then I am truly happy for you, but I am a 19 year old male, and it just isn&#x27;t working for me.</li>
            <li>My husband rarely gets those bumps he use to get when shaving his head.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money if used as directed.</li>
            <li>Is it worth what you pay?  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t effective enough for mine.</li>
            <li>its a little strong like alcohol not so much so the product is wonderful still have more than half the bottle</li>
            <li>think there are many other better products out there now a days.</li>
            <li>but it goes away pretty quick</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it promises to do, and it does it quickly.</li>
            <li>I found this product to be very effective after shaving to prevent bumps and to also treat them in a few days max.</li>
            <li>So I had to shave it neatly and clean as I have been doing for so many years prior &amp; just like I like it!</li>
            <li>and I was almost in tears due to happiness.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the tendskin right after epilating because I did that one time and it stung a bit.</li>
            <li>This stuff worked right away.  </li>
            <li>I use Tend Skin right after shaving, before applying moisturizer and a moisturizing after shave.  </li>
            <li>I use a cotton ball to apply it right after I get out of the shower</li>
            <li>I would use it right after shaving and it did nothing.</li>
            <li>I epilate every morning on my bikini line and immediately apply right after.</li>
            <li>and I noticed a difference right away.  </li>
            <li>3 days of use and the ingrown hair comes right out.</li>
            <li>I have an acne condition where sometimes the hairs are ingrown and this brings them right up</li>
            <li>Worked right away for my razor bumps.</li>
            <li>It does burn if you use it right after a shave</li>
            <li>This company ships right away</li>
            <li>I have suffered from razor burn for what seems like years now, tried just about everything, so I figured why not try something else, eventually something has to work, am I right?</li>
            <li>I have used No Bump in the past after my waxes and have had great success.  </li>
            <li>Tend skin was first offered to me by my waxing salon; of course, I told them I&#x27;d take care of my messed-up lookin abs on my own and found the same product for 1/4 of their price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This stuff really does the trick just use cotten balls and stay clean.  </li>
            <li>Bump Patrol, on the other hand, is/was so effective that applying it in the morning of Day 1 resulted in significant improvements in the shaved (or unshaved) area by the morning of Day 2.  </li>
            <li>It is very strong and has been the only product that I&#x27;ve seen results with.</li>
            <li>You will use less product with the roll-on and you will get a better, more even application.</li>
            <li>I prefer natural products but this is my one exception because with daily use it keep my skin looking happy and absolutely helps prevent in-growns from waxing.</li>
            <li>: You need to use everyday to work effectively!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years for razor bumps, and it&#x27;s one of those rare &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; products that REALLY works!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money because it really WORKS!  </li>
            <li>Plus, since there&#x27;s no fragrance, your face will reek like pure alcohol!</li>
            <li>good reviews on YouTube for black skin.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I dabbed the TendSkin on my face immediately after and experienced the same results, not razor bumps, no irritation, no red spots, and no itchiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>far I really like this product :)</li>
            <li>So if you are ok with applying this everyday and spending $20 and more a month on this, then buy it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good product that i guess disinfects the skin after shaving in a way that there are much less breakouts.</li>
            <li>i was very much looking forward to getting this product</li>
            <li>when I get a hair cut, so this solution works actually very fast, I waited  to get a haircut</li>
            <li>You also don&#x27;t need very much of it per application</li>
            <li>I am sure this new razor and shaving cream have made a huge impact on preventing  future Razor bumps and razor burn.  </li>
            <li>Works pretty good on razor burns if u use it for few days right after shaving.  </li>
            <li>but as I got older and had to shave more frequently, the alcohol wasn&#x27;t doing the trick.</li>
            <li>It really helps open the pores and help prevent ingrown hairs - which I get a lot of and very easily.</li>
            <li>This is huge when you consider that I used to have a complete breakout every time</li>
            <li>Did not really work for me, but I can tell it cleans the area nicely.</li>
            <li>The product seems to work ok to help reduce ingrown hairs, although it definitely doesn&#x27;t eliminate them.</li>
            <li>It smells exactly like rubbing alcohol (makes me wonder</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone, I think the reviews were pretty helpful.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>So first off let me start off by saying that whenever I get my eye brows threaded, I get some acne from it.</li>
            <li>but it really works!</li>
            <li>Works pretty well at stopping ingrown hairs on the bikini area for me.</li>
            <li>I wanted to have it to use after getting my first waxing.  </li>
            <li>For the first two weeks I used it twice a day</li>
            <li>When I first applied it, I had just shaved</li>
            <li>outstanding product for women facial hair</li>
            <li>First off, tend skin isn&#x27;t a miracle worker for me</li>
            <li>First off let me warn you..</li>
            <li>First, be forewarned, it burns as soon as you put it on after you shave, but....</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different products, from&lt;br</li>
            <li>Glad I ordered a bigger bottle this time.</li>
            <li>I said yes, he gave me the hot towel, razor blade, etc.</li>
            <li>It may not be pretty</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t prevent them all, but it&#x27;s definitely been better.  </li>
            <li>After the first shave he uses it  morning and night for a couple days,after once a day.</li>
            <li>pretty quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If anything it seemed to irritate my skin further and cause more ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>and you really don&#x27;t need to smell like that any longer than you have to!</li>
            <li>I used this consistently and have not seen any changes.</li>
            <li>First time user.</li>
            <li>tend skin for many years and this one has packaging that is a bit different.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>Overall excellent product and will definitely order again in the future!</li>
            <li>then most likely you have had to deal with severe shaving bumps when shaving your face.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it is designed to do ... stop razor bumps and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Overall I would recommend this product and I am going to buy more when I run out because it is helping.</li>
            <li>I do warn you though that this stings when you first apply it after you shave</li>
            <li>I love this product have been using for several years.</li>
            <li>EVERYONE ;-)</li>
            <li>Be consistent and patient.</li>
            <li>My kids love it for clearing up teenage acne.  </li>
            <li>I shave my head pretty close</li>
            <li>&amp; I plan to purchase more as needed in the future.</li>
            <li>especially she shaving more in spring</li>
            <li>This product really does prevent in grown hairs!</li>
            <li>This was the first time I ordered the product from Amazon, and what I received smells like Rubbing Alcohol.</li>
            <li>Ever since I first started shaving as a teenager, I noticed that I would get unsightly razor bumps after shaving.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product, it was after showering first and then shaving, hoping that having open pores would help absorb the treatment better.</li>
            <li>I was impressed, I saw no razor bumps after the following days after shaving nor did I feel any itching, burning, or small patches of irritated skin.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t suffered from any razor bumps since I started using it, even on my most problem areas such as my chin and jawline.</li>
            <li>After the FIRST time putting it on, I noticed almost a 100 percent improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>The product was exactly what I was looking for and came just as described.</li>
            <li>Thanks Ace Man!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how I first heard of it - through a friend who styled hair.  </li>
            <li>When you first get it, you use it once in the morning and once at night.  </li>
            <li>When I first got it I would put it on after shaving then again in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Love this product use this on a daily and it has removed my ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>I switched to Anthony&#x27;s logistics for men - still expensive but doesn&#x27;t sting and works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s product does exactly was it says it does...</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I used it, I found it a pain to do morning and night with a cotton ball and used it inconsistently.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my son, it is nit the first time we have purchased but it is the first time from this company.</li>
            <li>This stuff has done exactly what it claims to do.</li>
            <li>Last night I was able to try this.&lt;br /&gt;Considering</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>I am absolutely dumbfounded as to how and why it works!</li>
            <li>especially when I am sexually active-soooo THIS STUFF is the answer.</li>
            <li>I used TEND SKIN when I first got it</li>
            <li>The peeling skin turned me off at first, it was when I saw the peeling skin that I knew how it worked so well at preventing the bumps.</li>
            <li>the first time I&#x27;d tried it</li>
            <li>the days that I shave, I first take a rag and run it under some hot water.</li>
            <li>Just make sure that you keep the area properly</li>
            <li>Love this and order the largest size which actually lasted over a year</li>
            <li>I do not like how it smells like alcohol at first.  </li>
            <li>Started using product and saw results within the first 3 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Note that it does burn and sting a tad when you first apply</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a female, and don&#x27;t shave on my face BUT do have some acne which must be because of the heat and humidity in OK.</li>
            <li>A deep moisturizing lotion would serve you better.</li>
            <li>Should have followed my first mind.</li>
            <li>So, for the last 30 years I have use Magic Shave.  </li>
            <li>razor burn pretty</li>
            <li>It really works on ingrown hair and helps calm razor burns.  </li>
            <li>so you really get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>Exactly the type of skin conditioner I needed.</li>
            <li>It really works well!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s the first ingredient listed on both the Amazon listing and on the bottle.</li>
            <li>It really works!  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff it definitely works!</li>
            <li>I have used many skin solutions; but this one is the only one that is soothing and can be used for any scratch, pimple and bites.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper!</li>
            <li>First after-shave I ever used.</li>
            <li>Its the first product that has worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this product by watching others recommend it on YouTube reviews.</li>
            <li>But, I realized I was genning ingrown hairs in the first place because I was using a no-name razor.</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend finding a great moisturizer to use to apply to the area to prevent the area from becoming too dry, especially if your skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>; contains, among other ingredients, acetylsalicylate (aspirin), which is not recognized as a safe and effective ingredient in an external analgesic OTC drug product.</li>
            <li>It really does help with razor burn (although it stings when you apply it right after shaving.)</li>
            <li>Makes my skin smooth, smooth, smooth and no more ingrowns.</li>
            <li>They also have a roll-on applicator available which is a little more convenient (no cotton balls needed).  </li>
            <li>I am surprised that the hair bumps on my head has reduced significantly since I started using it.</li>
            <li>I tried sharp manual razors, electric razors, and every kind of shaving cream and skin treatment out there to treat the problem.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little bit more pricey than TENDSKIN not by much though, but it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent at all.</li>
            <li>As an African American male, I&#x27;ve experienced unsightly ingrown hairs for most of my adult life.</li>
            <li>But when I do it seems to clean pores and clear up any bumps.</li>
            <li>Cotton pads or cotton balls tend to absorb too much of the product, so one ends up consuming more than is necessary.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s his absolute favorite facial product.</li>
            <li>The last one was gone too fast :-)</li>
            <li>On a side note, I much prefer the roll on bottle, it lasts ten times longer, because cotton balls will soak up most of the solution.</li>
            <li>I have been using Tend Skin for many years, it is the only product that miraculously prevents razor bumbs especially in sensitive areas- armpit/bikini.  </li>
            <li>i bought this while i was pregnant because my skin became very sensitive...</li>
            <li>LESS IS MORE!</li>
            <li>Only downsides are that it has a strong smell when first applied and it stings and itches just after it is applied, but that goes away within a matter of minutes.  </li>
            <li>The reviews for this product are rather positive, so I hoped it would work for him.  </li>
            <li>which is pretty much all it is.</li>
            <li>It really does reduce razor bumps and ingrown hairs, but be aware that it will sting if you have any razor nicks.</li>
            <li>Amazon also has this product available in packs of two that apparently fluctuates in price (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004V50XHA/ref&#x3D;od_aui_detailpages00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1)</li>
            <li>Amazon also has this product available in packs of two that apparently fluctuates in price (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004V50XHA/ref&#x3D;od_aui_detailpages00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1)</li>
            <li>As my freshly shaved neck hair grows back, it makes ingrown hairs and significant pain wherever the shirt touched my neck line.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really pretty much just alcohol, and because of that it stings.  </li>
            <li>My wife has tried a few other types of products to prevent ingrown hairs and says this one does the best job.</li>
            <li>first noticed results only a day after my first application, and my skin has stayed bump free since.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>I have tried pretty much everything on the market.</li>
            <li>He has used this product consistently and has reported much improvement with his skin.  </li>
            <li>I have been able to maintain a clean shave (head &amp; beard) with few if any razor bumps &amp; ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product so that your skin remains unblemished and smooth.</li>
            <li>It does a good job of preventing ingrowns, but is very harsh on your skin.</li>
            <li>so I will have to keep trying other products similar but in a better more affordable price range.</li>
            <li>Even after a fresh shave, with continued use new bumps did not appear.</li>
            <li>Would not recommend for people with eczema as it does dry out the skin, since changing my regimen to what the dermatologist recommend my skin as been doing 100% better, but as far as a general razor burn solution, this is the top of the line.</li>
            <li>Within the first week i noticed a huge different in skin appearance.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to dry out something,like a zit, I&#x27;m sure it would work.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, over time, with consistent use it won&#x27;t sting as much, and it really doesn&#x27;t smell all THAT</li>
            <li>For the first time, I feel comfortable wearing shorts out in public...</li>
            <li>The scent, the strong isopropyl component, and finally Skin</li>
            <li>It does have a strong alcohol smell (and the sting that goes with it), but that only lasts for maybe 20 seconds?</li>
            <li>It am completely certain that TEND is the cause.  </li>
            <li>I have large pores on my legs and this helps me not to additionally suffer from ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>Large size.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not had peeling as others have, but I can certainly see that being a by-product of using this.</li>
            <li>Trying to shave certain spots used to wreck me to the point where I just couldn&#x27;t keep it up.  </li>
            <li>My girlfriend uses it regularly overnight for over an year, so she asked me to buy another flask (as we live in Brazil) during my latest business trip.</li>
            <li>I use natural shampoo bars, dry shampoo, I make my own lotions, moisturizers, toners, ect..</li>
            <li>Quick drying and no mess.</li>
            <li>Usage is NOT painful-- regular rubbing alcohol left more intense stinging than TEND did.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and this completely works after a wax to calm my skin.</li>
            <li>One down side is that it has a very strong rubbing alcohol smell</li>
            <li>My skin is very fair and delicate and this has improved the overall brightness.</li>
            <li>and I went back and purchased a huge industrial size bottle.</li>
            <li>If you use it daily it makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work as well as I thought it would I haven&#x27;t really seen a difference</li>
            <li>also noticed that it works really well</li>
            <li>This product really works and if you suffer from razor bumps you will want to try this product.</li>
            <li>This product works very well.</li>
            <li>It works but you really have to use it twice a day</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for the fast delivery of the product.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t help with razor burn, or ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>that was fast thank u</li>
            <li>I use the product daily, even when I don&#x27;t shave, along with a Mary Kay Naturals moisturizer and my skin is baby smooth.</li>
            <li>This works very well to soothe and prevent razor burn.  </li>
            <li>I would highly reccomend it!</li>
            <li>I can really tell a difference between when I use this product and when I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>really works well for</li>
            <li>I stopped using it because my hands started to peel too much, so I would recommend using gloves every-time you apply the solution.</li>
            <li>Works very well to prevent ingrown hairs</li>
            <li>I googled for products that could help me, without much optimism.</li>
            <li>I was without irritation and with a temporary alcohol burn, which I really don&#x27;t mind</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Shave with a fresh blade, use a sensitive shaving gel,  blah blah</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;ve been burned so much in the pastthat</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t really or at all.</li>
            <li>Really bummed me out cause I could never wear swimsuits.</li>
            <li>Really embarrassing.</li>
            <li>and it really seems to be helping.</li>
            <li>He was really struggling with razor burn on his neck.</li>
            <li>It takes about a week for the product to really work</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The gel product worked very well and just as advertised it was gentle to the skin, I would recommend the product.</li>
            <li>This product is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Like I said nothing else helped this much.</li>
            <li>and I really wanted to try it</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>2-3xs a day with a moisturizer which is very cooling and soothing, plus</li>
            <li>You really have to use it for a week for results.  </li>
            <li>I really like it and think it works with out a doubt</li>
            <li>you have those ingrown real BAD!&amp;#34; I said &amp;</li>
            <li>rubbed a cotton soaked in this Tendskin on my freshly shaved, bumper, sensitive face...</li>
            <li>For a light moisturizer I like SkinFix Daily lotion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really done nothing to eliminate the existing bumps.  </li>
            <li>My product came fast just on time for the gift bag.</li>
            <li>This one smells like straight alcohol.</li>
            <li>I would say, save yourself some money and just use straight rubbing alcohol because that&#x27;s basically all this product is.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect this product to work</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product and it&#x27;s very over priced for the quality.</li>
            <li>It has helped me soooo much with my ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>No matter if I shave, epilate, wax....makes no difference, it really affected the swimwear I could wear, etc.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t really see much improvement.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Before I used this I would be in so much pain</li>
            <li>is about all you can reasonably expect.</li>
            <li>I was having a real problem with ingrown hairs under my arm.  </li>
            <li>I read the reviews and really thought my boyfriend would like this product for his razor burn, turns out it has a smell that he doesn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>This really helps to keep them at bay.</li>
            <li>The 8oz bottle is a real steal.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This product works very well.</li>
            <li>I really need to be their spokesperson.</li>
            <li>Now I recommend if any of you ladies are suffering from a severe case of folliculitis, you really need to apply this product 2x a day till you are healed.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>an will continue to reorder an use this, it really work ya&#x27;ll.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and I gently apply it on all of my face and part of my neck.</li>
            <li>Tend Skin really works.</li>
            <li>This costs a ton, but even for this frugal fanny it is so far WORTH IT.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that TendSkin doesn&#x27;t work, because it absolutely does.</li>
            <li>It really prevents them--more so than any product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I used the product after getting out of the shower like I always do and could immediately tell that this was not the real thing.</li>
            <li>and he&#x27;d never broken out from it nor had razor burn.</li>
            <li>This stuff works very well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>But it didn&#x27;t really help me.</li>
            <li>The travel size roll-on is very convenient.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>recommend this problem because it absolutely works..</li>
            <li>Though I do notice regrowth of hair, growth is much slower and the hair is much finer</li>
            <li>This really works at clearing up the not-so-attractive bumps from waxing.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>felt absolutely hopeless in this area.</li>
            <li>Make life much easier vs. the cotton-ball</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the idea that this product keeps going up so much in price.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon I can get it on here for 1/3 the price.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff and think it works.</li>
            <li>, don&#x27;t go to any cosmetics stores, very over priced, cheapest place is here at amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never felt the need to write a review for anything I&#x27;ve purchased my whole life</li>
            <li>This really keeps the bumps away.</li>
            <li>I personally like to use Cetaphil moisturizing fragrance free lotion (you can find for under $10)</li>
            <li>Works really.....</li>
            <li>This stuff really does work.</li>
            <li>I really really like the tend skin product.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it works really well.</li>
            <li>So much razor burn,</li>
            <li>, it is kinda sticky though not so much like alcohol, it might smell like it but</li>
            <li>and I found that this stuff really helps with the razor burn and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>really well fighting off razor burn.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to solving this problem, and</li>
            <li>This product really work.</li>
            <li>and it really works</li>
            <li>This stuff really helps with the bumps after shaving and waxing.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Much easier to use than cotton balls.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works for me .</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how Ive lived without this my whole life.  </li>
            <li>It really does help.</li>
            <li>and I found that it&#x27;s really just an underpowered application for managing razor bumps and ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>This tend skin product works very well.</li>
            <li>really messed up my skin.</li>
            <li>Way to much alcohol.</li>
            <li>Seems to work very well.  </li>
            <li>After a few days, the hairs come out on their own.</li>
            <li>I researched the problem and found numerous posts on the net about Tend Skin being effective and curing this problem.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if it tackled such issues as razor bumps, burns, and especially ingrown hair.</li>
            <li>Will definitely continue to use after a decade of searching for something that could work for my case; thank you guys sooo much!!!</li>
            <li>He asked me if I was willing to try something new.</li>
            <li>I love the large bottle at the low cost and have found that it generally works for in grown hairs.</li>
            <li>At one point I really wanted to start to get a REALLY clean shave, one that you can only get from a razor but every razor that I tried and every shaving cream and every after shave concoction never worked.</li>
            <li>This product is far better than both Moore Unique &amp; Skin Tight!</li>
            <li>Tend Skin is mostly alcohol, vegetable glycerin and salicylic acid (or Asprin -- used as a mask for acne due to the salicylic acid.)</li>
            <li>What more can you say about Tend Skin other than it seems to work.  </li>
            <li>Always in the Instyle or other magazines as top editors pick.  </li>
            <li>Shaving daily also significantly decreases the likelihood that you will break out with bumps.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I received this that I had to use the same day.</li>
            <li>Not sure of the formula change, but little sting and works so great on ingrown hairs - overnight!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t even able to return it due to hazard liquid): .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m flat out cheap.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t help me any better than the other one i have</li>
            <li>Due to its price, I tried many solutions before trying Tend Skin.</li>
            <li>Tend Skin on the other hand is okay for the price point.  </li>
            <li>There is more product in the bottle and a friend recommended it to me due to my tendency to have ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, particularly since it didn&#x27;t seem to help much before.</li>
            <li>I was initially skeptical because the reviews seemed too good to be true</li>
            <li>Fair women with coarse dark hair....</li>
            <li>The only thing is it&#x27;s strong, so sit in front of a fan while applying it to face and avoid eyes completely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line, I&#x27;ve used this product on my blemishes for years, and it&#x27;s never failed to clear things up super-quick and painlessly and no blob of goo sitting on my face for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think washing with an acne facewash that contains salicylic acid, and then cleansing with rubbing alcohol would probably just as effective (if not more), than purchasing this.</li>
            <li>Sure, it stops bleeding from shaving cuts, but not worth it for the price.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m more than average.</li>
            <li>So far seems to be working pretty well.</li>
            <li>I am still not thrilled about the price (even though it is much cheaper on Amazon) nor the fact that it lacked more wholesome ingredients - but I have to say that it is certainly worth it for me.</li>
            <li>Complete change during the first week of buying this products.</li>
            <li>I know that nothing is 100% full proof, but this definitely does help with ingrown hairs and razor bumps on the legs.  </li>
            <li>I also just pour it directly onto my skin and then dab with a cotton ball instead of applying it to the cotton ball first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still in the process of using it but so far it&#x27;s doing exactly what it was advertised to do</li>
            <li>put in one immediately after shaving (it burns for a second, but it&#x27;s not bad)</li>
            <li>it goes a long way and also stings a little which is why you use very little, it does have a smell to it so best time to use morning or night and use EVERY day or you will not get full results...</li>
            <li>only complaint is the smell is really really strong (like a bottle of super cheap vodka kinda smell)</li>
            <li>and i purchase it at a much better price than at the store down the street from my house</li>
            <li>I use it for the bikini area and my husband uses it on his scalp and his face and he absolutely can&#x27;t live without this stuff!</li>
            <li>Dries them up super quick, plus the aspirin brings down the swelling.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, the smell is potent, it will make you cough if you don&#x27;t actually move the bottle away from you when you open it, not sure why, but the smell is super strong.</li>
            <li>I was getting ready to try Tend Skin until I read that it was being sold in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and may not be marketed in the United States without an approved New Drug Application (NDA)</li>
            <li>This is important because I put LOADS of this stuff on my skin and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a month now and skin had tighten and less razor bumps love it</li>
            <li>The area couldn&#x27;t be more than a half square inch or so</li>
            <li>smooth without getting dry, as if I&#x27;m no longer in need of lotion,</li>
            <li>They want more for a bottle half the size at the flea market</li>
            <li>I should use it more on regular bases, but it does work even without regular use!  </li>
            <li>This product is suited for mild to moderate ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>I would not have expected anything so relatively simple to be so effective.  </li>
            <li>The main reason is that it contains alcohol.</li>
            <li>It totally cleared my back and butt, better than my prescription products.</li>
            <li>I have been cursed with razor burn since I have started shaving, particularly around the bikini area.</li>
            <li>The main reason was RAZOR bumps and burns.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been loyal to it ever since and will continue to use this product in the future.</li>
            <li>We have seen the dermatologist, used several different products, and nothing has worked better.</li>
            <li>but I use it after I shave and my neck gets red for hours after using this, more than likely because the burn.</li>
            <li>Perhaps that&#x27;s why this bottle is so much larger; they knew you&#x27;d have to apply a lot more to get the same effect.  </li>
            <li>I have to hold my breath and be careful or the fumes can be strong.</li>
            <li>The scent is not great, very strong medicinal/chemical smell, but fades quickly within about 30 seconds.    </li>
            <li>It burns going on, but I saw immediate results starting with the very first application.</li>
            <li>think the main things you should make sure of when choosing a moisturizer is that it&#x27;s (1) fragrance free, as this can sometimes cause more problems for skin prone to razor bumps, and (2) not too heavy, as this can clog pores and also make matters worse.</li>
            <li>B&amp;C Skin Tight would better suit you&#x27;re</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.</li>

            <li>I have tried every product on the market from high time bump stopper, to bump stopper razors, to acne medicine, to shaving in the shower, to praying to God.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;To summarize: I highly recommend this for anyone who fights with shaving irritation and/or ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>but I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>and I had high hopes for this one.</li>

            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Regardless of my other products or shaving method, Tend Skin has kept my skin clear and sexy.</li>
            <li>Be careful because after shaving or waxing it does burn and tingle, but if you wait a day or two then it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Nice product - I have extremely reactive skin in my bikini area and am prone to ingrown hairs, constant razor bumps and cystic acne.</li>
            <li>I was most self conscious about were my legs, due to the razor bumps.</li>
            <li>While it does have the ability to prevent ingrown hairs I would say it does a little more than that for me</li>
            <li>Nothing worked so well on my sensitive skin before!!</li>
            <li>it Burns a little as I think its made mostly of prue alcohol.</li>
            <li>skin is very sensitive and during a shave my skin gets super red</li>
            <li>hence you do not waste any, or as much and #2</li>
            <li>This product has really helped my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks God, I am all clear now.</li>
            <li>wow this really works</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried others with more harsh ingredients</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a very big bottle and worth the money you pay.</li>
            <li>After 3-4 weeks of usage I noticed that the skin in the distinct area that I swab daily is now darkening.  </li>
            <li>I &amp;#34;think&amp;#34; it did help with reducing ingrown hairs, but not enough that I&#x27;d be willing to pay as much as I did to purchase it again.</li>
            <li>I figured what the heck, he already told me that it might cost me a tad bit more than the everyday stuff, so I didn&#x27;t wince at going in on a whim.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use since I can get a few more months use</li>
            <li>and I see enough of an improvement that it seems worth purchasing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s normally about $20 for 8 oz.</li>
            <li>i use a normal amount just squirt a bit on a cotton ball morning and night.</li>
            <li>I thought it was okay, my fingers got dried out from it</li>
            <li>It worked ok, but it didn&#x27;t clear the dark marks.</li>
            <li>I had my first Brazilian wax at 18 and the woman told me that my skin was extremely sensitive and that I was shaving too frequently.</li>
            <li>Nothing had worked before, or only very slightly improved the condition of my skin (BikiniZone, in particular), and I honestly did not have much hope for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My bumps are totally gone and I rarely get ingrowns anymore.</li>
            <li>But coming from a world of using products such as [[ASIN:B000NPJHQU Bump Patrol]], I found that the Tend Skin product took longer to do anything and when it did start working, required multiple daily applications to remain effective.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not certain if this particular item is counterfeit or reformulated by the manufacturer, but it in no&lt;br /&gt;way resembles the Tend Skin liquid I&#x27;m familiar with.</li>
            <li>Make sure your skin is as dry as possible</li>
            <li>and I noticed that the bikini area is more soft and with less ingrown hair.</li>
            <li>After consistently using this product for 2 weeks on my legs and upper arm, I have seen significant improvement on my skin: my skin feels silky smooth, there are less ingrown hair, and the pores seem to have gotten smaller!</li>
            <li>I know it seems obvious, but if you forget to apply it right away, your results will suffer (it will still heal any sad/icky razor bumps or burn, but that doesn&#x27;t happen overnight, friends).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does sting when you apply it right after shaving, and can sting in the following applications, as well.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who is condsidering waxing, it works wonders for people with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for any young shaver!</li>
            <li>Compared to other solutions for ingrown hair, this one is pretty economical.</li>
            <li>The product was shipped very quickly and the price was half of what I pay normally at the store.</li>
            <li>I love having a beard, but get some pretty serious razor burn on my neck.  </li>
            <li>Gave me back my smooth skin not clear skin so much though.</li>
            <li>Cannot live without this.  </li>
            <li>I will be moving on to a new product.</li>
            <li>New York Solution2 Razor Bump Rollerball Treatment]])</li>
            <li>Been using this for over 10 years and let me tell you i can;t live without this product.</li>
            <li>day I went to a new barbershop and the guy asked me if I wanted a shave</li>
            <li>cant live without this...</li>
            <li>He says it cleared up his razor bumps and prevents new ones from forming.</li>
            <li>However I also received a new Gillette Mach 5 Razor which from my Fiancee.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li>it brings the ingrowns to the surface &amp; i have seen a decrease in new ones.</li>
            <li>New bottle arrived today, it smells just like the stuff I&#x27;ve been using for years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has cleared my razor bumps &amp; prevented new ones.</li>
            <li>Be weary of it being strong - especially after waxing such a sensitive area - this isn&#x27;t the case when you shave.</li>
            <li>So far, every time I use it, it helps to calm the red bumps</li>
            <li>After useing it for days it really don&#x27;t clear it up any faster and wasn&#x27;t particularly soothing.</li>
            <li>I read in a blog that salicylic acid  (common in acne products) works well and have been using a neutragena product that sprays on and was much cheaper and have been seeing much better results.</li>
            <li>I then use the TEND SKIN, by placing just enough to lightly soak a cotton ball and dab it across my entire face and neck.</li>
            <li>had tried everything OTC and some prescription for acne, and this was the first one that really worked in the long run.</li>
            <li>been using this product for a few weeks &amp; so far i am really pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>With Bump Patrol I can apply it fresh in the morning even over existing bumps, the next morning they&#x27;re completely gone.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend for someone who shaves frequently and are prone to razor burn.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, so no matter what I did</li>
            <li>so I tried it and was very surprised.</li>
            <li>but I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin on the neck and get razor burns using a blade or even from electric razors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with razor bumps since I was very young.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin that always breaks out after waxing and shaving and this product prevents it completely!!</li>
            <li>AND it seemed to clear up my acne!</li>
            <li>so it can clear up faster!</li>
            <li>This is the first product that I have actually used that worked for me.</li>
            <li>I recently had razor burn for the first time.</li>
            <li>My issue is not mere sensitivity, and no amount of obvious advice helps.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have said, it definitely seems to be mostly just rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li>Gets rid of razor burn which I get pretty regularly after shaving my legs.</li>
            <li>As a person of African descent, I get many ingrown hairs due to my curly hair texture.</li>
            <li>But now I roll it on directly onto my skin without losing any solution!</li>
            <li>Tend Skin has been the only product that works and is not expensive.  </li>
            <li>Especially since I needed to start using other products on my face to keep it healthy and</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>when I apply this directly after I&#x27;ve shaved!</li>
            <li>For me, it only takes an application every morning and night for the first 2-3 days after shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li>wow my skin burned after i applied it!</li>
            <li>and prospective Tend Skin users should be aware of these citations before using the product, especially those who are allergic or react adversely to aspirin.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to start using this product and agree with multiple reviews stating that the product is practically the same as rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li>the only thing i&#x27;ve found that actually works, worth the price!</li>
            <li>It does burn at times with application, but small price to pay for better looking legs.</li>
            <li>When I started using Tend, at first I didn&#x27;t see a different and</li>
            <li>and I first purchased this product last year.  </li>
            <li>my boyfriend also immediately noticed the change in my skin and couldn&#x27;t stop stroking my legs and commenting on how soft they were!</li>
            <li>I have no more bumps :)</li>
            <li>it works better than any other similar product i have ever used.  </li>
            <li>LASTLY, I have been consistent with using TEND day and night, so I am hopeful (and optimistic) that it will reduce or diminish the bumps of my legs and arm.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take care of every last ingrown hair, but works well, better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>, I use less of this product because it works to heal so quickly and prevents break out of ingrown hairs, so I can go days between shaves with out using any!</li>
            <li>For someone who struggles with razor burn down there, this makes a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>As a woman it&#x27;s fantastic to have one less thing about your body driving you nuts.</li>
            <li>This product works fine although not good enough to enjoy two 8oz bottles, my order processed twice because of an &amp;#34;error&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks now, an from the first use, it help clear an bring present</li>
            <li>I would recommend getting a roller ball to help with easy application and so as not to waste any product applying with a cotton ball.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive facial skin, so I get bumps and rashes every time I shave or use my electric trimmer.</li>
            <li>Now if only I can hide the remaining dark spots... :)</li>
            <li>This is a S***ty product, waste of money, and the alcohol on the product smell so strong.</li>
            <li>After many years of razor burn on my face/neck, I finally broke down and bought this per friend&#x27;s recommendation.</li>
            <li>moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started purchasing TendSkin after seeing a wealth of positive online reviews about it along with mentions in various articles regarding skin care for men.</li>
            <li>This stuff is terrific and really helps to smooth down the bumps.</li>
            <li>This product even helped the odd bumpy skin on my upper arms that no dermatologist has ever been able to help with.</li>
            <li>Its ok, I didn&#x27;t see great improvement in my legs because I have really bad black dots from shaving and waxing.</li>
            <li>Plus, it is super cheaper here than on any other sites.</li>
            <li>isn&#x27;t super drying like other products I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>I used to cut my beard with trimmers, because razors electric and traditional cause me to BUMP UP, and trust me, ladies don&#x27;t particularly go for that sort of thing!</li>
            <li>For the longest time I would always get little red bumps after I shave, and a nice red neck.</li>
            <li>due to epilation/waxing, and has started becoming irritated over the past couple months and realized I need a solution quick.     </li>
            <li>but it burns like crazy lol</li>
            <li>The solution clear all bumps.</li>
            <li>Tend Skin really clear it up almost immediately.</li>
            <li>It also seems to help clear up redness around the neck area.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait for it to clear off.</li>
            <li>I used it to clear some razor bumps on my legs.</li>
            <li>my neck remains clear,</li>
            <li>I gave this a whirl to clear up</li>
            <li>(maybe 20 years by now?), sometimes for ingrown hairs, but mostly to clear blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Helped clear up razor burn as advertised.</li>
            <li>If you mixed this yourself you would have a much cheaper approximation.</li>
            <li>By far it helps with the bumps after shaving or waxing but does not help or stop ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>And the old ones are healing.  </li>
            <li>It does take time to get results so you must use frequently.</li>
            <li>This product has completely stopped any razor burn on my bikini area.  </li>
            <li>Tend Skin far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>It has made my ingrown hair/irritation problem nearly nonexistent.  </li>
            <li>Do not use if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>A side benefit is that it exfoliates dead skin and leaves skin smooth.</li>
            <li>After reading all of the reviews, I was very hopeful I would get the same result.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I get razor burn on the inside of my thighs near my bikini line in the summer.</li>
            <li>It does feel like putting straight rubbing alcohol on razor burn but it only stings for 3 seconds.</li>
            <li>but if you have sensitive skin then be prepared</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and had given up hope that anything could help.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely eliminated the problem of ingrown hairs that I used to get after shaving.  </li>
            <li>Just, WOW.... My underarms have cleared up dramatically.</li>
            <li>My skin is so sensitive to shaving</li>
            <li>Cleans and prevents debris from accumulating in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>I notice that bumps near my bikini line have diminished, they have not fully gone away but are not what they use to look like.  </li>
            <li>It really helped reduce bumps and ingrown hairs without causing extra irritation or drying the skin out.</li>
            <li>Works really fast too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>I bought this product a couple months ago and it&#x27;s now completely gone.</li>
            <li>I apply directly after shaving, plucking those areas.</li>
            <li>I would completely recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li>I tried all products after seeing a young lady on YouTube talk about this product.</li>
            <li>, it has worked really well for me, I would definitely recommend it&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this every time I shave and so far it has worked well.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>reduces redness completely.</li>
            <li>Just a piece of advice: don&#x27;t use directly after shaving/waxing, as it will irritate the skin.</li>
            <li>My face is far smoother with this stuff, and I never get acne anymore -</li>
            <li>It does what it says it does, it reduces the appearance of ingrown hairs, but if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This solved the problem completely.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried darn near everything.  </li>
            <li>I dont have to use TEND SKIN as much under my arms as I do my bikini area, because the last thing I want is Razor Bumps in my bikini area</li>
            <li>Stay away from sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have had no problems with it.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used this product for years and as a skin care professional (esthetician)</li>
            <li>I have not yet completely licked the problem because I forget to use it.</li>
            <li>and I have no complaints so far.</li>
            <li>that just wouldn&#x27;t go away, no matter how old I got.</li>
            <li>this is the only product that really works for razor bumps</li>
            <li>it is caused by clogged pores blocking the natural outward flow of skin fluids which contain bacteria.</li>
            <li>If you apply it with a cotton swab to each sore after washing the area with a gentle anti-bacterial cleanser the swelling will recede with will cause the pores to open and the infection to be released from the pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I compared it to my old bottle.</li>
            <li>I have very course hair (Italian)</li>
            <li>My esthetician that does waxing recommended this to me years ago, and its a must-have for folks with sensitive skin, or who develop razor-burn.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works as instructed; I used it after shaving in the morning and again at night on the irritated area, and in about five days the razor burn was almost completely gone.  </li>
            <li>I have suffered from razor burn and razor bumps all of my adult life.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that this does what it claims to.  </li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My skin is just sensitive to shaving for some reason, and &amp;#34;Tend Skin&amp;#34; has the word, tend in the name, so I figured perhaps</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and had tried a lot of things to help get rid of the razor burn that I get when shaving.</li>
            <li>Using the Tend Skin Care Solution with the Air Gel leaves my face smooth and with few razor bumps and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>The cream the doctor prescribed (Ziana), applied nightly, has almost completely resolved my ingrown hair/razor bump situation.</li>
            <li>I can not say this product worked with my sensitive skin when it comes to razor burn.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how well it worked.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t get rid out my razor bumps completely but basically cleared about 98% of them.</li>
            <li>When I was doing research on how to shave legs, I someone said that any old razor would do.</li>
            <li>A no go for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Its worth every penny spent on it.</li>
            <li>A few uses in I definitely noticed an improvement in my skin, however it was not as magical as others made it seem.</li>
            <li>I use expensive razors and good shave cream.</li>
            <li>i am not dramatizing in any way my bums are dissapearing and blemishes are slowly but surely dissapearing</li>
            <li>I still get an occasional one or two razor bumps every few months, but that&#x27;s far better success than any other product gave me.  </li>
            <li>I only use it right after I shave, and as the hair grows back in</li>
            <li>The little bit of sting it toally worth it!  </li>
            <li>No dark spots or in grown hairs there anymore ( something I&#x27;ve suffered with for over 10 years)!</li>
            <li>After other products that really did not work, this product really helped alot.</li>
            <li>Just super strong astringent that&#x27;s expensive</li>
            <li>Really glad my buddy referred it to me for my neck bump issues: Definitely begins the drying process in as little as 48 hours!</li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned with very thick coarse black hair.</li>
            <li>Will sting a little when first applied after shaving but cools &amp; sooths fast.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it maybe 4 days, but the hard, darker exterior is flaking off to reveal healthy, new skin underneath already.  </li>
            <li>and im a young latin american male, but my skin is more comparable to an african american male.  </li>
            <li>OK I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li>I had given up and told myself that I would get hair removal treatment when I got older ( im only 23) .</li>
            <li>and now that I&#x27;m older, I totally understand the benefits.</li>
            <li>I will likely continue searching for a more natural alternative, but this is my one vice, my one exception to the rule because it alleviates so much pain, itching, ugliness, shame, and emotional distress for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been razor bump free since I started shaving (being a dark haired italian) until discovering this product.</li>
            <li>I shave my head, and I used to get razor bumps, particularly on the back of my head.  </li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m going to spend a decent amount of money to fix my ingrown hair problem, I&#x27;ll put it towards a product that actually works.</li>
            <li>It actually started working after the first week of regular application.</li>
            <li>After the first night I applied this, I saw instant results the next day!</li>
            <li>It definitely has a drying affect, as isopropyl alcohol is one of the main ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I have major sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I had such high expectations.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to you if you have similar issues</li>
            <li>Next time I will check if a product contains a high percentage of alcohol.</li>
            <li>A little on a 2x2 gauze right after shaving in the morning (on dry skin), and right at night before I go to bed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have incredibly sensitive skin and thick hair and am easily irritated by shaving and skin products.  </li>
            <li>Plus the prices on Amazon are usually about 50% cheaper than the drugstore prices for this product which is a huge savings.</li>
            <li>&quot; I&#x27;ve never been able to shave my bikini area more than once a week because the day after I ALWAYS have ugly, red bumps.</li>
            <li>The product works very well as long as you use it as directed.</li>
            <li>I am African American, so I have a greater tendency to get razor bumps around my neck when I shave due to my hairs curling back into the skin.</li>
            <li>With this product it keeps my face just right, not too dry but enough not to make it too oily.</li>
            <li>, it stung tremendously and it burned a little, if you are using this for your legs</li>
            <li>I use in conjunction with Cortizone and aloe vera to calm skin down.</li>
            <li>This is primarily alcohol and does help dry out some of the bumps, but  I have found it does little to prevent new ones.  </li>
            <li>This seem to affect black men more than any other race.</li>
            <li>I continued to follow the practice of shaving after showering or at least giving my pores a chance to open up first before shaving and using TendSkin right after, that is, until one day when I was in a rush and forgot to do so completely.</li>
            <li>and it also doesn&#x27;t dry the skin out as much.</li>
            <li>too much use will make your skin dry out.  </li>
            <li>leaves the skin bit dry but works really well.</li>
            <li>Didnt really do anything for me except sting, make my face smell like rubbing alcohol and dry it out.</li>
            <li>and if you apply too much the skin on your neck will peel a bit later in the day and leave white stuff on your collar like you have dandruff!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used that has helped clear my skin back up, and trust me I have tried damn near EVERYTHING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It burns slightly after a fresh shave, but will prevent and treat</li>
            <li>Not excellent but good enough</li>
            <li>I think it has helped reduce razor burn, but I have very sensitive skin and didn&#x27;t see the total elimination that others reported.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference after only one week of using the product, and after 3 weeks everything cleared up completely!</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this product years ago when I was getting bikini waxes every other month.  </li>
            <li>The very first time I ordered it, it did take a few applications for my skin to adjust.</li>
            <li>Tend Skin is the ONLY product I have tried that not only eases the burn and itch of ingrown hair, but prevents them from starting in the first place.</li>
            <li>First of all, it&#x27;s really expensive - and really easy to make yourself (cheaper) according to my sister who is in pharmacy school.  </li>
            <li>BUT if the smell is really that much of an issue for you, I would either only shave at night and put this on before bed, OR I would recommend trying Barc Bump down razor relief</li>
            <li>Little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>It does sting a little, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>may seem a little pricey to some, but it is worth every penny if you have a problem with ingrown hairs like myself.</li>
            <li>this is a hidden little secret that should be on top shelves everywhere!!!</li>
            <li>After it clears, use once daily to keep it clear.</li>
            <li>This is ridiculously expensive for what you&#x27;re buying - try the cheap route first.</li>
            <li>I generally am strict about using only completely natural beauty products.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that completely knocked it out</li>
            <li>If this product didn&#x27;t completely eliminate ingrown hairs then it was because I probably didn&#x27;t use it often enough.</li>
            <li>I am extremely sensitive to mosquito bites and nothing has helped -- not hydrocortisone, nor commercial remedies.  </li>
            <li>I expected nothing, and got so much.</li>
            <li>My coarse hair or sensitive skin is prone/vulneralbe to ingrown hair and razor burns.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>I barely have any ingrown hairs anymore...</li>
            <li>seriously, barely ANY ingrowns.  </li>
            <li>Apparently after I bought this, my skin decided it wanted to behave.  </li>
            <li>very well - use it every so often (when i remember to) and absolutely no ingrown hairs or razor bumps</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t immediately completely get rid of ingrown hairs, but it definitely starts the healing process.</li>
            <li>the things that I have been using to stop my legs from itching, this barely stung.  </li>
            <li>Not trying to sell anything here, but as a 26-year old A.A. male, this is a product I continue to use once or twice a day.</li>
            <li>I bought this for ingrown hairs that suddenly developed in the last year or two.</li>
            <li>Started using daily in early Sept.</li>
            <li>Since purchasing a Gillete Fusion Proglide, ingrown hairs have completely disappeared, except on my upper thighs, which are extra sensitive anyways.</li>
            <li>The product does burn on freshly shaved skin so wait a few hours before putting it on.</li>
            <li>I have also noticed that after using this for a few months I rarely even get razor burn anymore.  </li>
            <li>If this wasn&#x27;t considered a hazardous material and unable to be returned, I would return this item immediately.</li>
            <li>You only need a little and the results can be seen rather quickly.</li>
            <li>It was used by a young black male, who has pretty severe razor bumps and ingrown hairs on his face.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s used too much it will cause even teenage skin to dry out and peel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been able to get my daily shave down to about 5 minutes from the 30 minutes using my previous methods.  </li>
            <li>Literally the next day, I woke up and my ingrown hair acne decreased significantly, like SOOO MUCH.</li>
            <li>Instead, I found Skin Tight locally and tried it, again, without success.  </li>
            <li>I was really hoping this would work as some other people have suggested.  </li>
            <li>When shaved my legs usually get hair bumps within the second day, and by applying this liquid of my skin twice daily my legs are feeling smoother and bumps free.</li>
            <li>Smells very much like alcohol, and its also a little too watery.</li>
            <li>and I used it for two weeks twice a day and saw not a single improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>This products works amazingly well, but you have to keep up with it everyday (at least I do) in order keeps the bumps under control.</li>
            <li>but so far I&#x27;m only using it on a very tiny portion of my face.</li>
            <li>I recently found a make your own version on line and decided to give that a try on a weird bumpy ingrown hair patch on my leg from waxing.  </li>
            <li>The odor was so intolerable that I used it only a few times and decided it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>But most recently I got so tired of razor irritation &amp; the bumps that follows it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve rarely had to use it a second day, because the blemish is dried up from two applications.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does work a little better than just plain alcohol.</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous at first because the reviews are hit or miss</li>
            <li>Burns slightly when you first put it on but definitely works well.</li>
            <li>The alcohol and aspirin kill bacteria and several humectants work to extract moisture from the epidermis and the general atmosphere or environment.  </li>
            <li>In general, I don&#x27;t recommend this product because it doesn&#x27;t work well enough to warrant the steep price tag.</li>
            <li>Do be aware that dead skin may peel away though.</li>
            <li>No, but the scent dissipates very quickly and your reward is bump-free skin after using this for just a few days, with none of the itching that typically accompanies regrowth after shaving.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve kept the empty bottle, and will compare labels with the new bottle when it arrives tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Used that frequently, it does seem to dry my skin, but not unmanageably so.  </li>
            <li>If you are a black guy or someone with very curly hair</li>
            <li>It has a slight burn like alcohol but if you don&#x27;t touch it you&#x27;ll be fine after a few seconda</li>
            <li>Can be applied twice daily for faster results on problem areas and this product does not dry your skin out like alcohol.  </li>
            <li>Beware, it can sting a little in certain areas if you have shaved too close.&lt;br</li>
            <li>especially if you&#x27;re a black man/ woman take it from me, this stuff works real talk.</li>
            <li>I used two full bottles of tend skin as I wanted to give it enough time to really get through several layers of skin, but unfortunately it just didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li>but after those hellish two months and a year of trying to make dry brushing followed by moisturizing with oils,sugar scrubs, and witch hazel work, I broke down and decided I should revisit Tend Skin - especially since I&#x27;d paid a pretty penny for it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a little scared to leave this review for fear of jinxing the whole thing.</li>
            <li>Good stuff; a little on the expensive side.</li>
            <li>This product has significantly reduced the incidence of new ingrown hair but unfortunately nothing it has not relieved those already beneath the skin.</li>
            <li>You put it on the ingrown hair LUMPS (thats pretty much what I have, it is pretty bad...)</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great remedy for ingrown hairs AFTER the fact, and an even better remedy for acne!</li>
            <li> To my great surprise, Tend Skin has made an amazing difference for me.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff.  </li>
            <li> I saw some good reviews on this product and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for post waxing.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good product to use before ingrown hairs occur since it takes forever to get rid of them.</li>
            <li> (it kinda feels good...).</li>
            <li> It has been working good on my underarms, but hasn&#x27;t been working as well on my bikini area.</li>
            <li> I been using this stuff for over a year and let me tell you it works good...</li>
            <li> Good for ingrown hair problems.</li>
            <li> The tend skin bottle is in the didn&#x27;t have as good results.</li>
            <li> this works really good to minimize the chances of getting razor burn though it does burn like a bitch</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works and work good.</li>
            <li> I used this years ago and remembered it kind of burned, but it still worked great on ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> but not that good</li>
            <li> GOOD LUCK</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell that great though, kind of like rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product that did the job and is  money</li>
            <li> its a good product</li>
            <li> good choice for sensative skin</li>
            <li> This stuff is as good as advertised, used it for the bikini area for my wife and saw no razor bumps or ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> Good for bumps on bikini line.</li>
            <li> I even have a fair pain tolerance.  </li>
            <li> It burns like hell when u put it on your lady parts, but after a couple seconds you&#x27;re good.  </li>
            <li> the price is good and you ll be surpise the dirt it pulls off your skin.</li>
            <li> Good product...</li>
            <li> good results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s good stuff.  </li>
            <li> i been trying using another products without any good result.</li>
            <li> good product.</li>
            <li> I also read that it can be used before waxing to &amp;#34;loosen&amp;#34; hair and make the process easier, but I will still rely on a good numbing cream for that.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work as well as good ol&#x27; fashioned exfoliating.</li>
            <li> It got a 4 and not a 5 because of the cost and because it&#x27;s so good</li>
            <li> my bf loved it</li>
            <li> It is a good quality</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do,but not that good.</li>
            <li> Great seller, excellent product, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the results I received.</li>
            <li> but it surely burns when I apply it after shaving lol</li>
            <li> Best solution for ingrown hairs, I have tried many products and this by far is the best.</li>
            <li> not everything that works will have a amazing smell and look good...</li>
            <li> Great product which I have been using for many years.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with everything.</li>

            <li> This stuff helps calm my skin after I shave, but it&#x27;s nothing too impressive.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> stuff works great has potent smell though i wouldn&#x27;t use before going out</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy about that I&#x27;m sure to repurchase this product again</li>

            <li> This solution is effective.</li>
            <li> This stuff is effective, but I noticed that the bottle I was sent expired 4 months before they sent it to me.</li>

            <li> Nice for the after shave irritation</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it and am amazed at how effective it is.</li>
            <li> Nice.</li>
            <li> Bought this for razor bumps, and honestly it wasn&#x27;t the mirical cure I wanted.</li>
            <li> The razor bumps remain and we will continue searching for an effective product to treat his razor bumps.</li>
            <li> The two or three times I did use it, it seemed effective.</li>
            <li> This is an effective product for anyone suffering from in-grown hairs.</li>
            <li> Does it smell nice?</li>
            <li> I was scared of the burning but it honestly DOES NOT BURN ME...</li>
            <li> is nice to not have to worry about this anymore.    </li>
            <li> So effective with razor bumps, ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> Works well on hormonal bumps nicely</li>
            <li> This is a must for any dude who body builds and wants the perfect ab look with out the irritation included.</li>
            <li> has this nice silky feelin from the glycerin in it once it dries.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and excellent product.</li>
            <li> It is an effective product.</li>
            <li> Honestly, i did not use qtip, i used a tissue because i wanted to put as must as i can</li>
            <li> Im gonna keep using it until the bottle finishes to see how effective this tend skin is.</li>
            <li> I liked using this stuff</li>
            <li> I accepted that my skin just wasn&#x27;t as nice as others&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much Tend Skin for an excellent product!</li>
            <li> I purchased tend skin based on the great reviews, and was so excited to try it out.</li>
            <li> Useful for bikini and leg bumps as well as a good protector for men&#x27;s faces as well!  </li>
            <li> I got this for hubby in sephora for the first time, but I found it here at a better price, we are fan of this product because it works great!.</li>
            <li> I am happy to say that neither of those were true for me.  </li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t perfectly smooth but it&#x27;s a remarkable improvement.</li>
            <li> This is my new &#x27;Grooming&#x27; best friend!!</li>
            <li> It smells very strongly of rubbing alcohol and will make your eyes water a bit, but I use to always break out on my face after waxing, but not anymore.</li>
            <li> This has a very strong smell.</li>
            <li> I ended up trying this out becuz of all the reviews posted however the smell is a very strong alcohol smell which I don&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li> I have never been more satisfied with a product for that function!</li>
            <li> but this is probably the most satisfied I have ever been with a product!</li>
            <li> This is the best product for anyone who has sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> remarkable product....expensive, but worth it!</li>
            <li> Although the smell is not the most pleasant, it fades very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Outstanding product, quick delivery and works just as described, Tend Skin has never disappointed its absolutely perfect effect on helping to eliminate razor bumps and painfu n</li>
            <li> I have used rubbing alcohol on occasion to disinfect and sooth razor bumps as well, which much more cost effective, but does not work as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was the most popular product I read about.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s far from perfect.    </li>
            <li> Excellent action.</li>
            <li> Tend Skin is by far the best product I&#x27;ve used to treat my razor bumps!</li>
            <li> This is way more effective than bikini zone.</li>
            <li> Best price option I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks of using morning and night it clear up wonderfully.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best beauty product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Is it the most effective?  </li>
            <li> However some of the bottles no longer have the nice gold tone top and they have a plastic which makes its appearance</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff!</li>
            <li> It had a strong rubbing alcohol smell but it works!</li>
            <li> I took a chance and finally decided to purchase this product because of the excellent reviews---and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m on the hunt for a good non-clogging moisterizer that may help return the skin to it&#x27;s original hue......</li>
            <li> Works great for women and men - it really is a miracle worker!</li>
            <li> My face seems to be very smooth</li>
            <li> ingrown hair makes the skin softer and smooth love it!  </li>
            <li> I wish this was available in more stores!</li>
            <li> I have very fair and sensitive skin which results in a lot of razor burn.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> but this is because the product contains mostly isoprophyl alcohol.</li>
            <li> Time and time again my esthetician would comment on them, suggesting I &amp;#34;drink more water, exfoliate more often, try this ingrown serum&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is the best for anywhere you get bumps from shaving, or even wherever tiny &amp;#34;fuzz&amp;#34; hair grows.</li>
            <li> Okay this one is for the ladies...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed I just have nice smooth skin.</li>
            <li> It would be much better to have a more soothing product.</li>
            <li> but I know there are many that don&#x27;t rely on alcohol for some of their effect.</li>
            <li> This works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried before.  </li>
            <li> Okay so let me start off my saying</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more after I finish this bottle.</li>
            <li> Make sure you check on the bottle</li>
            <li> I love it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Give it shot, you&#x27;ll love both.</li>
            <li> Could there be something better?  </li>
            <li> , I wish it had better scents.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff -</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> and he was supportive, but we were both concerned about the cost.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading many reviews and am EXTREMELY  satisfied.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I hope it will do a better job.</li>
            <li> My ingrown hair has been more of a challenge.</li>
            <li> This product has allowed me to risk shaving my pate and face/chin more than once a week sometimes without worry of the razor burn or ingrown.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I listened.  </li>
            <li> Glad I listened to my friend.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Just burns like rubbing alcohol n caused more ingrowns.  </li>
            <li> n now ve more problems, discoloration, from use...</li>
            <li> this product is that I spend more money on waxing becos</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> the one I got is not an authentic product.</li>
            <li> get the biggest bottle, its more $$</li>
            <li> ive fallen completely in love with this and the air shave gel</li>
            <li> i love it keeps me from feeling ashames about the below parts</li>
            <li> love this stuff</li>
            <li> Have tried so many things over the years.  </li>
            <li> I have referred it to many and they love it as well.</li>
            <li> I have used it for many years</li>
            <li> Look, I love Tendskin.</li>
            <li> I said sure what is it?</li>
            <li> but it sure is smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just buy witch hazel or rubbing alcohol, they probably work better.</li>
            <li> What I love about it is that it does work to prevent ingrowns but</li>
            <li> A be sure to moisturize along with the tend skin use.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> Better than Dilapitory shaving products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> Must shave more often now.</li>
            <li> I love Tend Skin and have been using it for years.  </li>
            <li> Most of the time I use it for underarms and bikini line, but believe it would work anywhere you needed it.</li>
            <li> I had tried a comparable product and had better results.</li>
            <li> I have tried products like nair and many, many others and the bumps just kept coming.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful septic product that has helped reduce the regular, persistent occurrence of ingrown hairs on my face.  </li>
            <li> Definitely the best product I have tried for these uses.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying four more just to keep around.</li>
            <li> Maybe you will see better results.</li>
            <li> I shave w/a Gillitte Fusion razor if you want to know, but I&#x27;m sure that I could shave with any razor and this stuff would work its magic.</li>

            <li> but it looked like many of the pictures I see for razor bumps, ingrown hairs, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will be buying more</li>
            <li> Plus the roll-on bottle unscrews at the top</li>
            <li> , i love this</li>
            <li> many whose complaints come before mine, or the manufacturer Or Seller, is laughing all the way to&lt;br /&gt;the bank.</li>
            <li> I tried a lot of different remedies and Tend Skin is the one that works the best.</li>
            <li> This stuff works much better than Neutrogena T-gel shampoo</li>
            <li> I do like the roller version better though.</li>
            <li> For the most stubborn though I have to use it about 3 times a day instead of the one time.</li>
            <li> so I thought okay</li>
            <li> IT WORKS LIKE MAGIC.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>

            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Better than I used to be after shaving.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product and I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> After shaving  I put a quarter sized amount of tend skin on a hand towel and use that to apply all over my beard areas (seems to work much better than using your palms).</li>
            <li> Will buy more</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Tend Skin for more then 10 years now</li>
            <li> This works so much better than products I have purchased at stores.</li>
            <li> Advice - You need to come up with a better applicator/dispenser.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did,</li>
            <li> I have had an issue with Razor bumps off and on over many years.  </li>
            <li> it works wonders and makes your skin smooth!</li>
            <li> If it was milder and smelled better I would use it more often and perhaps see better results.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> The more your skin heals from shaving,</li>
            <li> I chose them because they were having a sale for 2 bottles at a better price than everyone else had for 1 bottle.</li>
            <li> This along with a moisturizer and a loofa in the shower will truthfully get rid of your ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Phenomenal product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It sure does burn when applied, but it works so well.</li>
            <li> I find that the using TEND SKIN method works better than using an exfoliating scrub or exfoliant pad to scrub.</li>
            <li> I am totally pleased with Tend Skin.  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li> This product is like magic put it on after a shave or wax and</li>
            <li> and it seems to work much better.</li>
            <li> I no longer need to feel embarrassed and feel confident after shaving.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any better results.</li>
            <li> It does however burn a lot more for me than TEND SKIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hopefully this helps someone out in choosing whether or not to buy this product &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> am a pleased customer</li>
            <li> so glad that I&#x27;ve found this product</li>
            <li> and so glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Glad I did...</li>
            <li> what more can I say</li>
            <li> Tend Skin is a million times better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I discovered this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, and I love it.</li>
            <li> The product was okay</li>
            <li> but this works better.</li>
            <li> and It&#x27;s been better than what I was using at the time.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to use a razor, electric shaver or anything like that for years.  </li>
            <li> had read many reviews on Tend Skin, and this product has allowed me to purchase my Braun 7 Series Electric Razor and almost eliminate all razor bumps.  </li>
            <li> so many ingrown</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s safe to say it&#x27;s helping.  </li>
            <li> this product works like magic .</li>
            <li> In all honesty, however, after that 20 seconds my skin already starts to feel better than it did before.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for many years and simply love this product.</li>
            <li> The product was great and works very well.</li>
            <li> This works better than every product.  </li>
            <li> I tried many aftershaves to no avail, I read a review about tend skin and tried it.</li>
            <li> I really love this.</li>
            <li> I love this  and will always try to keep it on hand.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that this stuff is really healthy for the skin, but it does what it promises, and I havent noticed any adverse effects.</li>
            <li> Trend skin has been magical.</li>
            <li> so i guess the tea tree bump oil is slightly better</li>
            <li> The acetylsalicylic acid speeds up exfoliation of the top layer of skin, and is anti-inflammatory; and the alcohol helps prevent infection.</li>
            <li> Much love to the producers.</li>
            <li> Used it a couple times to be sure, but yep, still sucked.</li>
            <li> better pice on Amazon.</li>
            <li> then the lady who waxes me told me to use more than the recommended amount</li>
            <li> Within 5 days my most problematic areas that I had been dealing with for years had magically disappeared.</li>
            <li> Like most after shaves, it does sting.</li>
            <li> I love it and use it everytime I shave.</li>
            <li> So it does work, but it doesnt magically make the bumps dissapear like some say 0_o.  </li>
            <li> but i am satisfied, and i will keep using it.</li>
            <li> Glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product, must have if you have ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> and I am glad I chose this as well.</li>
            <li> Love it for the bichini area.</li>
            <li> I apply it like I would an aftershave, and that seemed to have better performance.  </li>
            <li> It works better as a preventative than it does a cure.  </li>
            <li> not so grand.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have that many marks anyway,so</li>
            <li> Results are good, although some people overrate this product, there are no miracles, if you set your expectations right, should not disappoint.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anywho, This product does work, and yes it does kinda sting at first and has a not so pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I just want to give a shout out to the Tend Skin The Skin Care Solution Company for such an outstanding product!!!  </li>
            <li> Great product and I highly recommend it for ladies and gentlemen to try.</li>
            <li> you will be super pleased with your results!</li>
            <li> Soothing and cool with nice smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent $$ on all different brands &amp; I would say this is the best, as best as it can get.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, but make sure to use it consistently!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li> it wasnt as effective, I guess I was just lucky with the one i bought at cvs.</li>
            <li> Bottle goes kind of quick</li>
            <li> make sure you don&#x27;t use a lot at once because it will give off a strong alcohol scent</li>
            <li> It burns like rubbing alcohol upon application, but that goes away very quickly and the results are better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> It does smell strongly of alcohol, but it is mostly alcohol.</li>
            <li> could not live without it the best!</li>
            <li> It has also greatly reduced the acne on my face by drying pimples, exfoliating (also keeping skin very soft), and disinfecting.  </li>
            <li> Nothing very special.</li>
            <li> or sometimes I like to use a little BIO OIL when I have it (BIO OIL, is about $5-$10 for a 2 fl oz bottle, but has proven to me to be VERY effective in moisturizing and great for a variety of skin problems).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but it work better if its applied alone but 10 mins after use then lotion should be fine</li>
            <li> But this is the best stuff I have found, and I have tried so many other products.  </li>
            <li> This is the best product ive ever used after tying so many other products.  </li>
            <li> burn for so many years, but Tend Skin took care of it after the very first application!</li>
            <li> It made a huge difference over night - worked better than I remember the tendskin working.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t eliminate bumps completely for me but greatly reduces them.</li>
            <li> So far so great.</li>
            <li> Works great so far</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and a good product.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I didn&#x27;t purchase it right away, in fact it was</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s more effective on certain skin types than others.  </li>
            <li> The other reviews said it was a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to control that.</li>
            <li> You can see the changes very quickly.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply with a cotton ball</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad i finally got the product after i heard so much great  things about it.</li>
            <li> You will see results very quickly.  </li>
            <li> A friend who is a cosmetologist strongly recommended this product.  </li>
            <li> It has a strong smell but it doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn the skin either, which I thought it would do with the strong smell.</li>
            <li> others have said, it has a really strong smell of alcohol.</li>
            <li> However, you do need to use it in a ventilated are since the smell is slightly strong.</li>
            <li> It smells strongly of rubbing alcohol</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any strong smell and it didn&#x27;t burn when I put it on.</li>
            <li> the solution is  not as strong as it used to be but will work.</li>
            <li> There are no other products out there that can do this and for the price I paid, I am incredibly happy.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend using both a good quality razor as well as</li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews on here I decided to give this product a try, and boy am I glad I did!</li>
            <li> he has mentioned to other buddies and they have tried it and love it too!!!</li>
            <li> I tried it out and WOW, what an amazing difference!</li>
            <li> the shipment came extremely fast and I was very pleased</li>
            <li> I am having good results with this product, when many others have done ok but fallen short.</li>
            <li> There are roll on versions but this version you can pour onto a cotton ball and it is pretty effective.</li>
            <li> But with consistent use, this stuff was seriously effective.</li>
            <li> It was average at best when it comes to preventing or getting rid of razor bumps.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t even develop razor bumps anymore because the hair is so fine.</li>
            <li> BUT it helps tremendously!</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and well priced!  </li>
            <li> The bottle being plastic is nicely designed and stores well in the lower bathroom cabinet too large for my medicine cabinet.  </li>
            <li> I love it, thanks!!</li>
            <li> in less than an HOUR I noticed that the bumps that were on my neck after I shaved were GONE, and even more, they STAYED GONE!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that makes a huge difference or not.  </li>
            <li> It makes a huge difference in reducing ingrown hair between waxing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year  now, and I can tell you that it has made a huge difference in my appearance.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a huge fan.</li>
            <li> But i used it twice a day, and followed it with a nice face lotion to prevent my skin from drying and shortly after a week or two i started noticing some amazing differences.    </li>
            <li> both have made a huge difference in my case.</li>
            <li> Made a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> Product arrived just as advertised, and the price for what I got was fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for someone else and they really enjoy the product.</li>
            <li> My skin cleared up in a matter of days and has remained bump free for months.</li>
            <li> Get free and get this stuff.</li>

            <li> razor-burn free.</li>
            <li> I use this often when I shave and it keeps the skin smooth and bumpless.  </li>
            <li> feel smooth as a baby bottom...</li>
            <li> This is a great item, it definitely works on reducing the bumps you get after shaving.</li>
            <li> and now it is FINALLY smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no longer worried about shaving anymore, my face is baby-skin smooth</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic skin care solution and does a noticeable job with clearing up issues after a week of use.</li>
            <li> Smooth skin results.</li>
            <li> I bought these, they have been great, I could only get them on line since where I was heading they didn&#x27;t have them.</li>
            <li> The product worked great to prevent the itching and bumps after hair started growing back.  </li>
            <li> Great for controlling facial razor bumps...can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I had started to wax, but got a free sample of this.</li>
            <li> I am bump free now.</li>
            <li> Enjoy using this product but proceed with caution.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product all around.</li>
            <li> Well worth the sticker price and just be sure to use it after every shave.</li>
            <li> maybe a couple of time after that and its smooth sailing.</li>
            <li> Overall, great stuff for the price.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff and it&#x27;s worth the $20 if you have hair bumps...</li>
            <li> Great product that actually works.</li>
            <li> No contact information available from Amazon on who to reach buyer.</li>
            <li> I did enjoy the burn</li>
            <li> It eliminates the bumps and it keeps your skin smooth.  </li>
            <li> No matter what technique I&#x27;m using to remove hair, I know that by applying this product I will have smoother, ingrown hair free skin on about 90-95% of where ever I use it.</li>
            <li> Takes all bumps away within days takes the red out within a day great product  </li>
            <li> I used it after shaving my women parts and it keeps me smooth without any irritation and burning.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hands silky smooth too.</li>
            <li> thought it was free shipping on the item.</li>
            <li> Smooth skin practically guaranteed, in my experience, if used as directed.</li>
            <li> i do see a difference, my bikini area has gotten lighter but not as light as i want it.</li>
            <li> This is such a great cure for the irritation that happens with ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> Great product to use as needed, you can apply to problem spots or apply overall as an aftershave for nicks and to prevent ingrown hairs before they start.</li>
            <li> This not only clears up &amp; prevents razor burn and ingrown hairs, it also works great on blemishes.  </li>
            <li> the price just isn&#x27;t justified .&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far so good, I don&#x27;t like the scents though</li>
            <li> Tend Skin Liquid is a good product for people with sensitive skin after any brand of epilator.</li>
            <li> So I searched daily for another good or better product that could take its place.</li>
            <li> Tend skin clears it right up, and if I stay on top of using it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more so right</li>
            <li> Tend Skin actually works better and is cheaper!!</li>
            <li> The bottle is also very large, it&#x27;s lasted me many months at twice a day usage.</li>
            <li> As a bonus, this is also a wonderful thing to put on your feet before slipping into your favorite shoes because it keeps your feet nice and dry.</li>
            <li> Tend Skin cleans it all up and leaves you with smooth clean skin.</li>
            <li> It has a strong smell of alcohol but it dissipates quickly.  </li>
            <li> And now with this new roll-on design they went over the top!</li>
            <li> a fairly hairy man, my facial hair grows very quickly.</li>
            <li> Well worth it!</li>
            <li> I originally got this product for my husband and his ingrown hairs he gets on his head from shaving.</li>
            <li> It significantly reduces the bumps.</li>
            <li> It seems like you need pretty regular and consistent use to get the best of it.</li>
            <li> This has significantly helped with my ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have ever tried that is successful at removing and preventing razor bumps.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I think that makes this unique because it also eliminates redness.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this product.</li>
            <li> It significantly decreases the likelihood that you will break out with bumps or a rash after shaving.</li>
            <li> I originally bought Tend Skin just for my razor bumps and used it as a spot treatment.</li>
            <li> At this point I was much better at having a consistent beauty routine</li>
            <li> Just make sure you are consistent.</li>
            <li> I use the roller-ball that came with my original order.</li>
            <li> I bought this to refill my roller ball bottle of this that I originally bought.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over 3 weeks and my skin has significantly improved.</li>
            <li> but the results are worth it!</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a great size so it lasts for a long time depending on how often you shave.  </li>
            <li> Tend Skin is definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous razor burn creams and if applied as directed this stuff is the best by far for razor burn!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great, for years i had a mild for of eczema and did not know it, after going to a dermatologist we are treating it differently and using special moisturizer ( amalactin)  to solve my skin irritant problems ( used this everywhere</li>
            <li> This product was very strongly recommended by a trusted cosmetologist and it delivers sweet relief from ingrown hairs &amp; razor burn, very soothing.</li>
            <li> Ok, so i dont normally do reviews, but as you all know Tend Skin has gotten so many good reviews and people that have used it, that i decided to go to my local Walgreens and purchase it for about $17 bucks.</li>
            <li> I have to keep clean shaven and hair</li>
            <li> It does sting a bit but its definitely the best product on the marker so far.</li>
            <li> I tried many similar product but none have been as effective as tend Skin on eliminating and preventing razor bumps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy who likes his face clean shaven and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple products for razor bumps, and this is by far the best!</li>
            <li> So far my face has been getting better every day most of them are now gone.    </li>
            <li> I must say, after various products this one is by far the best!</li>
            <li> I must say after countless products that I have tried, I find this to be the most effective.</li>
            <li> I prefer a product from my salon that does the same thing with a pleasant aroma</li>
            <li> I use this after shaving my neck with a single blade razor and skin looks great during the day.</li>
            <li> worked!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this if anything changes with long term use but so far, I love, love, love, love this!</li>
            <li> The only time I experienced any burning was after a line up in which I was cut, so with alcohol in the solution you can expect there to be some burning right?</li>
            <li> Cleared my razor bumps right up!</li>
            <li> Used as soon as it arrived as I had some acne giving me fits on the right side of my face!  </li>
            <li> In fact, I think I&#x27;ll do that right now before I forget!</li>
            <li> I used another popular product called Skin Tight a fews back and it worked awesomely.</li>
            <li> I have experimented with many other products for years and this is definitely the best to avoid razor bumps and to maintain smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say, 95% of my skin is nice and clear now.</li>
            <li> About 95% of my ingrowns are healed and I can enjoy freshly shaved legs for a day or two instead of 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> I apply it in front of a fan to cool the burn and that helps.</li>
            <li> The results are true to what is advertised, but you will do the burning flesh dance for about five seconds after application.</li>
            <li> Good size, this one will last me probably 9-12 months.</li>
            <li> I wax my full leg and get a Brazilian...</li>
            <li> Tend Skin solution is a true winner.  </li>
            <li> Its okay doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff now for years and can&#x27;t say good enough about it.</li>
            <li> and It&#x27;s lasted me a full three months.</li>
            <li> Tend skin is by far the most effective, it REALLY does what it says</li>
            <li> Good price for a man&#x27;s basic grooming needs.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t harm it, gives my face a cool feeling after using I recommend using lotion on the face after 10mins</li>
            <li> For some reason they stopped producing the creme which caused my ingrowns to come back because the liquid was not as good.</li>
            <li> Once the sample was used, I bought the full size bottle ($35).</li>
            <li> But here are facts I found true for my experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell of this one is not nearly as bad as its competition.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product.</li>
            <li> I a reading some of the reviews with the 1 and 2 stars, folks are on here saying the products price is increasing over the years while the product appears to be becoming more diluted &amp; less effective.</li>
            <li> many thanks for quick delivery..</li>
            <li> I love this products it works good on the hidden hairs on my chin area.</li>
            <li> when traveling the roll-on is perfect not to get taken by the mean airport people.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is probably the single most effective solution I have used to fight the unsightly razor bumps and ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> It got to me very quickly and was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> #34;this is nothing but alcohol and acid&amp;#34; but I decided to try it anyway due to all of the great reviews.</li>
            <li> Works great for razor burn and other skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li> I use it on the bikini line and it&#x27;s helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> but I was not as lucky as these people...</li>
            <li> It worked okay, but I still have many ingrown hairs left.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take a few days like any reasonable person would expect; it worked flawlessly.</li>
            <li> and I must say it helps tremendously</li>
            <li> Came quickly.</li>
            <li> but it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time and it has helped razor bumps tremendously.</li>
            <li> This product provides quick healing and reduces the amount of ingrown hairs I receive.</li>
            <li> This product has reduced them tremendously.</li>
            <li> My son swears this is the best product on the planet and says it&#x27;s the only made that actually does what it&#x27;s suppose to do!  </li>
            <li> I had shaved quickly and was worried that the inconsistent strokes would cause irritation and lead to razor bumps.</li>
            <li> I have tried several things and this definitely works the best</li>
            <li> , I will continue to be a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product was delivered fairly quickly and as promised.</li>
            <li> It seems to work although not as well nor not as quickly.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> but its quick.</li>
            <li> Friend pharmacist says that it is just like rubbing alcohol, but I think TEND is just not as powerful (which is good because for the amount of areas I needed to use this product for, I probably would get poisoning from actual rubbing</li>
            <li> It has a very strong rubbing alcohol smell to it, but it seems to be working well so far.  </li>
            <li> Compared to other after shaves that I have tried, this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I very much recommend - 5 stars!</li>
            <li> A fantastic all-around product!</li>
            <li> But overall am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I use to refil the rollerball that came with my very first purchase of Tend Skin at a waxing boutique.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t always find the best deals on ebay, as you have to constantly check back to see if any new bottles were listed, but Amazon has great prices from lots of different sellers.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of bumps/burn serums etc but never this one till my new waxing place (Waxing the City - which I love btw)</li>
            <li> Tend Skin helps the skin area surrounding my ingrown hairs to be less reddened and inflamed so that pain and swelling is minimized and my appearance has greatly improved.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a slight reduction in ingrown hairs, but nothing to jump up for over joy over.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually does a pretty good job removing razor bumps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using TEND skin for about 3-4 weeks now and the improvment is remarkable; the \\&quot;terrain\\&quot; has been left free and clear of any irritation or afflictions.  </li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t really break out at all!!</li>
            <li> was pretty excited since I&#x27;ve tried getting rid of them using home remedies, and that didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Plus I can do it more frequently!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how this stuff works, but it really does!!</li>
            <li> Notice a change within the first week!</li>
            <li> Trust and believe me, that I definitely will be buying more and recommend others to try this product out!</li>
            <li> and it is an absolute must for me!!</li>
            <li> Having fair skin and dark, thick hair, I was the perfect candidate for this.</li>
            <li> This stuff truly works if you use it consistently!</li>
            <li> This product does exactly as it promises!</li>
            <li> This product was noticeably more effective than typical creams like Bikinizone.</li>
            <li> Not only is it effective but it also works quickly.</li>
            <li> clears skin up well, I have mild psoriasis and this clears it right up.</li>
            <li> After reading so many positive reviews, I was really expecting to be blown away by this product.</li>
            <li> , It is worth the money in the first week all my bumps cleared up!.</li>
            <li> Great product that is a little pricey</li>
            <li> I really didin&#x27;t have a chance to use it as I guess it should have been used, but for the most part the product was pure meh.</li>
            <li> I discovered this a few years ago and it works great to prevent my neck from breaking out in razor burn when I shave.</li>
            <li> Once I started seeing great results, I ended up using it as a toner everyday.</li>
            <li> It smells very skunky by does precisely what it is advertised to do.  </li>
            <li> This is an awesome product that helps reduce redness and swelling from stubborn ingrown hairs (4+ weeks old) around sensitive areas within days with once-daily application and even gets rid of regular pimples on the face overnight (added bonus for me!).</li>
            <li> Great product but a bit harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very creamy and goes on like a light lotion</li>
            <li> This product has helped to keep my skin smooth and razor bump free, it burns like fire for a minute after hair removal but have been razor bump free since starting to use it.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and my skin feels and looks great.</li>
            <li> but I just use a cotton round and that works great for me.</li>
            <li> Great product for a few decades now.</li>
            <li> Burns a bit but worth it.</li>
            <li> As a woman, I use it on bikini line, back of legs &amp; arms &amp; my skin is 100% more smooth because of tend skin.</li>
            <li> those who like to make more natural products: there are DIY recipes out there.</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of products for ingrown hairs on my (bald) scalp and face--both prescription and non-prescription--without success.  </li>
            <li> This product is definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> So far I have not found anything that works better at melting away bumps.</li>
            <li> It was well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth buying.</li>
            <li> Literally TWO DAYS after using it his skin was clear and baby smooth!</li>
            <li> It stings when I apply it after shaving, but it&#x27;s worth the couple of seconds of swearing.</li>
            <li> I think the pain is worth the results.</li>
            <li> Really hurts when you put on if you have any nics, but nothing better really at taking away the bumps and redness over time.  </li>
            <li> It is well worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> i shaved/waxed), but for what its worth, after shaving this did do the trick</li>
            <li> /&gt;Totally worth it to not have razor burn/bumps anymore.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, this is the only thing I&#x27;ve ever used that has worked and prevented razor bumps.</li>
            <li> but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> but I love this product so much that it doesn&#x27;t bother me as much.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It does burn when you apply after a fresh shave, but it goes away and fanning air helps.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the money</li>
            <li> /&gt;Whether the product is really useful, I cannot say.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it, trust me.</li>
            <li> and it is honestly the only product that ever worked for me.  </li>
            <li> Oedered this because I was tired of having ingrown hairs and product worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li> and WOW he looked so much better.  </li>
            <li> but the results are worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if some of these reviews were paid off or if maybe my body just reacts to it differently, but honestly, this product did NOT work for me...</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth the $$.</li>
            <li> but this one is worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s worth it to have a fab looking bikini area</li>
            <li> If you only use it after you shave, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as effective as i still got</li>
            <li> , if it does then I am truly happy for you, but I am a 19 year old male, and it just isn&#x27;t working for me.</li>
            <li> My husband rarely gets those bumps he use to get when shaving his head.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money if used as directed.</li>
            <li> Is it worth what you pay?  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t effective enough for mine.</li>
            <li> its a little strong like alcohol not so much so the product is wonderful still have more than half the bottle</li>
            <li> think there are many other better products out there now a days.</li>
            <li> but it goes away pretty quick</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it promises to do, and it does it quickly.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be very effective after shaving to prevent bumps and to also treat them in a few days max.</li>
            <li> So I had to shave it neatly and clean as I have been doing for so many years prior &amp; just like I like it!</li>
            <li> and I was almost in tears due to happiness.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the tendskin right after epilating because I did that one time and it stung a bit.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked right away.  </li>
            <li> I use Tend Skin right after shaving, before applying moisturizer and a moisturizing after shave.  </li>
            <li> I use a cotton ball to apply it right after I get out of the shower</li>
            <li> I would use it right after shaving and it did nothing.</li>
            <li> I epilate every morning on my bikini line and immediately apply right after.</li>
            <li> and I noticed a difference right away.  </li>
            <li> 3 days of use and the ingrown hair comes right out.</li>
            <li> I have an acne condition where sometimes the hairs are ingrown and this brings them right up</li>
            <li> Worked right away for my razor bumps.</li>
            <li> It does burn if you use it right after a shave</li>
            <li> This company ships right away</li>
            <li> I have suffered from razor burn for what seems like years now, tried just about everything, so I figured why not try something else, eventually something has to work, am I right?</li>
            <li> I have used No Bump in the past after my waxes and have had great success.  </li>
            <li> Tend skin was first offered to me by my waxing salon; of course, I told them I&#x27;d take care of my messed-up lookin abs on my own and found the same product for 1/4 of their price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does the trick just use cotten balls and stay clean.  </li>
            <li> Bump Patrol, on the other hand, is/was so effective that applying it in the morning of Day 1 resulted in significant improvements in the shaved (or unshaved) area by the morning of Day 2.  </li>
            <li> It is very strong and has been the only product that I&#x27;ve seen results with.</li>
            <li> You will use less product with the roll-on and you will get a better, more even application.</li>
            <li> I prefer natural products but this is my one exception because with daily use it keep my skin looking happy and absolutely helps prevent in-growns from waxing.</li>
            <li> : You need to use everyday to work effectively!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years for razor bumps, and it&#x27;s one of those rare &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; products that REALLY works!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money because it really WORKS!  </li>
            <li> Plus, since there&#x27;s no fragrance, your face will reek like pure alcohol!</li>
            <li> good reviews on YouTube for black skin.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I dabbed the TendSkin on my face immediately after and experienced the same results, not razor bumps, no irritation, no red spots, and no itchiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> far I really like this product :)</li>
            <li> So if you are ok with applying this everyday and spending $20 and more a month on this, then buy it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good product that i guess disinfects the skin after shaving in a way that there are much less breakouts.</li>
            <li> i was very much looking forward to getting this product</li>
            <li> when I get a hair cut, so this solution works actually very fast, I waited  to get a haircut</li>
            <li> You also don&#x27;t need very much of it per application</li>
            <li> I am sure this new razor and shaving cream have made a huge impact on preventing  future Razor bumps and razor burn.  </li>
            <li> Works pretty good on razor burns if u use it for few days right after shaving.  </li>
            <li> but as I got older and had to shave more frequently, the alcohol wasn&#x27;t doing the trick.</li>
            <li> It really helps open the pores and help prevent ingrown hairs - which I get a lot of and very easily.</li>
            <li> This is huge when you consider that I used to have a complete breakout every time</li>
            <li> Did not really work for me, but I can tell it cleans the area nicely.</li>
            <li> The product seems to work ok to help reduce ingrown hairs, although it definitely doesn&#x27;t eliminate them.</li>
            <li> It smells exactly like rubbing alcohol (makes me wonder</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone, I think the reviews were pretty helpful.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> So first off let me start off by saying that whenever I get my eye brows threaded, I get some acne from it.</li>
            <li> but it really works!</li>
            <li> Works pretty well at stopping ingrown hairs on the bikini area for me.</li>
            <li> I wanted to have it to use after getting my first waxing.  </li>
            <li> For the first two weeks I used it twice a day</li>
            <li> When I first applied it, I had just shaved</li>
            <li> outstanding product for women facial hair</li>
            <li> First off, tend skin isn&#x27;t a miracle worker for me</li>
            <li> First off let me warn you..</li>
            <li> First, be forewarned, it burns as soon as you put it on after you shave, but....</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different products, from&lt;br</li>
            <li> Glad I ordered a bigger bottle this time.</li>
            <li> I said yes, he gave me the hot towel, razor blade, etc.</li>
            <li> It may not be pretty</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t prevent them all, but it&#x27;s definitely been better.  </li>
            <li> After the first shave he uses it  morning and night for a couple days,after once a day.</li>
            <li> pretty quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If anything it seemed to irritate my skin further and cause more ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> and you really don&#x27;t need to smell like that any longer than you have to!</li>
            <li> I used this consistently and have not seen any changes.</li>
            <li> First time user.</li>
            <li> tend skin for many years and this one has packaging that is a bit different.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> Overall excellent product and will definitely order again in the future!</li>
            <li> then most likely you have had to deal with severe shaving bumps when shaving your face.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it is designed to do ... stop razor bumps and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Overall I would recommend this product and I am going to buy more when I run out because it is helping.</li>
            <li> I do warn you though that this stings when you first apply it after you shave</li>
            <li> I love this product have been using for several years.</li>
            <li> EVERYONE ;-)</li>
            <li> Be consistent and patient.</li>
            <li> My kids love it for clearing up teenage acne.  </li>
            <li> I shave my head pretty close</li>
            <li> &amp; I plan to purchase more as needed in the future.</li>
            <li> especially she shaving more in spring</li>
            <li> This product really does prevent in grown hairs!</li>
            <li> This was the first time I ordered the product from Amazon, and what I received smells like Rubbing Alcohol.</li>
            <li> Ever since I first started shaving as a teenager, I noticed that I would get unsightly razor bumps after shaving.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product, it was after showering first and then shaving, hoping that having open pores would help absorb the treatment better.</li>
            <li> I was impressed, I saw no razor bumps after the following days after shaving nor did I feel any itching, burning, or small patches of irritated skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t suffered from any razor bumps since I started using it, even on my most problem areas such as my chin and jawline.</li>
            <li> After the FIRST time putting it on, I noticed almost a 100 percent improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly what I was looking for and came just as described.</li>
            <li> Thanks Ace Man!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how I first heard of it - through a friend who styled hair.  </li>
            <li> When you first get it, you use it once in the morning and once at night.  </li>
            <li> When I first got it I would put it on after shaving then again in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Love this product use this on a daily and it has removed my ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I switched to Anthony&#x27;s logistics for men - still expensive but doesn&#x27;t sting and works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s product does exactly was it says it does...</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I used it, I found it a pain to do morning and night with a cotton ball and used it inconsistently.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my son, it is nit the first time we have purchased but it is the first time from this company.</li>
            <li> This stuff has done exactly what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> Last night I was able to try this.&lt;br /&gt;Considering</li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> I am absolutely dumbfounded as to how and why it works!</li>
            <li> especially when I am sexually active-soooo THIS STUFF is the answer.</li>
            <li> I used TEND SKIN when I first got it</li>
            <li> The peeling skin turned me off at first, it was when I saw the peeling skin that I knew how it worked so well at preventing the bumps.</li>
            <li> the first time I&#x27;d tried it</li>
            <li> the days that I shave, I first take a rag and run it under some hot water.</li>
            <li> Just make sure that you keep the area properly</li>
            <li> Love this and order the largest size which actually lasted over a year</li>
            <li> I do not like how it smells like alcohol at first.  </li>
            <li> Started using product and saw results within the first 3 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Note that it does burn and sting a tad when you first apply</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a female, and don&#x27;t shave on my face BUT do have some acne which must be because of the heat and humidity in OK.</li>
            <li> A deep moisturizing lotion would serve you better.</li>
            <li> Should have followed my first mind.</li>
            <li> So, for the last 30 years I have use Magic Shave.  </li>
            <li> razor burn pretty</li>
            <li> It really works on ingrown hair and helps calm razor burns.  </li>
            <li> so you really get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Exactly the type of skin conditioner I needed.</li>
            <li> It really works well!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s the first ingredient listed on both the Amazon listing and on the bottle.</li>
            <li> It really works!  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff it definitely works!</li>
            <li> I have used many skin solutions; but this one is the only one that is soothing and can be used for any scratch, pimple and bites.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much cheaper!</li>
            <li> First after-shave I ever used.</li>
            <li> Its the first product that has worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this product by watching others recommend it on YouTube reviews.</li>
            <li> But, I realized I was genning ingrown hairs in the first place because I was using a no-name razor.</li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY recommend finding a great moisturizer to use to apply to the area to prevent the area from becoming too dry, especially if your skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> ; contains, among other ingredients, acetylsalicylate (aspirin), which is not recognized as a safe and effective ingredient in an external analgesic OTC drug product.</li>
            <li> It really does help with razor burn (although it stings when you apply it right after shaving.)</li>
            <li> Makes my skin smooth, smooth, smooth and no more ingrowns.</li>
            <li> They also have a roll-on applicator available which is a little more convenient (no cotton balls needed).  </li>
            <li> I am surprised that the hair bumps on my head has reduced significantly since I started using it.</li>
            <li> I tried sharp manual razors, electric razors, and every kind of shaving cream and skin treatment out there to treat the problem.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit more pricey than TENDSKIN not by much though, but it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent at all.</li>
            <li> As an African American male, I&#x27;ve experienced unsightly ingrown hairs for most of my adult life.</li>
            <li> But when I do it seems to clean pores and clear up any bumps.</li>
            <li> Cotton pads or cotton balls tend to absorb too much of the product, so one ends up consuming more than is necessary.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s his absolute favorite facial product.</li>
            <li> The last one was gone too fast :-)</li>
            <li> On a side note, I much prefer the roll on bottle, it lasts ten times longer, because cotton balls will soak up most of the solution.</li>
            <li> I have been using Tend Skin for many years, it is the only product that miraculously prevents razor bumbs especially in sensitive areas- armpit/bikini.  </li>
            <li> i bought this while i was pregnant because my skin became very sensitive...</li>
            <li> LESS IS MORE!</li>
            <li> Only downsides are that it has a strong smell when first applied and it stings and itches just after it is applied, but that goes away within a matter of minutes.  </li>
            <li> The reviews for this product are rather positive, so I hoped it would work for him.  </li>
            <li> which is pretty much all it is.</li>
            <li> It really does reduce razor bumps and ingrown hairs, but be aware that it will sting if you have any razor nicks.</li>
            <li> Amazon also has this product available in packs of two that apparently fluctuates in price (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004V50XHA/ref&#x3D;od_aui_detailpages00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1)</li>
            <li> Amazon also has this product available in packs of two that apparently fluctuates in price (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004V50XHA/ref&#x3D;od_aui_detailpages00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1)</li>
            <li> As my freshly shaved neck hair grows back, it makes ingrown hairs and significant pain wherever the shirt touched my neck line.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really pretty much just alcohol, and because of that it stings.  </li>
            <li> My wife has tried a few other types of products to prevent ingrown hairs and says this one does the best job.</li>
            <li> first noticed results only a day after my first application, and my skin has stayed bump free since.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> I have tried pretty much everything on the market.</li>
            <li> He has used this product consistently and has reported much improvement with his skin.  </li>
            <li> I have been able to maintain a clean shave (head &amp; beard) with few if any razor bumps &amp; ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product so that your skin remains unblemished and smooth.</li>
            <li> It does a good job of preventing ingrowns, but is very harsh on your skin.</li>
            <li> so I will have to keep trying other products similar but in a better more affordable price range.</li>
            <li> Even after a fresh shave, with continued use new bumps did not appear.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend for people with eczema as it does dry out the skin, since changing my regimen to what the dermatologist recommend my skin as been doing 100% better, but as far as a general razor burn solution, this is the top of the line.</li>
            <li> Within the first week i noticed a huge different in skin appearance.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to dry out something,like a zit, I&#x27;m sure it would work.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, over time, with consistent use it won&#x27;t sting as much, and it really doesn&#x27;t smell all THAT</li>
            <li> For the first time, I feel comfortable wearing shorts out in public...</li>
            <li> The scent, the strong isopropyl component, and finally Skin</li>
            <li> It does have a strong alcohol smell (and the sting that goes with it), but that only lasts for maybe 20 seconds?</li>
            <li> It am completely certain that TEND is the cause.  </li>
            <li> I have large pores on my legs and this helps me not to additionally suffer from ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Large size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had peeling as others have, but I can certainly see that being a by-product of using this.</li>
            <li> Trying to shave certain spots used to wreck me to the point where I just couldn&#x27;t keep it up.  </li>
            <li> My girlfriend uses it regularly overnight for over an year, so she asked me to buy another flask (as we live in Brazil) during my latest business trip.</li>
            <li> I use natural shampoo bars, dry shampoo, I make my own lotions, moisturizers, toners, ect..</li>
            <li> Quick drying and no mess.</li>
            <li> Usage is NOT painful-- regular rubbing alcohol left more intense stinging than TEND did.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and this completely works after a wax to calm my skin.</li>
            <li> One down side is that it has a very strong rubbing alcohol smell</li>
            <li> My skin is very fair and delicate and this has improved the overall brightness.</li>
            <li> and I went back and purchased a huge industrial size bottle.</li>
            <li> If you use it daily it makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as I thought it would I haven&#x27;t really seen a difference</li>
            <li> also noticed that it works really well</li>
            <li> This product really works and if you suffer from razor bumps you will want to try this product.</li>
            <li> This product works very well.</li>
            <li> It works but you really have to use it twice a day</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for the fast delivery of the product.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t help with razor burn, or ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> that was fast thank u</li>
            <li> I use the product daily, even when I don&#x27;t shave, along with a Mary Kay Naturals moisturizer and my skin is baby smooth.</li>
            <li> This works very well to soothe and prevent razor burn.  </li>
            <li> I would highly reccomend it!</li>
            <li> I can really tell a difference between when I use this product and when I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> really works well for</li>
            <li> I stopped using it because my hands started to peel too much, so I would recommend using gloves every-time you apply the solution.</li>
            <li> Works very well to prevent ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> I googled for products that could help me, without much optimism.</li>
            <li> I was without irritation and with a temporary alcohol burn, which I really don&#x27;t mind</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Shave with a fresh blade, use a sensitive shaving gel,  blah blah</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;ve been burned so much in the pastthat</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t really or at all.</li>
            <li> Really bummed me out cause I could never wear swimsuits.</li>
            <li> Really embarrassing.</li>
            <li> and it really seems to be helping.</li>
            <li> He was really struggling with razor burn on his neck.</li>
            <li> It takes about a week for the product to really work</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The gel product worked very well and just as advertised it was gentle to the skin, I would recommend the product.</li>
            <li> This product is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Like I said nothing else helped this much.</li>
            <li> and I really wanted to try it</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> 2-3xs a day with a moisturizer which is very cooling and soothing, plus</li>
            <li> You really have to use it for a week for results.  </li>
            <li> I really like it and think it works with out a doubt</li>
            <li> you have those ingrown real BAD!&amp;#34; I said &amp;</li>
            <li> rubbed a cotton soaked in this Tendskin on my freshly shaved, bumper, sensitive face...</li>
            <li> For a light moisturizer I like SkinFix Daily lotion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really done nothing to eliminate the existing bumps.  </li>
            <li> My product came fast just on time for the gift bag.</li>
            <li> This one smells like straight alcohol.</li>
            <li> I would say, save yourself some money and just use straight rubbing alcohol because that&#x27;s basically all this product is.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect this product to work</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product and it&#x27;s very over priced for the quality.</li>
            <li> It has helped me soooo much with my ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> No matter if I shave, epilate, wax....makes no difference, it really affected the swimwear I could wear, etc.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t really see much improvement.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Before I used this I would be in so much pain</li>
            <li> is about all you can reasonably expect.</li>
            <li> I was having a real problem with ingrown hairs under my arm.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews and really thought my boyfriend would like this product for his razor burn, turns out it has a smell that he doesn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> This really helps to keep them at bay.</li>
            <li> The 8oz bottle is a real steal.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> This product works very well.</li>
            <li> I really need to be their spokesperson.</li>
            <li> Now I recommend if any of you ladies are suffering from a severe case of folliculitis, you really need to apply this product 2x a day till you are healed.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> an will continue to reorder an use this, it really work ya&#x27;ll.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> and I gently apply it on all of my face and part of my neck.</li>
            <li> Tend Skin really works.</li>
            <li> This costs a ton, but even for this frugal fanny it is so far WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that TendSkin doesn&#x27;t work, because it absolutely does.</li>
            <li> It really prevents them--more so than any product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I used the product after getting out of the shower like I always do and could immediately tell that this was not the real thing.</li>
            <li> and he&#x27;d never broken out from it nor had razor burn.</li>
            <li> This stuff works very well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> But it didn&#x27;t really help me.</li>
            <li> The travel size roll-on is very convenient.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair</li>
            <li> recommend this problem because it absolutely works..</li>
            <li> Though I do notice regrowth of hair, growth is much slower and the hair is much finer</li>
            <li> This really works at clearing up the not-so-attractive bumps from waxing.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> felt absolutely hopeless in this area.</li>
            <li> Make life much easier vs. the cotton-ball</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the idea that this product keeps going up so much in price.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon I can get it on here for 1/3 the price.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff and think it works.</li>
            <li> , don&#x27;t go to any cosmetics stores, very over priced, cheapest place is here at amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never felt the need to write a review for anything I&#x27;ve purchased my whole life</li>
            <li> This really keeps the bumps away.</li>
            <li> I personally like to use Cetaphil moisturizing fragrance free lotion (you can find for under $10)</li>
            <li> Works really.....</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work.</li>
            <li> I really really like the tend skin product.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it works really well.</li>
            <li> So much razor burn,</li>
            <li> , it is kinda sticky though not so much like alcohol, it might smell like it but</li>
            <li> and I found that this stuff really helps with the razor burn and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> really well fighting off razor burn.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to solving this problem, and</li>
            <li> This product really work.</li>
            <li> and it really works</li>
            <li> This stuff really helps with the bumps after shaving and waxing.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Much easier to use than cotton balls.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works for me .</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how Ive lived without this my whole life.  </li>
            <li> It really does help.</li>
            <li> and I found that it&#x27;s really just an underpowered application for managing razor bumps and ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> This tend skin product works very well.</li>
            <li> really messed up my skin.</li>
            <li> Way to much alcohol.</li>
            <li> Seems to work very well.  </li>
            <li> After a few days, the hairs come out on their own.</li>
            <li> I researched the problem and found numerous posts on the net about Tend Skin being effective and curing this problem.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if it tackled such issues as razor bumps, burns, and especially ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> Will definitely continue to use after a decade of searching for something that could work for my case; thank you guys sooo much!!!</li>
            <li> He asked me if I was willing to try something new.</li>
            <li> I love the large bottle at the low cost and have found that it generally works for in grown hairs.</li>
            <li> At one point I really wanted to start to get a REALLY clean shave, one that you can only get from a razor but every razor that I tried and every shaving cream and every after shave concoction never worked.</li>
            <li> This product is far better than both Moore Unique &amp; Skin Tight!</li>
            <li> Tend Skin is mostly alcohol, vegetable glycerin and salicylic acid (or Asprin -- used as a mask for acne due to the salicylic acid.)</li>
            <li> What more can you say about Tend Skin other than it seems to work.  </li>
            <li> Always in the Instyle or other magazines as top editors pick.  </li>
            <li> Shaving daily also significantly decreases the likelihood that you will break out with bumps.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I received this that I had to use the same day.</li>
            <li> Not sure of the formula change, but little sting and works so great on ingrown hairs - overnight!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t even able to return it due to hazard liquid): .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m flat out cheap.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t help me any better than the other one i have</li>
            <li> Due to its price, I tried many solutions before trying Tend Skin.</li>
            <li> Tend Skin on the other hand is okay for the price point.  </li>
            <li> There is more product in the bottle and a friend recommended it to me due to my tendency to have ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, particularly since it didn&#x27;t seem to help much before.</li>
            <li> I was initially skeptical because the reviews seemed too good to be true</li>
            <li> Fair women with coarse dark hair....</li>
            <li> The only thing is it&#x27;s strong, so sit in front of a fan while applying it to face and avoid eyes completely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, I&#x27;ve used this product on my blemishes for years, and it&#x27;s never failed to clear things up super-quick and painlessly and no blob of goo sitting on my face for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think washing with an acne facewash that contains salicylic acid, and then cleansing with rubbing alcohol would probably just as effective (if not more), than purchasing this.</li>
            <li> Sure, it stops bleeding from shaving cuts, but not worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m more than average.</li>
            <li> So far seems to be working pretty well.</li>
            <li> I am still not thrilled about the price (even though it is much cheaper on Amazon) nor the fact that it lacked more wholesome ingredients - but I have to say that it is certainly worth it for me.</li>
            <li> Complete change during the first week of buying this products.</li>
            <li> I know that nothing is 100% full proof, but this definitely does help with ingrown hairs and razor bumps on the legs.  </li>
            <li> I also just pour it directly onto my skin and then dab with a cotton ball instead of applying it to the cotton ball first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still in the process of using it but so far it&#x27;s doing exactly what it was advertised to do</li>
            <li> put in one immediately after shaving (it burns for a second, but it&#x27;s not bad)</li>
            <li> it goes a long way and also stings a little which is why you use very little, it does have a smell to it so best time to use morning or night and use EVERY day or you will not get full results...</li>
            <li> only complaint is the smell is really really strong (like a bottle of super cheap vodka kinda smell)</li>
            <li> and i purchase it at a much better price than at the store down the street from my house</li>
            <li> I use it for the bikini area and my husband uses it on his scalp and his face and he absolutely can&#x27;t live without this stuff!</li>
            <li> Dries them up super quick, plus the aspirin brings down the swelling.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, the smell is potent, it will make you cough if you don&#x27;t actually move the bottle away from you when you open it, not sure why, but the smell is super strong.</li>
            <li> I was getting ready to try Tend Skin until I read that it was being sold in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and may not be marketed in the United States without an approved New Drug Application (NDA)</li>
            <li> This is important because I put LOADS of this stuff on my skin and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a month now and skin had tighten and less razor bumps love it</li>
            <li> The area couldn&#x27;t be more than a half square inch or so</li>
            <li> smooth without getting dry, as if I&#x27;m no longer in need of lotion,</li>
            <li> They want more for a bottle half the size at the flea market</li>
            <li> I should use it more on regular bases, but it does work even without regular use!  </li>
            <li> This product is suited for mild to moderate ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I would not have expected anything so relatively simple to be so effective.  </li>
            <li> The main reason is that it contains alcohol.</li>
            <li> It totally cleared my back and butt, better than my prescription products.</li>
            <li> I have been cursed with razor burn since I have started shaving, particularly around the bikini area.</li>
            <li> The main reason was RAZOR bumps and burns.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been loyal to it ever since and will continue to use this product in the future.</li>
            <li> We have seen the dermatologist, used several different products, and nothing has worked better.</li>
            <li> but I use it after I shave and my neck gets red for hours after using this, more than likely because the burn.</li>
            <li> Perhaps that&#x27;s why this bottle is so much larger; they knew you&#x27;d have to apply a lot more to get the same effect.  </li>
            <li> I have to hold my breath and be careful or the fumes can be strong.</li>
            <li> The scent is not great, very strong medicinal/chemical smell, but fades quickly within about 30 seconds.    </li>
            <li> It burns going on, but I saw immediate results starting with the very first application.</li>
            <li> think the main things you should make sure of when choosing a moisturizer is that it&#x27;s (1) fragrance free, as this can sometimes cause more problems for skin prone to razor bumps, and (2) not too heavy, as this can clog pores and also make matters worse.</li>

            <li> and I had high hopes for this one.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I had high hopes.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Regardless of my other products or shaving method, Tend Skin has kept my skin clear and sexy.</li>
            <li> Be careful because after shaving or waxing it does burn and tingle, but if you wait a day or two then it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Nice product - I have extremely reactive skin in my bikini area and am prone to ingrown hairs, constant razor bumps and cystic acne.</li>
            <li> I was most self conscious about were my legs, due to the razor bumps.</li>
            <li> While it does have the ability to prevent ingrown hairs I would say it does a little more than that for me</li>
            <li> Nothing worked so well on my sensitive skin before!!</li>
            <li> it Burns a little as I think its made mostly of prue alcohol.</li>
            <li> skin is very sensitive and during a shave my skin gets super red</li>
            <li> hence you do not waste any, or as much and #2</li>
            <li> This product has really helped my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks God, I am all clear now.</li>
            <li> wow this really works</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others with more harsh ingredients</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a very big bottle and worth the money you pay.</li>
            <li> After 3-4 weeks of usage I noticed that the skin in the distinct area that I swab daily is now darkening.  </li>
            <li> I &amp;#34;think&amp;#34; it did help with reducing ingrown hairs, but not enough that I&#x27;d be willing to pay as much as I did to purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I figured what the heck, he already told me that it might cost me a tad bit more than the everyday stuff, so I didn&#x27;t wince at going in on a whim.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use since I can get a few more months use</li>
            <li> and I see enough of an improvement that it seems worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s normally about $20 for 8 oz.</li>
            <li> i use a normal amount just squirt a bit on a cotton ball morning and night.</li>
            <li> I thought it was okay, my fingers got dried out from it</li>
            <li> It worked ok, but it didn&#x27;t clear the dark marks.</li>
            <li> I had my first Brazilian wax at 18 and the woman told me that my skin was extremely sensitive and that I was shaving too frequently.</li>
            <li> Nothing had worked before, or only very slightly improved the condition of my skin (BikiniZone, in particular), and I honestly did not have much hope for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My bumps are totally gone and I rarely get ingrowns anymore.</li>
            <li> But coming from a world of using products such as [[ASIN:B000NPJHQU Bump Patrol]], I found that the Tend Skin product took longer to do anything and when it did start working, required multiple daily applications to remain effective.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not certain if this particular item is counterfeit or reformulated by the manufacturer, but it in no&lt;br /&gt;way resembles the Tend Skin liquid I&#x27;m familiar with.</li>
            <li> Make sure your skin is as dry as possible</li>
            <li> and I noticed that the bikini area is more soft and with less ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> After consistently using this product for 2 weeks on my legs and upper arm, I have seen significant improvement on my skin: my skin feels silky smooth, there are less ingrown hair, and the pores seem to have gotten smaller!</li>
            <li> I know it seems obvious, but if you forget to apply it right away, your results will suffer (it will still heal any sad/icky razor bumps or burn, but that doesn&#x27;t happen overnight, friends).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does sting when you apply it right after shaving, and can sting in the following applications, as well.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who is condsidering waxing, it works wonders for people with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for any young shaver!</li>
            <li> Compared to other solutions for ingrown hair, this one is pretty economical.</li>
            <li> The product was shipped very quickly and the price was half of what I pay normally at the store.</li>
            <li> I love having a beard, but get some pretty serious razor burn on my neck.  </li>
            <li> Gave me back my smooth skin not clear skin so much though.</li>
            <li> Cannot live without this.  </li>
            <li> I will be moving on to a new product.</li>
            <li> New York Solution2 Razor Bump Rollerball Treatment]])</li>
            <li> Been using this for over 10 years and let me tell you i can;t live without this product.</li>
            <li> day I went to a new barbershop and the guy asked me if I wanted a shave</li>
            <li> cant live without this...</li>
            <li> He says it cleared up his razor bumps and prevents new ones from forming.</li>
            <li> However I also received a new Gillette Mach 5 Razor which from my Fiancee.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li> it brings the ingrowns to the surface &amp; i have seen a decrease in new ones.</li>
            <li> New bottle arrived today, it smells just like the stuff I&#x27;ve been using for years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has cleared my razor bumps &amp; prevented new ones.</li>
            <li> Be weary of it being strong - especially after waxing such a sensitive area - this isn&#x27;t the case when you shave.</li>
            <li> So far, every time I use it, it helps to calm the red bumps</li>
            <li> After useing it for days it really don&#x27;t clear it up any faster and wasn&#x27;t particularly soothing.</li>
            <li> I read in a blog that salicylic acid  (common in acne products) works well and have been using a neutragena product that sprays on and was much cheaper and have been seeing much better results.</li>
            <li> I then use the TEND SKIN, by placing just enough to lightly soak a cotton ball and dab it across my entire face and neck.</li>
            <li> had tried everything OTC and some prescription for acne, and this was the first one that really worked in the long run.</li>
            <li> been using this product for a few weeks &amp; so far i am really pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> With Bump Patrol I can apply it fresh in the morning even over existing bumps, the next morning they&#x27;re completely gone.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend for someone who shaves frequently and are prone to razor burn.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so no matter what I did</li>
            <li> so I tried it and was very surprised.</li>
            <li> but I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin on the neck and get razor burns using a blade or even from electric razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with razor bumps since I was very young.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin that always breaks out after waxing and shaving and this product prevents it completely!!</li>
            <li> AND it seemed to clear up my acne!</li>
            <li> so it can clear up faster!</li>
            <li> This is the first product that I have actually used that worked for me.</li>
            <li> I recently had razor burn for the first time.</li>
            <li> My issue is not mere sensitivity, and no amount of obvious advice helps.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said, it definitely seems to be mostly just rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of razor burn which I get pretty regularly after shaving my legs.</li>
            <li> As a person of African descent, I get many ingrown hairs due to my curly hair texture.</li>
            <li> But now I roll it on directly onto my skin without losing any solution!</li>
            <li> Tend Skin has been the only product that works and is not expensive.  </li>
            <li> Especially since I needed to start using other products on my face to keep it healthy and</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> when I apply this directly after I&#x27;ve shaved!</li>
            <li> For me, it only takes an application every morning and night for the first 2-3 days after shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> wow my skin burned after i applied it!</li>
            <li> and prospective Tend Skin users should be aware of these citations before using the product, especially those who are allergic or react adversely to aspirin.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to start using this product and agree with multiple reviews stating that the product is practically the same as rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> the only thing i&#x27;ve found that actually works, worth the price!</li>
            <li> It does burn at times with application, but small price to pay for better looking legs.</li>
            <li> When I started using Tend, at first I didn&#x27;t see a different and</li>
            <li> and I first purchased this product last year.  </li>
            <li> my boyfriend also immediately noticed the change in my skin and couldn&#x27;t stop stroking my legs and commenting on how soft they were!</li>
            <li> I have no more bumps :)</li>
            <li> it works better than any other similar product i have ever used.  </li>
            <li> LASTLY, I have been consistent with using TEND day and night, so I am hopeful (and optimistic) that it will reduce or diminish the bumps of my legs and arm.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take care of every last ingrown hair, but works well, better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> , I use less of this product because it works to heal so quickly and prevents break out of ingrown hairs, so I can go days between shaves with out using any!</li>
            <li> For someone who struggles with razor burn down there, this makes a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> As a woman it&#x27;s fantastic to have one less thing about your body driving you nuts.</li>
            <li> This product works fine although not good enough to enjoy two 8oz bottles, my order processed twice because of an &amp;#34;error&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks now, an from the first use, it help clear an bring present</li>
            <li> I would recommend getting a roller ball to help with easy application and so as not to waste any product applying with a cotton ball.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive facial skin, so I get bumps and rashes every time I shave or use my electric trimmer.</li>
            <li> Now if only I can hide the remaining dark spots... :)</li>
            <li> This is a S***ty product, waste of money, and the alcohol on the product smell so strong.</li>
            <li> After many years of razor burn on my face/neck, I finally broke down and bought this per friend&#x27;s recommendation.</li>
            <li> moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started purchasing TendSkin after seeing a wealth of positive online reviews about it along with mentions in various articles regarding skin care for men.</li>
            <li> This stuff is terrific and really helps to smooth down the bumps.</li>
            <li> This product even helped the odd bumpy skin on my upper arms that no dermatologist has ever been able to help with.</li>
            <li> Its ok, I didn&#x27;t see great improvement in my legs because I have really bad black dots from shaving and waxing.</li>
            <li> Plus, it is super cheaper here than on any other sites.</li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t super drying like other products I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> I used to cut my beard with trimmers, because razors electric and traditional cause me to BUMP UP, and trust me, ladies don&#x27;t particularly go for that sort of thing!</li>
            <li> For the longest time I would always get little red bumps after I shave, and a nice red neck.</li>
            <li> due to epilation/waxing, and has started becoming irritated over the past couple months and realized I need a solution quick.     </li>
            <li> but it burns like crazy lol</li>
            <li> The solution clear all bumps.</li>
            <li> Tend Skin really clear it up almost immediately.</li>
            <li> It also seems to help clear up redness around the neck area.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait for it to clear off.</li>
            <li> I used it to clear some razor bumps on my legs.</li>
            <li> my neck remains clear,</li>
            <li> I gave this a whirl to clear up</li>
            <li> (maybe 20 years by now?), sometimes for ingrown hairs, but mostly to clear blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Helped clear up razor burn as advertised.</li>
            <li> If you mixed this yourself you would have a much cheaper approximation.</li>
            <li> By far it helps with the bumps after shaving or waxing but does not help or stop ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> And the old ones are healing.  </li>
            <li> It does take time to get results so you must use frequently.</li>
            <li> This product has completely stopped any razor burn on my bikini area.  </li>
            <li> Tend Skin far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> It has made my ingrown hair/irritation problem nearly nonexistent.  </li>
            <li> Do not use if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> A side benefit is that it exfoliates dead skin and leaves skin smooth.</li>
            <li> After reading all of the reviews, I was very hopeful I would get the same result.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get razor burn on the inside of my thighs near my bikini line in the summer.</li>
            <li> It does feel like putting straight rubbing alcohol on razor burn but it only stings for 3 seconds.</li>
            <li> but if you have sensitive skin then be prepared</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and had given up hope that anything could help.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely eliminated the problem of ingrown hairs that I used to get after shaving.  </li>
            <li> Just, WOW.... My underarms have cleared up dramatically.</li>
            <li> My skin is so sensitive to shaving</li>
            <li> Cleans and prevents debris from accumulating in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I notice that bumps near my bikini line have diminished, they have not fully gone away but are not what they use to look like.  </li>
            <li> It really helped reduce bumps and ingrown hairs without causing extra irritation or drying the skin out.</li>
            <li> Works really fast too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a couple months ago and it&#x27;s now completely gone.</li>
            <li> I apply directly after shaving, plucking those areas.</li>
            <li> I would completely recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I tried all products after seeing a young lady on YouTube talk about this product.</li>
            <li> , it has worked really well for me, I would definitely recommend it&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this every time I shave and so far it has worked well.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> reduces redness completely.</li>
            <li> Just a piece of advice: don&#x27;t use directly after shaving/waxing, as it will irritate the skin.</li>
            <li> My face is far smoother with this stuff, and I never get acne anymore -</li>
            <li> It does what it says it does, it reduces the appearance of ingrown hairs, but if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This solved the problem completely.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried darn near everything.  </li>
            <li> I dont have to use TEND SKIN as much under my arms as I do my bikini area, because the last thing I want is Razor Bumps in my bikini area</li>
            <li> Stay away from sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have had no problems with it.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used this product for years and as a skin care professional (esthetician)</li>
            <li> I have not yet completely licked the problem because I forget to use it.</li>
            <li> and I have no complaints so far.</li>
            <li> that just wouldn&#x27;t go away, no matter how old I got.</li>
            <li> this is the only product that really works for razor bumps</li>
            <li> it is caused by clogged pores blocking the natural outward flow of skin fluids which contain bacteria.</li>
            <li> If you apply it with a cotton swab to each sore after washing the area with a gentle anti-bacterial cleanser the swelling will recede with will cause the pores to open and the infection to be released from the pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I compared it to my old bottle.</li>
            <li> I have very course hair (Italian)</li>
            <li> My esthetician that does waxing recommended this to me years ago, and its a must-have for folks with sensitive skin, or who develop razor-burn.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works as instructed; I used it after shaving in the morning and again at night on the irritated area, and in about five days the razor burn was almost completely gone.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered from razor burn and razor bumps all of my adult life.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that this does what it claims to.  </li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My skin is just sensitive to shaving for some reason, and &amp;#34;Tend Skin&amp;#34; has the word, tend in the name, so I figured perhaps</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and had tried a lot of things to help get rid of the razor burn that I get when shaving.</li>
            <li> Using the Tend Skin Care Solution with the Air Gel leaves my face smooth and with few razor bumps and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> The cream the doctor prescribed (Ziana), applied nightly, has almost completely resolved my ingrown hair/razor bump situation.</li>
            <li> I can not say this product worked with my sensitive skin when it comes to razor burn.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how well it worked.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t get rid out my razor bumps completely but basically cleared about 98% of them.</li>
            <li> When I was doing research on how to shave legs, I someone said that any old razor would do.</li>
            <li> A no go for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Its worth every penny spent on it.</li>
            <li> A few uses in I definitely noticed an improvement in my skin, however it was not as magical as others made it seem.</li>
            <li> I use expensive razors and good shave cream.</li>
            <li> i am not dramatizing in any way my bums are dissapearing and blemishes are slowly but surely dissapearing</li>
            <li> I still get an occasional one or two razor bumps every few months, but that&#x27;s far better success than any other product gave me.  </li>
            <li> I only use it right after I shave, and as the hair grows back in</li>
            <li> The little bit of sting it toally worth it!  </li>
            <li> No dark spots or in grown hairs there anymore ( something I&#x27;ve suffered with for over 10 years)!</li>
            <li> After other products that really did not work, this product really helped alot.</li>
            <li> Just super strong astringent that&#x27;s expensive</li>
            <li> Really glad my buddy referred it to me for my neck bump issues: Definitely begins the drying process in as little as 48 hours!</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned with very thick coarse black hair.</li>
            <li> Will sting a little when first applied after shaving but cools &amp; sooths fast.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it maybe 4 days, but the hard, darker exterior is flaking off to reveal healthy, new skin underneath already.  </li>
            <li> and im a young latin american male, but my skin is more comparable to an african american male.  </li>
            <li> OK I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> I had given up and told myself that I would get hair removal treatment when I got older ( im only 23) .</li>
            <li> and now that I&#x27;m older, I totally understand the benefits.</li>
            <li> I will likely continue searching for a more natural alternative, but this is my one vice, my one exception to the rule because it alleviates so much pain, itching, ugliness, shame, and emotional distress for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been razor bump free since I started shaving (being a dark haired italian) until discovering this product.</li>
            <li> I shave my head, and I used to get razor bumps, particularly on the back of my head.  </li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m going to spend a decent amount of money to fix my ingrown hair problem, I&#x27;ll put it towards a product that actually works.</li>
            <li> It actually started working after the first week of regular application.</li>
            <li> After the first night I applied this, I saw instant results the next day!</li>
            <li> It definitely has a drying affect, as isopropyl alcohol is one of the main ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I have major sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I had such high expectations.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to you if you have similar issues</li>
            <li> Next time I will check if a product contains a high percentage of alcohol.</li>
            <li> A little on a 2x2 gauze right after shaving in the morning (on dry skin), and right at night before I go to bed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have incredibly sensitive skin and thick hair and am easily irritated by shaving and skin products.  </li>
            <li> Plus the prices on Amazon are usually about 50% cheaper than the drugstore prices for this product which is a huge savings.</li>
            <li> &quot; I&#x27;ve never been able to shave my bikini area more than once a week because the day after I ALWAYS have ugly, red bumps.</li>
            <li> The product works very well as long as you use it as directed.</li>
            <li> I am African American, so I have a greater tendency to get razor bumps around my neck when I shave due to my hairs curling back into the skin.</li>
            <li> With this product it keeps my face just right, not too dry but enough not to make it too oily.</li>
            <li> , it stung tremendously and it burned a little, if you are using this for your legs</li>
            <li> I use in conjunction with Cortizone and aloe vera to calm skin down.</li>
            <li> This is primarily alcohol and does help dry out some of the bumps, but  I have found it does little to prevent new ones.  </li>
            <li> This seem to affect black men more than any other race.</li>
            <li> I continued to follow the practice of shaving after showering or at least giving my pores a chance to open up first before shaving and using TendSkin right after, that is, until one day when I was in a rush and forgot to do so completely.</li>
            <li> and it also doesn&#x27;t dry the skin out as much.</li>
            <li> too much use will make your skin dry out.  </li>
            <li> leaves the skin bit dry but works really well.</li>
            <li> Didnt really do anything for me except sting, make my face smell like rubbing alcohol and dry it out.</li>
            <li> and if you apply too much the skin on your neck will peel a bit later in the day and leave white stuff on your collar like you have dandruff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used that has helped clear my skin back up, and trust me I have tried damn near EVERYTHING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It burns slightly after a fresh shave, but will prevent and treat</li>
            <li> Not excellent but good enough</li>
            <li> I think it has helped reduce razor burn, but I have very sensitive skin and didn&#x27;t see the total elimination that others reported.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after only one week of using the product, and after 3 weeks everything cleared up completely!</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this product years ago when I was getting bikini waxes every other month.  </li>
            <li> The very first time I ordered it, it did take a few applications for my skin to adjust.</li>
            <li> Tend Skin is the ONLY product I have tried that not only eases the burn and itch of ingrown hair, but prevents them from starting in the first place.</li>
            <li> First of all, it&#x27;s really expensive - and really easy to make yourself (cheaper) according to my sister who is in pharmacy school.  </li>
            <li> BUT if the smell is really that much of an issue for you, I would either only shave at night and put this on before bed, OR I would recommend trying Barc Bump down razor relief</li>
            <li> Little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> It does sting a little, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> may seem a little pricey to some, but it is worth every penny if you have a problem with ingrown hairs like myself.</li>
            <li> this is a hidden little secret that should be on top shelves everywhere!!!</li>
            <li> After it clears, use once daily to keep it clear.</li>
            <li> This is ridiculously expensive for what you&#x27;re buying - try the cheap route first.</li>
            <li> I generally am strict about using only completely natural beauty products.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that completely knocked it out</li>
            <li> If this product didn&#x27;t completely eliminate ingrown hairs then it was because I probably didn&#x27;t use it often enough.</li>
            <li> I am extremely sensitive to mosquito bites and nothing has helped -- not hydrocortisone, nor commercial remedies.  </li>
            <li> I expected nothing, and got so much.</li>
            <li> My coarse hair or sensitive skin is prone/vulneralbe to ingrown hair and razor burns.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> I barely have any ingrown hairs anymore...</li>
            <li> seriously, barely ANY ingrowns.  </li>
            <li> Apparently after I bought this, my skin decided it wanted to behave.  </li>
            <li> very well - use it every so often (when i remember to) and absolutely no ingrown hairs or razor bumps</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t immediately completely get rid of ingrown hairs, but it definitely starts the healing process.</li>
            <li> the things that I have been using to stop my legs from itching, this barely stung.  </li>
            <li> Not trying to sell anything here, but as a 26-year old A.A. male, this is a product I continue to use once or twice a day.</li>
            <li> I bought this for ingrown hairs that suddenly developed in the last year or two.</li>
            <li> Started using daily in early Sept.</li>
            <li> Since purchasing a Gillete Fusion Proglide, ingrown hairs have completely disappeared, except on my upper thighs, which are extra sensitive anyways.</li>
            <li> The product does burn on freshly shaved skin so wait a few hours before putting it on.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed that after using this for a few months I rarely even get razor burn anymore.  </li>
            <li> If this wasn&#x27;t considered a hazardous material and unable to be returned, I would return this item immediately.</li>
            <li> You only need a little and the results can be seen rather quickly.</li>
            <li> It was used by a young black male, who has pretty severe razor bumps and ingrown hairs on his face.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s used too much it will cause even teenage skin to dry out and peel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been able to get my daily shave down to about 5 minutes from the 30 minutes using my previous methods.  </li>
            <li> Literally the next day, I woke up and my ingrown hair acne decreased significantly, like SOOO MUCH.</li>
            <li> Instead, I found Skin Tight locally and tried it, again, without success.  </li>
            <li> I was really hoping this would work as some other people have suggested.  </li>
            <li> When shaved my legs usually get hair bumps within the second day, and by applying this liquid of my skin twice daily my legs are feeling smoother and bumps free.</li>
            <li> Smells very much like alcohol, and its also a little too watery.</li>
            <li> and I used it for two weeks twice a day and saw not a single improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> This products works amazingly well, but you have to keep up with it everyday (at least I do) in order keeps the bumps under control.</li>
            <li> but so far I&#x27;m only using it on a very tiny portion of my face.</li>
            <li> I recently found a make your own version on line and decided to give that a try on a weird bumpy ingrown hair patch on my leg from waxing.  </li>
            <li> The odor was so intolerable that I used it only a few times and decided it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> But most recently I got so tired of razor irritation &amp; the bumps that follows it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve rarely had to use it a second day, because the blemish is dried up from two applications.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does work a little better than just plain alcohol.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous at first because the reviews are hit or miss</li>
            <li> Burns slightly when you first put it on but definitely works well.</li>
            <li> The alcohol and aspirin kill bacteria and several humectants work to extract moisture from the epidermis and the general atmosphere or environment.  </li>
            <li> In general, I don&#x27;t recommend this product because it doesn&#x27;t work well enough to warrant the steep price tag.</li>
            <li> Do be aware that dead skin may peel away though.</li>
            <li> No, but the scent dissipates very quickly and your reward is bump-free skin after using this for just a few days, with none of the itching that typically accompanies regrowth after shaving.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve kept the empty bottle, and will compare labels with the new bottle when it arrives tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used that frequently, it does seem to dry my skin, but not unmanageably so.  </li>
            <li> If you are a black guy or someone with very curly hair</li>
            <li> It has a slight burn like alcohol but if you don&#x27;t touch it you&#x27;ll be fine after a few seconda</li>
            <li> Can be applied twice daily for faster results on problem areas and this product does not dry your skin out like alcohol.  </li>
            <li> Beware, it can sting a little in certain areas if you have shaved too close.&lt;br</li>
            <li> especially if you&#x27;re a black man/ woman take it from me, this stuff works real talk.</li>
            <li> I used two full bottles of tend skin as I wanted to give it enough time to really get through several layers of skin, but unfortunately it just didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> but after those hellish two months and a year of trying to make dry brushing followed by moisturizing with oils,sugar scrubs, and witch hazel work, I broke down and decided I should revisit Tend Skin - especially since I&#x27;d paid a pretty penny for it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little scared to leave this review for fear of jinxing the whole thing.</li>
            <li> Good stuff; a little on the expensive side.</li>
            <li> This product has significantly reduced the incidence of new ingrown hair but unfortunately nothing it has not relieved those already beneath the skin.</li>
            <li> You put it on the ingrown hair LUMPS (thats pretty much what I have, it is pretty bad...)</li>
            <li> Smells Bad, but great in every other way.</li>
            <li> This product confused me because the bottle looked a bit different than the original product.</li>
            <li> This &#x27;little wonder drug&#x27; seem to live up to the reputation!</li>
            <li> (That was actually disappointing because Skin Tight made a remarkable difference for some of my friends--male and female--but not for me.)  </li>
            <li> already no itching/irritation and those big bumps have gone down significantly so far!</li>
            <li> I use it frequently as it was recommended to me and I would recommend it to other people.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They aren&#x27;t completely gone, but extreme reduction in frequency and severity.</li>
            <li> The only thing is it took a long time to and it dried out my skin, but other than that, it does exactly as described!</li>
            <li> I loved the results but hated the high price ($38/50pads).</li>
            <li> We tried high tech razors and they helped a little, but not until he tried tend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black female, 22 yrs old and in the last year I&#x27;ve tried almost anything ie:</li>
            <li> I am currently having laser hair removal and still get ingrown because it takes A LONG time for the hair to stop growing back.  </li>
            <li> It really helps remove the unsightly bumps and the little freckles caused by nicks during shaving!</li>
            <li> I also can&#x27;t shave everyday, so I mix this product with High times bumper stopper 2.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend if you have trouble after shaving &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> However, the high alcohol content makes this stuff HARSH.</li>
            <li> Not only did I notice the razor bumps to be gone in as little as 24 hours, but it was not harsh on my skin and is simple to use.</li>
            <li> Im a 26 year old black male.  </li>
            <li> Since I started using this, ingrown hairs have decreased immensely and when I do get one they go away quickly after usin Tend Skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My waxer recommended this to me to clear up some dark spots from</li>
            <li> I remember using this is the past and getting fast results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it made much of a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I am a woman with a long hairline, and have a short haircut, so my neck requires a close shave with a razor.  </li>
            <li> A little pain for little to no razor bumps is worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I have very sensative skin when I shave my face, usually my face goes from being dry to being oily later in the day.</li>
            <li> This product really works for extremely well for black men.  </li>
            <li> This product is only slightly above par a myriad of other personal care products, it works, but don&#x27;t expect a miracle.</li>
            <li> Also it has a harsh sting when applied to newly shaven skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, the smell really isn&#x27;t that bad if you use it correctly, and it&#x27;s nothing that can&#x27;t be covered with some cheap cologne/perfume.</li>
            <li> BLACK PEOPLE OR ANYONE WITH SENSITIVE SKIN -</li>
            <li> (?) I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m bothered enough by the \\&quot;side effect\\&quot; to stop using the product; after all, better to have an artificial accidental \\&quot;tan\\&quot; than razor bumps and abcesses....</li>
            <li> The only thing this product did was dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> I am a Black Hispanic with mildly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It does dry your skin, so I used it with a facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African-American male, fairly dark skin (about the same complexion as Denzel Washington) that developed a dark patch just to the left of my lips.  </li>
            <li> The only annoyance was the brief odor that lingers when wet, after applying.</li>
            <li> definitely recommend this product for both men and women who have trouble with razor bumps/burns or have sensitive skin.o</li>
            <li> definitely recommend this product for both men and women who have trouble with razor bumps/burns or have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> After finally deciding to try it out I saw a slight improvement, but it&#x27;s nothing major.</li>
            <li> i am very happpy and use it regularly (the bottle lasts a long time as you only need a very small amount)</li>
            <li> My process is simple, shave at night with a single blade disposable razor, follow it with tend skin all over my face.   </li>
            <li> African American male using for dark spots and decrease irritation from shaving</li>
            <li> After using it just a few days, it&#x27;s nearly gone!  </li>
            <li> I have very coarse, curly hair, so I am constantly getting ingrown hairs and other issues when I shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> price is a little higher than I would like to pay, but a little goes a long ways</li>
            <li> Definitely a staple for me until I bite the bullet and get laser hair removal every single place that I can!</li>
            <li> , I read the instructions, did what it said, used it day and night, I was amazed by this product, it really works, it might be a little expensive but its worth a try.</li>
            <li> Not only did I not get results, when I first used it, my skin flared up and looked pretty bad</li>
            <li> I had been contemplating a wax for a while (more specifically a brazilian wax), but I kept putting it off afraid of how my skin would react.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had ingrown hair for a long time</li>
            <li> I have struggled w/ ingrown hairs for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;s suppose to take to start working though.</li>
            <li> Wish I had found this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> As long as it keeps working, I&#x27;ll never be without it.</li>
            <li> and I wish I would&#x27;ve found this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working so far, just have to wait a few months and see if it will keep working</li>
            <li> saw immediate results with this and reduced my ingrowns to minimal with prolonged and regular use.</li>
            <li> so long as I have to shave I will use this.</li>
            <li> Hair bumps are not nearly as severe.</li>
            <li> Long time user of this product.</li>
            <li> I found that strange and it burned at times&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> It doesnt take long to see results.</li>
            <li> listed ingredients are the same as the list on the empty bottle</li>
            <li> Definitely read the directions carefully.</li>
            <li> It just takes too long to work.  </li>
            <li> I will continue using this as long as they carry it.</li>
            <li> I use this on my bikini area and underarms at least 2 times daily when I first begin treatment and then down to once a day for maintainence.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is one of the only products (next to Barc Bump Down)</li>
            <li> It keeps the skin on his face and neck, baby smooth no more razor burns, no more pain or ingrown hairs!</li>
            <li> I started noticing less ingrowns within a week, and four weeks later when I made my regular trip to see my esthetician, she asked me what I had been doing</li>
            <li> Works well and last long but does burn when applied unlike some other brands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but a little goes a long way--one bottle for me and my daughters lasts more than a year.</li>
            <li> The smell is not very pleasant, and the glycerine film after the dry-down make it unsuitable as a \\&quot;toner\\&quot; but it is probably not intended for daily or frequent use.  </li>
            <li> If I had bought the same thing at a hair salon, I would&#x27;ve spent about 50 bucks!</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars is due to the smell/fumes.</li>
            <li> In talking with other friends, I learned  several of my friends are familar and use this product.  </li>
            <li> Although it says to use day and night, I started using it only after shaving (every other day or so) and still works.</li>
            <li> My husband uses it after every shave and although he&#x27;s tried other brands, he keeps coming back to Tend Skin.  </li>
            <li> I have found that it is cheapest either on Amazon or at WalMart; I noticed that other stores such as Target and Walgreens charge anywhere from $16.99 - $18.99 for the 4oz.</li>
            <li> I have found that it is cheapest either on Amazon or at WalMart; I noticed that other stores such as Target and Walgreens charge anywhere from $16.99 - $18.99 for the 4oz.</li>
            <li> cream is the only other product I&#x27;ve used that works to remove and prevent razor bumps.</li>
            <li> As long as she continues to use it, the bumps stay away!</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;ll be a long time fan!</li>
            <li> I tried some other products before finally visiting a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with this problem for a very long time.</li>
            <li> This product can dry out the skin and can cause peeling.  </li>
            <li> Use moisturizer though, it will dry your skin.</li>
            <li> I dab it on immediately after I rinse and dry</li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s dry you can&#x27;t smell it anymore.</li>
            <li> Note that it contains a lot of alcohol, so it will dry your face out.</li>
            <li> Any product that contains alcohol somewhat  will dry out the bumps but harden the skin.</li>
            <li> Must be used with cotton balls on dry skin.</li>
            <li> noticed my skin started to dry up</li>
            <li> You need the moisturizer because this will dry your skin out.</li>
            <li> dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Several minutes after the area is dry, I apply a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Beware, it does dry out your skin</li>
            <li> It did nothing but dry out my skin</li>
            <li> So, let it dry all the way after application</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re razor bumps really aren&#x27;t that serious of a condition (in terms of amount of bumps and the size of the bumps)</li>
            <li> I question whether this is an imitation Tend Skin, since the labeling was slightly different.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The secret is to shave ONLY with the grain and use a safety razor or straight.</li>
            <li> No new ingrown hairs have grown on my face.  </li>
            <li> Will never live without it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terrible though, the worst is right after shaving.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and get harsh painful razor burn and ingrown hairs that cover my legs from top to bottom, and this product did not a thing to reduce any of it.</li>
            <li> Suggestions for using Tend Skin:  1) Pour a small amount of the product directly onto the affected area, and spread the product with a brush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Because I had hyperpigmentation from old ingrown scars I also use a few other exfoliation methods in conjunction with Tend Skin.</li>
            <li> I wish there was a product that clears up dark spots instantly.</li>
            <li> Only concern is nail polish, it kinda ruins your mani so use those locking dental clips scissors, hemastats (sp?)</li>
            <li> I was amazed, not only did it remove the pimples from my chest , it took away the dark spots as well .</li>
            <li> I was annoyed at first but figured they&#x27;d go away eventually.</li>
            <li> 23 y/o white male with course thick blonde hair.</li>
            <li> It stopped after a few minutes and it was so barely noticeable</li>
            <li> Perhaps this is just my experiences, but all it did for me was dry my skin up really bad, due to the alcohol which must be present (obvious by the strong smell).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> No other issues, no irritation, no peeling like I have read on some reviews, no strong smell that irritates my nose or eyes.</li>
            <li> but then my skin calms down and the red bumps and swelling improve.  </li>
            <li> I switched waxing salons, I went in and happened to have a cyst down there (which had only happened once before).</li>
            <li> It smells pretty bad (like straight rubbing alcohol)</li>
            <li> This stuff smells pretty bad and doesn&#x27;t really do anything.  </li>
            <li> unbelievable improvement in my constant battle with in-grown facial hair.  </li>
            <li> My razor bumps have definitely become less on my legs since using it.  </li>
            <li> I have also noticed a reduction in in grown hairs, and I waxed yesterday, but this on afterwards, and woke up this morning with only some slight redness.</li>
            <li> And you definitely want to get the roll on applicator, which is sold separately to help with applying and to prevent evaporation by putting only small amounts at a time in the applicator.</li>
            <li> Well I am still on my same 16oz Bottle I purchased months ago (its half way done), and I use my cotton balls along with this stuff after ever shave once or 2x</li>
            <li> awhile my big (half used)16 oz bottle of TEND SKIN has been sitting on my Vanity with \\&quot;occassional\\&quot; usage.</li>
            <li> Half way in it bout to subscribe on my next bottle  </li>
            <li> I am a black male &amp; I used to get razor bumps after every shave.</li>
            <li> I usually could only find this product online and with the product cost and shipping it almost came to double what I would pay if found in the stores.  </li>
            <li> I bought a 16 ounce bottle at discount only to find that the product had less than three months until expiration date.  </li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re going to be in the house forget the lotion I recommend lotion when going out because it leave white mark and make your face a little dry</li>
            <li> It stings a little and it smells really bad (like most astringents), but it works and the smell doesn’t last very long after application.</li>
            <li> it does work your suppose to use only a little dab</li>
            <li> , you really only need a LITTLE bit at a time, so no need to slap it on like after-shave, besides it</li>
            <li> My legs have never been smoother after shaving and I also noticed that hair tends to grow back a little slower than before.</li>
            <li> It only takes a little bit of the product to take care of it so well.</li>
            <li> Use this after time I shave my bikini line to prevent those little red bumps.</li>
            <li> but it doesnt dry your skin out like other alcohol smelling cosmetics.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair and get ingrown hairs every single time I remove hair-</li>
            <li> I now shave every other day with a single blade razor, Aveno shave cream and put this on my problem areas with a cotton swab afterwards.</li>
            <li> On top of that, i now believe that what i used to think was bad acne (mostly on the cheeks and neck) was also connected to bad razor bumps as well.  </li>
            <li> it is not effective at all, i had expected it to be good after reading all the reviews, smells bad too</li>
            <li> This is great on the worst in grown hairs!</li>
            <li> However, it isn&#x27;t a painful sting, it&#x27;s more like a &amp;#34;it&#x27;s working&amp;#34; sting.</li>
            <li> a day along my bikini line and groin area (thats where the ugly shaving bumps come, &amp; there is nothing more embarassing to myself to see that along with the irritation and itching that comes along with shaving).</li>
            <li> This stuff is an amazing product, stop wasting your money on stuff from Walmart &#x27;cause none of that crap</li>
            <li> This product eliminates those tiny razor bumps you get around the neck area that make your face look like freshly plucked chicken</li>
            <li> and you have to be careful of the burning and pain.  </li>
            <li> Never use it on wet skin.</li>
            <li> The only bump stuff thay works, dint waste your money on imitations, this is the one to buy.</li>
            <li> I definitely notice a difference when I run out and stop using it for a few days.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not real.</li>
            <li> After a few days of applying twice daily like the directions said, it cleared it up.</li>
            <li> I tried this years and years ago and it was useful but SO expensive.  </li>
            <li> Do to military</li>
            <li> I hope that continuing using this product I can feel the result as I expected.</li>
            <li> If then I have exhausted all avenues and absolutely can&#x27;t find anything like this than I will probably cave and buy this again.</li>
            <li> It took a few weeks of solid dedication to this....</li>
            <li> Just what I had expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years now, and I use it twice daily.</li>
            <li> though so i recommend that you be careful</li>
            <li> money well spent.</li>
            <li> This does not really work.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had issues with razor bumps &amp; burns going on five years, never really finding a product thst works.</li>
            <li> Would&#x27;ve gave it five stars if it got rid of ALL my bumps on the back of my neck, but still a few (3-4) remain.</li>
            <li> I use this once a day now (be careful not to use too often and scrub too vigorously in the shower- it can start to irritate your skin) along with moisturizer.</li>
            <li> this product works well but be careful...</li>
            <li> Ingrown hair has been minimal and this clears up</li>
            <li> This is not really Trend Skin.</li>
            <li> a few months before I finally bit the bullet and purchased it.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is sort of expensive, but in my opinion, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Rubbed this on the back of my neck for bumps and within a  few days bumps were gone.</li>
            <li> Now I can let my facial hair grow for a few days &amp; not shave every day.</li>
            <li> have spent plenty on razor burn products</li>
            <li> The sting is minimal and some how lasts longer for relief on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I am curious to see whether they continue to be non-existent with just using it after haircuts and shaves.</li>
            <li> I wish this was around when I was in the military.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product at the military exchange mall.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Amazon refuses to carry Bump Patrol directly for some reason, so it&#x27;s either get it from a local store or get ripped off by a third party marketplace seller.  </li>
            <li> When it didn&#x27;t, and irritated my razor bumps worse than they already were, I realized that this product is made up of mostly alcohol and witch hazel, which are both extremely irritating to skin.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work and irritated my skin, actually made it worse as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>
            <li> Also, made my skin dry!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical at first since one reviewer previously said \\&quot;you can get the same affect with alcohol\\&quot;, which I&#x27;d already tried.  </li>
            <li> It is the same product for half the price!</li>
            <li> It is a little expensive, but I promise it is worth it!</li>
            <li> It has helped immensely with razor burn and in grown hairs in awkward spots - just remember never to apply right after shaving or waxing, or on any area that is already irritated or cut...</li>
            <li> Burns like crazy if you apply it right after a wax but gets easier in the days following.</li>
            <li> plain and simple.</li>
            <li> I used to get really bad bumps around my bikini line, but ever since starting this there has been a significant change.</li>
            <li> It is not a strong smell but enough that he doesn&#x27;t want to use it.</li>
            <li> If you use it every day, your skin will get very dry and might peel!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but worth it - and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> But seriously, this is the only product that has ever worked for me, finally.</li>
            <li> I like to keep myself closely shaven, so I shave roughly about every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First off, to all those saying it&#x27;s too expensive, it&#x27;s really not if you use it correctly!&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many others that cost less but did not work and were actually rejected by my skin as toxins - what happens when you feed the body&#x27;s largest organ with crap.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately a majority of its composition seems to be alcohol, and the smell and drying nature of this discourages such regular use - at least for some people (I certainly wouldn&#x27;t want to put it on my face).</li>
            <li> I can finally shave down there everyday or two days versus once a week.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Tend Skin on it (a little goes a long way)</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and one bottle lasts forever.  </li>
            <li> There is a slight stinging if you use directly after shaving, but I hardly notice now.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I had a few drops left of the 4 oz bottle&lt;br /&gt;from a previous beauty store purchase.</li>
            <li> I use it just as instructed and even listened to advice from other reviews but nada.</li>
            <li> Even extremely stubborn ingrowns will be extracted by Tend Skin.</li>
            <li> So when I first got the product, I was skeptical because it literally smells like nail polish remover and vodka, but I decided to go for it.</li>
            <li> I tried this based on other reviews here.  </li>
            <li> (I have an extremely severe case) and</li>
            <li> No more red bumps!</li>
            <li> but other areas have seemed to have a effect.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviews..</li>
            <li> I bought this due to redness and bumps on my bikini line.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never spend a dime on any other product.</li>
            <li> I have been plagued by ingrown hairs on my bikini line due to this combo for years.</li>
            <li> Also works for other scrapes and skin irritations</li>
            <li> I get lazy using it regularly</li>
            <li> Ever since I started using it, I have no more red bumps!</li>
            <li> I do it again with the other end of the Q-Tip.  </li>
            <li> Do not purchase from amazon.com or anyone other than TendSkin themselves.</li>
            <li> at Beauty Brands or other places offering salon products.  </li>
            <li> No more red bumps!</li>
            <li> This is my go-to product for razor burns and other shaving/</li>
            <li> the other ingredients I guess make it sticky, anyway, after 2 times I could feel the difference</li>
            <li> I started using this morning after shaving and night before bed combined with an every other day exfolliating sugar scrub and my bumps and itching are gone.</li>
            <li> Then reverted to &amp;#34;in transit&amp;#34; and now the agent told me she is not sure about whereabouts of the package.&lt;br /&gt;Frustrated, i looked for this product at a local store CHEAPER than what i paid for it.</li>
            <li> no body not ganna be looking in your face other than family members you get the point</li>
            <li> the life of me, I don&#x27;t know what the other listed ingredients smell like, so don&#x27;t know if ingredients have changed or are missing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This has lasted longer than any other product I have tried, even the ones specializing in women&#x27;s bikini areas.  </li>
            <li> is the price for what it is, is just alcohol with some other stuff, a alcohol bottle can cost like 2 dollars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some trouble of the last few months with ingrown hairs and did some research as what to do.</li>
            <li> My son gets red bumps all over his back and behind from wearing sports equipment and sweating.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to give this stuff 5 stars, but the smell is so harsh and caustic that I practically need to hold my breath while using it.</li>
            <li> tried a couple of other products not worth mentioning.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my secret to staying young while all my friends look like they&#x27;ve been chain-smoking marlboros for years!</li>
            <li> so when I shave my bikini are it usually gets really red and icky but this definitely helped not to mention I haven&#x27;t gotten any ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> Careful though, with excessive use it can lead to dry, chemically burned skin.</li>
            <li> My legs are covered in ingrown hairs that are at the very least a decade old.</li>
            <li> Her salon gal has also recommended other, less astringent stuff.</li>
            <li> After about 8 or 9 treatments and three different types of lasers and hardly noticeable improvement,</li>
            <li> Not cheap, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Huge ugly bumps that would make my shaving a nightmare.</li>
            <li> Just not worth it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had already used the whole bottle before I noticed.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my friend because she complained about razor bumps by her \\&quot;private area\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the price.</li>
            <li> I had at least ten ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> A big bottle lasts me at least a year, and I use it often.</li>
            <li> I would get at least one ingrown hair every time I shaved that would last for weeks or months.</li>
            <li> When I use it my only complaint is the bathroom smells like chemicals for an hour after.</li>
            <li> I tried it out and it was definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Someone recommended it and after seeing how much it was, I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> From razor burns to ingrown hairs to fading dark spots  </li>
            <li> I read at least 40 reviews before I actually ordered this (and majority were the 2 star and 1 star reviews).  </li>
            <li> Especially for someone who sucks ass at shaving like me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also read that it&#x27;s not meant to lighten dark spots, but my dark spots are starting to slowly fade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m african with thick curly hair</li>
            <li> It makes them worse not better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, instead of putting it on a cotton pad, put the product directly onto the skin.</li>
            <li> I get very bad ingrown hairs and irritation due to my hair type (blonde and fine).</li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;m down to once a day.</li>
            <li> so I backed it down to once a day after shaving.  </li>
            <li> This got rid  of the hair bumps down there.</li>
            <li> Hands down.</li>
            <li> Tend Skin gets the job done, but what it lacks is the Witch Hazel that is in the No Bump that calms the irritation down.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products and nothing works as well as this!</li>
            <li> After years of trying different products, The Art Of Shaving, skin tight products, etc... and no results, this one gave me hardly any razor bumps or ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> I consider the failure to disclose the close expiration date with the discounted price to be a form of misleading advertising and Amazon should require its vendors to reveal expiration dates in similar situations.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, and am VERY prone to ingrown hairs down there, I was very afraid waxing would irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> After the first time I began cutting back to find the least number of applications required for it to work.</li>
            <li> There is a slight alcohol burn that comes with application, but it does not bother me, just feels like an antiseptic going on</li>
            <li> In less than two weeks, ALL of the ingrown hairs on my scalp are gone.</li>
            <li> The slight annoyance had become unbearable.</li>
            <li> I still have about 5% of ingrowns and there are patches on my legs that are slightly bumpy and prickly.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle, have used half of it, twice a day as directed.</li>
            <li> two and a half ounces witch hazel, twenty-six aspirin.  </li>
            <li> I will admit I still get slight razor burn but</li>
            <li> I am black and I have struggled with razor bumps literally ever since i could remember shaving.</li>
            <li> I can tell a slight difference.</li>
            <li> I see less bumps than before</li>
            <li> Apply it using the method I previously mentioned on any area that you shave.</li>
            <li> Helps with ingrown hairs slightly</li>
            <li> the less it stings.</li>
            <li> It is 17 dollars for half the amount at walgreens.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s half the price, I should just buy two to keep one for a backup.</li>
            <li> Less redness, less bumps, and less regrowth itching.</li>
            <li> Splash on a cotton ball after shaving on your neckline and the slight tingle will let you know it works.</li>
            <li> , all the black spots apache seems to have disappeared.</li>
            <li> Took a gamble on Tend Skin for nearly half the price &amp; have been amazed at the results.</li>
            <li> I noticed results in less than two weeks.</li>
            <li> Anything less is inappropriate.</li>
            <li> Less frequency of application, lasts longer.  </li>
            <li> My doctor told me to put Neosporin on it, but that didn&#x27;t get rid of the ingrown, or bring down the swelling or pain even just a little bit.</li>
            <li> Seems not worth the trouble</li>
            <li> I was a mess....</li>
            <li> and I had just had a waxing done that left me battling HORRIBLE ingrown hairs for two whole months, even when I completely stopped shaving in hopes to let everything heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> aloe Vera gel, lemon juice, vinegar juice, cucumber paste, coconut oil, Shea butter, exfoliating, even skin tight wouldn&#x27;t help me.</li>
            <li> I did a comparison with the B&amp;C Skin Tight and the tend skin product.  </li>
            <li> have been using TendSkin for about four years now and it has allowed me to focus on clearing away the dark spots and blemishes left behind by my previous razor bumps.</li>
            <li> Waste of money and now I have to find some other product to help get rid of the scars this stuff left behind.</li>
            <li> And I think it uses less product to roll it on because ALL of it goes on your skin - none is wasted in the cotton ball or pad.</li>
            <li> Just use a little and you&#x27;ll see results in five days.</li>
            <li> With Tend Skin a little dab on a cotton ball is all it takes.</li>
            <li> A little experimenting</li>
            <li> It does burn a little on contact with the skin</li>
            <li> with little improvement at all.</li>
            <li> I was a little unsure if it would work or not</li>
            <li> It also tingles a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I still do have a little redness</li>
            <li> It stings a little, but it is something that you can get used to.</li>
            <li> $10 for a little tube and did little for the irritation.  </li>
            <li> eh...only a little.</li>
            <li> on my off days, when I don&#x27;t shave, I&#x27;ll still apply a little TENDSKIN after washing my face before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like this product, but it does sting for a little while when you apply it</li>
            <li> A little over a week using this</li>
            <li> tried using store bought stuff for years (bikini zone and bump patrol) and even wasted money on a Kiehl&#x27;s treatment all with little to no results.  </li>
            <li> After years of effort and disappointment I really wasn&#x27;t expecting any results.</li>
            <li> He has sensitive skin and gets big painful razor bumps.  </li>
            <li> This always gets rid of my bumps in a few hours.</li>
            <li> Just a few times after I shave -- which is not every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> no problems if you use it everyday.</li>
            <li> To prevent that, apply lotion/cream/oil once the Tend Skin has dried.</li>
            <li> Few people suggested Tend Skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the drugstore products and wasted a ton of money.</li>
            <li> Works just have to be patient and give it a few days</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> Wasted funds</li>
            <li> Now I have two bottles and a wasted $20.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say I&#x27;m a heavy sweater</li>
            <li> I shave my bikini area a lot and have always had trouble with bumps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now and cannot tell a difference.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve learned a few things along the way.  </li>
            <li> but I had to use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> It does not work and was just a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> what a waste of money .</li>
            <li> I am not brave enough to use after shaving as it has alcohol and stings!  </li>
            <li> It does have a heavy alcohol smell though.</li>
            <li> and then I put it on a few times after</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not cheap,</li>
            <li> The cotton just soaks up what product and wastes it.</li>
            <li> If I ever get a zit or if I feel one developing, I hold the cotton ball on that spot for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I have used this twice a day for a few days and I already notice the difference.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday on my bikini area and even my underarms.</li>
            <li> , boy let me tell you that after a few weeks of using it my ingrown problems are gone.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I used it each morning and night for a few weeks and now just apply a bit before I sleep every few days or so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a bottle that I use everyday</li>
            <li> Since it is a liquid it can be a bit messy, but it&#x27;s not the end of the world.</li>
            <li> I have trouble rating this product because...</li>
            <li> The biggest problem besides the smell is how messy it is to use and remove from the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tend Skin for a few years now, on the reccommendation from my asthetitan at Paul Mitchell Salon.</li>
            <li> Just plan ahead, I ran out a few days ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this just once a day for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> My daughter sufferers from severe razor burn, but after using Tend Skin as directed, it cleared up in a few days.</li>
            <li> I find that it does help, if I use it everyday, or twice a day.</li>
            <li> You will have to apply this everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days now and have noticed results.  </li>
            <li> I usually just put a few drops on a cotton ball, apply to the infected area, and within hours the swelling goes down and it starts to fade away.</li>
            <li> It appeared watered down (not potent) and didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> If you have very bad razor burn, it won&#x27;t magically disappear after one application</li>
            <li> Especially this last time, my acne was terrible from the hairs popping up, so I decided to order this because of its high reviews.</li>
            <li> did nothing for me...smelled just like alcohol so after no results I threw it away rather just  spray plain alcohol rather than this ...cheaper and probably safer.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for five days and it has already made a dramatic impact.</li>
            <li> All I do is take a small cotton ball, squeeze a little</li>
            <li> and it stung pretty bad every time I applied it.</li>
            <li> It is definitely painful on areas that have been waxed, and has a pretty unsavoy smell that burns the nose.</li>
            <li> I was expecting that I had no more ingrown hair in few days, like a miracle.</li>
            <li> Long before the internet, this stuff was a trade secret amongst dermatologists and hair stylists.  </li>
            <li> have dark, thick, curly hair and it causes ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed I spent a decent amount of money for a product that did not even take effect.</li>
            <li> My bumps went down at least 60%</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no need to buy this expensive product, when a little rubbing alcohol, aspirin and witch hazel does the same thing.</li>
            <li> I have an unfortunately fast grow bikini line and the frequent shaving results in terrible razor</li>
            <li> : It can be harsh such that it makes your skin feel as if it&#x27;s on fire (that passes after 10 minutes), and it can cause surface skin to peel if you get it in the wrong place (like fingers).</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying this product b/c it was recommended by someone on a website, but this product honestly works to keep away those annoying bikini bumps.</li>
            <li> So disappointed due to the high rating this product has.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it during the summer, wish it was less expensive , but still it&#x27;s less expensive tha going to the store for it.</li>
            <li> The stinging sensation takes a little getting used to but hardly bothers me anymore.  </li>
            <li> Also, be very very careful if you have any open cuts from shaving or epilating, because Tend Skin will burn like crazy.</li>
            <li> I see very little difference</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does smell terrible, but if you don&#x27;t use this product because of the smell I kind of don&#x27;t believe your problem is that serious.</li>
            <li> However, since I&#x27;ve been using this stuff every time I shaved and flashed with the IPL, it really hasn&#x27;t been that bad.  </li>
            <li> this stuff really works for unsightly razor bumps, razor burns, and those ugly ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> it just dried out my skin and made the ingrown hairs worse because my hairs were getting trapped under the dried skin.</li>
            <li> After I started using this product everyday, I no longer have problems!  </li>
            <li> During the summer I was constantly shaving and the tend skin saved me because waxing is way too expensive.</li>
            <li> I started getting ingrown hair from past 2 years.</li>
            <li> I should try this on an especially nasty red mosquito bite that was keeping me awake, and several drops on a cotton ball pressed against the bite stopped the itch and reduced the swelling instantly.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say that is the last place any woman would want any \\&quot;unsightliness\\&quot; occurring.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure there is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still skeptical that anything can actually help my legs, but for now it&#x27;s working and for now</li>
            <li> what a waste!</li>
            <li> and I have no more bumps from ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Just put a small amount on a cotton pad and swipe with the growth.</li>
            <li> convenient and noticebly effective,but not magic........</li>
            <li> This product is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> No more razor burns or ingrown</li>
            <li> After a couple of applications, no more razor bumps under my armpits or on my thighs.</li>
            <li> but i think its fake and wont do anything, im upset because i thought finally something that might work</li>
            <li> I was having a lot of trouble after shaving/waxing with ingrown hairs and razor burn in my bikini area and this eliminated them!</li>
            <li> each wax session, but ingrown hairs will be no more.  </li>
            <li> Works unbelievably well.</li>
            <li> Use a small amount to minimize skin peeling.</li>
            <li> No more $40 bikini waxes.</li>
            <li> No more redness AT ALL.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product but after trying it a couple of times, it actually worked.</li>
            <li> I bought other porducts and when i saw Tend Skin i was way skeptical due to its price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does what it says it will do, so no more bumps and ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> No more ingrowns, no more razor burn.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, for the benefits it provides that&#x27;s a small price to pay.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that expensive when I get low I will buy again</li>
            <li> Not completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> bump-free, and no more razor burn!&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> no more ingrown hair</li>
            <li> No more razor burn.  </li>
            <li> I use Tend Skin everyday and no more rash!  </li>
            <li> was annoyed I had to do another thing along with my other routines</li>
            <li> If I do get ingrown hairs they stay very small and are gone within a few days with this stuff...</li>
            <li> It seems like it is a product I would have to use for the long run, and it&#x27;s just too expensive for that.</li>
            <li> In the past I used the Bikini Zone brand, but it was never totally effective.</li>
            <li> I am a white male and have been suffering from bad, painful, sore, red razor bumps on my neck for almost 10 years.</li>
            <li> His face made a dramatic change from painful bumps all over to smooth like a babys behind.  </li>
            <li> I am a black woman and I had such bad razor burn problems</li>
            <li> matter of fact, if you use too much it can dry your skin out terribly and probably make matters</li>
            <li> It is a bit costly and hard to find this product</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m having a hard time getting rid of them.</li>
            <li> Now there are hardly any bumps at all</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding this item.  </li>
            <li> if you have a hard beard or like to shave against the grain to get a closer shave.</li>
            <li> Yes I hardly ever wear deodorant when I use the Tend Skin immediately after application and  </li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and very dark.</li>
            <li> It will kill off all the dead skin on your face - it&#x27;s a little scary.  </li>
            <li> Even when I didn&#x27;t use it every day, it at least reduced the problem.</li>
            <li> I use it at least one a day after showers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a AA female who suffers from severe razor bump to side burn.</li>
            <li> Sucks.  </li>
            <li> and I needed something to at least lessen them in number.</li>
            <li> and I have found it to prevent at least 95% of bumps.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why there are negative reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on testosterone replacement therapy and head and body acne are common issues.</li>
            <li> At least.. i USED to.    </li>
            <li> I have incredibly sensitive skin and shaving or waxing would leave unsightly and sometimes painful bumps for days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a daily user of Tend Skin for over 10 years now, and it is a lifesaver for someone who suffers from razor burn.  </li>
            <li> Isopropyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Acetylsalicylic Acid, Cyclomethicone, Glycerin, Diglycerin, Polysorbate 80.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers who complained or worried that the product smells just like rubbing alcohol, ...&lt;</li>
            <li> But i&#x27;d recommend it others to at least try it.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and fight with razor burn and ingrowns every time I shave.</li>
            <li> I look forward to bikini season now with no more dread of covering up with swim shorts the day after!</li>
            <li> , I randomly got razor burn one day from a razor that wasn&#x27;t as sharp (cartridge razor since then</li>
            <li> Suffer no more!</li>
            <li> (also bikini, if you know what I mean)</li>
            <li> I found this product way too expensive and not worth it.</li>
            <li> I had some serious issues with ingrown hair and it did help.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter has terrible razor burn and rash on her inner thighs and was so embarrassed.  </li>
            <li> You will have serious burning.</li>
            <li> I recently started Epilating because I got such horrible breakouts from shaving.</li>
            <li> I was suffering some serious razor bumps and itching.  </li>
            <li> Just follow instruction on a bottle; it&#x27;s less painful process with epilator and less irritation on the skin after it.</li>
            <li> Costs way too much to end up making you sick!</li>
            <li> bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a black man that has suffered from terrible razor bumps due to wet shaving on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> it prevented future razor burns when I used it with my bad shaving habits.</li>
            <li> If your skin issues are bad enough that you even know about this product then you probably need it.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from really bad razor burn in the bikini area my entire life.</li>
            <li> I have been waxing my legs since I was 12, and then one day I started getting really bad ingrown hairs, The entire hair follicles would swell up to the size of silver dollars almost.</li>
            <li> It definitely lowers the irritation and inflammation, but I guess I have really bad leg scarring because it isn&#x27;t a miracle like everyone claims it is -.-</li>
            <li> For quite a few years now I&#x27;ve had the unfortunate problem of razor bumps/ ingrown hairs and abcesses in my bikini zone.  </li>
            <li> Not good to smell like vodka before work...</li>
            <li> I suffer from red and painful neckline where my collar of any shirt touches my neck.</li>
            <li> I tried everything before this product but still no good results.</li>
            <li> I pat it on razor-burn prone spots after shaving, then again before bed the same night, and I never get painful razor burn.</li>
            <li> well, it did work for me, I use it for the back of my head, I get bumps and besides being painful</li>
            <li> This review  is not fair to the seller.</li>
            <li> This one does not burn or hurt even in those very delicate areas, if you know what I mean.  </li>
            <li> This is NOT a pleasant experience at all..</li>
            <li> The seller is very and unprofessional, rude, and nasty!!!</li>
            <li> My skin was smoother than it ever was; I almost had trouble believing that those were the same legs that I had hated and hid away for all those years.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin very dry, flaky, and generally unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Applying Tend Skin is a very simple way to get rid of those ugly nasty bumps that seem to plague African American/ Black people because of our curly hair textures for Centuries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be aware that it smells terrible</li>
            <li> Next time I went to get waxed, I told them I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it as directed only to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> But only I am disappointed</li>
            <li> So i have very thick hair and lots and lots of razor bumps.    </li>
            <li> What a waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> So i decided to start waxing,, but the ingrown hairs were still there and left a nasty dark spot!</li>
            <li> I shaved my bikini area, applied the product, and have had absolutely no redness, itching, ugly bumps.</li>
            <li> and now im addicted ..i dont get bumps and ingrowns anymore</li>
            <li> Totally a waste and a disappointment.</li>
            <li> After trying this for a week my bumps are worse then ever</li>
            <li> stuff is a game changer.</li>
            <li> It does not work 100% on redness or bumps around my bikini line, but if I don&#x27;t use it then things get much worse.</li>
            <li> I can tell you the razor bumps have decreased and cleared as well</li>
            <li> Eventually, I grew tired of spending the money on this and stopped buying.</li>
            <li> I started off using it every morning and night between each shave (approximately one week).</li>
            <li> Instead of helping, my situation has gotten worse.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a rip-off.</li>
            <li> Some people have complained that it&#x27;s difficult to apply</li>
            <li> Now, i was very skeptical, because my bikini area is DARK because of all the bumps.</li>
            <li> I noticed myself growing annoyed with Tend Skin.  </li>
            <li> Once in a while I get a bad (and by bad I mean deep, red, painful &amp; swollen) ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> The product lessened my razor bumps and itching in delicate areas from horrible to barely there.  </li>
            <li> so I would have it this summer, instead of procrastinating and deal with ugly, embarassing bumps, as typical for me each summer.</li>
            <li> In fact, it gave me a very serious infection.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve consulted websites, forums, magazines, books, etc and the advice is always the same insulting spattering of mere common sense.</li>
            <li> Like i said, i did not want to write this review because i didint want to jinx myself, but i definitely owe it to people who suffer from bad acne and painful ingrown hairs and razor bumps.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not too painful, but if you&#x27;re using this on a small child, they&#x27;ll probably kick and scream.)  </li>
            <li> Removing my leg hair tends to be a useless, pointless and painful endeavor.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!</li>
            <li> i have really bad razor burn so its hard for me to  tell if its working, or have the patience for my legs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not impressed and will not buy again!</li>
            <li> This is a fake product.</li>
            <li> This makes it inefficient and expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d read about Tend Skin, but just dismissed it as another useless serum.</li>
            <li> I get the worst red bumps and ingrowns there, I&#x27;ll  try anything.</li>
            <li> Ill tell you</li>
            <li> /&gt;Witch Hazel to expensive designer products,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> but this is too expensive for me for what you get</li>
            <li> My neck especially would be the worst.  </li>
            <li> I wanted this product to work, but unfortunately it has not.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it hasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I used to have to go to Sephora to buy this; that can be uncomfortable because a lot of the women in there look at you like you&#x27;re a creep for being in there.</li>
            <li> and I was unable to shave again until it cleared.</li>
            <li> It was expensive and</li>
            <li> For what is in this, it should NOT be so expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, but I&#x27;m not embarrassed to wear swimsuits to the beach anymore.</li>
            <li> I used the expensive product from my wax salon and it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Prevents those razor bumps and burns that are so uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I no longer buy expensive creams, lotions or cosmetics, but this is one beauty product I will not do without.</li>
            <li> If you are having problems with razor burn just give this a try, its not overly expensive and truly did help me.</li>
            <li> If shaving is something that can be awful for you, this might actually make it tolerable.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just too expensive there,</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Weird coincidence?</li>
            <li> My ingrowns weren&#x27;t horrible but definitely bothered me.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say that for my shaving issues this was not a help.</li>
            <li> After being asked once by someone &amp;#34;what was wrong with my legs,&amp;#34; I avoided clothing that showed my legs because I was so embarrassed about them.  </li>
            <li> Again, not sure it did anything :(</li>
            <li> that was very irritating since I shave every day and never gave it a break.  </li>
            <li> It burns a little like after shave, but not too bad!</li>
            <li> I have a terrible problem with razor bumps, and from the rave reviews, I expected this to help.</li>
            <li> but no matter what, I always got big painful bumps that made me miserable for weeks</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, TendSkin is a very expensive product</li>
            <li> After a wax/shave, slight burns, then real bad burns where the wax peeled me off</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, as I have reeeaellly bad ingrown hairs, but this does work.</li>
            <li> me/ grosses me out to see how dirty the cotton ball is.</li>
            <li> STINKS for like 15 seconds</li>
            <li> However, the expense is crazy.</li>
            <li> Desperate, I tried Tend Skin.</li>
            <li> I used this after shaving and it stings like crazy.</li>
            <li> [Section 505(a) of&lt;br /&gt;According to the Food and Drug Administration &amp;#34;Tend Skin&amp;#34; is promoted and labeled for razor bumps and ingrown hair, but is also promoted for the treatment of acne, cold sores, athlete&#x27;s foot, warts, pityriasis rosea and ringworm.</li>
            <li> I never realized how dirty one&#x27;s head is.  </li>
            <li> It burns like mad.</li>
            <li> Yes, laser hair removal is expensive, but cheaper than using this product for the rest of my life!</li>
            <li> Sadly lost my bottle like an idiot when I tried to carry it in a carry-on on an airplane.</li>
            <li> I have always had horrible, horrible ingrown hairs and tiny inflamed razor bumps.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why everyone is complaining about the bad smell.</li>
            <li> I have a really bad ingrown hair problem on my face.  </li>
            <li> I felt it working immediately after a wax, which burned so bad -</li>
            <li> And I get really bad ones around the bikini area.</li>
            <li> Either I got a bad product or this product just doesn&#x27;t work for my type of skin.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think the smell was bad at all,.</li>
            <li> It doesnt burn as bad as everyone else on here complains about.</li>
            <li> His face and neck had razor bumps and ingrown hairs so bad</li>
            <li> it smells really bad</li>
            <li> no stinging, no discomfort, jut the bad smell.</li>
            <li> So I was recommened this product by my wax lady and this is what she told me which I think why some rate it bad...</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not as bad anymore.</li>
            <li> you may think you have it bad, but that&#x27;s what I thought until i started using this.</li>
            <li> I expect that it works by burning off a layer of skin that causes ingrown hairs, and yes it does burn, but not that bad.</li>
            <li> Just not as bad.</li>
            <li> The item caused me a bad allergy I ended up throwing the product away.</li>
            <li> I have wicked bad razor burn on my face.  </li>
            <li> Husband had bad problem with razor burn.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a REALLY bad problem with razor burn.  </li>
            <li> THAT also causes ingrown hairs, but not as bad as the shaving my bikini area.</li>
            <li> Too bad I didn&#x27;t have it as a teenager!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> Smells bad during application.</li>
            <li> I was at a point where I was so frustrated that nothing else was working.</li>
            <li> I used to have painful bumps after bikini and Brazilian waxes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked.  </li>
            <li> and it was slightly painful</li>
            <li> (otherwise it was too painful), while my friends shaved two, even three, times a week.</li>
            <li> After shaving off the beard I had continuous problems with shaving bumps and ingrown hairs that were painful and aggravating.</li>
            <li> Its always bad when I run out and immediately get painful razor burn.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is painful to apply to immediately-shaved areas, so I use it on&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I get painful cystic acne, so this + hydrocortizone with aloe does miracles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always struggled with embarrassing and painful bikini bumps.</li>
            <li> I purchased Tend Skin in an attempt to combat painful and unsightly irritation after shaving my legs.</li>
            <li> It did nothing for my razor bumps... very expensive and yet worthless</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> He was greatly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Started to get embarassing ingrown hairs at base of neck.  </li>
            <li> I hate what it does to my skin.</li>
            <li> After reading all of these RAVING reviews, I decided to buy Tend Skin after having suffered brutally from ingrown hairs and razor burn around the bikini area.</li>
            <li> Very bad customer services from everyone.</li>
            <li> and I get very painful razor bumps that eventually subside after about a week.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Go ahead and purchase, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> He was skeptical but loves it too now!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t done anything for me. I use it just as instructed and even listened to advice from other reviews but nada.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as I thought it would I haven&#x27;t really seen a difference</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought this product and I love it.  Use it correctly and it works great with no side effects.</li>
            <li> Not impressed...been using it for months still get razor burns....</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  alcohol based.</li>
            <li> Works great. I use it on the bottom of my neck where I tend to get ingrown hairs from shaving. Just use a little and you&#x27;ll see results in five days. I use it in the am after I shower n shave and then again at night before bed. It has a slight burn like alcohol but if you don&#x27;t touch it you&#x27;ll be fine after a few seconda</li>
            <li> I had such high expectations. The other reviews said it was a wonderful product. I don&#x27;t know why everyone is complaining about the bad smell. Smells like alcohol...which is pretty much all it is. If you&#x27;re looking to dry out something,like a zit, I&#x27;m sure it would work. it just dried out my skin and made the ingrown hairs worse because my hairs were getting trapped under the dried skin. Just not worth it. I&#x27;ve made some DIY recipes that work about the same.</li>
            <li> it is not effective at all, i had expected it to be good after reading all the reviews, smells bad too</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want red bumps on your butt get this. It works.</li>
            <li> Excellent product..does just what it says it will do..many thanks for quick delivery..</li>
            <li> Great for razor burn!!! I love it. I highly recommend for someone who shaves frequently and are prone to razor burn.</li>
            <li> This always gets rid of my bumps in a few hours. Burns a bit but worth it. Have bought several times.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works... But the smell is horrible....</li>
            <li> Bottom line is it works. Little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best I&#x27;ve found for razor bumps.</li>
            <li> I use this on my bikini area after shaving and twice per day thereafter.  I have a tendency to get shaving bumps and ingrown hairs. After I started using this product everyday, I no longer have problems!  I was at a point where I was so frustrated that nothing else was working. I saw some good reviews on this product and decided to give it a try. Well worth it! There is a slight alcohol burn that comes with application, but it does not bother me, just feels like an antiseptic going on and I know it is doing its job!</li>
            <li> Cannot live without this.  I shave everywhere daily and would stuggle with razor bumps and irritation.  Use of this product once daily immediately after showering and toweling off keeps the razor burn and bumps at bay.  I will never be without this product!  I&#x27;ve tried others with more harsh ingredients and you have to be careful of the burning and pain.  This one does not burn or hurt even in those very delicate areas, if you know what I mean.  This is truly a life saver.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  I&#x27;ve had ingrown hair for a long time and I used this on the back of my neck and stomach area.  I&#x27;d say, 95% of my skin is nice and clear now.</li>
            <li> I have used this for over a year and rarly get ingrown hairs. I use it everytime after shaving.</li>
            <li> I discovered this a few years ago and it works great to prevent my neck from breaking out in razor burn when I shave.</li>
            <li> I have a really bad ingrown hair problem on my face.  This is the only product that completely knocked it out</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! I felt it working immediately after a wax, which burned so bad - but this is because the product contains mostly isoprophyl alcohol. Be weary of it being strong - especially after waxing such a sensitive area - this isn&#x27;t the case when you shave. It really helps open the pores and help prevent ingrown hairs - which I get a lot of and very easily. It also helps get rid of current ingrown hairs after you exfoliate the area. I am having good results with this product, when many others have done ok but fallen short.</li>
            <li> I have struggled w/ ingrown hairs for as long as I can remember. Time and time again my esthetician would comment on them, suggesting I &amp;#34;drink more water, exfoliate more often, try this ingrown serum&amp;#34; none of which seemed to work all that well. I was so thankful for the reviews of this product that I just had to write one as well. This is the first product that I have actually used that worked for me. I started noticing less ingrowns within a week, and four weeks later when I made my regular trip to see my esthetician, she asked me what I had been doing differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this product worked wonders.</li>
            <li> Nice skin care product. Helps w/ ingrown hair, but still may need to exfoliate for best results</li>
            <li> It &#x27;s about the only thing that works for me and I&#x27;ve tried more expensive products. Purchase it with the roll-on bottle and it&#x27;s a great combination for travel and for saving on cotton balls.</li>
            <li> This is the best for anywhere you get bumps from shaving, or even wherever tiny &amp;#34;fuzz&amp;#34; hair grows. As a woman, I use it on bikini line, back of legs &amp; arms &amp; my skin is 100% more smooth because of tend skin.</li>
            <li> I originally got this product for my husband and his ingrown hairs he gets on his head from shaving. I know this stuff is for ingrown hairs, razor burn, etc. but I use it for blemishes and it is amazing!!</li>
            <li> Product arrived just as advertised, and the price for what I got was fantastic.  If I had bought the same thing at a hair salon, I would&#x27;ve spent about 50 bucks!</li>
            <li> I have used this product on and off for years and there is no question it has helped with my razor burn and ingrown hairs. And I get really bad ones around the bikini area. I have even dabbed it on my face on occasion to disinfect acne. I have very sensitive skin and it does burn a tad, but then my skin calms down and the red bumps and swelling improve.  Never use it on wet skin. It burns like mad. I don&#x27;t use this too often because it is drying. Just a few times after I shave -- which is not every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who like to make more natural products: there are DIY recipes out there. Tend Skin is mostly alcohol, vegetable glycerin and salicylic acid (or Asprin -- used as a mask for acne due to the salicylic acid.) If you mixed this yourself you would have a much cheaper approximation. I make a lot of my own cosmetics so I thought I&#x27;d mention it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy Tend Skin because it is already conveniently mixed and I know it works for me. I have used rubbing alcohol on occasion to disinfect and sooth razor bumps as well, which much more cost effective, but does not work as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest gripe with this product, is the price.</li>
            <li> Okay this one is for the ladies...I had been contemplating a wax for a while (more specifically a brazilian wax), but I kept putting it off afraid of how my skin would react.  I have extremely sensitive skin, and am VERY prone to ingrown hairs down there, I was very afraid waxing would irritate my skin.  I found this product online and decided to give it a try.  I had my wax done, and about a day later I noticed a lot of red bumps and irritation.  I began to apply Tendskin.  Within a week with twice a day application, ALL of the irration/bumps were gone.  I continually regularly applied the product and did not get ONE ingrown hair.  I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who is condsidering waxing, it works wonders for people with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> It does what it says it does.</li>
            <li> I bought this product last year and have been using in for a total of 6 months already. By far it helps with the bumps after shaving or waxing but does not help or stop ingrown hairs. &gt;_&lt; Everyone&#x27;s skin is different so try it and see if iy works for you. I will be moving on to a new product.</li>
            <li> If you have deeper bumps you can rely on it. It significantly reduces the bumps. I highly recommend it to you if you have similar issues</li>
            <li> I was recommended this product by a spa boutique after I went there for a waxing session. I have used it for over three years and the results are amazing. Works overnight on razor bumps. Its been wonderful for my skin --- Nothing else compares!</li>
            <li> this stuff is great!!!</li>
            <li> I am an African American male who has suffered with a worsening case of pseudo folliculitis barbae for several years.  I have tried a number of products for ingrown hairs on my (bald) scalp and face--both prescription and non-prescription--without success.  So, when my dermatologist told me about Tend Skin, I was reluctant to try it.  Instead, I found Skin Tight locally and tried it, again, without success.  (That was actually disappointing because Skin Tight made a remarkable difference for some of my friends--male and female--but not for me.)  But in desperation, I finally bought Tend Skin on Amazon.  To my great surprise, Tend Skin has made an amazing difference for me.  In less than two weeks, ALL of the ingrown hairs on my scalp are gone. No new ingrown hairs have grown on my face.  And the old ones are healing.  I&#x27;m using the product twice a day (as directed) and feel that I can soon reduce that to once a day (as directed when the problem is under control).  Used that frequently, it does seem to dry my skin, but not unmanageably so.  I could not be happier with the product.</li>
            <li> This is excellent for preventing ingrown hairs. I use it on the bikini line and it&#x27;s helped tremendously. I have very sensitive skin, so no matter what I did I would get the red bumps and ingrown hairs. If I use this twice a day I&#x27;ve noticed I just have nice smooth skin. I would highly recommend this. The bottle is also very large, it&#x27;s lasted me many months at twice a day usage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some trouble of the last few months with ingrown hairs and did some research as what to do. This was the most popular product I read about. I tried it out and WOW, what an amazing difference! I would differently recommend this to family and friends that have this problem.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm but smell is pungent.</li>
            <li> The only bump stuff thay works, dint waste your money on imitations, this is the one to buy.</li>
            <li> I have had issues with ingrown hair and razor burn my entire life... and I have never found anything that has worked.  This product cleared everything within days.  I wouldn&#x27;t have believed it if I didn&#x27;t see it myself.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely worth every penny. I have had issues w/ ingrown hair ever since i was a kid. After consistently using this product for 2 weeks on my legs and upper arm, I have seen significant improvement on my skin: my skin feels silky smooth, there are less ingrown hair, and the pores seem to have gotten smaller! I just ordered the 16 oz Tendskin - this product is highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed that it works really well w/ the epilator. I don&#x27;t use the tendskin right after epilating because I did that one time and it stung a bit. I use tendskin the morning after I have used the epilator the night before to avoid the stinging sensation.</li>
            <li> Cleared my razor bumps right up! The only thing is it took a long time to and it dried out my skin, but other than that, it does exactly as described!</li>
            <li> This product works great! As an African American male, I&#x27;ve experienced unsightly ingrown hairs for most of my adult life. I haven&#x27;t had an ingrown hair since using this product. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This solution is effective. I had some serious issues with ingrown hair and it did help. There are roll on versions but this version you can pour onto a cotton ball and it is pretty effective. If you have any scrapes this has salicylic acid and alcohol, which will make your scrapes and cuts burn. Compared to other solutions for ingrown hair, this one is pretty economical. It doesn&#x27;t smell great but it is a lot of product and will certainly last me a while. It&#x27;s good for post waxing. If you have very bad razor burn, it won&#x27;t magically disappear after one application but I think it did help.</li>
            <li> Did not really work for me, but I can tell it cleans the area nicely.</li>
            <li> This product works so well! Contrary to some of the reviews I read before purchasing, the smell is not unbearable. Even extremely stubborn ingrowns will be extracted by Tend Skin. I would recommend this product to anyone who shaves or waxes on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I should use it more on regular bases, but it does work even without regular use!  the downside is the horrible alcohol smell..  but it doesnt dry your skin out like other alcohol smelling cosmetics.  I used it to reduce red bumps on my legs.  Plus, it is super cheaper here than on any other sites. (including sephora. go check out the price there.)  RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> Tend Skin is a wonderful product. My husband suffered years with razor bump and tender skin on his face from shaving. We tried high tech razors and they helped a little, but not until he tried tend skin did the skin on his face start improving. This product really works and if you suffer from razor bumps you will want to try this product. Please give it about a month to see improvement.</li>
            <li> I give this product 5 stars. It is great to help prevent ingrown hairs. I recommend this product. I am very satisfied with the results I received.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t actually use this stuff, I bought it for my girlfriend, so keep that in mind with my review. I have discussed the product and her experience with it, of course.     The product seems to work ok to help reduce ingrown hairs, although it definitely doesn&#x27;t eliminate them. It seems like you need pretty regular and consistent use to get the best of it. Unfortunately a majority of its composition seems to be alcohol, and the smell and drying nature of this discourages such regular use - at least for some people (I certainly wouldn&#x27;t want to put it on my face). So it&#x27;s far from perfect.    It would be much better to have a more soothing product. We haven&#x27;t tried any others out there yet (e.g. [[ASIN:B000B6VIPY Princereigns Ingrown Hair Gel]] or [[ASIN:B000ZPSNW2 MiN New York Solution2 Razor Bump Rollerball Treatment]]), but I know there are many that don&#x27;t rely on alcohol for some of their effect. Her salon gal has also recommended other, less astringent stuff. She&#x27;ll probably switch to something else as soon as this is gone (or sooner).</li>
            <li> The only product I&#x27;ve found that legitimately works on in-grown hairs and irritation. I prefer natural products but this is my one exception because with daily use it keep my skin looking happy and absolutely helps prevent in-growns from waxing. Plus the prices on Amazon are usually about 50% cheaper than the drugstore prices for this product which is a huge savings.</li>
            <li> Great product although a tad pricey...</li>
            <li> This product works very well. It does take time to get results so you must use frequently. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is due to the smell/fumes. I have to hold my breath and be careful or the fumes can be strong. Great buy for the money. I think this is a good product to use before ingrown hairs occur since it takes forever to get rid of them.</li>
            <li> What more can you say about Tend Skin other than it seems to work.  No bumps  no problems if you use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve been using it for years!</li>
            <li> My waxer suggested it. It works but you really have to use it twice a day, you can&#x27;t just use it after shaving and hope that it prevents bumps. But that&#x27;s just my laziness shining through. It only stings if you&#x27;re a wimp. It smells exactly like rubbing alcohol (makes me wonder is that the only ingredient?) but the smell does not linger or stick to the skin. So overall, it works, only downside is, if you want to see results you have to apply it twice a day (as the directions indicate).</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the reviews but I was not as lucky as these people... It didn&#x27;t help me at all. I bought it for my legs, to use it after I shave and although I keep using it, I don&#x27;t see any improvement. What a waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone, I think the reviews were pretty helpful. If this product didn&#x27;t completely eliminate ingrown hairs then it was because I probably didn&#x27;t use it often enough. Even when I didn&#x27;t use it every day, it at least reduced the problem. There are no other products out there that can do this and for the price I paid, I am incredibly happy.</li>
            <li> I bought this for someone else and they really enjoy the product. They will buy again from you. Thank you so much for the fast delivery of the product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this product is very effective!  I used it a couple of time and all it did was burn my skin.  It smells like rubbing alcohol and dries out my skin.  It really doesn&#x27;t help with razor burn, or ingrown hairs.  I&#x27;m just not impressed and will not buy again!</li>
            <li> This works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried before.  It&#x27;s also a very big bottle and worth the money you pay.</li>
            <li> This product has completely stopped any razor burn on my bikini area.  During the summer I was constantly shaving and the tend skin saved me because waxing is way too expensive.</li>
            <li> that was fast thank u</li>
            <li> BLACK PEOPLE OR ANYONE WITH SENSITIVE SKIN - This product is a god send, and I&#x27;ve tried just about everything else. It goes on like rubbing alcohol and works great to treat razor bumps, ingrown hairs, and even bug bites. I use the product daily, even when I don&#x27;t shave, along with a Mary Kay Naturals moisturizer and my skin is baby smooth. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It does a great job of getting rid of and preventing ingrown hairs and unsightly bumps.  I still get a few ingrown hairs, but not as much as I used to get before I started using Tend Skin.  A 16-oz bottle lasted four months for me.  Suggestions for using Tend Skin:  1) Pour a small amount of the product directly onto the affected area, and spread the product with a brush.  Cotton pads or cotton balls tend to absorb too much of the product, so one ends up consuming more than is necessary.  2) Moisturize your skin after applying Tend Skin.  This product can dry out the skin and can cause peeling.  To prevent that, apply lotion/cream/oil once the Tend Skin has dried.</li>
            <li> I am someone who cuts hair regularly. This makes me run into alot of razor bumps from shaving. So far I have not found anything that works better at melting away bumps.</li>
            <li> Okay so let me start off my saying that I never make reviews, but this product definitely deserves one. So first off let me start off by saying that whenever I get my eye brows threaded, I get some acne from it. Especially this last time, my acne was terrible from the hairs popping up, so I decided to order this because of its high reviews. So when I first got the product, I was skeptical because it literally smells like nail polish remover and vodka, but I decided to go for it. I used a cotton ball to put the product on, then applied it to the inflamed area. Literally the next day, I woke up and my ingrown hair acne decreased significantly, like SOOO MUCH. Today is only my second day using the product but my face looks so much better! This product is WIN WIN WIN!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have used!!! Reay good!!! After first time using my skin looks much better!!!</li>
            <li> This has significantly helped with my ingrown hairs. I use this daily and once a week use the retin-a cream. I have found this to work for me.</li>
            <li> I started getting ingrown hair from past 2 years. Few people suggested Tend Skin. Pros: It&#x27;s helps with ingrown hair&lt;br /&gt;Cons: You need to use everyday to work effectively! When I ignored couple of times, it comes back!</li>
            <li> This works very well to soothe and prevent razor burn.  It also works as described to minimize ingrown hair.  This is now a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; in my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!!! I have only been using it for five days and it has already made a dramatic impact. It is quite emberassing but when I was younger I decided to shave my stomach... oh I wish I would have known better! Now after years of razor bumps and ingrown hairs it is finally clearing up!I am eager to see what the final result will be! I have been using it 3 times a day instead of two. I don&#x27;t know if that makes a huge difference or not.  This stuff is seriously amazing. I would highly reccomend it! I will be purchasing more after I finish this bottle.</li>
            <li> The product works as described. I recommend that anyone suffering from razor bumps try this product. I noticed an immediate improvement in the clarity of my skin 24 hours after using Tend Skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this product now so I would have it this summer, instead of procrastinating and deal with ugly, embarassing bumps, as typical for me each summer. I was going to wait until then to use it, but when I received a request to review this product, I thought \\&quot;what the heck.\\&quot; I&#x27;ve never been able to shave my bikini area more than once a week because the day after I ALWAYS have ugly, red bumps. I shaved my bikini area two days in a row and used Tend Skin afterwards both times. No razor bumps or ingrown hairs! So now when I do my weekly shaving for that area, I use Tend Skin. I look forward to bikini season now with no more dread of covering up with swim shorts the day after!</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have ever tried that is successful at removing and preventing razor bumps. I have incredibly sensitive skin and thick hair and am easily irritated by shaving and skin products.  Tend Skin far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t do without Tend Skin.  For me, it has greatly reduced the appearance of razor bumbs and ingrown hairs.  If you have these skin problems, I would recommend that you try it!</li>
            <li> Works well. Doesn&#x27;t eliminate bumps completely for me but greatly reduces them. I definitely notice a difference when I run out and stop using it for a few days.</li>
            <li> i bought this while i was pregnant because my skin became very sensitive... i am very happpy and use it regularly (the bottle lasts a long time as you only need a very small amount)</li>
            <li> Thank you to my fellow reviewers for recommending this. I have curly hair. Multiple visits to several different doctors over the last 35 years provided zero results with shaving bumps. I had all but given up.  I tried this based on other reviews here.  This stuff worked right away.  Make sure your skin is as dry as possible (no water) before and after applying this.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works! It smells very strongly of rubbing alcohol and will make your eyes water a bit, but I use to always break out on my face after waxing, but not anymore. AND it seemed to clear up my acne! Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I can really tell a difference between when I use this product and when I don&#x27;t. It makes a huge difference in reducing ingrown hair between waxing.</li>
            <li> I only wish I&#x27;d bought it sooner! Liquid miracle! I&#x27;ve tried all the drugstore products and wasted a ton of money. With Tend Skin a little dab on a cotton ball is all it takes. My skin cleared up in a matter of days and has remained bump free for months. As a woman it&#x27;s fantastic to have one less thing about your body driving you nuts. Get free and get this stuff.</li>
            <li> This stuff is effective, but I noticed that the bottle I was sent expired 4 months before they sent it to me. Unfortunately, I had already used the whole bottle before I noticed.  Make sure you check on the bottle so you aren&#x27;t getting ripped off!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for two weeks and I wish I would have bought it years ago.  I use it after I epilate under my arms which I do daily for touch up.  It has made my ingrown hair/irritation problem nearly nonexistent.  The only downside...this stuff burns like heck with each application but the burning does go away.</li>
            <li> This stuff does NOT work. In fact, it gave me a very serious infection. Costs way too much to end up making you sick! Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!</li>
            <li> Tend skin was first offered to me by my waxing salon; of course, I told them I&#x27;d take care of my messed-up lookin abs on my own and found the same product for 1/4 of their price on Amazon. I have about 30+ ingrown hairs across my abs due to epilation/waxing, and has started becoming irritated over the past couple months and realized I need a solution quick.     However, Tend Skin doesn&#x27;t promote the ingrown hairs from being taken out easier, all it does it make the redness go away - it&#x27;s a symptom cure, not a problem cure. So yea it works if you gotta be at the beach but by the end of the day you&#x27;re still in the same boat; it&#x27;s NOR like sacrylic acid, nor a form of exfoliation, and it won&#x27;t make tweezing out those ingrowns any easier which was my impression.</li>
            <li> This stuff gave me severe chemical burns which tooks months to heal from (and I&#x27;m not allergic to aspirin).  Do not use if you have sensitive skin.  It was horrible.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing I&#x27;ve seen for in-grown hair on the face and throat. Definately reccomend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been reading the promotional ads on this product for years -- but doubted the claims.  I have had repeat ingrown facial hair issues after plucking.  I decided to try Tend Skin.  Used with discretion (it clears the follicle but dries the surface) this is an amazing product. A side benefit is that it exfoliates dead skin and leaves skin smooth. The smell is not very pleasant, and the glycerine film after the dry-down make it unsuitable as a \\&quot;toner\\&quot; but it is probably not intended for daily or frequent use.  Only the oiliest skin could handle it daily.  Follow the directions and you will get the promised result -- the clogged pore will open.  Here&#x27;s another surprise use -- it stops the itch of insect bites ON CONTACT.  I am extremely sensitive to mosquito bites and nothing has helped -- not hydrocortisone, nor commercial remedies.  I had a feeling I should try this on an especially nasty red mosquito bite that was keeping me awake, and several drops on a cotton ball pressed against the bite stopped the itch and reduced the swelling instantly.  I will keep a bottle of this handy.</li>
            <li> This works great for hair bumps juts like it said it does. I have not had any issues since I started using it.</li>
            <li> Someone had recommended it to me so I tried it and was very surprised. It lived up to my friends ravings. I love it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY product that has worked for razor bumps and ingrown hair. I have been using this daily for years..absolutely love Tend Skin!</li>
            <li> This is great for ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> For quite a few years now I&#x27;ve had the unfortunate problem of razor bumps/ ingrown hairs and abcesses in my bikini zone.  Needless to say that is the last place any woman would want any \\&quot;unsightliness\\&quot; occurring.  Before TEND Skin I tried everything that I had at my disposal:  Alchohol rub of clippers before and after, alchohol rub of affected area before/after/and DAILY after showers, neem herb supplement and gel lotion (intended to remove impurities in the skin).......  ultimately, tho it helped to some degree, it didn&#x27;t eraticate the issue.  During a visit, my GYN  recommended TEND skin....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical at first since one reviewer previously said \\&quot;you can get the same affect with alcohol\\&quot;, which I&#x27;d already tried.  Another said \\&quot;it stung like hell\\&quot;.... I am happy to say that neither of those were true for me.  I&#x27;ve been using TEND skin for about 3-4 weeks now and the improvment is remarkable; the \\&quot;terrain\\&quot; has been left free and clear of any irritation or afflictions.  Usage is NOT painful-- regular rubbing alcohol left more intense stinging than TEND did. I use it at least one a day after showers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DRAWBACK/side effect:  After 3-4 weeks of usage I noticed that the skin in the distinct area that I swab daily is now darkening.  It am completely certain that TEND is the cause.  Now, if that is the price for my relief(?) I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m bothered enough by the \\&quot;side effect\\&quot; to stop using the product; after all, better to have an artificial accidental \\&quot;tan\\&quot; than razor bumps and abcesses.... Now I&#x27;m on the hunt for a good non-clogging moisterizer that may help return the skin to it&#x27;s original hue......</li>
            <li> This product man....this product is something else. I&#x27;m so happy it&#x27;s a product that does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do with great efficiency!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saw good reviews on YouTube for black skin. It&#x27;s only been 3 hours since I&#x27;ve applied it (I have an extremely severe case) and already no itching/irritation and those big bumps have gone down significantly so far! Will definitely continue to use after a decade of searching for something that could work for my case; thank you guys sooo much!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING! I have tried EVERYTHING to not get razor bumps when I shave my bikini area but no matter what, I always got big painful bumps that made me miserable for weeks (TMI?) but I used this a couple days after shaving and it made the bumps almost go away in just one use! I would definitely recommend this if you&#x27;ve tried all the &amp;#34;tricks&amp;#34; online and still have issues, this product is great.</li>
            <li> This is a fake product. I opened the package and it was a reprinted bottle with regular alcohol in it. Don&#x27;t buy this it&#x27;s not real.</li>
            <li> really works well for ingrown hair makes the skin softer and smooth love it!  could not live without it the best!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, but I stopped using it after about 2 weeks.   It worked okay, but I still have many ingrown hairs left. It seems like it is a product I would have to use for the long run, and it&#x27;s just too expensive for that. I stopped using it because my hands started to peel too much, so I would recommend using gloves every-time you apply the solution.</li>
            <li> Works just have to be patient and give it a few days</li>
            <li> I heard about this after getting my husband a facial.  It worked like a wonder!!!! His face made a dramatic change from painful bumps all over to smooth like a babys behind.  We will never stop using this</li>
            <li> Works very well to prevent ingrown hairs but it surely burns when I apply it after shaving lol</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve used for razor bump and irritation prevention!</li>
            <li> This product works miracles!  No, I don&#x27;t work for Tend Skin but believe me, it works!  My teenage daughter has terrible razor burn and rash on her inner thighs and was so embarrassed.  After using it just a few days, it&#x27;s nearly gone!  I also bought the air shave gel and I think the combination has taken care of the problem.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it.  I can&#x27;t believe it myself but it really works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year  now, and I can tell you that it has made a huge difference in my appearance. I have very sensative skin when I shave my face, usually my face goes from being dry to being oily later in the day. With this product it keeps my face just right, not too dry but enough not to make it too oily. I also can&#x27;t shave everyday, so I mix this product with High times bumper stopper 2. Give it shot, you&#x27;ll love both.</li>
            <li> Product did not correct issue with skin.</li>
            <li> If you have ingrown hairs and unsightly bumps, you need Tend Skin. Use moisturizer though, it will dry your skin.</li>
            <li> I recently had razor burn for the first time. I&#x27;ve shaved thousands of times, and never had it. I was annoyed at first but figured they&#x27;d go away eventually. They didn&#x27;t. After a couple weeks, I was incensed. The slight annoyance had become unbearable. I googled for products that could help me, without much optimism. I noticed this product had very good reviews on Amazon. I considered ordering it off Amazon and waiting for it to be shipped, but I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore - I rushed to the nearest store with the product and overpaid for a 4 oz bottle ($17!!!). It was the last bottle on the shelf!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tend Skin worked immediately. It didn&#x27;t take a few days like any reasonable person would expect; it worked flawlessly. I was without irritation and with a temporary alcohol burn, which I really don&#x27;t mind (it kinda feels good...). Anyway, the product is perfect. And rest assured, this is the cheapest you&#x27;ll find it. If I ever run out, I plan to buy this 8 oz bottle. Bottom line: This product will kill razor burn and make you happy!</li>
            <li> I am a AA female who suffers from severe razor bump to side burn. This product has been great and I wound recommend to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I continue to be happy with this product, it works wonders.  Could there be something better?  I&#x27;m not sure there is.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff...he has mentioned to other buddies and they have tried it and love it too!!!</li>
            <li> So far so good, I don&#x27;t like the scents though, I wish it had better scents.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years for razor bumps, and it&#x27;s one of those rare &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; products that REALLY works!  Be aware that it smells terrible and if you apply too much the skin on your neck will peel a bit later in the day and leave white stuff on your collar like you have dandruff! A little experimenting and it&#x27;s easy to control that.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well at stopping ingrown hairs on the bikini area for me. The product does burn on freshly shaved skin so wait a few hours before putting it on. The scent is not great, very strong medicinal/chemical smell, but fades quickly within about 30 seconds.    I would recommend this as I&#x27;ve continued to use it with great results.</li>
            <li> I researched and read the reviews before I bought this product.  I wanted to have it to use after getting my first waxing.  I must say that I was amazed at how well the product worked.  No irritation, redness, nor bumps ever.  It was well worth the price.  In fact, it was cheaper to purchase on Amazon than in the spa where I get waxed.  I will be a repeat consumer.</li>
            <li> Works great on ingrown hairs!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff - I purchased this to refill one of the roller balls (you can purchase online or at retailers like Sephora). I would recommend getting a roller ball to help with easy application and so as not to waste any product applying with a cotton ball. It has helped immensely with razor burn and in grown hairs in awkward spots - just remember never to apply right after shaving or waxing, or on any area that is already irritated or cut... You will have serious burning.</li>
            <li> This is some miracle stuff! I use this for after I shave, and voila, no razor burn. I also use on any razor burn or red bumps that I might get (because I forgot to use it) and they go away overnight. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Been using this for over 10 years and let me tell you i can;t live without this product. I have recommends it over 75 times and everyone of the still uses it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 months now and I must say it helps tremendously, I randomly got razor burn one day from a razor that wasn&#x27;t as sharp (cartridge razor since then I&#x27;ve switched to a safety razor) The product not only sped up the relief of the razor burn it prevented future razor burns when I used it with my bad shaving habits.</li>
            <li> Overall, I like this products. It does help you to reduce the after shave bumps and ingrown hair. However, you need to put a descent amount of this product on your skin in order to make it work. This makes it inefficient and expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for one week now. It has been working good on my underarms, but hasn&#x27;t been working as well on my bikini area. I don&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;s suppose to take to start working though. I am going to try to continue to use it on my bikini area for another week or so to see if I see a difference.</li>
            <li> After reading all of the reviews, I was very hopeful I would get the same result.&lt;br /&gt;It just didn&#x27;t work for me. I used it twice daily for several months and still no difference. Either I got a bad product or this product just doesn&#x27;t work for my type of skin.  Who knows. It just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This is going to be A Story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My legs and I have suffered for years. Removing my leg hair tends to be a useless, pointless and painful endeavor. As soon as I&#x27;m done shaving its as if I haven&#x27;t actually shaved in two days. Like I&#x27;m in a constant state of goosebumps. Bumpy with a prickly raised follicle. I can shave the same spot over and over and over again, and just wind up with torn up legs and bumpy prickles. Afterwards I can look forward to ingrown hairs among ingrown hairs that never heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve consulted websites, forums, magazines, books, etc and the advice is always the same insulting spattering of mere common sense. \\&quot;Shave with a fresh blade, use a sensitive shaving gel,  blah blah blah.\\&quot; My issue is not mere sensitivity, and no amount of obvious advice helps. After years of pain and embarrassment I reached a breaking point and found myself at a crossroad: dermatologist or laser hair removal. I spoke to my husband about it and he was supportive, but we were both concerned about the cost. That is when I started to consider Tend Skin. I&#x27;d read about Tend Skin, but just dismissed it as another useless serum. However, it was literally the only at home treatment left to my knowledge that I had not tried. I decided to give home treatment one last try before consulting professionals. After years of effort and disappointment I really wasn&#x27;t expecting any results. That was about four weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using Tend Skin I have stopped searching for dermatologists and laser hair removal.  For the first two weeks I used it twice a day and now I&#x27;m down to once a day. About 95% of my ingrowns are healed and I can enjoy freshly shaved legs for a day or two instead of 30 seconds. Is my skin perfect with Tend Skin? No. I still have about 5% of ingrowns and there are patches on my legs that are slightly bumpy and prickly. But just patches, people. Not the entire leg! I expected nothing, and got so much. In fact, I&#x27;ve been burned so much in the pastthat I&#x27;m a little scared to leave this review for fear of jinxing the whole thing. It&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does smell terrible, but if you don&#x27;t use this product because of the smell I kind of don&#x27;t believe your problem is that serious. 30 seconds of alcohol smell may be the smallest price to ever pay for comfort and healing. I&#x27;m still skeptical that anything can actually help my legs, but for now it&#x27;s working and for now I&#x27;m ecstatic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Tend Skin. In fact I insist on it. If your skin issues are bad enough that you even know about this product then you probably need it. And deserve it.</li>
            <li> great price from amazon. recommended by my waxer. stings a bit but overall it works well.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect. I use it for the bikini area and my husband uses it on his scalp and his face and he absolutely can&#x27;t live without this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have struggled with razor burn in my bikini area for years. I purchased this product after reading many reviews and am EXTREMELY  satisfied. This is product works miracles. I shaved my bikini area, applied the product, and have had absolutely no redness, itching, ugly bumps. I am so pleased with this product. I will be a lifetime user.</li>
            <li> This product works amazingly.  I&#x27;ve used many others that cost less but did not work and were actually rejected by my skin as toxins - what happens when you feed the body&#x27;s largest organ with crap.  So Tend Skin, although pricey is wonderful.  The alcohol and aspirin kill bacteria and several humectants work to extract moisture from the epidermis and the general atmosphere or environment.  This is important because I put LOADS of this stuff on my skin and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.  It has also greatly reduced the acne on my face by drying pimples, exfoliating (also keeping skin very soft), and disinfecting.  So basically you should buy this product.  Thank you God for Tend Skin!</li>
            <li> This is just rubbing alcohol.  The only thing this product did was dry out my skin.  I would definitely recommend the bump stopper products over this.</li>
            <li> MY HUSBAND HAS BEEN STRUGGLING WITH INGROWN HAIRS AFTER SHAVING HIS FACE FOR YEARS.  I AM HAPPY TO REPORT THAT WITH THE USE OF TEND SKIN HE NO LONGER HAS THAT PROBLEM.  TEND SKIN IS AN AMAZING PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> This doses not work for me. I spend a lot of money to buy several bottles. All it does is burn up my skin, and the hair keep growing.</li>
            <li> This smells horrible and feels like it could be carcinogenic. However, I think it did reduce the amount of ingrown hairs I have, but it also left a residue on things I touched if I didn&#x27;t wash it off my skin after use. Seems not worth the trouble and I probably will not be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> It is something I cannot do without. It is a great product. It is just a great product. I recommend</li>
            <li> My waxer recommended this to me to clear up some dark spots from ingrown hairs/ future ingrown hairs on the bikini line. I have never been more satisfied with a product for that function! It works like a charm!</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t really or at all. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Great for daily use and ingrown hair</li>
            <li> At the urging of a cosmetologist who does my waxing,I bought a bottle of TS for use on my bikini line. I get the worst red bumps and ingrowns there, I&#x27;ll  try anything. I bought a bottle, have used half of it, twice a day as directed. It started to work well but now I am back to the bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TS is over priced..what a waste! I am going to try Emjoi&#x27;s After Epilation Cream. I hope it will do a better job.</li>
            <li> I started using this product mid-fall of 2010. It did a wonderful job on my razor burns. My ingrown hair has been more of a challenge. I keep a bald head shave and chin/facial hair shave gets done once a week. My coarse hair or sensitive skin is prone/vulneralbe to ingrown hair and razor burns. This product has significantly reduced the incidence of new ingrown hair but unfortunately nothing it has not relieved those already beneath the skin. It does burn a little on contact with the skin but I have learned never to be bothered by such a short lived discomfort. This product has allowed me to risk shaving my pate and face/chin more than once a week sometimes without worry of the razor burn or ingrown.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend swears by this stuff. It&#x27;s his absolute favorite facial product. He definitely would recommend tend skin to anyone else.</li>
            <li> I been using this stuff for over a year and let me tell you it works good... It does help with the ingrown hairs after waxing... Great price for the size of the bottle!</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff! I have suffered from really bad razor burn in the bikini area my entire life. Really bummed me out cause I could never wear swimsuits. Really embarrassing. I have read about this stuff for about a year now and finally decided to try it. I promise, it works like magic! When I first applied it, I had just shaved so my area was all razor burn. After a few days of applying twice daily like the directions said, it cleared it up. After it clears, use once daily to keep it clear. I can now shave and have no worries about razor burn. I am looking forward to swimsuit season this year.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product for my senstive skin to shaving. I use it only once daily and it really seems to be helping. No more red bumps!</li>
            <li> I tried this years and years ago and it was useful but SO expensive.  I recently found a make your own version on line and decided to give that a try on a weird bumpy ingrown hair patch on my leg from waxing.  Five ounces rubbing alcohol, two and a half ounces witch hazel, twenty-six aspirin.  Throw in the blender and pulverize.  Apply with a cotton ball.  It made a huge difference over night - worked better than I remember the tendskin working.  This is ridiculously expensive for what you&#x27;re buying - try the cheap route first.</li>
            <li> i have really bad razor burn so its hard for me to  tell if its working, or have the patience for my legs. but other areas have seemed to have a effect.</li>
            <li> This continues to and always will be my go-to to prevent razor burn!  The little bit of sting it toally worth it!  I stay razor-burn free.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my friend because she complained about razor bumps by her \\&quot;private area\\&quot;. She says since she started using this product her razor bumps has reduced dramatically.</li>
            <li> I have large pores on my legs and this helps me not to additionally suffer from ingrown hairs. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great seller, excellent product, fast delivery. Would reorder.</li>
            <li> Amazing!!! I&#x27;ve struggled with embarrassing bikini razor burn for so many years, but Tend Skin took care of it after the very first application! I will NEVER, EVER shave with out it again!! I&#x27;m a forever user......thank you, thank you!</li>
            <li> Nice for the after shave irritation</li>
            <li> outstanding product for women facial hair</li>
            <li> This product was recommended for my son by our dermatologist. He was really struggling with razor burn on his neck. Within one week, the razor burn was gone! I could not believe it worked that well! I highly recommend this for any young shaver!</li>
            <li> Works wonders!  It takes about a week for the product to really work but it does!  I didn&#x27;t think the smell was bad at all,. Like the other reviews..</li>
            <li> This is a medicine cabinet must have. Works great for women and men - it really is a miracle worker!</li>
            <li> Im a 26 year old black male.  Do to military I have to keep clean shaven and hair lined up.  Started to get embarassing ingrown hairs at base of neck.  So I did a search online tried a couple of other products not worth mentioning.  This stuff really does the trick just use cotten balls and stay clean.  It doesnt burn as bad as everyone else on here complains about.</li>
            <li> Great Product. Will continue to use and recommend it to everyboody who suffer from razor bumps. Arrived as promised. Will continue to order.</li>
            <li> A friend told me about this product, for getting rid of hair bumps, when I shave.  I am so glad I listened.  I use this often when I shave and it keeps the skin smooth and bumpless.  Glad I listened to my friend.</li>
            <li> OMG!!! this is a hidden little secret that should be on top shelves everywhere!!! I use this product for razor bumps in the bikini area and my hubby uses it for his face and Ill tell you what -this product has saved our skin!!!</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in 7days. It&#x27;s been a month now and skin had tighten and less razor bumps love it</li>
            <li> I love this product. I apply daily with a q-tip after showering. I noticed the difference immediately. Would highly recommend! Amazon sells this product at a great discount. It&#x27;s much more expensive at Sephora.</li>
            <li> The gel product worked very well and just as advertised it was gentle to the skin, I would recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I get razor burn on the inside of my thighs near my bikini line in the summer. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and I&#x27;m a huge fan. So far, every time I use it, it helps to calm the red bumps so it&#x27;s barely noticeable. It stings a tad when going on but it does the trick so it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Sucks.  Just burns like rubbing alcohol n caused more ingrowns.  Wasted funds n now ve more problems, discoloration, from use...</li>
            <li> This product works really great. I saw a lot of instant results. I will continue to recommend this product to alot of people.</li>
            <li> This product is the real deal. I used to have painful bumps after bikini and Brazilian waxes. This was recommended by the salon. They actually charge twice the price for the 4 oz bottle btw. Anyway...I&#x27;ve used it and am amazed at how effective it is. No bumps!! No ingrowns!&lt;br /&gt;The only con abt this product is that I spend more money on waxing becos I don&#x27;t have nasty after effects:D</li>
            <li> I &amp;#34;think&amp;#34; it did help with reducing ingrown hairs, but not enough that I&#x27;d be willing to pay as much as I did to purchase it again. It is definitely painful on areas that have been waxed, and has a pretty unsavoy smell that burns the nose. As other reviewers have said, it definitely seems to be mostly just rubbing alcohol. I think washing with an acne facewash that contains salicylic acid, and then cleansing with rubbing alcohol would probably just as effective (if not more), than purchasing this.</li>
            <li> I never thought it was possible for one of these products to actually work, but this one does. After starting use I saw a noticeable improvement within two weeks. This product even helped the odd bumpy skin on my upper arms that no dermatologist has ever been able to help with.</li>
            <li> Nice. Came quickly. Good for ingrown hair problems. Soothing and cool with nice smell.</li>
            <li> First off, tend skin isn&#x27;t a miracle worker for me BUT it helps tremendously! I have major sensitive skin. Especially in the bikini area. I get the worst razor burn and Ingrown hairs and it&#x27;s just awful and embarrassing. I&#x27;ve tried every razor, cream, gel, etc. with little improvement at all. I found tend skin and after reading reviews decided to try it. First off let me warn you.. It Burns like hell. But it&#x27;s worth it to me. It does feel like putting straight rubbing alcohol on razor burn but it only stings for 3 seconds. I apply it in front of a fan to cool the burn and that helps. I can finally shave down there everyday or two days versus once a week. I will admit I still get slight razor burn but nothing compared to what I had. But I&#x27;ve only used it a handful of times. It&#x27;s worth buying. Like I said nothing else helped this much. Im impressed!!</li>
            <li> I am a black woman and I had such bad razor burn problems and I saw people talking about Tend Skin on you tube and I really wanted to try it, It is worth the money in the first week all my bumps cleared up!. I love it</li>
            <li> the one I got is not an authentic product. I emailed tendskin and asked them, they said that the batch number should start with &amp;#34;F&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Best solution for ingrown hairs, I have tried many products and this by far is the best.</li>
            <li> Although my ingrown hair issue severe. I can see that the product has minimized my flare ups greatly. Best product yet for me.</li>
            <li> As described, results seen in 1-2 days!</li>
            <li> OK I was skeptical at first but this is probably the most satisfied I have ever been with a product! I accidentally bought two bottles and I was going to send one back but now I am just keeping them both.     I bought it for my fiance when he had to start shaving his face every day for work. His face and neck had razor bumps and ingrown hairs so bad and his skin was so irritated. Literally TWO DAYS after using it his skin was clear and baby smooth! Now he just puts some on his face every morning and his skin has been perfect ever since...I use it on my bikini area now too...this stuff actually does what it&#x27;s supposed to do!</li>
            <li> I bought this item after reading the great reviews. It works wonders. Wish I had found this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying this product b/c it was recommended by someone on a website, but this product honestly works to keep away those annoying bikini bumps.</li>
            <li> As someone who always dreads shaving because of the inevitable irritation, I was amazed by the difference after using tend skin.  It stings when I apply it after shaving, but it&#x27;s worth the couple of seconds of swearing. As long as it keeps working, I&#x27;ll never be without it.</li>
            <li> This product really works. it smells really bad but it dries/clears up bumps within in the 1st day. You can see the changes very quickly. get the biggest bottle, its more $$ but then you will be abe to use it everytime after you shave to prevent the bumps. no stinging, no discomfort, jut the bad smell. Why suffer any longer, get Tend Skin</li>
            <li> ive fallen completely in love with this and the air shave gel...i use this stuff all over and even in my pubic region and now im addicted ..i dont get bumps and ingrowns anymore but the suggestion i have towards the dryness is for u to buy the aloe sun gel walgreens sells two for five and ull feel smooth as a baby bottom... i love it keeps me from feeling ashames about the below parts</li>
            <li> I have used this product for only one month and I noticed that the bikini area is more soft and with less ingrown hair. I was expecting that I had no more ingrown hair in few days, like a miracle. I hope that continuing using this product I can feel the result as I expected.</li>
            <li> I am a African America male.  I use a electric razor, but still had ingrown hair problems.  After other products that really did not work, this product really helped alot.</li>
            <li> First, be forewarned, it burns as soon as you put it on after you shave, but....it totally works. It limits the the ingrown hairs and bumps instantly. I use it frequently as it was recommended to me and I would recommend it to other people. The results are true to what is advertised, but you will do the burning flesh dance for about five seconds after application. I think the pain is worth the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a week now 2-3xs a day with a moisturizer which is very cooling and soothing, plus I can already see an improvement. I&#x27;ve also read that it&#x27;s not meant to lighten dark spots, but my dark spots are starting to slowly fade. I&#x27;m a black female, 22 yrs old and in the last year I&#x27;ve tried almost anything ie: aloe Vera gel, lemon juice, vinegar juice, cucumber paste, coconut oil, Shea butter, exfoliating, even skin tight wouldn&#x27;t help me. It stings and burns but it&#x27;s not unbearable. I use it in the armpit area and bikini zone and I have no more bumps from ingrown hairs. When used under the arm it also acts a substitute for deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff and I wish I would&#x27;ve found this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> unbelievable improvement in my constant battle with in-grown facial hair.  Have tried so many things over the years.  A friend who is a cosmetologist strongly recommended this product.  A little on a 2x2 gauze right after shaving in the morning (on dry skin), and right at night before I go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They aren&#x27;t completely gone, but extreme reduction in frequency and severity.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for anyone who has sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Best product for razor bumps</li>
            <li> No problems, but have not seen a satisfactory change</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different products, from&lt;br /&gt;Witch Hazel to expensive designer products,&lt;br /&gt;but this one worked the best. I apply it after&lt;br /&gt;waxing sessions and it does keep ingrown hairs&lt;br /&gt;away. Skin absorbs it in seconds, it does have a&lt;br /&gt;strong scent but it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working so far, just have to wait a few months and see if it will keep working</li>
            <li> You really have to use it for a week for results.  Really hurts when you put on if you have any nics, but nothing better really at taking away the bumps and redness over time.  I use in conjunction with Cortizone and aloe vera to calm skin down.</li>
            <li> So I was recommened this product by my wax lady and this is what she told me which I think why some rate it bad...it does work your suppose to use only a little dab it goes a long way and also stings a little which is why you use very little, it does have a smell to it so best time to use morning or night and use EVERY day or you will not get full results...not everything that works will have a amazing smell and look good...</li>
            <li> Just an astringent.  Nothing very special.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time and it has helped razor bumps tremendously. I have referred it to many and they love it as well. Glad I ordered a bigger bottle this time. The last one was gone too fast :-)</li>
            <li> Tend skin is the best item on the market for ingrown hairs.  No stinging and it works. I have used it for many years</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It really does reduce razor bumps and ingrown hairs, but be aware that it will sting if you have any razor nicks.</li>
            <li> I really like it and think it works with out a doubt but this is too expensive for me for what you get so I will have to keep trying other products similar but in a better more affordable price range. If then I have exhausted all avenues and absolutely can&#x27;t find anything like this than I will probably cave and buy this again.</li>
            <li> I question whether this is an imitation Tend Skin, since the labeling was slightly different. Would not recommend product, it DOES NOT work.</li>
            <li> this stuff is just awesome....</li>
            <li> Look, I love Tendskin. It was 1996 and I was dealing with razor bumps, like all my life. Huge ugly bumps that would make my shaving a nightmare. I had bumps on my face and back of neck from shaving.&lt;br /&gt;One day I went to a new barbershop and the guy asked me if I wanted a shave, I had grown a beard just from fear of shaving. I said yes, he gave me the hot towel, razor blade, etc. When he saw my face he said &amp;#34;man you have those ingrown real BAD!&amp;#34; I said &amp;#34;yep all my life&amp;#34;. He asked me if I was willing to try something new. I said sure what is it? he said let me put it on and BTW it WILL sting.&lt;br /&gt;He rubbed a cotton soaked in this Tendskin on my freshly shaved, bumper, sensitive face...I wanted to beat him with his own chair! I left thinking what the heck did he do? ...I was upset until the next morning. My bumps went down at least 60% and I went back and purchased a huge industrial size bottle. Since then I use it twice to three times a week as i shave and BTW...I get compliments on my face all the time. It may not be pretty but it sure is smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you suffer from ingrown hairs get this bottle AND the roll-on version. Here is why. #1 The roll-on saves on spillage hence you do not waste any, or as much and #2 when traveling the roll-on is perfect not to get taken by the mean airport people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> It is a bit costly and hard to find this product and I don&#x27;t remember the smell that it now has.  It does work a little better than just plain alcohol.</li>
            <li> My husband gets razor bumps on his neck and insists on using this stuff every time he shaves, because it works somewhat.  Doesn&#x27;t prevent them all, but it&#x27;s definitely been better.  It has a strong smell but it doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> I was convinced that there was nothing I could do to avoid razor bumps in my bikini zone.  I tried every product I could find at the store.  Then, one day my salon suggested I try this.  I use it once a day every day (sometimes twice a day on the day I shave) and NEVER have bumps!  It is well worth every penny.  It&#x27;s now a mandatory staple in my bathroom vanity.</li>
            <li> This is a great item, it definitely works on reducing the bumps you get after shaving. It does sting a bit but its definitely the best product on the marker so far. I&#x27;ve been using it for years</li>
            <li> This product actually works! I was a little unsure if it would work or not but it did. I have been using veet because it also helps minimize the chance of me getting razor bumps but some always seemed to appear. But in combo with this product my skin has lightened up and I&#x27;m  razor bump free!!</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my ingrown hairs or for preventing any. Just buy witch hazel or rubbing alcohol, they probably work better.</li>
            <li> Tendskin I purchase for my son ingrowing hair after shaving. After the first shave he uses it  morning and night for a couple days,after once a day. The solution clear all bumps. This is the best product he has ever use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without Tend Skin. Its the ONLY thing that works to keep those ingrowns at bay. Burns like crazy if you apply it right after a wax but gets easier in the days following. What I love about it is that it does work to prevent ingrowns but isn&#x27;t super drying like other products I&#x27;ve tried and I feel like I&#x27;ve tried everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I had hyperpigmentation from old ingrown scars I also use a few other exfoliation methods in conjunction with Tend Skin. My two favorites are the Kojie San Kojic acid soap and a lemon sugar olive oil scrub. A be sure to moisturize along with the tend skin use. For a light moisturizer I like SkinFix Daily lotion. During the winter I like Bio-Oil.</li>
            <li> I bought this due to redness and bumps on my bikini line.  This is primarily alcohol and does help dry out some of the bumps, but  I have found it does little to prevent new ones.  It&#x27;s really done nothing to eliminate the existing bumps.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
            <li> The product works, it just takes time to see the results. After continued usage, you&#x27;ll notice the bumps no longer exist.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff. Gets rid of razor burn which I get pretty regularly after shaving my legs. Just put a small amount on a cotton pad and swipe with the growth. It will tingle/slightly burn, but then the razor burn is gone. Such a god-send during the summer. Good size, this one will last me probably 9-12 months.</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve checked the ingredients: it&#x27;s just isopropyl alcohol! Sure, it stops bleeding from shaving cuts, but not worth it for the price. Plus, since there&#x27;s no fragrance, your face will reek like pure alcohol! Not good to smell like vodka before work...</li>
            <li> Works well and last long but does burn when applied unlike some other brands. I don&#x27;t mind the burn but if you have sensitive skin then be prepared</li>
            <li> Took away bumps and irritation within one use!!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great, for years i had a mild for of eczema and did not know it, after going to a dermatologist we are treating it differently and using special moisturizer ( amalactin)  to solve my skin irritant problems ( used this everywhere i shaved/waxed), but for what its worth, after shaving this did do the trick and i still use this on my bikini line. Would not recommend for people with eczema as it does dry out the skin, since changing my regimen to what the dermatologist recommend my skin as been doing 100% better, but as far as a general razor burn solution, this is the top of the line.</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders to rid you of razor burn. I have very fair and sensitive skin which results in a lot of razor burn. Tend Skin really clear it up almost immediately.</li>
            <li> Better than Dilapitory shaving products. (I.E.,the SMELL). convenient and noticebly effective,but not magic........</li>
            <li> Perfect, very usefull for me! Love it!</li>
            <li> This product works fine although not good enough to enjoy two 8oz bottles, my order processed twice because of an &amp;#34;error&amp;#34;.  Now I have two bottles and a wasted $20.  There are NO returns because this product is &amp;#34;hazardous&amp;#34;.  Totally a waste and a disappointment.</li>
            <li> My go to for ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> A lot of products exfoliate, but it&#x27;s the aspirin I think that makes this unique because it also eliminates redness. It&#x27;s expensive, but a little goes a long way--one bottle for me and my daughters lasts more than a year. If it&#x27;s used too much it will cause even teenage skin to dry out and peel.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a life saver. It works on all my areas that I use an epilator. It keeps me from getting the ingrown and infected hairs. I use it with a cotton ball, so that I am not over using the product.</li>
            <li> My legs are covered in ingrown hairs that are at the very least a decade old. I used two full bottles of tend skin as I wanted to give it enough time to really get through several layers of skin, but unfortunately it just didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> It works well for my razor burn.  It seems to improve healing time for ingrown hairs.  I&#x27;m glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> After many years of razor burn on my face/neck, I finally broke down and bought this per friend&#x27;s recommendation. I have sensitive skin and had given up hope that anything could help. This totally changed my outlook on shaving. My neck especially would be the worst.  I dab it on immediately after I rinse and dry, post-shave. It does burn a bit but that goes away pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth it to not have razor burn/bumps anymore.  I only apply it once after shaving even though the directions recommend repeat applications the following day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go ahead and purchase, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I wanted this product to work, but unfortunately it has not. I get horrible in-grown hairs from brazilian waxing and I needed something to at least lessen them in number. I purchased tend skin based on the great reviews, and was so excited to try it out. I can&#x27;t tell a difference at all. I&#x27;m still getting the in-growns, I guess I will have to try something else.</li>
            <li> I got this for hubby in sephora for the first time, but I found it here at a better price, we are fan of this product because it works great!. My product came fast just on time for the gift bag.</li>
            <li> Definitely gets rid of the constant razor bumps that used to drive me nuts whenever I shave or trim my face!</li>
            <li> Large size. Must shave more often now.</li>
            <li> It had a strong rubbing alcohol smell but it works!</li>
            <li> Husband always breaks out when shaving chest etc. He didn&#x27;t really break out at all!! He was skeptical but loves it too now!!!</li>
            <li> This &#x27;little wonder drug&#x27; seem to live up to the reputation! Really glad my buddy referred it to me for my neck bump issues: Definitely begins the drying process in as little as 48 hours! This is my new &#x27;Grooming&#x27; best friend!!</li>
            <li> I love Tend Skin and have been using it for years.  It&#x27;s completely eliminated the problem of ingrown hairs that I used to get after shaving.  Most of the time I use it for underarms and bikini line, but believe it would work anywhere you needed it.</li>
            <li> Tend Skin helps the skin area surrounding my ingrown hairs to be less reddened and inflamed so that pain and swelling is minimized and my appearance has greatly improved.  I love my skin!</li>
            <li> I ordered this item to give it a try. I have sever ingrown hair issues. I had tried a comparable product and had better results. The smell of this one is not nearly as bad as its competition. This one smells like straight alcohol. However this did not do anything for me. If anything it seemed to irritate my skin further and cause more ingrown hairs. I would say, save yourself some money and just use straight rubbing alcohol because that&#x27;s basically all this product is. If you would like a product that works wonders but you just have to put up with the smell I would highly recommend this:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Tight-Product-Ingrown-Hairs-Extra-Strength/dp/B000S92OCK/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?rps&#x3D;1&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1440805582&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;skin+tight&lt;br /&gt;I saw immediate results with this and reduced my ingrowns to minimal with prolonged and regular use.</li>
            <li> I am black and I have struggled with razor bumps literally ever since i could remember shaving. I have tried products like nair and many, many others and the bumps just kept coming. I really didn&#x27;t expect this product to work but it did. It not only stops the bumps but it also helped reduced the existing scars. You must use it daily after shaving and it does burn initially but its not an unbearable burn. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I use Tend Skin right after shaving, before applying moisturizer and a moisturizing after shave.  It&#x27;s a wonderful septic product that has helped reduce the regular, persistent occurrence of ingrown hairs on my face.  It also seems to help clear up redness around the neck area.  Definitely the best product I have tried for these uses.</li>
            <li> This product is unbelievable. I ended up buying four more just to keep around. I have extremely curly hair and get ingrown hairs every single time I remove hair- be it shaving, waxing, using nair... nothing has ever worked. I would NEVER shave as a go to for hair removal because it is the worst for my ingrown hairs. Now though, I can shave, use my tend skin and I haven&#x27;t gotten ANY ingrown hairs since I started using this product. Just, WOW.... My underarms have cleared up dramatically. No dark spots or in grown hairs there anymore ( something I&#x27;ve suffered with for over 10 years)!</li>
            <li> Great product which I have been using for many years. I tried many similar product but none have been as effective as tend Skin on eliminating and preventing razor bumps.</li>
            <li> This product does help to prevent ingrown hairs!. I only use it on my underarms since this is my problem area. While it did help to remove some existing ingrowns there are still a couple that it didn&#x27;t. That&#x27;s the reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. I use a cotton ball to apply it right after I get out of the shower and it always amazes me/ grosses me out to see how dirty the cotton ball is. I wouldn&#x27;t say I&#x27;m a heavy sweater but I&#x27;m more than average. I can now go without deodorant some days if I wanted to! Before that was never a possibility. While it does have the ability to prevent ingrown hairs I would say it does a little more than that for me</li>
            <li> Honestly, this is the only thing I&#x27;ve ever used that has worked and prevented razor bumps. It burns going on, but I saw immediate results starting with the very first application. I only use it right after I shave, and as the hair grows back in I don&#x27;t get in-growns. I highly recommend if nothing else has worked.</li>
            <li> It has a very strong rubbing alcohol smell to it, but it seems to be working well so far.  My razor bumps have definitely become less on my legs since using it.  It doesn&#x27;t burn the skin either, which I thought it would do with the strong smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  Totally over priced in the salon.  Always in the Instyle or other magazines as top editors pick.  Try it out!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this product. I shave my bikini area a lot and have always had trouble with bumps. I use expensive razors and good shave cream. After trying this for a week my bumps are worse then ever and I&#x27;m having a hard time getting rid of them. I would use it right after shaving and it did nothing. I would not recommend this product and it&#x27;s very over priced for the quality.</li>
            <li> I have mixed reviews on this product. Although I have been using it for years i thought it was the best on the market. I had severe razor bumps. This product is suited for mild to moderate ingrown hairs. Maybe you will see better results. Give it a try</li>
            <li> I always get razor bumps on my thighs, I started applying this once a day, and they were gone by the fourth day!&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty excited since I&#x27;ve tried getting rid of them using home remedies, and that didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this stuff! Works wonders</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m prone to ingrown hairs and the nasty bumps after waxing.  Since using this product I&#x27;ve yet to receive one.  I use it daily after my showers.  So far so great.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  It has helped me soooo much with my ingrown hairs.  I highly recommend it to all women for the bikini area.</li>
            <li> I did a comparison with the B&amp;C Skin Tight and the tend skin product.  The tend skin bottle is in the didn&#x27;t have as good results.</li>
            <li> This product has really helped my sensitive skin. No more razor burns or ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Like others have said, it has a really strong smell of alcohol. It also tingles a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;I still recommend.</li>
            <li> Bought this for razor bumps, and honestly it wasn&#x27;t the mirical cure I wanted. After useing it for days it really don&#x27;t clear it up any faster and wasn&#x27;t particularly soothing.</li>
            <li> It does work.  After a couple of applications, no more razor bumps under my armpits or on my thighs.</li>
            <li> This is a holy grail product for me, I&#x27;ve suffered from ingrowns and razor bumps for decades. I&#x27;ve used all sorts of over the counter products and diy treatments to no avail, nothing ever made the slightest bit of difference in reducing/eliminating razor bumps and ingrowns until I tried Tend Skin. I was initially skeptical because the reviews seemed too good to be true but I was truly amazed by Tend Skin, it truly works and saved my skin from further damage and irritation. I&#x27;ll never spend a dime on any other product.</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned with very thick coarse black hair. I have been plagued by ingrown hairs on my bikini line due to this combo for years. No matter if I shave, epilate, wax....makes no difference, it really affected the swimwear I could wear, etc. This product is a GODSEND. I epilate every morning on my bikini line and immediately apply right after. It took a few weeks of solid dedication to this....and now it is FINALLY smooth. Fair women with coarse dark hair....this is essential!</li>
            <li> Great Product!  Starts working Immediately After Applied,</li>
            <li> I know its pricey but this stuff works!  My skin is so sensitive to shaving and I&#x27;ve always looked for somethng that can take care of the bumps and irritation.  If you use it daily it makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I used to cut my beard with trimmers, because razors electric and traditional cause me to BUMP UP, and trust me, ladies don&#x27;t particularly go for that sort of thing! At one point I really wanted to start to get a REALLY clean shave, one that you can only get from a razor but every razor that I tried and every shaving cream and every after shave concoction never worked. One day this guy I was working with told me about Tend Skin, I took a look at his neck and noticed that he didn&#x27;t have ONE bump on it. I figured what the heck, he already told me that it might cost me a tad bit more than the everyday stuff, so I didn&#x27;t wince at going in on a whim. It burns initially (if you&#x27;ve ever gone to the barber and had ointment slapped on your shape-up it feels about the same, so it&#x27;s really NO big deal), in a blink of an eye I couldn&#x27;t feel it, and in less than an HOUR I noticed that the bumps that were on my neck after I shaved were GONE, and even more, they STAYED GONE!!! I&#x27;m no longer worried about shaving anymore, my face is baby-skin smooth and I&#x27;m happy. It works, point blank. I shave w/a Gillitte Fusion razor if you want to know, but I&#x27;m sure that I could shave with any razor and this stuff would work its magic. Nuff said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, you really only need a LITTLE bit at a time, so no need to slap it on like after-shave, besides it STINKS for like 15 seconds and you really don&#x27;t need to smell like that any longer than you have to! HA!</li>
            <li> So far seems to be working pretty well. It&#x27;s only been two weeks but I am already seeing some results!!</li>
            <li> this works really good to minimize the chances of getting razor burn though it does burn like a bitch</li>
            <li> A great product if you have issues with ingrown hairs after shaving. Must be used every time you shave.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for years. Works as promised.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Although the smell is not the most pleasant, it fades very quickly.  Very simple to use w/ a cotton ball for application.</li>
            <li> I buy this regularly. Its great for keeping ingrown hairs under control. I recommend purchasing with the refillable roller applicator otherwise you may find that the skin on your fingers starts to peel</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic skin care solution and does a noticeable job with clearing up issues after a week of use.</li>
            <li> Only been using it for a couple of weeks. I can tell a slight difference.</li>
            <li> this is a really great product to apply after you shave to prevent razor bumps and  skin irritations caused by the razor whether it be blade our electric razor. Also works for other scrapes and skin irritations</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Helps with razor burn and ingrown hairs. Beware, it can sting a little in certain areas if you have shaved too close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product works and there is plenty of it. Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> I have been using Tend skin for a decade now and would recommend to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;It works and work good.</li>
            <li> I got this product for my husband to use on the razor bumps on his face and neck.  The reviews for this product are rather positive, so I hoped it would work for him.  Unfortunately it hasn&#x27;t.  The razor bumps remain and we will continue searching for an effective product to treat his razor bumps.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually does a pretty good job removing razor bumps. I&#x27;ve used it for many years now and I haven&#x27;t found anything that works like it.</li>
            <li> I used this consistently and have not seen any changes. Did they change the formula? I remember using this is the past and getting fast results.</li>
            <li> Compared to other after shaves that I have tried, this is by far the best. I see less bumps than before and I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now and cannot tell a difference. I used it after waxing and days afterwards. Easy to apply with a cotton ball but liquid is a bit sticky. I will continue to use since I can get a few more months use so will change my review if I see a change.</li>
            <li> I have been waxing for over 10 years now and I&#x27;ve learned a few things along the way.  I have used a lot of bumps/burn serums etc but never this one till my new waxing place (Waxing the City - which I love btw) suggested I use it as they swear by it.  So I bought it here on amazon b/c it was cheaper...and I didn&#x27;t really see much improvement.  Next time I went to get waxed, I told them I was disappointed.  The lady asked me how often I was using it and I told her about 1-2x/week.  She shook her head and explained it needs to be every day, and I need to insert it into my routine like brushing my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I was annoyed I had to do another thing along with my other routines but I did it anyway.  OMG!  I barely have any ingrown hairs anymore...I&#x27;m shocked.  I wax my full leg and get a Brazilian...seriously, barely ANY ingrowns.  So yeah, this stuff is amazing but I had to use it everyday.  But this is the best stuff I have found, and I have tried so many other products.  I very much recommend - 5 stars!</li>
            <li> It got to me very quickly and was exactly what I ordered. No issues. I was very satisfied with everything.</li>
            <li> This is so awesome! You put it on the ingrown hair LUMPS (thats pretty much what I have, it is pretty bad...) and next day they are almost gone! Nothing worked so well on my sensitive skin before!!</li>
            <li> I have bought this product several times. I would recommend to others. This helps with razor bumps ! It does</li>
            <li> Great product. First time user. I&#x27;ve tried many products for razor bumps and this product will be a staple in my product selections. I is a wonderful that works as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any doubts, look at all of the great reviews. Get it. Use it.</li>
            <li> I have used this for several years and it makes you have ZERO razor burn. It is a must have for men and women.</li>
            <li> I would not recomment this product to anyone with an ingrown hair.  It does not work and was just a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> This product works GREAT. My barber recommended that I use this for my Razor Bumps. I am African American and it does wonders. Love this Size</li>
            <li> This product confused me because the bottle looked a bit different than the original product. It seems like it may be a knock off as I have gotten tend skin for many years and this one has packaging that is a bit different.</li>
            <li> As a person of African descent, I get many ingrown hairs due to my curly hair texture. This product provides quick healing and reduces the amount of ingrown hairs I receive. Also excellent healing tonic for after waxing as the skin heals and repairs. Cleans and prevents debris from accumulating in sensitive areas. Quick drying and no mess.</li>
            <li> I took a chance and finally decided to purchase this product because of the excellent reviews---and I&#x27;m glad I did! It really works! My legs have never been smoother after shaving and I also noticed that hair tends to grow back a little slower than before. Overall excellent product and will definitely order again in the future!</li>
            <li> Definitely  works for ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> i was very much looking forward to getting this product but when it arrived as i started to look at it i notice this it didn&#x27;t have the seal on it and it truly just smells like alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;i will wait to see but i think its fake and wont do anything, im upset because i thought finally something that might work but i just to taking for 22$.</li>
            <li> This product even works for my chronic ear irritation from wearing hearing aids!</li>
            <li> I have the worst case of ingrown hair ever and I thought it would help but it did not ...I do not realize any improvement ...I am i will not buy it again..what a waste of money .</li>
            <li> Yeah everyone has said it already...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I used this I would be in so much pain that I didn&#x27;t want to move.  Now I can happily shave without fear of irritation.  Plus I can do it more frequently!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I suffer from ingrown hairs and I have tried so many things to make them go away.... nothing has worked until now. It doesn&#x27;t just speed up the healing, it makes them NOT show up. It smells pretty bad (like straight rubbing alcohol) but I don&#x27;t even care. Once it&#x27;s dry you can&#x27;t smell it anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a handful of times.  Apparently after I bought this, my skin decided it wanted to behave.  The two or three times I did use it, it seemed effective.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive facial skin, so I get bumps and rashes every time I shave or use my electric trimmer. I apply this stuff immediately after shaving or trimming, take a shower, then apply it again. I&#x27;d say it reduces bumps and rashes by about 95%--which is about all you can reasonably expect. Note that it contains a lot of alcohol, so it will dry your face out. Try using something to remoisturize in conjunction with this. I used to have to go to Sephora to buy this; that can be uncomfortable because a lot of the women in there look at you like you&#x27;re a creep for being in there. Ordering it online is the solution that that problem.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price! I was having a lot of trouble after shaving/waxing with ingrown hairs and razor burn in my bikini area and this eliminated them! Definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li> If you are a black guy or someone with very curly hair then most likely you have had to deal with severe shaving bumps when shaving your face. The medical term is called Pseudofolliculitis barbae. For years I have suffered with this problem. It has taken me years of research to come up with a working regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without Tend Skin I am guaranteed to break out with bumps. This product is truly amazing! It significantly decreases the likelihood that you will break out with bumps or a rash after shaving. I have been using this product for over a year now and I have found it to prevent at least 95% of bumps. This is huge when you consider that I used to have a complete breakout every time and I was unable to shave again until it cleared. Now there are hardly any bumps at all and none if I use the correct routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The secret is to shave ONLY with the grain and use a safety razor or straight. Then apply the Tend Skin afterwards. Shaving daily also significantly decreases the likelihood that you will break out with bumps. This is now an essential part of my shaving regimen.</li>
            <li> Great product! Works well! Used it without the cotton ball and it was just as amazing! I was very impressed!</li>
            <li> Very good product, it is working for me,</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works! I get lazy using it regularly but when I do,,, amazing. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, but make sure to use it consistently! I know it seems obvious, but if you forget to apply it right away, your results will suffer (it will still heal any sad/icky razor bumps or burn, but that doesn&#x27;t happen overnight, friends).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is a game changer.</li>
            <li> If used properly, this stuff works. Its great on the bikini area and on my husband&#x27;s face after shaving. Eliminates all ingrowns.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see a sinificant difference but will continue to use to see if that changes</li>
            <li> I am surprised that the hair bumps on my head has reduced significantly since I started using it. I can&#x27;t wait for it to clear off. I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Great remedy for ingrown hairs AFTER the fact, and an even better remedy for acne!</li>
            <li> The item was delivered as promised and was also in the condition it was advertised to be in. I have used this product for many years as I like its results.</li>
            <li> I was having a real problem with ingrown hairs under my arm.  My co worker recommended this as her husband used it for his facial hair.  In talking with other friends, I learned  several of my friends are familar and use this product.  I&#x27;ve gotten great reports and decided to give it a try.  Since using this product, I have not had any more problems with ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> The product works very well as long as you use it as directed. I wish there was a product that clears up dark spots instantly.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2A86AIIDFF2O1]]Tend Skin is a savior when it comes to ingrown hair issues, razor bumps and razor burn. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while (about 6 or 7 years). Not only is it effective but it also works quickly. You only need a little and the results can be seen rather quickly. See attached video review for more details.</li>
            <li> with consistency this works.  I notice that bumps near my bikini line have diminished, they have not fully gone away but are not what they use to look like.  Skin is smoother.  I am not brave enough to use after shaving as it has alcohol and stings!  I try to use it 2 x a day.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and really thought my boyfriend would like this product for his razor burn, turns out it has a smell that he doesn&#x27;t like. It is not a strong smell but enough that he doesn&#x27;t want to use it. Even if he could get over the smell I think the burning that it causes his skin is also a problem. I will not purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use after I get waxed... I see very little difference</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my ingrown hair bumps in bikini area. Best product ever. I have seen results in 2 days. I used this on an ingrown hair I&#x27;d had for years and it is now totally gone. Miracle in a bottle for sure.</li>
            <li> Product does what it says! I love Tend Skin and recommend it to everyone! Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product!</li>
            <li> It really helped reduce bumps and ingrown hairs without causing extra irritation or drying the skin out. I will continue using</li>
            <li> This is probably the single most effective solution I have used to fight the unsightly razor bumps and ingrown hair. I have tried all sorts and this works. I&#x27;m african with thick curly hair so do the math..... No matter how many precautions I take before shaving, I always get bumps. This really helps to keep them at bay. Works really fast too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I have always had problems with ingrown hairs and razor burn OUCH and after I shave, I put this on and it doesn&#x27;t even start to develop!  Been using for over 7 years.  I&#x27;ve ordered from their website and amazon and its both the same stuff! Both work great!</li>
            <li> Using this product after shaving has almost eliminated any razor burn or bumps I had previously experienced. Love it!</li>
            <li> Tend Skin Liquid is a good product for people with sensitive skin after any brand of epilator. Just follow instruction on a bottle; it&#x27;s less painful process with epilator and less irritation on the skin after it.</li>
            <li> Used to use this product as a go to after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I think there are many other better products out there now a days.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome.  Ever since I started using it, I have no more red bumps! I initially bought it at a beauty salon but it was way overpriced.  Gotta love Amazon for finding better deals :)</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it is designed to do ... stop razor bumps and ingrown hairs. The 8oz bottle is a real steal.  I just want to give a shout out to the Tend Skin The Skin Care Solution Company for such an outstanding product!!!  Thanks</li>
            <li> works very well - use it every so often (when i remember to) and absolutely no ingrown hairs or razor bumps</li>
            <li> Works pretty well. I still do have a little redness but I have very sensitive skin. Overall I would recommend this product and I am going to buy more when I run out because it is helping.</li>
            <li> Works wonders.  I rub my face before bed and before work</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I received this that I had to use the same day. I am not joking when I say that I saw improvement in my skin after 3 DAYS!!! My ingrown hairs reduced dramatically. I do warn you though that this stings when you first apply it after you shave but it is worth it. One down side is that it has a very strong rubbing alcohol smell but I love this product so much that it doesn&#x27;t bother me as much.</li>
            <li> cant live without this...no need for deodorant!!</li>
            <li> This product seems to work. Not excellent but good enough and I see enough of an improvement that it seems worth purchasing. It does have a heavy alcohol smell though.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how this stuff works, but it really does!!</li>
            <li> this tend skin was not like the one I got at cvs pharmacy. it wasnt as effective, I guess I was just lucky with the one i bought at cvs.</li>
            <li> I used to use Glytone Acne Back Spray and switched to Tend Skin.  Tend Skin actually works better and is cheaper!!</li>
            <li> I never get razor burn on my bikini area anymore. My wax girl reccommended this product and I love it!!!</li>
            <li> Smells very much like alcohol, and its also a little too watery.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a couple months ago and it&#x27;s now completely gone. I used it twice a day because I showered twice a day, exfoliated once a day and applied vitamin E after each application, but there was no noticeable decrease in ingrown hairs. I am debating whether to buy another bottle or to look for something else.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re really happy with this item. It is everything we hoped it would be and would refer it for a friend.</li>
            <li> I get razorburn/ bumps when I shave, no matter what razors or cream I use. Tend Skin is the only thing that works AND it works every time.&lt;br /&gt;I put in one immediately after shaving (it burns for a second, but it&#x27;s not bad) and then I put it on a few times after and I get no razor bumps. I use this bottle to refill the refillable roll on, which I HIGHLY recommend doing. You will use less product with the roll-on and you will get a better, more even application.</li>
            <li> its a little strong like alcohol not so much so the product is wonderful still have more than half the bottle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many things for ingrown hairs.  THIS IS THE ONLY SOLUTION that I&#x27;ve needed.  Works as described.  Smooth skin results.</li>
            <li> I love this product have been using for several years. Perfect for no razor burn but it does have a shelf life</li>
            <li> Gave this five stars because it works. I get ingrown hairs in the bikini area, underarm pits &amp; my chin. This product prevents that from happening. I apply directly after shaving, plucking those areas. My husband started using it on his neck and already sees the results. If you shave you totally need this.</li>
            <li> Excellent action. The product is simply amazing. I will recommend it to anyone anytime with razor bump problems. Thank you</li>
            <li> I used this years ago and remembered it kind of burned, but it still worked great on ingrown hairs.  Not sure of the formula change, but little sting and works so great on ingrown hairs - overnight!</li>
            <li> I have ingrown hair and razor bumps on my face and i was using b&amp;c and it was like kinda working but not that good so after I saw all these review about tend skin so I bought it and start using it and my face got worst with the razor bumps!!! This is a S***ty product, waste of money, and the alcohol on the product smell so strong. The seller is very and unprofessional, rude, and nasty!!! GOOD LUCK EVERYONE ;-)</li>
            <li> I read the rave reviews and it does the job of decreasing the appearance of razor bumps but it&#x27;s not a miracle worker like some people have indicated. It was expensive and I think probably could have gotten the same results by just using a $1 bottle of rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this for years and loves it. He says it cleared up his razor bumps and prevents new ones from forming.</li>
            <li> Tend skin works well for reducing redness and ingrown hairs after shaving, epilating and waxing. It doesn&#x27;t smell that great though, kind of like rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for both ingrown hairs on my legs as well as razor burn on my bikini area. I noticed a difference after only one week of using the product, and after 3 weeks everything cleared up completely! I am so happy with the results and will continue to use this. My only complaint is the price. For what is in this, it should NOT be so expensive.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend uses it regularly overnight for over an year, so she asked me to buy another flask (as we live in Brazil) during my latest business trip. Results are good, although some people overrate this product, there are no miracles, if you set your expectations right, should not disappoint.</li>
            <li> I used to get really bad bumps around my bikini line, but ever since starting this there has been a significant change. It&#x27;s not perfect, but I&#x27;m not embarrassed to wear swimsuits to the beach anymore. It does sting... a lot, I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple years now though and I&#x27;ve gotten used to the stinging so it&#x27;s not as bad anymore. I also use it on my underarms, but I haven&#x27;t quite gotten used to the stinging there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is a little higher than I would like to pay, but a little goes a long ways so it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why there are negative reviews. I used the expensive product from my wax salon and it didn&#x27;t work. I had at least ten ingrown hairs.  The salon told me I should not be waxed. I called my niece and she told me to buy this product. I used it for one week and all the ingrown hairs are gone. I went to the spa today and told my tech. She is going to buy it.  I love this product! I would completely recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I would not have expected anything so relatively simple to be so effective.  The ingredients as listed on the bottle: Isopropyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Acetylsalicylic Acid, Cyclomethicone, Glycerin, Diglycerin, Polysorbate 80.  Granted, it&#x27;s a lot of syllables for 7 ingredients, but that&#x27;s it.  My story?  I&#x27;m an African-American male, fairly dark skin (about the same complexion as Denzel Washington) that developed a dark patch just to the left of my lips.  The area couldn&#x27;t be more than a half square inch or so but it looked like many of the pictures I see for razor bumps, ingrown hairs, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want to go to a dermatologist because the co-pay for a visit is $50 for me.  So I tried this.  Turns out it saved me $30 and a lot of time and gas money.  I&#x27;ve only been using it maybe 4 days, but the hard, darker exterior is flaking off to reveal healthy, new skin underneath already.  Basically, I saturate one end of a Q-Tip and then rub it into the area.  (It burned... it&#x27;s not too painful, but if you&#x27;re using this on a small child, they&#x27;ll probably kick and scream.)  I do it again with the other end of the Q-Tip.  I repeated this about 3 times per day.  By about the 2nd day, I started seeing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eight ounces cost me $20 so it&#x27;s not cheap, but so far I&#x27;m only using it on a very tiny portion of my face.</li>
            <li> The best skin care hes said hes ever used. Will be buying more</li>
            <li> This is an effective product for anyone suffering from in-grown hairs. Put it on after you get out of the shower. Be consistent and patient. After a few days, the hairs come out on their own. Just resist the temptation to pick. It makes them worse not better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, instead of putting it on a cotton pad, put the product directly onto the skin. A little goes a long way. The cotton just soaks up what product and wastes it. A big bottle lasts me at least a year, and I use it often.</li>
            <li> i dont feel is working</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a friend who is an esthetician. She said she recommends it to all her waxing clients. It did nothing for me and smells like rubbing alcohol. I read in a blog that salicylic acid  (common in acne products) works well and have been using a neutragena product that sprays on and was much cheaper and have been seeing much better results.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING to stop the bumps, ingrown hairs, redness and irritation that comes from making my bikini line presentable for swimsuit season.  I tried sharp manual razors, electric razors, and every kind of shaving cream and skin treatment out there to treat the problem.  This is the ONLY THING THAT WORKS.  Does it smell nice? No, but the scent dissipates very quickly and your reward is bump-free skin after using this for just a few days, with none of the itching that typically accompanies regrowth after shaving.  As a bonus, this is also a wonderful thing to put on your feet before slipping into your favorite shoes because it keeps your feet nice and dry. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This product works very well. It does not work 100% on redness or bumps around my bikini line, but if I don&#x27;t use it then things get much worse.</li>
            <li> Razor burns and ingrown hairs are gross. This product has reduced them tremendously. It does burn when you apply after a fresh shave, but it goes away and fanning air helps. A little bit goes a long way. The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me. It doesn&#x27;t linger either. Works well for men and women. Your bikini line will thank you.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.</li>
            <li> Ultra-low price should have tipped me off. No lot # or exp. date either. Do not purchase from amazon.com or anyone other than TendSkin themselves.</li>
            <li> Great product and I highly recommend it for ladies and gentlemen to try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product that did the job and is  money well spent.when I run out of tend skin&lt;br /&gt;I plan on purchasing a second bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been battling ingrown hairs on the back of my neck for years. This seem to affect black men more than any other race. I tried all products after seeing a young lady on YouTube talk about this product. I didn&#x27;t have anything lose decided to give it a shot. After applying the Tend Skin all my Ingrown have now disappeared.</li>
            <li> This product has definitely helped with the razor bumps. I use it on my legs, underarms and bikini area. It stings a little, but it is something that you can get used to. However, you do need to use it in a ventilated are since the smell is slightly strong.</li>
            <li> Definitely helps relieve razor bumps. It burns a little like after shave, but not too bad!</li>
            <li> I bought these, they have been great, I could only get them on line since where I was heading they didn&#x27;t have them. Am African and the I can tell you the razor bumps have decreased and cleared as well, it has worked really well for me, I would definitely recommend it&lt;br /&gt;It stings but it does it&#x27;s job</li>
            <li> This product changed my life literally. I really need to be their spokesperson. I have been waxing my legs since I was 12, and then one day I started getting really bad ingrown hairs, The entire hair follicles would swell up to the size of silver dollars almost. I was so embarrassed, that I went to the dermatologist for help. Whatever they gave me didn&#x27;t work, until one day I was watching a morning show and one of the guests they had started talking about this product. I scrambled to get it and voila within a week&#x27;s time I was cured.  Now I recommend if any of you ladies are suffering from a severe case of folliculitis, you really need to apply this product 2x a day till you are healed. After that, prevention is key. Must apply before and after ( yes it burns) each wax session, but ingrown hairs will be no more.  I also find this product great for bug bites too. Dries them up super quick, plus the aspirin brings down the swelling.  I am forever gratefully to the people at Tendskin.</li>
            <li> Best solution for any razor burn ever.</li>
            <li> Good Stuff!  My kids love it for clearing up teenage acne.  We use this to refill the roller ball bottle.</li>
            <li> Great! Just what I had expected. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product, quick delivery and works just as described, Tend Skin has never disappointed its absolutely perfect effect on helping to eliminate razor bumps and painfu n grow hairs.</li>
            <li> The tend skin care solution is great at keeping you from getting razor bumps or ingrown hairs.  It is a great product</li>
            <li> Tend Skin is by far the best product I&#x27;ve used to treat my razor bumps! I&#x27;ve tried other products and nothing works as well as this! I&#x27;m a guy who likes his face clean shaven and the razor bumps were just ruining my dating chances, but I&#x27;ve had to fight the ladies off with a fly-swatter since I started using this product! And now with this new roll-on design they went over the top! I used to buy cotton pads to apply it on my skin and a lot of the solution was lost in the pad. But now I roll it on directly onto my skin without losing any solution! Great idea! Plus the roll-on bottle unscrews at the top so I can refill it once all the solution from the roll-on bottle is gone! I love it, thanks!!</li>
            <li> Its Great!! its actually working.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks now, an from the first use, it help clear an bring present ingrown hairs to surface.  Since then I&#x27;ve shaved twice and still no bumps, i love this an will continue to reorder an use this, it really work ya&#x27;ll.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve occasionally used this product during the summer months, for ingrown hairs or just a nice&lt;br /&gt;followup after shaving my legs. Every instance experiencing how remarkable this product (was )&lt;br /&gt; can be. The only annoyance was the brief odor that lingers when wet, after applying. My legs&lt;br /&gt;remained smooth without getting dry, as if I&#x27;m no longer in need of lotion, later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not certain if this particular item is counterfeit or reformulated by the manufacturer, but it in no&lt;br /&gt;way resembles the Tend Skin liquid I&#x27;m familiar with. In fact, I had a few drops left of the 4 oz bottle&lt;br /&gt;from a previous beauty store purchase. The scent, the strong isopropyl component, and finally Skin&lt;br /&gt;Drying effect of the product purchased at Amazon bears no likeness. Either I&#x27;ve been duped like so&lt;br /&gt; many whose complaints come before mine, or the manufacturer Or Seller, is laughing all the way to&lt;br /&gt;the bank.</li>
            <li> Great product!!!!! Notice a change within the first week!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome, I have been using it consistently for about six years now. I can see a noticeable difference when using.</li>
            <li> The best stuff ever!!</li>
            <li> What sorcery is this? Works unbelievably well. Use a small amount to minimize skin peeling.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to give everyone a heads up that this product is not apprived through the FDA.  My dermatologist did not recommend me to use it.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin on the neck and get razor burns using a blade or even from electric razors. I tried a lot of different remedies and Tend Skin is the one that works the best. I shave my head pretty close and I use it and the nape of the neck to prevent bumps there as well. Although it says to use day and night, I started using it only after shaving (every other day or so) and still works.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this product years ago when I was getting bikini waxes every other month.  The product worked great to prevent the itching and bumps after hair started growing back.  At another salon, they sold me Finipil for the same thing.  It was horrible.  $10 for a little tube and did little for the irritation.  Tend Skin has been the only product that works and is not expensive.  It&#x27;s normally about $20 for 8 oz. at Beauty Brands or other places offering salon products.  The bottle will last me 6 months using it every day.  I&#x27;ve gone back to shaving because it works so well.  No more $40 bikini waxes.</li>
            <li> Maybe not the \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; others say it is, but it definitely has made a difference. Also, amazon has a great price, considering that at Sephora the 8oz sells for $35 plus shipping.</li>
            <li> This product is far better than both Moore Unique &amp; Skin Tight! I have been able to maintain a clean shave (head &amp; beard) with few if any razor bumps &amp; ingrown hairs. It&#x27;s well worth the money &amp; I plan to purchase more as needed in the future.</li>
            <li> This product worked amazing. Within the first week i noticed a huge different in skin appearance.</li>
            <li> This product is the only thing that works. Don&#x27;t listen to the Tend Skin Web Site. It is the same product for half the price! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> its a good product but it did burn my skin a bit</li>
            <li> I originally bought Tend Skin just for my razor bumps and used it as a spot treatment. Once I started seeing great results, I ended up using it as a toner everyday. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years now, and I use it twice daily. All I do is take a small cotton ball, squeeze a little Tend Skin on it (a little goes a long way) and I gently apply it on all of my face and part of my neck. After, I apply my moisturizer and sunscreen. If I ever get a zit or if I feel one developing, I hold the cotton ball on that spot for a few seconds. The great thing about Tend Skin is that you can use it on all of your body. Apply it using the method I previously mentioned on any area that you shave.</li>
            <li> Swems to be the same as alcohol</li>
            <li> Tend Skin solution is a true winner.  It smells very skunky by does precisely what it is advertised to do.  My husband uses it after every shave and although he&#x27;s tried other brands, he keeps coming back to Tend Skin.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Works great on my neck, but I have to remember to use it!</li>
            <li> My son swears this is the best product on the planet and says it&#x27;s the only made that actually does what it&#x27;s suppose to do!  It&#x27;s worth the money because it really WORKS!  So the product justifies the price.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> Works so well seriously!!!!! Raving because I have been searching for a product that will get rid of razor bumps for FOREVER and the suffering is finally gone. I love this stuff!!!! Its amazzzzzinnnnggg</li>
            <li> Works pretty good on razor burns if u use it for few days right after shaving.  Bottle goes kind of quick especially she shaving more in spring</li>
            <li> Tend Skin worked great on my teenaged son&#x27;s razorbumps. Boughtnthis in conjunction with the refillabe roll on. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> This product is EXCELLENT for acne on your shoulders or head. I&#x27;m on testosterone replacement therapy and head and body acne are common issues. This product came highly recommend by my physician. This stuff works much better than Neutrogena T-gel shampoo plus it can be used for red irritated skin from shaving too. A fantastic all-around product!</li>
            <li> Its okay doesn&#x27;t really work. The main reason is that it contains alcohol. Any product that contains alcohol somewhat  will dry out the bumps but harden the skin. Therefore, the hair follicle cannot break through the skin and your bumps will still be there.</li>
            <li> A lil pricey but does cleans face real good.</li>
            <li> Tend Skin really works.</li>
            <li> good choice for sensative skin</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and a good product.</li>
            <li> Great for controlling facial razor bumps...can&#x27;t beat the price. They want more for a bottle half the size at the flea market</li>
            <li> I use this every time I shave and so far it has worked well.</li>
            <li> This product really does prevent in grown hairs! I use it often and would recommend it to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> If you have folliculitis or even just body acne I would definitely recommend this product for clearing it! It totally cleared my back and butt, better than my prescription products. I do like the roller version better though. I wish this was available in more stores!</li>
            <li> I have used this twice a day for a few days and I already notice the difference. This product works.</li>
            <li> This is great on the worst in grown hairs! For the most stubborn though I have to use it about 3 times a day instead of the one time. Be careful because after shaving or waxing it does burn and tingle, but if you wait a day or two then it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I had basically given up on all treatment, but then i saw all the people who had bought this. I also saw the GREAT reveiw so I thought okay why not. I had given up and told myself that I would get hair removal treatment when I got older ( im only 23) . I gave up on wearing bikinis or even cropped tops because of the ingrown hairs and razor bumps i got that scarred and left marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I ordered the smallest bottle of this and immediately started using it. I was scared of the burning but it honestly DOES NOT BURN ME... at all. i use a normal amount just squirt a bit on a cotton ball morning and night. IT WORKS LIKE MAGIC. i dont know HOW OR WHY OR WHAT it does but it works.... I promise. you may think you have it bad, but that&#x27;s what I thought until i started using this. I&#x27;ve also only been using it for 2 weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it. Wish i&#x27;d found it sooner.</li>
            <li> This stuff works. Will always buy again.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 20 yrs and I love it.  it prevents ingrown hairs just like it says it does. so long as I have to shave I will use this.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this would work as some other people have suggested.  I think it has helped reduce razor burn, but I have very sensitive skin and didn&#x27;t see the total elimination that others reported.</li>
            <li> Wow. I was praying for a miracle, and this is it!!!!! I have an unfortunately fast grow bikini line and the frequent shaving results in terrible razor burn and in grown hairs. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of things, but have always had to avoid wearing bathing suits mid summer because it is just so embarassing. I ordered this out of desperation... and bam! No more redness AT ALL. I have also noticed a reduction in in grown hairs, and I waxed yesterday, but this on afterwards, and woke up this morning with only some slight redness. This costs a ton, but even for this frugal fanny it is so far WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> Still have ingrown hair and red bumps after waxing. Also, made my skin dry!! I wasn&#x27;t even able to return it due to hazard liquid): . So disappointed due to the high rating this product has.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding this item.  But I decided to look it up on amazon.Low and behold there it was.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for relief after a shave.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that TendSkin doesn&#x27;t work, because it absolutely does. I have thick hair and fight with razor burn and ingrowns every time I shave. It really prevents them--more so than any product I&#x27;ve tried. However, the expense is crazy. I found a recipe for a &amp;#34;knock-off&amp;#34; online, and it works just as well at pennies on the dollar. There&#x27;s no need to buy this expensive product, when a little rubbing alcohol, aspirin and witch hazel does the same thing.</li>
            <li> It seems to help but the suggested application with a cotton ball or swab isn&#x27;t ideal. Leaves shreds of the cotton on my beard. Maybe a rolling ball applicator or something. I guess that would limit it for multiple users and drive the cost up.</li>
            <li> Works like magic on the bikini zone! Careful though, with excessive use it can lead to dry, chemically burned skin.</li>
            <li> Never has anything worked on the horrible razor burn I would get after shaving.  Tend Skin is AMAZING!!!  As soon as I put it on the bumps go away.  I have also noticed that after using this for a few months I rarely even get razor burn anymore.  It is great for the bikini line!</li>
            <li> But seriously, this is the only product that has ever worked for me, finally. 23 y/o white male with course thick blonde hair. I would get at least one ingrown hair every time I shaved that would last for weeks or months. I tried electric shaving, different shave gels/creams, different razors..everything. I now shave every other day with a single blade razor, Aveno shave cream and put this on my problem areas with a cotton swab afterwards. If I do get ingrown hairs they stay very small and are gone within a few days with this stuff...and that&#x27;s IF I get them.</li>
            <li> This product seems to work for the redness associated with ingrown hair.  Seems to help if used after shaving for prevention.</li>
            <li> If you have ingrown hairs, you NEED this product in your life. This is a miracle and works within a week by a month you will be super pleased with your results! Don&#x27;t hesitate and keep walking around with an unsightly area get this :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost scared to write a review on this product because of how well its worked for me and i dont want to jinx myself here.    I&#x27;ve been using tend skin for 2 months now, and im a young latin american male, but my skin is more comparable to an african american male.  So i have very thick hair and lots and lots of razor bumps.    At least.. i USED to.    By all means, this did not work for me overnight.  But i used it twice a day, and followed it with a nice face lotion to prevent my skin from drying and shortly after a week or two i started noticing some amazing differences.    On top of that, i now believe that what i used to think was bad acne (mostly on the cheeks and neck) was also connected to bad razor bumps as well.  This solution has cleared my skin almost entirely of razor bumps and acne.  It&#x27;s been almost a month now since i have used tweezers to pull out ingrown hairs.    My process is simple, shave at night with a single blade disposable razor, follow it with tend skin all over my face.   And i use it again in the morning.  It might not be the same for everyone but this has worked for me, and i gotta say, its about time.  I feel like i&#x27;ve been suffering and fighting my face for the last ten years of my life is nice to not have to worry about this anymore.    Like i said, i did not want to write this review because i didint want to jinx myself, but i definitely owe it to people who suffer from bad acne and painful ingrown hairs and razor bumps.  This has worked for me and my skin, and although it may not work for you, you should try it and not give up like i almost did.    Im very happy.  and stop touching your face!</li>
            <li> I have used this product before so I knew when I ordered it that it would work.  It prevents in grown hair as well as treating ones you may already have.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the vinegar-like smell that the product has.  I prefer a product from my salon that does the same thing with a pleasant aroma but it is more expensive so I use Tend Skin when money is tighter!</li>
            <li> Love it. Stops in grown hairs. No ingrown hairs since I&#x27;ve been using this amazing. Also lightens my under arms.</li>
            <li> Great stuff been using it for 15yrs</li>
            <li> Helps a lot been using it for a week now and can see some improvements</li>
            <li> I have been using Tend Skin for 4 years. This was the first time I ordered the product from Amazon, and what I received smells like Rubbing Alcohol. I used the product after getting out of the shower like I always do and could immediately tell that this was not the real thing. There was no stinging sensation. Going to send this back! Beware fellow shoppers and Tend Skin lovers.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product but after trying it a couple of times, it actually worked. Me using this product resulted in no ingrown hair and no hideous bumps. Trust and believe me, that I definitely will be buying more and recommend others to try this product out!</li>
            <li> For someone who struggles with razor burn down there, this makes a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend who has one of the cleanest shaved faces and bald heads I&#x27;ve ever seen. He told me it was an excellent after shave and he&#x27;d never broken out from it nor had razor burn. I bought some for my father for holiday and he is now hooked. I see an improvement in his skin. I&#x27;ve recently begun to use the product as an after-shave on my legs.</li>
            <li> Love it! Works so well.</li>
            <li> This stuff works very well. I used to get irritations after I shaved my neck but when I use this after shaving I have no problems. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I am a Black Hispanic with mildly sensitive skin. Ever since I first started shaving as a teenager, I noticed that I would get unsightly razor bumps after shaving. I used to dab rubbing alcohol as a remedy but as I got older and had to shave more frequently, the alcohol wasn&#x27;t doing the trick. Especially since I needed to start using other products on my face to keep it healthy and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started purchasing TendSkin after seeing a wealth of positive online reviews about it along with mentions in various articles regarding skin care for men. The first time I used this product, it was after showering first and then shaving, hoping that having open pores would help absorb the treatment better. I was impressed, I saw no razor bumps after the following days after shaving nor did I feel any itching, burning, or small patches of irritated skin. I continued to follow the practice of shaving after showering or at least giving my pores a chance to open up first before shaving and using TendSkin right after, that is, until one day when I was in a rush and forgot to do so completely. I had shaved quickly and was worried that the inconsistent strokes would cause irritation and lead to razor bumps. Nevertheless, I dabbed the TendSkin on my face immediately after and experienced the same results, not razor bumps, no irritation, no red spots, and no itchiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using TendSkin for about four years now and it has allowed me to focus on clearing away the dark spots and blemishes left behind by my previous razor bumps. I haven&#x27;t suffered from any razor bumps since I started using it, even on my most problem areas such as my chin and jawline. It does sting after usage, but that&#x27;s always going to happen when alcohol comes into contact with open skin. However, it isn&#x27;t a painful sting, it&#x27;s more like a &amp;#34;it&#x27;s working&amp;#34; sting. Unfortunately, TendSkin is a very expensive product but I&#x27;ve found that I&#x27;ve lasted on the 4oz bottles for 6+ months so you do get a great value for what you&#x27;re paying for. I have found that it is cheapest either on Amazon or at WalMart; I noticed that other stores such as Target and Walgreens charge anywhere from $16.99 - $18.99 for the 4oz. bottles. Amazon also has this product available in packs of two that apparently fluctuates in price (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004V50XHA/ref&#x3D;od_aui_detailpages00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1) but I&#x27;ve caught it priced at $20 with Prime for two 4oz. bottles which is an amazing deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product for both men and women who have trouble with razor bumps/burns or have sensitive skin.o you do get a great value for what you&#x27;re paying for.

            <li> I thought it was okay, my fingers got dried out from it though so i recommend that you be careful</li>
            <li> I bought this from eStores-LLC. They sent me a product that was expired 6-months, which I didn&#x27;t realize until after I&#x27;d used it some.&lt;br /&gt;Whether the product is really useful, I cannot say. But it didn&#x27;t really help me.</li>
            <li> I have to say... this is the best product I&#x27;ve purchased for razor bumps. I haven&#x27;t had any on my bikini line since I started using this. This is way more effective than bikini zone. I love it!!! Will definitely keep buying.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great to prevent ingrown hairs as well as razor burn. I use it everyday on my bikini area and even my underarms. I def recommend it!</li>
            <li> Smells Bad, but great in every other way.</li>
            <li> This has saved my life- amazing product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years and it is great! The travel size roll-on is very convenient.</li>
            <li> Tend skin is the best, a great product.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product. Helps with ingrown hairs slightly and i do use it after shaving. However I do still find myself digging out hairs with tweezers or a needle in the end.</li>
            <li> This stuff is as good as advertised, used it for the bikini area for my wife and saw no razor bumps or ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> Great product for ingrown hair on face. Good for bumps on bikini line.</li>
            <li> I can never complain with this product except the dryness. Better than I used to be after shaving.</li>
            <li> Yes, it works. I was skeptical, as I have reeeaellly bad ingrown hairs, but this does work. I expect that it works by burning off a layer of skin that causes ingrown hairs, and yes it does burn, but not that bad. It&#x27;s worth it, trust me. When I use it my only complaint is the bathroom smells like chemicals for an hour after. Yes, I will buy again. Must be used with cotton balls on dry skin.</li>
            <li> Great product. I remember seeing my dad use it as a kid and now that I&#x27;m older, I totally understand the benefits. I have very curly hair so I would always get ingrown hairs and after 3 weeks of use, I haven&#x27;t had one. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> It work...Hair bumps are not nearly as severe. Daily use is suggested.</li>
            <li> Bumpstopper worked until one day it didn&#x27;t.  A friend recommended this product and I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try.  The stinging sensation takes a little getting used to but hardly bothers me anymore.  I have used this product successfully for 3 years to prevent bothersome razor bumps.  I still get an occasional one or two razor bumps every few months, but that&#x27;s far better success than any other product gave me.  This product eliminates those tiny razor bumps you get around the neck area that make your face look like freshly plucked chicken skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use those disposable Bic plastic 2 blade razors that I toss out after 4 uses. After shaving  I put a quarter sized amount of tend skin on a hand towel and use that to apply all over my beard areas (seems to work much better than using your palms).</li>
            <li> Excellent for ingrown hairs. It makes them come out. It&#x27;s not for the scars though. It arrived in perfect condition just two days after I ordered it. Best price option I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> Awesome product...&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very sensitive and during a shave my skin gets super red and I got real bad razor bumps. This stuff does the trick, haven&#x27;t had red skin or bumps since using this product. Will buy more</li>
            <li> I recently started Epilating because I got such horrible breakouts from shaving. The epilator helped but only still got breakouts.... Just not as bad. Desperate, I tried Tend Skin. After the FIRST time putting it on, I noticed almost a 100 percent improvement in my skin. I am totally amazed by and greatful for this product!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Does just what it claims to do.  Prevents those razor bumps and burns that are so uncomfortable.  I used it with the shave gel.</li>
            <li> It was a wonderful online shopping experience. The product works great. I use it every day. It does sting a little, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Terrible product. The item caused me a bad allergy I ended up throwing the product away.</li>
            <li> Makes shaving aftercare a breeze.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend for women and men.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed in this product. I have a terrible problem with razor bumps, and from the rave reviews, I expected this to help. When it didn&#x27;t, and irritated my razor bumps worse than they already were, I realized that this product is made up of mostly alcohol and witch hazel, which are both extremely irritating to skin. I heard deodorant works for razor bumps, so I tried that, and it did indeed work with no irritation. Next time I will check if a product contains a high percentage of alcohol.</li>
            <li> waiting for the results</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying that, not even a $300 prescribed cream solved my ingrown hair problem. I was suffering from continuous ingrown on my left cheek and even went to the dermatologist. I bought other porducts and when i saw Tend Skin i was way skeptical due to its price.&lt;br /&gt;After reading numerous reviews i went for it and, boy let me tell you that after a few weeks of using it my ingrown problems are gone.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this problem because it absolutely works..&lt;br /&gt;(&#x27;.&#x27;)</li>
            <li> I bought this several months ago to help with ingrown hairs and redness. I use it all the time and I still get the ingrown hairs. It doesn&#x27;t even reduce them. There is no effect at all. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this. I tried it out and it was definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly what I was looking for and came just as described. It really does help with razor burn (although it stings when you apply it right after shaving.) It arrived in a timely manner. I am very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> For the longest time I would always get little red bumps after I shave, and a nice red neck. (bumps were on the neck too) I use this after shaving my neck with a single blade razor and skin looks great during the day. No more red bumps! I actually must thank Adam Carolla for mentioning it on his podcast. Thanks Ace Man!</li>
            <li> reduces redness completely. make sure you don&#x27;t use a lot at once because it will give off a strong alcohol scent</li>
            <li> Best premade you can find</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple products for razor bumps, and this is by far the best!</li>
            <li> very good for ingrown treatment and irritation</li>
            <li> I no longer buy expensive creams, lotions or cosmetics, but this is one beauty product I will not do without. I use it on my legs and upper arms. Makes my skin smooth, smooth, smooth and no more ingrowns.</li>
            <li> So effective with razor bumps, ingrown hair. My husband and I truly like the product. Will be placing another order soon.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to product for razor burns and other shaving/waxing-induced ingrown hairs/bumps. It only takes a little bit of the product to take care of it so well. Just a piece of advice: don&#x27;t use directly after shaving/waxing, as it will irritate the skin. I use it after showering the day or two after shaving/waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a year and have repurchased several bottles so I feel qualified to write a review. Does it work? eh...only a little. I noticed a slight reduction in ingrown hairs, but nothing to jump up for over joy over. Eventually, I grew tired of spending the money on this and stopped buying. The only thing that has helped with the incessant razor bumps under my arms has been laser hair removal. Though I do notice regrowth of hair, growth is much slower and the hair is much finer so I don&#x27;t even develop razor bumps anymore because the hair is so fine. And because I don&#x27;t need to shave as often, I don&#x27;t experience razor burn. Yes, laser hair removal is expensive, but cheaper than using this product for the rest of my life! In general, I don&#x27;t recommend this product because it doesn&#x27;t work well enough to warrant the steep price tag.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that helps to sooth my skin after a shave.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Tend Skin for more then 10 years now and it is an absolute must for me!!</li>
            <li> I have been cursed with razor burn since I have started shaving, particularly around the bikini area. I had started to wax, but got a free sample of this. Wow! I can shave without worrying about gross bumps. I do have to use it regularly to work. Definitely a 5 star product!</li>
            <li> I am a woman with a long hairline, and have a short haircut, so my neck requires a close shave with a razor.  My stylist recommended this product.  I use it every day.  It is also great for clearing blemishes!</li>
            <li> It really helps remove the unsightly bumps and the little freckles caused by nicks during shaving! It also exfoliates my skin, making it even smoother and clearer than before! It&#x27;s really nice to know that I don&#x27;t have to deal with ingrown hairs anymore!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything for me but burn.</li>
            <li> This works so much better than products I have purchased at stores.</li>
            <li> Wonderful. The  razor bumps have disappeared after 3rd application. Advice - You need to come up with a better applicator/dispenser.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Someone recommended it and after seeing how much it was, I was skeptical. But I bought it anyway and I&#x27;m glad I did, money well spent. Apply using a cotton ball all over the legs, works beautifully. Only concern is nail polish, it kinda ruins your mani so use those locking dental clips scissors, hemastats (sp?) They work great.</li>
            <li> Long before the internet, this stuff was a trade secret amongst dermatologists and hair stylists.  That&#x27;s how I first heard of it - through a friend who styled hair.  I have wicked bad razor burn on my face.  Curly hair will do that to ya.  I have been using this stuff for many years now, and it&#x27;s great.  When you first get it, you use it once in the morning and once at night.  It will kill off all the dead skin on your face - it&#x27;s a little scary.  Then, over time, you just use it once after shaving and viola: your razorburn will decrease dramatically.  My face is far smoother with this stuff, and I never get acne anymore - almost never.  This stuff is made from several different alcohol bases, and all that stuff dries out your skin and tightens it up, so you also get fewer wrinkles.  It&#x27;s my secret to staying young while all my friends look like they&#x27;ve been chain-smoking marlboros for years!</li>
            <li> Great product for refilling the roll on tend skin care container.  This is the only product I can actually say it helps with my razor bumps.  I am a white male and have been suffering from bad, painful, sore, red razor bumps on my neck for almost 10 years. I have tried every product on the market from high time bump stopper, to bump stopper razors, to acne medicine, to shaving in the shower, to praying to God.  If you suffer from razor bumps give this product a try, what do you have to lose?  I used it twice a day for several months then noticed my skin started to dry up so I backed it down to once a day after shaving.  I saw improvements after about a week of using.  When I first got it I would put it on after shaving then again in the morning.  It smells strongly of rubbing alcohol but once it dries on your face/neck the odor goes away.  It burns once you put it on after shaving or on open cuts but to me I guess that means its working.  A little pain for little to no razor bumps is worth it to me.</li>
            <li> Love this product use this on a daily and it has removed my ingrown hairs. will buy this product again great seller.</li>
            <li> I suffer from red and painful neckline where my collar of any shirt touches my neck. As my freshly shaved neck hair grows back, it makes ingrown hairs and significant pain wherever the shirt touched my neck line. This product healed me literally overnight and I was almost in tears due to happiness. I was considering laser hair removal and this did the trick instead. Stop looking and order this product.</li>
            <li> Tend Skin was introduced to me by a friend. I have always had bumps all over after I trim. I have been dealing with this problem for a very long time. I had used every bump products on the market but nothing seem to work. But atlas here comes Tend Skin. This product stings like alcohol but it does the job. I am bump free now.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift from my Mom for Christmas and have been using ever since.  Works great so far and I noticed a difference right away.  I have had an issue with Razor bumps off and on over many years.  So far my face has been getting better every day most of them are now gone.    However I also received a new Gillette Mach 5 Razor which from my Fiancee.  I am sure this new razor and shaving cream have made a huge impact on preventing  future Razor bumps and razor burn.  I have been using this razor after Christmas as well  and have not had to change the blades yet either.   If you have razor burn I would highly recommend using both a good quality razor as well as Tend Skin  both have made a huge difference in my case.</li>
            <li> This is the best product on the market for razor bumps, rash, etc.  it works wonders and makes your skin smooth!</li>
            <li> I used this after shaving and it stings like crazy. It&#x27;s too smelly for daily use. I&#x27;m not sure if it made much of a difference in my skin. If it was milder and smelled better I would use it more often and perhaps see better results.</li>
            <li> I used this stuff for about 2 years before stopping.  First of all, it&#x27;s really expensive - and really easy to make yourself (cheaper) according to my sister who is in pharmacy school.  Second of all, it burns like hellllll. I even have a fair pain tolerance.  Thirdly, I stopped because it didn&#x27;t seem to be working like it used to.  I switched to Anthony&#x27;s logistics for men - still expensive but doesn&#x27;t sting and works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> My son gets red bumps all over his back and behind from wearing sports equipment and sweating.  This stuff is terrific and really helps to smooth down the bumps. He uses it every night before going to bed. He applies it with a cotton ball.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and I love it. My neck area gets a lot of in grown hairs and this product not only prevents them but also alleviates the irritation. Follow directions and use as often as possible. Problem will not disappear but if you use this, you will have no redness and no irritation.</li>
            <li> When I ordered, my Tend Skin got to me in a timely manner, but it expired in 07/2007.</li>
            <li> This really works at clearing up the not-so-attractive bumps from waxing.  I haven&#x27;t found another product that works as well.</li>
            <li> I stopped using this for a while and tried Zirhs &amp;#34;post shave solution&amp;#34; and I started getting razor burn and bumps on my neck. Went back to this and in a week it was all gone. Excellent product if you have a hard beard or like to shave against the grain to get a closer shave.</li>
            <li> Does a great job in reducing razor bumps.</li>
            <li> I cannot attest to the ability of the product. The odor was so intolerable that I used it only a few times and decided it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> It does what it says it does, it reduces the appearance of ingrown hairs, but if you have sensitive skin like I do I would not recommend this product it made my skin start peeling off and it was slightly painful, it stung tremendously and it burned a little, if you are using this for your legs I recommend this, but not under your arms upper thighs or never on your bikini lines and if your a guy NEVER I REPEAT NEVER USE THIS ON YOUR FACE.  Enjoy using this product but proceed with caution.</li>
            <li> The very first time I ordered it, it did take a few applications for my skin to adjust. It works. Now if only I can hide the remaining dark spots... :)</li>
            <li> Fantastic product all around.</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff now for years and can&#x27;t say good enough about it. It does what it says, just give it some time. I only suggest you buy the roll on after this big bottle and refill it save on product when using.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I used to get razor burn all the time and now I don&#x27;t when I apply this directly after I&#x27;ve shaved!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s product does exactly was it says it does... No red bumps or  irritation marks.I have extremely sensitive skin that always breaks out after waxing and shaving and this product prevents it completely!!</li>
            <li> I used it to clear some razor bumps on my legs. It worked ok, but it didn&#x27;t clear the dark marks.</li>
            <li> tend skin works miracles. I always get razor burn and swear by this remedy. I have tried several things and this definitely works the best</li>
            <li> This stuff does smell like vinegar, but who cares? It is beyond excellent.  I have used it for years and it is honestly the only product that ever worked for me.  I have incredibly sensitive skin and shaving or waxing would leave unsightly and sometimes painful bumps for days.  I use Tend Skin everyday and no more rash!  It&#x27;s expensive, but worth it - and a little goes a long way.  They also have a roll-on applicator available which is a little more convenient (no cotton balls needed).  And I think it uses less product to roll it on because ALL of it goes on your skin - none is wasted in the cotton ball or pad.</li>
            <li> I have always had horrible, horrible ingrown hairs and tiny inflamed razor bumps. My hair is very thick and very dark. I had my first Brazilian wax at 18 and the woman told me that my skin was extremely sensitive and that I was shaving too frequently. Thing is, I only shaved once a week (otherwise it was too painful), while my friends shaved two, even three, times a week. A couple of years later I began laser hair removal of the bikini area to help with the razor bumps/burn/ingrowns. Having fair skin and dark, thick hair, I was the perfect candidate for this. After about 8 or 9 treatments and three different types of lasers and hardly noticeable improvement, I stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I switched waxing salons, I went in and happened to have a cyst down there (which had only happened once before). I spoke to her about my issues with the razor burn and what not and asked if there was anything she suggested. She pointed me to Tend Skin. $20 for 4 oz. was not my cup of tea, though. I&#x27;m flat out cheap. But since I was gearing up for a vacation I decided just this one time. Nothing had worked before, or only very slightly improved the condition of my skin (BikiniZone, in particular), and I honestly did not have much hope for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, I found it a pain to do morning and night with a cotton ball and used it inconsistently. It didn&#x27;t do much. A year later I revisited the bottle. At this point I was much better at having a consistent beauty routine and I had just had a waxing done that left me battling HORRIBLE ingrown hairs for two whole months, even when I completely stopped shaving in hopes to let everything heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt absolutely hopeless in this area. I generally am strict about using only completely natural beauty products. I use natural shampoo bars, dry shampoo, I make my own lotions, moisturizers, toners, ect.. but after those hellish two months and a year of trying to make dry brushing followed by moisturizing with oils,sugar scrubs, and witch hazel work, I broke down and decided I should revisit Tend Skin - especially since I&#x27;d paid a pretty penny for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, particularly since it didn&#x27;t seem to help much before. But with consistent use, this stuff was seriously effective. I was so amazed. I would say I have a 95% improvement from using Tend Skin. I am still not thrilled about the price (even though it is much cheaper on Amazon) nor the fact that it lacked more wholesome ingredients - but I have to say that it is certainly worth it for me. I will likely continue searching for a more natural alternative, but this is my one vice, my one exception to the rule because it alleviates so much pain, itching, ugliness, shame, and emotional distress for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I urge anyone to try it if this is a problematic issue for you. Just make sure you are consistent. I started off using it every morning and night between each shave (approximately one week). After the first time I began cutting back to find the least number of applications required for it to work. For me, it only takes an application every morning and night for the first 2-3 days after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does sting when you apply it right after shaving, and can sting in the following applications, as well. The more your skin heals from shaving, the less it stings. It&#x27;s not terrible though, the worst is right after shaving. I&#x27;ve not had peeling as others have, but I can certainly see that being a by-product of using this.</li>
            <li> Once in a while I get a bad (and by bad I mean deep, red, painful &amp; swollen) ingrown hair. My doctor told me to put Neosporin on it, but that didn&#x27;t get rid of the ingrown, or bring down the swelling or pain even just a little bit. After looking for decently-priced ingrown treatments online, I tried a bottle of Tend Skin that I found on ebay. Since then, Tend Skin is my go-to for ingrowns. It is very strong and has been the only product that I&#x27;ve seen results with. It doesn&#x27;t immediately completely get rid of ingrown hairs, but it definitely starts the healing process. I usually just put a few drops on a cotton ball, apply to the infected area, and within hours the swelling goes down and it starts to fade away. I don&#x27;t know what I ever did without this stuff! You can&#x27;t always find the best deals on ebay, as you have to constantly check back to see if any new bottles were listed, but Amazon has great prices from lots of different sellers. Try it!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27; t do it for me at all. Instead of helping, my situation has gotten worse.Thanks God, I am all clear now.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my son, it is nit the first time we have purchased but it is the first time from this company. I chose them because they were having a sale for 2 bottles at a better price than everyone else had for 1 bottle. the shipment came extremely fast and I was very pleased</li>
            <li> Husband had bad problem with razor burn.  This solved the problem completely.  Good stuff; a little on the expensive side.</li>
            <li> This stuff has done exactly what it claims to do. It has cured my issues with ingrown hairs and irritated, pissy skin post-shaving. It takes about a week, maybe two, to fully kick in, but once it does, you can kiss off your skin problems. Regardless of my other products or shaving method, Tend Skin has kept my skin clear and sexy. No joke. I apply this to only my neck after I shower, then again before bed. I use the roller-ball that came with my original order. Make life much easier vs. the cotton-ball method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To summarize: I highly recommend this for anyone who fights with shaving irritation and/or ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> This does not really work.  It&#x27;s really pretty much just alcohol, and because of that it stings.  I would put up with the stinging if it worked, it does not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a REALLY bad problem with razor burn.  I&#x27;ve tried darn near everything.  Last night I was able to try this.&lt;br /&gt;Considering the things that I have been using to stop my legs from itching, this barely stung.  It stopped after a few minutes and it was so barely noticeable that I didn&#x27;t think it was working.  It wasn&#x27;t until I woke up this morning and my legs weren&#x27;t itching and they hadn&#x27;t been all night that I realized that it worked!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this if anything changes with long term use but so far, I love, love, love, love this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had issues with razor bumps &amp; burns going on five years, never really finding a product thst works. Complete change during the first week of buying this products. My bumps disappeared. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Tend Skin is great for razor burns.  I love having a beard, but get some pretty serious razor burn on my neck.  Tend skin clears it right up, and if I stay on top of using it I never even get it.  Great product that is a little pricey but I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Helps a lot with razor burn or ingrown hair. I use this product on my armpits to deal with razor burn and on my bikini line to prevent in-growns as my hair regrows between waxes.</li>
            <li> I was told by a friend to use this product because I constantly go shaving bumps on the bikini area.  I tried it and was happy with the results.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love this products it works good on the hidden hairs on my chin area. I will recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Long time user of this product. I don&#x27;t like the idea that this product keeps going up so much in price. I might have to find an alternative if prices keep increasing.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is so expensive and out of stock locally. It is 17 dollars for half the amount at walgreens. I will not shave without having it. It is wonderful...5 stars is not enough. I have been using it for years.&lt;br /&gt;I am a female and it keeps away bikini line razor bumps.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. I bought this from the spa I go to for waxing and it works great for my bikini area. Thanks to Amazon I can get it on here for 1/3 the price. I even got my bro to use it for his razor burn.</li>
            <li> been using this product for years. It works best for preventing and treating razor burn</li>
            <li> This product really works! I am absolutely dumbfounded as to how and why it works! Would&#x27;ve gave it five stars if it got rid of ALL my bumps on the back of my neck, but still a few (3-4) remain. But overall am very satisfied with it. This will be in my bathroom every summer from now on when I shave my head</li>
            <li> For any African-American male that has to shave, this is a must have product. I have experimented with many other products for years and this is definitely the best to avoid razor bumps and to maintain smooth skin. I immediately noticed the difference as soon as I began using it.  Well worth the sticker price and just be sure to use it after every shave.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff and think it works. Beware of drying from over use. And you definitely want to get the roll on applicator, which is sold separately to help with applying and to prevent evaporation by putting only small amounts at a time in the applicator.</li>
            <li> I am a dolt. Basically, I paid $20 for rubbing alcohol. This stuff is a rip-off. Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful. This along with a moisturizer and a loofa in the shower will truthfully get rid of your ingrown hairs. I can actually wear shorts in the summer now without being embarrassed. I use this once a day now (be careful not to use too often and scrub too vigorously in the shower- it can start to irritate your skin) along with moisturizer. You need the moisturizer because this will dry your skin out. This has now become a staple in my routine, my legs look and feel great.</li>
            <li> Phenomenal product. I use to refil the rollerball that came with my very first purchase of Tend Skin at a waxing boutique. A little goes a long way and one bottle lasts forever.  I&#x27;ve never been razor bump free since I started shaving (being a dark haired italian) until discovering this product. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My wife has tried a few other types of products to prevent ingrown hairs and says this one does the best job.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for both men &amp; women. I would recommend to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It sure does burn when applied, but it works so well.</li>
            <li> I a reading some of the reviews with the 1 and 2 stars, folks are on here saying the products price is increasing over the years while the product appears to be becoming more diluted &amp; less effective. Well I am still on my same 16oz Bottle I purchased months ago (its half way done), and I use my cotton balls along with this stuff after ever shave once or 2x a day along my bikini line and groin area (thats where the ugly shaving bumps come, &amp; there is nothing more embarassing to myself to see that along with the irritation and itching that comes along with shaving). I use a EPILATOR on my underarms- THAT also causes ingrown hairs, but not as bad as the shaving my bikini area. I dont have to use TEND SKIN as much under my arms as I do my bikini area, because the last thing I want is Razor Bumps in my bikini area especially when I am sexually active-soooo THIS STUFF is the answer. If my friends ask of a Razor bump solution I will tell them DESITIN ointment (yes- the diaper rash ointment) Tee Tree oil, or TEND SKIN. Those are some of the best thing for preventing &amp;/or treating RAZOR BUMPS &amp; irritation. I used TEND SKIN when I first got it but then I stopped. The peeling skin turned me off at first, it was when I saw the peeling skin that I knew how it worked so well at preventing the bumps. It simply works as a skin exfoliant. This means that the surface layer of skin is eliminated (peeled off), this makes it so the hair doesnt get the chance to grow &amp; curl underneath the skin layers. I find that the using TEND SKIN method works better than using an exfoliating scrub or exfoliant pad to scrub. Applying Tend Skin is a very simple way to get rid of those ugly nasty bumps that seem to plague African American/ Black people because of our curly hair textures for Centuries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For awhile my big (half used)16 oz bottle of TEND SKIN has been sitting on my Vanity with \\&quot;occassional\\&quot; usage. But most recently I got so tired of razor irritation &amp; the bumps that follows it Iactually grew out my pubic hairs as if in some form of liberated womens protest against shaving LOL. The downside to that is ODOR (Lots of pubic hair &#x3D; ODOR.) So I had to shave it neatly and clean as I have been doing for so many years prior &amp; just like I like it! But I would start back using my TEND SKIN (as directed on the bottle). And I dont mind the peeling one bit either. This time I am sticking to it! Its been great in eliminating irritation, and razor bumps! Its worth every penny spent on it.</li>
            <li> I am totally pleased with Tend Skin.  It does what it says it will do, so no more bumps and ingrown hairs.  Pease at last!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product that helps reduce redness and swelling from stubborn ingrown hairs (4+ weeks old) around sensitive areas within days with once-daily application and even gets rid of regular pimples on the face overnight (added bonus for me!). I really wanted to give this stuff 5 stars, but the smell is so harsh and caustic that I practically need to hold my breath while using it. Also, be very very careful if you have any open cuts from shaving or epilating, because Tend Skin will burn like crazy. Still, I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> After years of trying different products, The Art Of Shaving, skin tight products, etc... and no results, this one gave me hardly any razor bumps or ingrown hairs the first time I&#x27;d tried it, I read the instructions, did what it said, used it day and night, I was amazed by this product, it really works, it might be a little expensive but its worth a try. And it work for me, it might work for you as well, don&#x27;t go to any cosmetics stores, very over priced, cheapest place is here at amazon.</li>
            <li> Oedered this because I was tired of having ingrown hairs and product worked wonderfully. It only took about 3 days for all of them to disappear I woulda gave 5 stars but as a heads up it Burns a little as I think its made mostly of prue alcohol.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product. From razor burns to ingrown hairs to fading dark spots  it works on just about anything.</li>
            <li> I tried everything before this product but still no good results. This product is like magic put it on after a shave or wax and maybe a couple of time after that and its smooth sailing. I even told all my guy friends about this</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son because I heard rave reviews. He was greatly disappointed. It appeared watered down (not potent) and didn&#x27;t work at all. I&#x27;ve found recipes online for homemade Tend Skin that&#x27;s made with alcohol and aspirin and it seems to work much better. I found this product way too expensive and not worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never felt the need to write a review for anything I&#x27;ve purchased my whole life but I felt I should for this and for people who have suffered as I have.  I&#x27;ve had problems with razor burn and ingrown hairs on my neck for almost a decade now. Nothing I tried worked until this. This is no miracle liquid but using this alongside proper shaving techniques and showering before shaving actually work wonders. I used it each morning and night for a few weeks and now just apply a bit before I sleep every few days or so. This really keeps the bumps away. I no longer need to feel embarrassed and feel confident after shaving. If you are having problems with razor burn just give this a try, its not overly expensive and truly did help me.</li>
            <li> It was used by a young black male, who has pretty severe razor bumps and ingrown hairs on his face. After a couple of weeks of using morning and night it clear up wonderfully. Even after a fresh shave, with continued use new bumps did not appear. I would definitely recommend for anyone with razor/hair bump issues.</li>
            <li> If you have razor hair bumps, this is your tool.</li>
            <li> Bottle was cracked and leaking when i received it.</li>
            <li> This seems to be nothing more than expensive isopropyl alcohol. Haven&#x27;t seen any better results.</li>
            <li> Great product but a bit harsh on the skin. Stay away from sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> First off, to all those saying it&#x27;s too expensive, it&#x27;s really not if you use it correctly!&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it in order for it to work! I&#x27;ve had a bottle that I use everyday and It&#x27;s lasted me a full three months. LESS IS MORE! when applying it, put just enough on a cotton ball and dab it across the entire area that needs it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anywho, This product does work, and yes it does kinda sting at first and has a not so pleasant smell. HOWEVER, over time, with consistent use it won&#x27;t sting as much, and it really doesn&#x27;t smell all THAT bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a black man that has suffered from terrible razor bumps due to wet shaving on my face and neck. This stuff is one of the only products (next to Barc Bump Down) I&#x27;ve used that has helped clear my skin back up, and trust me I have tried damn near EVERYTHING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first noticed results only a day after my first application, and my skin has stayed bump free since.&lt;br /&gt;As a fairly hairy man, my facial hair grows very quickly. I like to keep myself closely shaven, so I shave roughly about every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the days that I shave, I first take a rag and run it under some hot water. I then place the rag on the areas of my face and neck I plan to shave and let it set for about a minute to help loosen up the hairs and open the pores. I then shave, after shaving I wash my entire face and neck with a deep cleanser or an exfoliator and pat dry. I then use the TEND SKIN, by placing just enough to lightly soak a cotton ball and dab it across my entire face and neck. Like I said earlier you don&#x27;t need to use a lot for it to work! matter of fact, if you use too much it can dry your skin out terribly and probably make matters worse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several minutes after the area is dry, I apply a moisturizer. I would HIGHLY recommend finding a great moisturizer to use to apply to the area to prevent the area from becoming too dry, especially if your skin is very sensitive. I personally like to use Cetaphil moisturizing fragrance free lotion (you can find for under $10) or sometimes I like to use a little BIO OIL when I have it (BIO OIL, is about $5-$10 for a 2 fl oz bottle, but has proven to me to be VERY effective in moisturizing and great for a variety of skin problems).&lt;br /&gt;I think the main things you should make sure of when choosing a moisturizer is that it&#x27;s (1) fragrance free, as this can sometimes cause more problems for skin prone to razor bumps, and (2) not too heavy, as this can clog pores and also make matters worse. Just make sure that you keep the area properly hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also on my off days, when I don&#x27;t shave, I&#x27;ll still apply a little TENDSKIN after washing my face before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, the smell really isn&#x27;t that bad if you use it correctly, and it&#x27;s nothing that can&#x27;t be covered with some cheap cologne/perfume. BUT if the smell is really that much of an issue for you, I would either only shave at night and put this on before bed, OR I would recommend trying Barc Bump down razor relief cream.&lt;br /&gt;This cream is the only other product I&#x27;ve used that works to remove and prevent razor bumps. It&#x27;s a little bit more pricey than TENDSKIN not by much though, but it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent at all. It&#x27;s very creamy and goes on like a light lotion and it also doesn&#x27;t dry the skin out as much. It does however burn a lot more for me than TEND SKIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this helps someone out in choosing whether or not to buy this product &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: all of the products I talk about in this review, I&#x27;ve purchased through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous at first because the reviews are hit or miss but this product definitely worked for me. I didn&#x27;t notice any strong smell and it didn&#x27;t burn when I put it on. I have extremely sensitive skin so when I shave my bikini are it usually gets really red and icky but this definitely helped not to mention I haven&#x27;t gotten any ingrown hairs yet either!&lt;br /&gt;So far I really like this product :)</li>
            <li> I shave every 3-4 days but if I skip the hairs are inevitably ingrown and I get very painful razor bumps that eventually subside after about a week. I found this product to be very effective after shaving to prevent bumps and to also treat them in a few days max. Love this and order the largest size which actually lasted over a year</li>
            <li> This got rid  of the hair bumps down there. Lol.&lt;br /&gt;However it did make my skin peal I found that strange and it burned at times&lt;br /&gt;When my body got use to it , it no longer bothered me.&lt;br /&gt;I am a pleased customer</li>
            <li> This is the best product ive ever used after tying so many other products.  Im so glad that I&#x27;ve found this product, I will continue to be a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> this product works well but be careful...too much use will make your skin dry out.  Overall, great stuff for the price.</li>
            <li> This product has helped to keep my skin smooth and razor bump free, it burns like fire for a minute after hair removal but have been razor bump free since starting to use it. Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> The product was shipped very quickly and the price was half of what I pay normally at the store. I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> wow my skin burned after i applied it! it works but it burns. i don&#x27;t use it anymore i won&#x27;t again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a daily user of Tend Skin for over 10 years now, and it is a lifesaver for someone who suffers from razor burn.  I have very coarse, curly hair, so I am constantly getting ingrown hairs and other issues when I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried everything and when I came across this, it was the only thing that ever came close to actually preventing bumps after I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a plus, this also seems to help if you have a pimple or breakout.</li>
            <li> tried using store bought stuff for years (bikini zone and bump patrol) and even wasted money on a Kiehl&#x27;s treatment all with little to no results.  If I don&#x27;t have this I literally can&#x27;t shave.  It burns like hell when u put it on your lady parts, but after a couple seconds you&#x27;re good.  I looked for YEARS trying to find something and this finally works.</li>
            <li> Works really.....the solution is  not as strong as it used to be but will work. Works well on hormonal bumps nicely</li>
            <li> leaves the skin bit dry but works really well. the price is good and you ll be surpise the dirt it pulls off your skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this to refill my roller ball bottle of this that I originally bought.  This product does help prevent ingrown hairs.  I do not like how it smells like alcohol at first.  However, the smell only lasts for a minute until it dries.</li>
            <li> I really didin&#x27;t have a chance to use it as I guess it should have been used, but for the most part the product was pure meh.</li>
            <li> I was using the European Wax stuff until I found this... So amazing. 3 days of use and the ingrown hair comes right out. This this is miraculous</li>
            <li> I was amazed, not only did it remove the pimples from my chest , it took away the dark spots as well . This is a must for any dude who body builds and wants the perfect ab look with out the irritation included. I&#x27;m ordering my second bottle as i&#x27;m writing this . Tend skin is a must for anyone who shaves.</li>
            <li> I have an acne condition where sometimes the hairs are ingrown and this brings them right up and I don&#x27;t have to dig with tweezers and scar the skin.  Excellent product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  My anesthetist had it in her shop but discontinued having it and so glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Just super strong astringent that&#x27;s expensive</li>
            <li> Best thing since sliced bread</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders.  I would buy again and would recommend.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work. You do need to use it on a daily basis though!  I have sensitive skin and have had no problems with it. Do be aware that dead skin may peel away though.</li>
            <li> Works great, seeing results after just 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t want to spend the money...but I decided to give it a shot.........Glad I did...I really love this stuff and it&#x27;s worth the $20 if you have hair bumps...It works...what more can I say</li>
            <li> Great product that actually works.Started using product and saw results within the first 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;Why did,nt I find out about this sooner..</li>
            <li> It definitely lowers the irritation and inflammation, but I guess I have really bad leg scarring because it isn&#x27;t a miracle like everyone claims it is -.- I will keep using it though because it does lower the inflammation!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman who uses this to get rid of redness, bumps and ingrown hairs around the bikini area. In the past I used the Bikini Zone brand, but it was never totally effective. Tend Skin is a million times better. No bumps, no razor burn, no ingrown hairs. I use it everyday and my skin feels and looks great. I&#x27;m so glad I discovered this product. Since it is a liquid it can be a bit messy, but it&#x27;s not the end of the world. If you are concerned about messiness during application you might want to try the roll-on version.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for Afro-American friend with bumps on his face from ingrown hairs.  Saw him a week later and WOW he looked so much better.  It is really amazing results.  This stuff works!&lt;br /&gt;He washed his face with sulfur soap in morning and applied Solution 2 with Q-Tips. Then washed with sulfur soap at bedtime and applied Tend Skin with Q-tips at night.  The results speak for themselves.  Good product...good results.</li>
            <li> Smells like alcohol but it actually works!</li>
            <li> Bottle was cracked open when I opened the box and the liquid was all over the inside. No contact information available from Amazon on who to reach buyer. Contact Tend Skin and they said they couldn&#x27;t help me. Very bad customer services from everyone. Never purchase product again.........</li>
            <li> I actually had no razor bumps when I used this.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this product for about 5 years and i swear by it. may seem a little pricey to some, but it is worth every penny if you have a problem with ingrown hairs like myself.</li>
            <li> I have trouble rating this product because... Well... Idk if it works but it burns like crazy lol seems to help the ingrown hair but still.... Burns like crazy!!!! Lol literally have to hold my breath and close my eyes when i use this else it stings my eyes and lung lol</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and well priced!  Expiration was for a year after we received it. We&#x27;ve used this product for years and as a skin care professional (esthetician) I recommend it all my clients with ingrown hairs and razor burn!</li>
            <li> clears skin up well, I have mild psoriasis and this clears it right up. Might not work for everyone, but works for me...</li>
            <li> This product was very strongly recommended by a trusted cosmetologist and it delivers sweet relief from ingrown hairs &amp; razor burn, very soothing. Suffer no more!</li>
            <li> Works great on my skin. Wished I knew about it when I was younger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, and I love it. It does what it promises to do- I use it on the bikini area, my hubby on his face. No more ingrowns, no more razor burn. Magic!</li>
            <li> Great product. Best on the market for razor bumps compared to its competitors. Worked right away for my razor bumps.</li>
            <li> This product is a great exfoliator. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 3 weeks and my skin has significantly improved. As it exfoliates my skin, it has got rid of brownish bumps I had had for months.</li>
            <li> The product was okay but nothing earth-shattering or groundbreaking. It was average at best when it comes to preventing or getting rid of razor bumps. I did enjoy the burn I felt whenever I applied it after shaving.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it works but it works. I grew a beard while on a month vacation trout fishing in the mountains. I continued to grow the beard for about 5 months before deciding to shave. After shaving off the beard I had continuous problems with shaving bumps and ingrown hairs that were painful and aggravating. I researched the problem and found numerous posts on the net about Tend Skin being effective and curing this problem. I have not yet completely licked the problem because I forget to use it. When they flair up I start using it and they disappear in just a day or two. Great product. Note that it does burn and sting a tad when you first apply but it goes away pretty quick</li>
            <li> I really really like the tend skin product. Great stuff. A must have for skin care.really helps with razor bumps.</li>
            <li> I like this product, I have ingrown hair on my neck and this helps a lot, I&#x27;ve tried making the homemade one but this works better.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything under the sun and this is the only product that works to prevent razor bumps in the bikini area.  I bought the smaller roll on and then bought the bigger containers to refill it.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it keeps ingrown hairs away. I think some of us are just prone to them no matter what. I&#x27;ve spent $$ on all different brands &amp; I would say this is the best, as best as it can get. I would recommend it but just beware, it isn&#x27;t the holy grail.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for over 4 years and I have no complaints so far. An inlaw recommended it when visiting is and It&#x27;s been better than what I was using at the time. No itching immediately and all day after use.</li>
            <li> Used as soon as it arrived as I had some acne giving me fits on the right side of my face!  Must say, it helped a LOT~!  I&#x27;m a female, and don&#x27;t shave on my face BUT do have some acne which must be because of the heat and humidity in OK.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but it does sting for a little while when you apply it</li>
            <li> bumps and redness were greatly diminished or disappeared when my son used this product on his face after shaving.  skin irriation was increased by mixed martial arts sessions that included a lot of contact to the face and Tend Skin helped reduce the problem.</li>
            <li> I have been a Tend Skin customer for years. I have not found a product that cures hair bumps, ingrown hairs and razor rash as well. Beware, it does dry out your skin but if you keep it moisturized, you&#x27;ll be ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product was delivered fairly quickly and as promised.</li>
            <li> Stings while applying but the results are worth it!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells pretty bad and doesn&#x27;t really do anything.  Also it has a harsh sting when applied to newly shaven skin.  A deep moisturizing lotion would serve you better.</li>
            <li> This has not worked at all to prevent ingrown hairs nor get rid of existing ones. It also left a couple of burns on my upper lip after waxing. I read the ingredients before buying and I thought &amp;#34;this is nothing but alcohol and acid&amp;#34; but I decided to try it anyway due to all of the great reviews. Should have followed my first mind. Waste of money and now I have to find some other product to help get rid of the scars this stuff left behind.</li>
            <li> I was getting ready to try Tend Skin until I read that it was being sold in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and may not be marketed in the United States without an approved New Drug Application (NDA) [Section 505(a) of&lt;br /&gt;According to the Food and Drug Administration &amp;#34;Tend Skin&amp;#34; is promoted and labeled for razor bumps and ingrown hair, but is also promoted for the treatment of acne, cold sores, athlete&#x27;s foot, warts, pityriasis rosea and ringworm. &amp;#34;Tend Skin&amp;#34; contains, among other ingredients, acetylsalicylate (aspirin), which is not recognized as a safe and effective ingredient in an external analgesic OTC drug product.”&lt;br /&gt;Current and prospective Tend Skin users should be aware of these citations before using the product, especially those who are allergic or react adversely to aspirin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff. I pat it on razor-burn prone spots after shaving, then again before bed the same night, and I never get painful razor burn. Its always bad when I run out and immediately get painful razor burn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with razor bumps since I was very young. The ingrown hairs wreaked havoc on my efforts to shave and always looked as though I had back acne that just wouldn&#x27;t go away, no matter how old I got. I discovered Tend Skin about five years ago and have not had a problem since. The only drawback is that it can cause a discoloration in shirt collars. Otherwise, it works really well.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to use a razor, electric shaver or anything like that for years.  The main reason was RAZOR bumps and burns.  So, for the last 30 years I have use Magic Shave.  The biggest problem besides the smell is how messy it is to use and remove from the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had read many reviews on Tend Skin, and this product has allowed me to purchase my Braun 7 Series Electric Razor and almost eliminate all razor bumps.  Tend Skin WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been able to get my daily shave down to about 5 minutes from the 30 minutes using my previous methods.  Give it a try and it works.</li>
            <li> Great item would order from them again.</li>
            <li> Trying to shave certain spots used to wreck me to the point where I just couldn&#x27;t keep it up.  So much razor burn, so many ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now trying an IPL hair remover, which requires me to shave, which I dreaded.  However, since I&#x27;ve been using this stuff every time I shaved and flashed with the IPL, it really hasn&#x27;t been that bad.  I can watch it make red spots go away.  I think it&#x27;s safe to say it&#x27;s helping.  Ingrown hair has been minimal and this clears up razor burn pretty fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good stuff.  If shaving is something that can be awful for you, this might actually make it tolerable.  Give it a shot.</li>
            <li> Tend Skin is a must to have if you shave anywhere.  It eliminates the bumps and it keeps your skin smooth.  It really works on ingrown hair and helps calm razor burns.  I tried the home remedy that you can find on the internet and it doesn&#x27;t work compared to Tend Skin.  I highly recommend this product so that your skin remains unblemished and smooth.</li>
            <li> Husband did not like it said it burn and peel his skin</li>
            <li> im very impressed with this product .  i been trying using another products without any good result. this product works like magic . i used to have razor bumps but with this product removed all the bumps in 2 days in 1 day you will see the difference. im very happy. this is the only product that really works for razor bumps</li>
            <li> Best acne product ever, but they aren&#x27;t allowed to promote that fact. If you get red bumps from acne or razor rash it is caused by clogged pores blocking the natural outward flow of skin fluids which contain bacteria. This product has anti-inflamatory properties which reduce the swelling while the astringent properties cause the skin surface to recede from the pools. If you apply it with a cotton swab to each sore after washing the area with a gentle anti-bacterial cleanser the swelling will recede with will cause the pores to open and the infection to be released from the pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had tried everything OTC and some prescription for acne, and this was the first one that really worked in the long run. Too bad I didn&#x27;t have it as a teenager!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: It can be harsh such that it makes your skin feel as if it&#x27;s on fire (that passes after 10 minutes), and it can cause surface skin to peel if you get it in the wrong place (like fingers). Nevertheless, for the benefits it provides that&#x27;s a small price to pay.</li>
            <li> Bought tend skin for my teenage son who just starting shaving. Works well!</li>
            <li> This is not really Trend Skin. This is a knockoff version. I compared it to my old bottle. This has a very strong smell. It seems to work although not as well nor not as quickly. If this wasn&#x27;t considered a hazardous material and unable to be returned, I would return this item immediately. I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> used it for a razor burn rash.. about a 2 months still there, going to dermatologist</li>
            <li> this stuff really works for unsightly razor bumps, razor burns, and those ugly ingrown hairs. I&#x27;m really glad i finally got the product after i heard so much great  things about it. especially if you&#x27;re a black man/ woman take it from me, this stuff works real talk.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to start using this product and agree with multiple reviews stating that the product is practically the same as rubbing alcohol. It did nothing but dry out my skin and I used it for two weeks twice a day and saw not a single improvement in my skin. I have extremely sensitive skin and get harsh painful razor burn and ingrown hairs that cover my legs from top to bottom, and this product did not a thing to reduce any of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tend Skin for a few years now, on the reccommendation from my asthetitan at Paul Mitchell Salon. To be honest, I didn&#x27;t purchase it right away, in fact it was a few months before I finally bit the bullet and purchased it. I&#x27;ve been loyal to it ever since and will continue to use this product in the future. One of the great things about this product is it&#x27;s versatility. I shave my face, laser my chest and wax my abs. I&#x27;ll be lasering my abs as well, just doing everything sections at a time because it hurts. No matter what technique I&#x27;m using to remove hair, I know that by applying this product I will have smoother, ingrown hair free skin on about 90-95% of where ever I use it. It does have a strong alcohol smell (and the sting that goes with it), but that only lasts for maybe 20 seconds? It&#x27;s more so right after you&#x27;ve shaved, waxed or lasered. I&#x27;m assuming because the skin is already irritated. In all honesty, however, after that 20 seconds my skin already starts to feel better than it did before. I apply it generously about twice a day, though sometimes I do forget (especially in the mornings when I&#x27;m in a hurry). If you&#x27;re unsure of whether or not to get this, do it! And when you do, buy it on Amazon. I just bought mine for under $15 for the larger 8oz bottle. The same bottle goes for twice that at Ulta and Sephora. Just plan ahead, I ran out a few days ago. I thought I&#x27;d just buy it from Sephora but it&#x27;s just too expensive there, so I&#x27;ll just wait for my order to come in. Since it&#x27;s half the price, I should just buy two to keep one for a backup. In fact, I think I&#x27;ll do that right now before I forget!</li>
            <li> anything else I&#x27;ve found. I believe it&#x27;s the ph &amp; % of salicylic acid in the formula. Not cheap, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for many years and simply love this product. If you regularly wax you must use this product. Does what it says, which is a great relief!</li>
            <li> This product did not seem to have an effect. I still had ingrown hairs after using it and it is costly.</li>
            <li> well, it did work for me, I use it for the back of my head, I get bumps and besides being painful they are also not that great when I get a hair cut, so this solution works actually very fast, I waited  to get a haircut and after that I applied this, it is kinda sticky though not so much like alcohol, it might smell like it but the other ingredients I guess make it sticky, anyway, after 2 times I could feel the difference and now I can get a haircut and have shorter hair and no worry to get hurt.</li>
            <li> I read at least 40 reviews before I actually ordered this (and majority were the 2 star and 1 star reviews).  I was a bit worried about a reaction to the product but there has not been one as of yet. Been using this stuff for about a month and it noticeably reduced the size of my razor bumps within two days. Not trying to sell anything here, but as a 26-year old A.A. male, this is a product I continue to use once or twice a day. The only time I experienced any burning was after a line up in which I was cut, so with alcohol in the solution you can expect there to be some burning right? No other issues, no irritation, no peeling like I have read on some reviews, no strong smell that irritates my nose or eyes. It&#x27;s not that expensive when I get low I will buy again it&#x27;s that simple.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best beauty product I have ever used. Hands down. It does exactly what it promises to do, and it does it quickly. Not only did I notice the razor bumps to be gone in as little as 24 hours, but it was not harsh on my skin and is simple to use. It is a little expensive, but I promise it is worth it! You will not regret this purchase!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product.  He has sensitive skin and gets big painful razor bumps.  When he uses this, the bumps are gone.</li>
            <li> Takes all bumps away within days takes the red out within a day great product  I use it when I need too it works</li>
            <li> been using this product for years and have had great results. i always realize how great it is when i run out for a week or so. recommended!</li>
            <li> I feel like this works for me sometimes. The jury is still out. I have tried seemingly every product out there for ingrown hairs and I had high hopes for this one. Not completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I was suffering some serious razor bumps and itching.  I started using this morning after shaving and night before bed combined with an every other day exfolliating sugar scrub and my bumps and itching are gone.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I have very course hair (Italian) and I found that this stuff really helps with the razor burn and ingrown hairs. It does burn if you use it right after a shave but the results are worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> A terrible terrible thing..smells like a nail polish, feels like it too on the skin. I put it on myself once and that was it. If you want cancer this is probably for you. They don&#x60;t let you to return it too.</li>
            <li> This stuff is an amazing product, stop wasting your money on stuff from Walmart &#x27;cause none of that crap works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use an Epilady on legs and face and use Tend Skin immediately afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dark, thick, curly hair and it causes ingrown hairs sometimes when it&#x27;s growing back. Since I started using this, ingrown hairs have decreased immensely and when I do get one they go away quickly after usin Tend Skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint is the smell is really really strong (like a bottle of super cheap vodka kinda smell) so if you&#x27;re using it on your face, probably take a deep breath and hold it before applying. (Sorry Tend Skin, I love ya, but you are sooooo strong).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has this nice silky feelin from the glycerin in it once it dries.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tend Skin for years on the days that I don&#x27;t shave!&lt;br /&gt;It is painful to apply to immediately-shaved areas, so I use it on&lt;br /&gt; the &amp;#34;days off!&amp;#34; BTW, I use an electric razor. Used on a regular basis,&lt;br /&gt; my neck remains clear, bump-free, and no more razor burn!&lt;br /&gt;A remarkable product....expensive, but worth it!</li>
            <li> I love the large bottle at the low cost and have found that it generally works for in grown hairs.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how the hell it works, but it does. I get red bumps and ingrown hairs on my neck when I shave, but tend skin takes care of it. I use it once in the morning and night.</li>
            <li> I use this all over my face and have for years. I get painful cystic acne, so this + hydrocortizone with aloe does miracles. My skin is very fair and delicate and this has improved the overall brightness. The only thing is it&#x27;s strong, so sit in front of a fan while applying it to face and avoid eyes completely.</li>
            <li> works great and i purchase it at a much better price than at the store down the street from my house</li>
            <li> been using this product for a few weeks &amp; so far i am really pleased with the results. it brings the ingrowns to the surface &amp; i have seen a decrease in new ones. Will definitely continue to use this product in the future</li>
            <li> This is a great company. The product was great and works very well. The quality is great.  This company ships right away</li>
            <li> I have tried pretty much everything on the market. Tend skin is by far the most effective, it REALLY does what it says</li>
            <li> i was considering electrolysis, but now with this product i dont need it!! the ingrown hair is none visible now</li>
            <li> This is the best razor burn solution.  I used this when it came out back in the day.  I have used every product under the sun for my bikini line and now I am back to Tend Skin.  This works better than every product.  I am currently having laser hair removal and still get ingrown because it takes A LONG time for the hair to stop growing back.  TEND SKIN is the best.</li>
            <li> I shave my head, and I used to get razor bumps, particularly on the back of my head.  I tried many aftershaves to no avail, I read a review about tend skin and tried it. My head cleaned up in a matter of days and have not had any since.  I never realized how dirty one&#x27;s head is.  Tend Skin cleans it all up and leaves you with smooth clean skin.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Don&#x27;t know why</li>
            <li> My daughter is embarrassed by unsightly razor bumps. This is the only product we&#x27;ve found that prevents those bumps. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> This review  is not fair to the seller. But UPS dropped the ball on this one.. It was &amp;#34;out for delivery&amp;#34; since last Thursday.. Then reverted to &amp;#34;in transit&amp;#34; and now the agent told me she is not sure about whereabouts of the package.&lt;br /&gt;Frustrated, i looked for this product at a local store CHEAPER than what i paid for it. I will wait another day before i go ahead and buy it.. This is NOT a pleasant experience at all..</li>
            <li> This stuff helps calm my skin after I shave, but it&#x27;s nothing too impressive. I still get ingrown hairs often even with use.</li>
            <li> The only thing that world well on my ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I really love this. I&#x27;ve always struggled with embarrassing and painful bikini bumps. I&#x27;ve been using this just once a day for a few weeks now and it&#x27;s great! My skin isn&#x27;t perfectly smooth but it&#x27;s a remarkable improvement. Less redness, less bumps, and less regrowth itching. Some people have complained that it&#x27;s difficult to apply but I just use a cotton round and that works great for me. You also don&#x27;t need very much of it per application so you really get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> the only thing i&#x27;ve found that actually works, worth the price!</li>
            <li> The stuff is a life saver!  I used it after shaving my women parts and it keeps me smooth without any irritation and burning.  I love this  and will always try to keep it on hand.  I highly recommend if you have trouble after shaving &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34;. ha!</li>
            <li> THE BEST SHAVING STUFF EVER.</li>
            <li> Good price for a man&#x27;s basic grooming needs. Splash on a cotton ball after shaving on your neckline and the slight tingle will let you know it works.</li>
            <li> My esthetician that does waxing recommended this to me years ago, and its a must-have for folks with sensitive skin, or who develop razor-burn.  It burns slightly after a fresh shave, but will prevent and treat existing razor burn in all places on the body.</li>
            <li> I like the way tend skin works after one use. It doesnt take long to see results. I used it years ago and resumed using it when I made this purchase. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Exactly the type of skin conditioner I needed. It arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I ordered samples before setting this up on my subscribe and save, and Tend does work.  The product lessened my razor bumps and itching in delicate areas from horrible to barely there.  I would recommend using this in combination with the shave gel, this alone makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and excellent product. Burns slightly when you first put it on but definitely works well.</li>
            <li> Tend skin works really well fighting off razor burn. I also get some pimples from in grown hairs, and this stuff helps get rid of that too! I can&#x27;t say that this stuff is really healthy for the skin, but it does what it promises, and I havent noticed any adverse effects.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and no complaints here! I&#x27;ve even gotten my husband to start using it when he needs to! Great size for the price!</li>
            <li> This stuff works!! My daughter sufferers from severe razor burn, but after using Tend Skin as directed, it cleared up in a few days. As long as she continues to use it, the bumps stay away! We have seen the dermatologist, used several different products, and nothing has worked better. Yes, it is sort of expensive, but in my opinion, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Its ok, I didn&#x27;t see great improvement in my legs because I have really bad black dots from shaving and waxing. Nothing works!</li>
            <li> Have used this off and on for years and it&#x27;s great.  Clears up razor bumps and ingrown hairs overnight.  Leaves my hands silky smooth too.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with purchase. My husband has had no complaints with this item.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I had high hopes. I was not disappointed at all. After 1 use I could see a difference in my razor burn, bumps and ingrown hairs. They are virtually gone and I&#x27;ve only bee using this stuff for 2 weeks. Will recommend it to everyone, will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Did not work what so ever.</li>
            <li> I have always battled razor burn on my bikini line every summer. Within three days of starting this product, all of my red bumps were gone, and they aren&#x27;t coming back. It stings a little and it smells really bad (like most astringents), but it works and the smell doesn’t last very long after application.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I have struggled with my razor bumps for months and bought different after shaves that never worked. Trend skin has been magical. In just one week my chin has transformed to the smoothest it could ever be.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t help me any better than the other one i have so i guess the tea tree bump oil is slightly better</li>
            <li> I bought this for ingrown hairs that suddenly developed in the last year or two. I find that it does help, if I use it everyday, or twice a day. I have found online there is a recipe for homemade version of tendskin that is supposed to work. It has witch hazel, aspirin and something else. I am going to try the homemade version to see if it works, if not I would definitely re-purchase this as I don&#x27;t like the bumps or scars on the back of my legs.</li>
            <li> good product. thought it was free shipping on the item.</li>
            <li> stuff works great has potent smell though i wouldn&#x27;t use before going out i just shave and put it on before bed</li>
            <li> Use it every day.  It really works well!</li>
            <li> Didnt see any difference after using this product</li>
            <li> I get very bad ingrown hairs and irritation due to my hair type (blonde and fine). This stuff is magically! Within 24 hours I&#x27;ve seen such a vast improvement. Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> no more ingrown hair, all the black spots apache seems to have disappeared. My face seems to be very smooth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several months now, to prevent ingrown hairs and bumps after epilating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a like/hate relationship with Tend Skin. It is an effective product. The acetylsalicylic acid speeds up exfoliation of the top layer of skin, and is anti-inflammatory; and the alcohol helps prevent infection. However, the high alcohol content makes this stuff HARSH. I hate what it does to my skin. It makes my skin very dry, flaky, and generally unpleasant. I always use a moisturizer afterward, but it is an uphill battle.</li>
            <li> Works great! I don&#x27;t use it on a regular basis. But when I do it seems to clean pores and clear up any bumps.</li>
            <li> I gave this a whirl to clear up some nasty razor burn on my neck that was very irritating since I shave every day and never gave it a break.  This stuff works as instructed; I used it after shaving in the morning and again at night on the irritated area, and in about five days the razor burn was almost completely gone.  Only downsides are that it has a strong smell when first applied and it stings and itches just after it is applied, but that goes away within a matter of minutes.  Ultimately, it did what I wanted it to do!</li>
            <li> I have suffered from razor burn and razor bumps all of my adult life.  Even went through electrolysis.  Nothing worked.  Tend Skin is the answer to my prayers.  Best product on the market.  I swear by it. Will never live without it. Much love to the producers.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that this does what it claims to.  I know that nothing is 100% full proof, but this definitely does help with ingrown hairs and razor bumps on the legs.  It does burn at times with application, but small price to pay for better looking legs.</li>
            <li> After reading all of these RAVING reviews, I decided to buy Tend Skin after having suffered brutally from ingrown hairs and razor burn around the bikini area. I was really looking forward to solving this problem, and I figured Tend Skin was the best way. Unfortunately I was wrong. I don&#x27;t know if some of these reviews were paid off or if maybe my body just reacts to it differently, but honestly, this product did NOT work for me...AT ALL. I&#x27;m disappointed I spent a decent amount of money for a product that did not even take effect. I went to my Ob/Gyn asking how I could solve the problem, and his assistant had said that her waxer had recommended this product, and yet it hadn&#x27;t worked for her either. Weird coincidence? Anyways, I will not be buying this again. If I&#x27;m going to spend a decent amount of money to fix my ingrown hair problem, I&#x27;ll put it towards a product that actually works.</li>
            <li> This product really work. It actually started working after the first week of regular application. When shaved my legs usually get hair bumps within the second day, and by applying this liquid of my skin twice daily my legs are feeling smoother and bumps free.</li>
            <li> I was a mess....literally 20-30 ingrown hairs. A little over a week using this and they were gone! Absolutely worth the $$.</li>
            <li> It does a good job of preventing ingrowns, but is very harsh on your skin. I use it for my bikini area, and I would suggest just using it three times a week. If you use it every day, your skin will get very dry and might peel!</li>
            <li> wow this really works ive had this product not even a week now and it really works i am not dramatizing in any way my bums are dissapearing and blemishes are slowly but surely dissapearing</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. Been using it for years. Clears up razor bumps and ingrown hairs within days. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work and irritated my skin, actually made it worse as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  Used it a couple times to be sure, but yep, still sucked. African American male using for dark spots and decrease irritation from shaving</li>
            <li> Nothing to me like tend skin this is the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have really sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t harm it, gives my face a cool feeling after using I recommend using lotion on the face after 10mins that&#x27;s only if you going to leave the house  if you&#x27;re going to be in the house forget the lotion I recommend lotion when going out because it leave white mark and make your face a little dry but if your in your house that&#x27;s your comfort zone no body not ganna be looking in your face other than family members you get the point but it work better if its applied alone but 10 mins after use then lotion should be fine also it works Miracles on my ingrown hair and razor bumps I&#x27;m  on my 1st bottle Half way in it bout to subscribe on my next bottle  I advise you  to subscribe also</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Tend Skin for years (maybe 20 years by now?), sometimes for ingrown hairs, but mostly to clear blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have acne, but do get some troublesome blemishes \\&quot;once a month\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Just a drop onto a q-tip, apply to the outbreak once in the morning and once at night.  I&#x27;ve rarely had to use it a second day, because the blemish is dried up from two applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am worried about some of the comments here, that the TendSkin contents in these orders is knock-off or just rubbing alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;I hope not, because I just ran out, just ordered more.&lt;br /&gt;For the life of me, I don&#x27;t know what the other listed ingredients smell like, so don&#x27;t know if ingredients have changed or are missing.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the only ingredient that smells is the isopropyl alcohol?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve kept the empty bottle, and will compare labels with the new bottle when it arrives tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I&#x27;ve used this product on my blemishes for years, and it&#x27;s never failed to clear things up super-quick and painlessly and no blob of goo sitting on my face for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDITED TO ADD: New bottle arrived today, it smells just like the stuff I&#x27;ve been using for years.&lt;br /&gt;The listed ingredients are the same as the list on the empty bottle I just used up:&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Isopropyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Acetylsalicylic Acid, Cyclomethicone, Glycerin, Diglycerin, Polysorbate 80.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers who complained or worried that the product smells just like rubbing alcohol, ...&lt;br /&gt;well, that&#x27;s the first ingredient listed on both the Amazon listing and on the bottle. There are no perfurmes.  Of course it&#x27;s going to smell like isopropyl alcohol.</li>
            <li> It really works!  Who would have guessed this would turn out to be such a fab product!  Useful for bikini and leg bumps as well as a good protector for men&#x27;s faces as well!  We all use it!</li>
            <li> Use after waxing to prevent bumps and ingrown hairs. Smooth skin practically guaranteed, in my experience, if used as directed. I also read that it can be used before waxing to &amp;#34;loosen&amp;#34; hair and make the process easier, but I will still rely on a good numbing cream for that.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  I have super sensitive skin and this completely works after a wax to calm my skin.</li>
            <li> I HAVE TRIED A LOT OF PRODUCTS AND THIS ONE WORKS THE BEST FOR BUMPS AND INGROWN HAIR.</li>
            <li> This stuff really helps with the bumps after shaving and waxing. Recommended by my esthetician. She said it was the best OTC product you can buy. Could not find it in the drug stores though, so I&#x27;m glad Amazon had it!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work as well as good ol&#x27; fashioned exfoliating.</li>
            <li> this stuff is the greatest.  I use it to prevent razor burn and also on breakouts. I recommend it to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> The best stuff. plain and simple. AWESOME.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any results since I tried this product. It would be nice if it tackled such issues as razor bumps, burns, and especially ingrown hair. But in my case it has not given me any satisfactory results. I&#x27;ve used it as directed only to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff it definitely works!</li>
            <li> Rubbed this on the back of my neck for bumps and within a  few days bumps were gone.</li>
            <li> Spoiler alert!! This is just rubbing alcohol and asprin. Didnt really do anything for me except sting, make my face smell like rubbing alcohol and dry it out. Did not prevent anything.</li>
            <li> Tend Skin has been such a BLESSING for me! It has cleared my razor bumps &amp; prevented new ones. I am a black male &amp; I used to get razor bumps after every shave. I was even considering laser hair removal. Now I can let my facial hair grow for a few days &amp; not shave every day. I use it two times a day. I recommend Tend Skin to anyone with ingrown hairs. I know I&#x27;ll be a long time fan!</li>
            <li> If you have never tried this product you should!&lt;br /&gt;I have spent plenty on razor burn products but this one is worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;I have been a fan for along time and have tried replacements here and there.  I won&#x27;t do that anymore.  The sting is minimal and some how lasts longer for relief on the skin.  I&#x27;m a woman and shaving the bikini line I think takes extra abuse being that then we wear pants/jeans/shorts, etc.  That can rub the treatment off and irritate shaven areas. This has lasted longer than any other product I have tried, even the ones specializing in women&#x27;s bikini areas.  So, let it dry all the way after application and you are good to go!  The bottle is a great size so it lasts for a long time depending on how often you shave.  I will say this, I use less of this product because it works to heal so quickly and prevents break out of ingrown hairs, so I can go days between shaves with out using any!</li>
            <li> Product is counterfeit. Received today and does not have the tend skin verified seal that their website tells you to look for. Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> Works great for razor burn and other skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;Much better pice on Amazon.</li>
            <li> great for refilling roll-on</li>
            <li> This stuff truly works if you use it consistently!</li>
            <li> Definitely read the directions carefully. You will have to apply this everyday. Not just on the day you shave. With that being said, it did get rid of my bumps. It took time. But after applying it 3 times a day like said. My skin started to peel. Which is why I&#x27;m only giving 3 stars. So if you are ok with applying this everyday and spending $20 and more a month on this, then buy it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t recommend this product.  It didn&#x27;t work and it bleached some of my clothing.</li>
            <li> I started getting ingrown hairs and razor bumper after YEARS of getting brazilians with no issues. I tried everything, organic wax, shaving, even similar products to Tend and nothing worked. When I started using Tend, at first I didn&#x27;t see a different and then the lady who waxes me told me to use more than the recommended amount so I did. I use it in the morning, before bed, and before every workout. I also just pour it directly onto my skin and then dab with a cotton ball instead of applying it to the cotton ball first. Made a HUGE difference. My bumps are totally gone and I rarely get ingrowns anymore. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is the only product that works for me to keep ingrown hairs at bay....</li>
            <li> I must say, after various products this one is by far the best! Being a personal trainer my appearance is valuable. My ingrowns weren&#x27;t horrible but definitely bothered me. I used another popular product called Skin Tight a fews back and it worked awesomely. For some reason they stopped producing the creme which caused my ingrowns to come back because the liquid was not as good. So I searched daily for another good or better product that could take its place. I eventually found the creme version again but it didn&#x27;t work as it did before. Then I found Tend Skin. I seen all the great reviews and had to try it. The hype is well deserved. Within 5 days my most problematic areas that I had been dealing with for years had magically disappeared. I am curious to see whether they continue to be non-existent with just using it after haircuts and shaves. Tend Skin is definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Within 48 hours I began to see results. It got a 4 and not a 5 because of the cost and because it&#x27;s so good and you&#x27;ll want continued results, you&#x27;ll keep buying at that price. But it&#x27;s worth it to have a fab looking bikini area</li>
            <li> Best stuff I have ever used. I wish this was around when I was in the military. I was introduced to this product at the military exchange mall.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the BEST!!! I&#x27;d used Bliss Ingrown Hair Eliminating pads forever. I loved the results but hated the high price ($38/50pads). Took a gamble on Tend Skin for nearly half the price &amp; have been amazed at the results. Plus, this can be used immediately after hair removal unlike the pads.</li>
            <li> I ended up trying this out becuz of all the reviews posted however the smell is a very strong alcohol smell which I don&#x27;t care for. Like most after shaves, it does sting. I am not big on putting stuff on my face daily but I think you have to with this stuff. If you only use it after you shave, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as effective as i still got razor burn the next day. I feel like this is overrated but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from razor burn for what seems like years now, tried just about everything, so I figured why not try something else, eventually something has to work, am I right? I got this with the hopes of it working, based on the reviews it sounded as if there was a chance. My skin is just sensitive to shaving for some reason, and &amp;#34;Tend Skin&amp;#34; has the word, tend in the name, so I figured perhaps this would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the smell is potent, it will make you cough if you don&#x27;t actually move the bottle away from you when you open it, not sure why, but the smell is super strong. I dabbed it on a cotton ball and applied as instructed, I did this for about 2 weeks without results. Not only did I not get results, when I first used it, my skin flared up and looked pretty bad and it stung pretty bad every time I applied it. Perhaps this is just my experiences, but all it did for me was dry my skin up really bad, due to the alcohol which must be present (obvious by the strong smell).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that this works for someone, if it does then I am truly happy for you, but I am a 19 year old male, and it just isn&#x27;t working for me.</li>
            <li> The best after-shave product I&#x27;ve used to prevent ingrown hairs! I will definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li> Great product! Nothing else works as good!</li>
            <li> This is the best solution if you have severe razor bumps! It works!!!</li>
            <li> This product is great for prevention and treatment of razor burn!  I love it and use it everytime I shave.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re razor bumps really aren&#x27;t that serious of a condition (in terms of amount of bumps and the size of the bumps) then this is the product for you. If you&#x27;re like me and have tried this and everything else in walmart, target and CVS pharmacy and still haven&#x27;t found a solution then  B&amp;C Skin Tight would better suit you&#x27;re</li>
            <li> Ok, so i dont normally do reviews, but as you all know Tend Skin has gotten so many good reviews and people that have used it, that i decided to go to my local Walgreens and purchase it for about $17 bucks. So.. ive suffered from ingrown and razor bumps in the bikini area ever since i started shaving from the age of 14 and i am now 24. Now, i was very skeptical, because my bikini area is DARK because of all the bumps. (I am brown skin). Even my boyfriend said why do i shave. So i decided to start waxing,, but the ingrown hairs were still there and left a nasty dark spot! So i bought tend skin about 2 weeks ago and started putting it every morning and night. Honestly, i did not use qtip, i used a tissue because i wanted to put as must as i can so it can clear up faster! Soo, Now 2 weeks.. i do see a difference, my bikini area has gotten lighter but not as light as i want it. Im gonna keep using it until the bottle finishes to see how effective this tend skin is. So it does work, but it doesnt magically make the bumps dissapear like some say 0_o.  but i am satisfied, and i will keep using it.</li>
            <li> Used to get discoloration and lines around my bikini line after shaving.  This stuff is a miracle in a bottle. NO issues with skin, bumps and ingrowns after using this even just one time. Definitely a staple for me until I bite the bullet and get laser hair removal every single place that I can!</li>
            <li> I have used many skin solutions; but this one is the only one that is soothing and can be used for any scratch, pimple and bites.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and had tried a lot of things to help get rid of the razor burn that I get when shaving. This stuff finally did it! It doesn&#x27;t work instantly, but after about a day or two I could already see and feel a difference. i would definitely recommend this to anyone who hasn&#x27;t found anything that works.</li>
            <li> This liquid only burned my body.it didn&#x27;t help me to reduce my bumps</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still in the process of using it but so far it&#x27;s doing exactly what it was advertised to do and I&#x27;m happy about that I&#x27;m sure to repurchase this product again</li>
            <li> This product really works for extremely well for black men.  My husband rarely gets those bumps he use to get when shaving his head.  Will never stop using it.</li>
            <li> Saw a difference  in two weeks...</li>
            <li> Helped clear up razor burn as advertised. Helped prevent in-grown hairs as advertised. Smells bad during application. Worth the money if used as directed. Buy the roller also. Much easier to use than cotton balls.</li>
            <li> Works great if you use it every time you shave</li>
            <li> I been trying a lot of products for this problem, &amp;  only 2 I can said they do they job, one was Barc who got discontinued Idk why... &amp;  now this one... But only I am disappointed is the price for what it is, is just alcohol with some other stuff, a alcohol bottle can cost like 2 dollars.</li>
            <li> I purchased Tend Skin in an attempt to combat painful and unsightly irritation after shaving my legs. After reading so many positive reviews, I was really expecting to be blown away by this product. A few uses in I definitely noticed an improvement in my skin, however it was not as magical as others made it seem. This product is only slightly above par a myriad of other personal care products, it works, but don&#x27;t expect a miracle. That being said, I will continue to buy this brand and would recommend it to others looking for help with after-shaving irritation.</li>
            <li> My husband has razor bumps and I first purchased this product last year.  He has used this product consistently and has reported much improvement with his skin.  While he still has some razor bumps, it has diminished with the use of the product.</li>
            <li> Using the Tend Skin Care Solution with the Air Gel leaves my face smooth and with few razor bumps and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I could not figure out how to get rid of my razor bumps but after putting on Tend Skin they started to go away and it helps to keep them away! Now my skin looks much better!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had issues with razor bumps and ingrown hairs after shaving. Due to its price, I tried many solutions before trying Tend Skin. After finally deciding to try it out I saw a slight improvement, but it&#x27;s nothing major. I think everyone reacts different.&lt;br /&gt;After Tend Skin I tried some other products before finally visiting a dermatologist. The cream the doctor prescribed (Ziana), applied nightly, has almost completely resolved my ingrown hair/razor bump situation.</li>
            <li> I liked using this stuff but I use it after I shave and my neck gets red for hours after using this, more than likely because the burn.</li>
            <li> I can not say this product worked with my sensitive skin when it comes to razor burn. I do not get razor bumps, so in that case it may work? I am sorry to say that for my shaving issues this was not a help. I have also used Neutrogena Post Shave and I am up in the air about that too, however I do not think that it dries my face out after using.</li>
            <li> Love that it works great with ingrown. Can&#x27;t live without it during the summer, wish it was less expensive , but still it&#x27;s less expensive tha going to the store for it.</li>
            <li> Nice product - I have extremely reactive skin in my bikini area and am prone to ingrown hairs, constant razor bumps and cystic acne. This product was noticeably more effective than typical creams like Bikinizone. It burns like rubbing alcohol upon application, but that goes away very quickly and the results are better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> As a teenage girl, one of the areas on my body I was most self conscious about were my legs, due to the razor bumps. After being asked once by someone &amp;#34;what was wrong with my legs,&amp;#34; I avoided clothing that showed my legs because I was so embarrassed about them.  I accepted that my skin just wasn&#x27;t as nice as others&#x27;.  After reading all the positive reviews on here I decided to give this product a try, and boy am I glad I did! All it took was one use to get me hooked. After the first night I applied this, I saw instant results the next day! My skin was smoother than it ever was; I almost had trouble believing that those were the same legs that I had hated and hid away for all those years. For the first time, I feel comfortable wearing shorts out in public... my boyfriend also immediately noticed the change in my skin and couldn&#x27;t stop stroking my legs and commenting on how soft they were! Thank you so much Tend Skin for an excellent product! :) I&#x27;ll never go without it!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Tend Skin from a dermatologist a year ago. Once the sample was used, I bought the full size bottle ($35). When that bottle was depleted after a year, I thought about checking Amazon for pricing. It&#x27;s much cheaper! Tend Skin works great on my chin by preventing scarring from pulled and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> No complaints. First after-shave I ever used. Sadly lost my bottle like an idiot when I tried to carry it in a carry-on on an airplane.</li>
            <li> Great for razor burn esp in bikini area for women!!  I have tried numerous razor burn creams and if applied as directed this stuff is the best by far for razor burn!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works for me . Thanks</li>
            <li> I pour this into a spray bottle.  I use it to avoid underarm bumps after shaving and use it after waxing.  I also spray it on the occasional blemish and they&#x27;re gone the next day.  My husband also sprays it on his face after shaving.  No more razor burn.  Don&#x27;t ever discontinue this product.</li>
            <li> Does what it says!!! I have no more bumps :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how Ive lived without this my whole life.  It is just amazing!</li>
            <li> I was surprised how well it worked. I am African American, so I have a greater tendency to get razor bumps around my neck when I shave due to my hairs curling back into the skin. It didn&#x27;t get rid out my razor bumps completely but basically cleared about 98% of them. It does dry your skin, so I used it with a facial moisturizer. Glad I found this product. The only downside is that it is a bit pricey and once you stop using it, the bumps come back. But i&#x27;d recommend it others to at least try it. Its the first product that has worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this product by watching others recommend it on YouTube reviews.</li>
            <li> the lotion caused bumps</li>
            <li> The best product on the market for AVOIDING razor burn. What else needs to be said?</li>
            <li> Again, not sure it did anything :(</li>
            <li> This product is amazing...... it helps prevent razor burn and ingrown hairs. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly as it promises! Gets rid of any bumps and irritation for under arms and bikini area</li>
            <li> Love this product, must have if you have ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> This does not smell like the smaller bottles i have purchased before.  It smells only like alcohol.  Plus, it is not working as well as the smaller bottles that I have purchased from Ulta, Sephora and BlissLabs over the years.  This may be counterfeit</li>
            <li> Great quality. This product is the only thing that works for my razor burn. I hope they never stop making this.</li>
            <li> Great product for a few decades now. Don&#x27;t change!</li>
            <li> It did nothing for my razor bumps... very expensive and yet worthless</li>
            <li> Love this! Burns when you put it on- but its quick. This is truly the best product on the market for after-shaving treatments.</li>
            <li> I have had a terrible problem with bikini zone bumps for years. Tend Skin is the ONLY product I have tried that not only eases the burn and itch of ingrown hair, but prevents them from starting in the first place. Started using daily in early Sept. and I haven&#x27;t had one since.</li>
            <li> It really does help. Especially for someone who sucks ass at shaving like me.</li>
            <li> I must say after countless products that I have tried, I find this to be the most effective. This has worked wonders for me and my skin and I am glad I chose this as well. I also now see this in stores, but the price is sometimes cheaper and sometimes not. I still have my bottle from when I purchased it earlier this year. You dont need a lot of it, but if used correctly it will work, just be patient! I noticed results in less than two weeks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get this...did nothing for me...smelled just like alcohol so after no results I threw it away rather just  spray plain alcohol rather than this ...cheaper and probably safer.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work on my razor bumps.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  it works better than any other similar product i have ever used.  Love it for the bichini area.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good product that i guess disinfects the skin after shaving in a way that there are much less breakouts. my bf loved it</li>
            <li> I want to say that Tend Skin Care Solution works, but the truth of the matter is you&#x27;ll have to just try it out for yourself. But here are facts I found true for my experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It is a good quality product.&lt;br /&gt;2. Friend pharmacist says that it is just like rubbing alcohol, but I think TEND is just not as powerful (which is good because for the amount of areas I needed to use this product for, I probably would get poisoning from actual rubbing alcohol)&lt;br /&gt;3. Does not burn at all if you have no cuts/openings; otherwise, it burns REAL bad, just like rubbing alcohol would.&lt;br /&gt;4. Before wax/shaving, no burning sensation. After a wax/shave, slight burns, then real bad burns where the wax peeled me off raw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND LASTLY, I have been consistent with using TEND day and night, so I am hopeful (and optimistic) that it will reduce or diminish the bumps of my legs and arm. (also bikini, if you know what I mean)</li>
            <li> I have been using Tend Skin for several years especially in the summer months were I am shaving daily and exposing my underarms.  I usually could only find this product online and with the product cost and shipping it almost came to double what I would pay if found in the stores.  This is such a great cure for the irritation that happens with ingrown hairs.  I use this on my bikini area and underarms at least 2 times daily when I first begin treatment and then down to once a day for maintainence.  There is a slight stinging if you use directly after shaving, but I hardly notice now.  I&#x27;ve noticed when using Tend Skin on the underarms, you can forego deodorant (don&#x27;t worry).  Yes I hardly ever wear deodorant when I use the Tend Skin immediately after application and  NO I do not smell.  This is a great product and the prices are comparable.</li>
            <li> I have used No Bump in the past after my waxes and have had great success.  Tend Skin on the other hand is okay for the price point.  There is more product in the bottle and a friend recommended it to me due to my tendency to have ingrown hairs.  Tend Skin gets the job done, but what it lacks is the Witch Hazel that is in the No Bump that calms the irritation down.  Does it work for ingrown hair?  Yes.  Is it worth what you pay?  Yes.  Between Tend Skin and No Bump, I&#x27;ll fork over the extra and get the No Bump.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years.  It is excellent.  I bought a 16 ounce bottle at discount only to find that the product had less than three months until expiration date.  I consider the failure to disclose the close expiration date with the discounted price to be a form of misleading advertising and Amazon should require its vendors to reveal expiration dates in similar situations.  Anything less is inappropriate.</li>
            <li> Does it work?  Yes. Is it the most effective?  No.  Well, maybe not.  See, I&#x27;ve been using this for a bit and I found that it&#x27;s really just an underpowered application for managing razor bumps and ingrown hairs.  In fact, following the directions given will yield no results.  I apply it like I would an aftershave, and that seemed to have better performance.  But coming from a world of using products such as [[ASIN:B000NPJHQU Bump Patrol]], I found that the Tend Skin product took longer to do anything and when it did start working, required multiple daily applications to remain effective.  Bump Patrol, on the other hand, is/was so effective that applying it in the morning of Day 1 resulted in significant improvements in the shaved (or unshaved) area by the morning of Day 2.  Less frequency of application, lasts longer.  The only downside of Bump Patrol is it&#x27;s a lot messier than this stuff.  Perhaps that&#x27;s why this bottle is so much larger; they knew you&#x27;d have to apply a lot more to get the same effect.  Unfortunately, Amazon refuses to carry Bump Patrol directly for some reason, so it&#x27;s either get it from a local store or get ripped off by a third party marketplace seller.  UPDATE: Bump Patrol is now properly carried by Amazon, and not a moment too soon.  I noticed myself growing annoyed with Tend Skin.  It just takes too long to work.  With Bump Patrol I can apply it fresh in the morning even over existing bumps, the next morning they&#x27;re completely gone.  Tend Skin takes days of applying it 3 times a day before you get an effect if you&#x27;re applying over existing bumps.  It works better as a preventative than it does a cure.  But Bump Patrol does both, faster.  Maybe it&#x27;s more effective on certain skin types than others.  Wasn&#x27;t effective enough for mine.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING! And has solved all of the bikini-area razor burn and ingrown hair issues I&#x27;ve been battling for years. YAY!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product to use as needed, you can apply to problem spots or apply overall as an aftershave for nicks and to prevent ingrown hairs before they start. Will sting a little when first applied after shaving but cools &amp; sooths fast.  You will see results very quickly.  Can be applied twice daily for faster results on problem areas and this product does not dry your skin out like alcohol.  I would recomend Tend Skin for anyone.</li>
            <li> This is the best solution for ingrown hairs. Use this after time I shave my bikini line to prevent those little red bumps. This is the only solution that works for me.</li>
            <li> I am a guy, and I bought this because I was getting ingrown hairs when I shaved my legs. This definitely suppresses ingrown hairs. But, I realized I was genning ingrown hairs in the first place because I was using a no-name razor. When I was doing research on how to shave legs, I someone said that any old razor would do. I will tell you, this is not the case. That statement is a lie. Since purchasing a Gillete Fusion Proglide, ingrown hairs have completely disappeared, except on my upper thighs, which are extra sensitive anyways. Guys (men and women), if you want to shave your legs, shell out money for a quality name brand razor. They last and work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I digress. This tend skin product works very well. It does smell strongly of alcohol, but it is mostly alcohol. To avoid the problem, simply do not apply this while sitting in your closet.</li>
            <li> After using the Tend Skin Air Shave Gel, I use this solution on my son&#x27;s face to ward off hair bumps/ingrown hairs.  It keeps the skin on his face and neck, baby smooth no more razor burns, no more pain or ingrown hairs!</li>
            <li> This products works amazingly well, but you have to keep up with it everyday (at least I do) in order keeps the bumps under control. Doesn&#x27;t take care of every last ingrown hair, but works well, better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.  I will continue using this as long as they carry it. On a side note, I much prefer the roll on bottle, it lasts ten times longer, because cotton balls will soak up most of the solution. It&#x27;s also easier to rub on. I just buy the regular bottles and refill the roll on when needed.</li>
            <li> The bottle being plastic is nicely designed and stores well in the lower bathroom cabinet too large for my medicine cabinet.  but the shape and color allows for the bottle if left out on the counter that it is not an eye sore.  However some of the bottles no longer have the nice gold tone top and they have a plastic which makes its appearance not so grand.  However overall the product works well for what it is designed.  NOt the easiest product to get locally and must order online.</li>
            <li> really messed up my skin. A no go for sensitive skin.  Took layers off my face.  Way to much alcohol.</li>
            <li> This not only clears up &amp; prevents razor burn and ingrown hairs, it also works great on blemishes.  Especially if you have a cyst or pimple that is deep under the skin.  This dries it up almost overnight.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Seems to work very well.  It definitely has a drying affect, as isopropyl alcohol is one of the main ingredients.  It has a strong smell of alcohol but it dissipates quickly.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days now and have noticed results.  Happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do,but not that good. I don&#x27;t have that many marks anyway,so the price just isn&#x27;t justified .&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using the product anyway till it&#x27;s gone</li>
            <li> Great business. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Gave me back my smooth skin not clear skin so much though.</li>
            <li> I have been using Tend Skin for many years, it is the only product that miraculously prevents razor bumbs especially in sensitive areas- armpit/bikini.  Consequently, I can shave every day!</li>
