            <li>This is the best!</li>
            <li>Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t pullout all your hair or break it!</li>
            <li>It is the best purchase ever.  </li>

            <li>This straightener worked wonderfully - for 8 months.</li>

            <li>Straightens hair beautifully.</li>
            <li>But because of the great reviews and the reputation of the chi</li>
            <li>I used mine 5 times and it worked great, then the 6th time it would not turn on at all.     </li>
            <li>and you should be happy with the way you look</li>

            <li>Great IRON</li>
            <li>I was upset and truly happy when I was issued a refund.</li>
            <li>this does the job @ a great price.</li>
            <li>It worked great.</li>
            <li>The supplier was great</li>
            <li>The price on amazon is a great buy</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>great for 5 years, found this one online</li>
            <li>my wife love this iron, amazing price, excellent item and excellent quality,&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many of them in hopes of finding the perfect straightener....    </li>
            <li>great product hair is very healthy.</li>
            <li>It is simply wonderful, it doesnt damage your hair, it heats up easily.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, and it produces excellent result in the hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve taken very good care of it and it has never been plugged in for more than fifteen minutes at a time.</li>
            <li>I find the straightener to work as good as my sister&#x27;s that I tried before purchasing.</li>
            <li>I think the product is a good product.  </li>
            <li>I had the 1\\&quot; CHI and loved it.  </li>
            <li>this is a good product and you will like it.  </li>
            <li>I looked for a good deal and came across this seller.  </li>
            <li>but I loved it.</li>
            <li>This was a really good purchase.</li>
            <li>I asked my hair salon about this brand and they had good things to say about it.  </li>
            <li>THey are not as good as they used to be.</li>
            <li>My wife loved this while it worked.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>Used a cheaper Chi and loved it but not this one.</li>
            <li>This is the best product I ever bought for my hair, and it is worth every cent of it!</li>
            <li>It works exceptionally well on her hair, even when damp.  </li>
            <li>It arrived in a orderly fashion and the very first time I used the iron I had salon perfect hair.  </li>
            <li>but I figured the difference in cost (~$25) would be made up by many years of great hair.</li>
            <li>Sure, it works great</li>
            <li>Yes the Chi Straightener is awesome and well worth the money, but do not buy from this company.</li>
            <li>My daughter is very pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li>Works great, and I LOVE the results (and so does everyone else).  </li>
            <li>No problems with this new best friend :P</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I have got the thickest, curliest, most unmanagable hair and my Chi makes it looks like silk!  </li>
            <li>I love this straightner!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to come home to a melted counter top or the house on fire!</li>
            <li>i love it!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>and i love it!</li>
            <li>I love this hair straightener!</li>
            <li>I promise you that you&#x27;ll love it and will recommend it to your own friends and family!</li>
            <li>I love this straightener!</li>
            <li>I love my CHI!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>They love it!</li>
            <li>I love this iron!  </li>
            <li>:) I&#x27;m ordering another one today and dare her to touch it!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I bought an older version of this chi straightners and it has been soooo good, that when one of my best friends told me she needed one.</li>
            <li>Great product and still going strong.</li>
            <li>With the Chi, it takes me about 30 min now and it looks amazing - -</li>
            <li>The difference was amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing ...</li>
            <li>That is amazing to me</li>
            <li>The handles was made of real cheap recycle plastic, which my wife complains to me about it because I ordered it (my wife use to work in the plastic injection mold industry, so she always checks out the quality of the mold and plastic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think the reason some women haven&#x27;t liked it is</li>
            <li>I am THRILLED with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and she liked it</li>
            <li>It glides so nicely through my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair spirals perfectly around a pencil, just to give you an idea of how curly it really is.  </li>
            <li>Not to mention the nice shine it gives my hair.  </li>
            <li>which is nice.</li>
            <li>My Wife liked this Hair Straightener.</li>
            <li>I wish I liked the CHI I got</li>
            <li>I used to own one of these about a year ago &amp; my friend owns one too.</li>
            <li>I know that CHI would make sure that their product is in good condition before sending to a store to sell.</li>
            <li>but well worth the money for all the time you will save and how gorgeous and shiny your hair will look!</li>
            <li>Whoa!!!This is an iron that is worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li>This is well worth every penny!!!  </li>
            <li>Whether or not it is, this is a nice seller and I am happy I got so lucky in dealing with nice people.</li>
            <li>My best friend has had two, so it came highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s brand new and works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Got it quickly -- as a gift for my daughter, and she says it works great</li>
            <li>salon quality from your own home : )</li>
            <li>I now own 2 of the Chi Turbo straighteners and we all love them.</li>
            <li>I think this is great, the size is amazing, however it does&#x27;t heat up as hot as I would like, but still does the job.</li>
            <li>She is very happy so far with this straightener.  </li>
            <li>By far, the best hair straightener I have purchased.</li>
            <li>And how easy it is!</li>
            <li>I purchased the Farouk chi Turbo 2 inch in 2006 and it is still going strong!</li>
            <li>not as good as the 1\\&quot; original chi</li>
            <li>I ordered this Farouk CHI hair straigtener, and when it arrived, it was in a very cheap package.</li>
            <li>people didn&#x27;t seem to like it better than the 1 inch</li>
            <li>I love the one inch</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE 2 INCH CHI.</li>
            <li>It is better than the 1 inch.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying another one, and hopefully it gets me 8 more years.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to believe the hype to realize that this is a top quality product.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>i still got it for a better price on-line</li>
            <li>The one I&#x27;ve had for 4 years does a better job.</li>
            <li>Nothing saves more time or does a better job.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it - no problems with it whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE my Chi</li>
            <li>My hair is still healthy and shiny and I use it about 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li>I love it and recommend this one.</li>
            <li>but im glad i found it on amazon :)</li>
            <li>So I thought surely a 2\\&quot; must be better.  </li>
            <li>I contacted the company, since it had been pruchased from amazon more than 30 days, and they said to send it in.     </li>
            <li>this is a great product, I received it so fast</li>
            <li>But what I don&#x27;t like is the fact that I cannot get more of a curl at the ends now because of the 2 inch width.  </li>
            <li>If you want more flexibility...stick with 1 to 1 1/2 inch straightener.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s peeling more and looks so worn out</li>
            <li>I also love that the velvet keeps me from burning myself when I am in a rush (which I always am).</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is also the best gift for any teenage girl.</li>
            <li>Most people with this length hair would have gone with the 1 inch, but given the amount of hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m what most would call, a hair snob.</li>
            <li>I got this on an Amazon Gold Box Deal and figured if it didn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;d be able to return it.    </li>
            <li>The seller was HAIR CARE PLUS AND MORE</li>
            <li>It heats up in seconds and what used to take me 45min to straighten my hair it now takes me 15min the most.  </li>
            <li>LOVE the straightner and my husband does too</li>
            <li>for an extra 50-60 bucks I would buy it at like ulta and get the FULL warranty!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a girl, this is almost better than the cell phone.  </li>
            <li>People, don&#x27;t even bother wasting your money on Conair, Vidal Sasson or any kind of cheap irons that you can get at Target or Walmart.</li>
            <li>But after I got the CHI, I am glad I made that decision.</li>
            <li>One thing to remember when using one of these is make sure you use something to protect your hair.....</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>it makes your hair look beautifuly NATURALY staright, shiny, silky, and amazingly healthy even if your hair isnt.</li>
            <li>i love my CHI which was also purchased on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I think the 1\\&quot; would have been a much better choice.</li>
            <li>Buy the Ceramic Tools unit at $35.00 --- Its so much better and lighter to handle.</li>
            <li>In fact, on Friday nights many of her friends will gather at my house to \\&quot;do their hair\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I love the Chi</li>
            <li>So after an hour of blow-drying and straightening my hair looked sort of okay</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>One of my all time, favorite purchases.</li>
            <li>I love my 2\\&quot; Chi Turbo though</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments.  </li>
            <li>I would have paid more for the product to get the manufacturer&#x27;s year warranty</li>
            <li>It worked amazing while it worked, but it always seemed cheaply made.</li>
            <li>amazon offered a great price, the retail store by my house had it priced twice a much.</li>
            <li>I have tried many hair straighteners.</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>love it for the price.  </li>
            <li>I love this straightener, however, I would not advise buying the Turbo.  </li>
            <li>I used to love the CHI</li>
            <li>My 1 inch that cost me $40 works better.</li>
            <li>Its also sturdy I threw it in and out of more suitcases and drawers than I can count and it truly stood the test of time.</li>
            <li>my Walmart brand works better than these.</li>
            <li>You could probably find a cheaper one that works better.</li>
            <li>and now I&#x27;ve purchased two more for her sisters.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast, works great, never any problems.</li>
            <li>So glad, I bought the 2\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I can tell this product is a knock off for so many reasons.&lt;br /&gt;First</li>
            <li>Need I say more?</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair is thicker with more wave</li>
            <li>more CHI&#x27;s will be purchased at a beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>love Amazon and will continue to purchase products from them.  </li>
            <li>this is an excellent flat iron.</li>
            <li>This flat iron is awesome.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done a lot of flat ironing on my curly hair, and this is the best one that I have found!  </li>
            <li>This is the best flat iron I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Im willing to pay more $$ if I know I am getting a good quality product.</li>
            <li>Great purchase, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It still works even after all these years just as good as when I first bought it.</li>
            <li>She has long hair and a lot of it, so the 2\\&quot; works perfect.     </li>
            <li>(because I&#x27;m worth it!!)</li>
            <li>The new iron works great</li>
            <li>It heats up nicely and straightens your hair quickly.</li>
            <li>The CHI is well worth the money if you are looking for a hair straightener that works like magic!</li>
            <li>The Farouk CHI products are wonderful as long as they don&#x27;t malfuction!!!</li>
            <li>i drop it all the time too, and have gotten it wet by leaving it around my sink, and it STILL works perfectly.</li>
            <li>I remember the good times, getting ready for prom and dances...</li>
            <li>Good investment, I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Two of my daughters practically ran to the shower Christmas morning so they could use their straighteners right away!!</li>
            <li>I received it very quickly in the mail.  </li>
            <li>could easily singe their hair off on the highest settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>the 2\\&quot; chi turbo is a great product, and worth the money if you need your hair straight.</li>
            <li>It is totally worth the price, and works so much better than those cheap irons from the discount store!</li>
            <li>That being said, I have been very lucky with my Chi.</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li>like I said, it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>Heating plate doesn&#x27;t seem to be as strong...</li>
            <li>and I was able return the item for a full credit.</li>
            <li>Worked fine for four months</li>
            <li>The product was a gift and was received in a timely manner and appears to be working fine.  </li>
            <li>The replacement is working fine now.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and it WORKS!</li>
            <li>I got lucky that I will be able to return my iron after contacting amazon customer service.</li>
            <li>don t know if i was not lucky, but some reviews were good, and others not so good, but NEVER  read it burnt the hair.</li>
            <li>However, when the red light stays on, it&#x27;s a great iron.</li>
            <li>Initially, I was happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Tried to return - no one available.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The light is on, and the heat comes off and on randomly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it is fabulous.</li>
            <li>and I was going to just use the cheap $20 one I still have.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough great things about it.  </li>
            <li>Also, the time it takes to straighten your hair with CHI is way faster than the cheap iron.</li>
            <li>I already went through 3 cheap irons, before I decided to get CHI (since it was pricey)</li>
            <li>my pocket isnt exactly filled with money, but without a doubt i would pay even $200 for this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t give 5 stars lightly ...</li>
            <li>and they weren&#x27;t 100% smooth</li>
            <li>I will continue to use my Maxi-Glide and get fabulous results.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to use and it leaves my hair lustrous and shiny.  </li>
            <li>The Farouk Chi is fabulous.</li>
            <li>Truly, it&#x27;s a fabulous product and</li>
            <li>Some work great from day 1 and last years</li>
            <li>The product appeard to be made cheap.</li>
            <li>It does leave my hair silky smooth</li>
            <li>I have used this iron many times before, and loved it, and so I decided to actually purchase one for myself.</li>
            <li>Great Flat Iron, I get a nice straight silky shine from it.  </li>
            <li>It is a great product, works better than any other I have used before.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get such a great deal, but im thinking this was not a chi product, but a knock off.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never seen her use a Christmas gift so much!!!</li>
            <li>CHI flat irons are great but buyer beware...</li>
            <li>your looking for beautiful perfectly straight hair and an iron that heats up in realy no time at all, and is completely durable, trust me youl want this Chi.</li>
            <li>You can do your hair so quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any problems, I love this product and it heats up very fast.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;As for how it works GREAT on long hair.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>Its worth the investement!</li>
            <li>I was so excited</li>
            <li>Originally I purchased these for my daughters</li>
            <li>and i was so excited,</li>
            <li>I originally had the 1/2\\</li>
            <li>&quot; This is 100% worth the price!</li>
            <li>but WELL WORTH IT!</li>
            <li>We have used chi products for years, so we are familiar with the brand.</li>
            <li>I have long curly hair and it worked great.  </li>
            <li>Top Beauty should make that fact as clear as they do about their 30 day warranty!!!!</li>
            <li>and so far we are very happy overall.</li>
            <li>I also own a Shedu straightener and have found the 1 inch straightener gives more flexibility to try different styling like curls.</li>
            <li>I received many positive reviews about this product from my friends...</li>
            <li>I was extrememly dissapointed to find this out as my authentic CHI 2 inch flat iron was the best flat iron ever.  </li>
            <li>Basically, I straighten the top portion of my  hair and let the bottom remain curly - it actually looks pretty good.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best flat iron I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing flat iron I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I think most people could easily burn their fingers or ears by touching their actual hair just after it has moved out of the iron on heat settings 8, 9 or 10.  </li>
            <li>It does heat up super fast and is very lightweight and feels good in my hands.  </li>
            <li>because I don&#x27;t think the length of the hair really matters, I think it is thicker textured hair which does better with the two inch.  </li>
            <li>but the \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; version is cool...</li>
            <li>Aside from my girls I also work full time and go to nursing school</li>
            <li>The iron itself is like a dream come true.  </li>
            <li>They sent me a full refund once I returned both straighteners...</li>
            <li>But my point is buy this product from a more responsible company.</li>
            <li>For someone who has struggled and suffered with curly hair all my life, this is a dream come true.</li>
            <li>It literally glides through my hair, making it straight, shiny and healthy feeling.  </li>
            <li>I immediately returned it for a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife loved this gift - she has long curly hair and this iron got it smooth and silky</li>
            <li>Heats up fast, smooth, doesn&#x27;t pull or tear my hair, and so easy to use.</li>
            <li>, it heats super fast, and does a phenomenal job.</li>
            <li>This iron heats up very quickly and gets really hot.  </li>
            <li>It gets hot but doesn&#x27;t straighten my lhair easily.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more maneuverable, and doing smaller sections at a time will produce better</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to clean and heats up incredibly fast.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and works like a charm.</li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly and well packaged.  </li>
            <li>and I was amazed at how quickly it arrived in the mail...</li>
            <li>quick to take your money but never reply to warranty questions..............</li>
            <li>Luckily nothing happened and i stopped using it.</li>
            <li>one great thing about the whole experience is that I received a credit back to my account within 2 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Turned on once and heated up quick and then never turned on again.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend the brand but like the 1\\&quot; better.</li>
            <li>This iron heats up quickly and gets very hot.  </li>
            <li>The Chi turbo gets very hot, makes my hair look silky, and doesn&#x27;t burn my hand.  </li>
            <li>It did not get very hot at all.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product because it works properly and met my expectations as a straightening product.  </li>
            <li>It also had a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li>I e-mailed my concern to Top Beauty who quickly responded that they are very clear about their 30 day warranty to which I agree.</li>
            <li>It was recommended highly by my cousin and when she purchased hers a few months before me, I used it and was quite impressed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had soooooo many compliments on my new hairstyle.  </li>
            <li>Overall pretty good product.</li>
            <li>This one is very sturdy and love how HOT it gets.  </li>
            <li>I found this one on Amazon for under $100 and at first worried it wouldn&#x27;t be good enough, but after reading reviews, I gave it a try.   </li>
            <li>And THANKS to Amazon.com, the return process was so easy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the flat iron I received.  </li>
            <li>I found the same product in stores for $120 more than I paid here!</li>
            <li>she has enough time to straighten her hair, and it looks BETTER than when she would spend 30 min - hour trying to straighten it before!     </li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and this straightener works SO well!!</li>
            <li>After just one press your hair is STRAIGHT!!  </li>
            <li>I paid what a REAL CHI would cost!!</li>
            <li>I think that Amazon has the best prices (i&#x27;m looking to get a new one for my little sister for Christmas) and is worth the risk ...</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this flat iron!  </li>
            <li>(I have baby fine hair very prone to breakage).  </li>
            <li>The results were great, my hair was smooth and it took no time at all to straighten my thick wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money-</li>
            <li>it really is a great straightener, but i still think it damages my hear/ creates \\&quot;fly-away,\\&quot; broken pieces of hair on the top of my head.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the money....</li>
            <li>It was well worth the money,</li>
            <li>There were misspelled words in the directions, the felt on the outside was peeling and kept catching my hair and it would not stay warm for longer than three seconds before it would need to heat itself back up.  </li>
            <li>every women wants straight sexy hair and this is the solution.</li>
            <li>I think the price is well worth it.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s worth making the investment.</li>
            <li>It works and it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>so I wanted something that would work fast AND be good enough to hold.     </li>
            <li>cause it s rare this happened.</li>
            <li>It is worth the money we spend.</li>
            <li>worth everypenny</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>said that it left her hair \\&quot;greasy\\&quot;, but she&#x27;s picky about that kind of thing.     </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every dollar of the investment.  </li>
            <li>well worth the money</li>
            <li>I was worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I spent a good chunk of money on.</li>
            <li>Not quite worth the money.</li>
            <li>and it works right away and leaves your hair looking and feeling silky smooth and pin straight.  </li>
            <li>I think the seller didn&#x27;t send me a good one and also the packaging was not like my other Amazon orders.</li>
            <li>I had the original real version of this item that I had ordered from amazon 4 years ago.</li>
            <li>Right now I am in the process of trying to find out whether or not Amazon can or will do anything.</li>
            <li>and she was right.  </li>
            <li>there is simply no other better hair iron around.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous product and I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this seller as service was prompt, reliable &amp; accurate.  </li>
            <li>This means that she is happy with her hair and it takes her A LOT less time to get ready.    </li>
            <li>I have been using the 2 inch straightener for less than a month and for the most part am satisfied with the performance.  </li>
            <li>It was nice not having to wait a long time for it.  </li>
            <li>I bought the chi turbo after much research and was very excited to finally be getting a good quality flat iron.  </li>
            <li>My first inclination was to buy the 2\\&quot; size - that would make the process faster, right?  </li>
            <li>It is really quick and fast.  </li>
            <li>It is not that heavy or big and it is actually beautiful!</li>
            <li>The only upside was the great customer service by Amazon (even though I had to pay to ship both irons back).  </li>
            <li>you want straight hair quickly, with salon quality, bite the bullet</li>
            <li>The iron did not get very hot and it didn&#x27;t get my hair straight at all.</li>
            <li>, only thing i don&#x27;t like is that i need a high heat to straighten fast which makes my hair feel hot for a good 10 secs</li>
            <li>It heats up super fast, gives you stick straight shiny hair, no smell of the appliance to make your hair smell funky!</li>
            <li>The cost was very reasonable as well.</li>
            <li>Of course this makes it very straight</li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought the two inch and will probably never go back to the one inch.  </li>
            <li>my first day at my first job...now I&#x27;m in business school, and yesterday it just stopped working.   </li>
            <li>size matters - smaller size is better -</li>
            <li>yes, this iron is more expensive, but hopefully it will last for years of top-notch straightening.</li>
            <li>Well, funny thing.</li>
            <li>I was in shock the first time I used it</li>
            <li>It saves so much TIME!</li>
            <li>Should have bought this one first.</li>
            <li>but overall I had more control with the 1\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>The reason I finally up-graded was because I&#x27;m going on a trip with some girlfriends and wanted something better to take with me.  </li>
            <li>(reason why I was loyal to buying this particular straigtner).</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed!</li>
            <li>Overall I was extremely satisfied with the product and the supplier.</li>
            <li>If it had not failed within 30 days would not have received a replacement more than likely.</li>
            <li>This hair straightener was a last resort for me, I&#x27;ve gone through many of them.</li>
            <li>I returned it and got a full refund and the people from the company are really nice, but don&#x27;t waste your time ordering this product b/c</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bigger which allows it to cover more ground.  </li>
            <li>It turns out that after the first time I did my hair, the iron broke and would not turn on.</li>
            <li>I boughtmy first Turbo Chi 2\\&quot; at a salon 2 years ago.</li>
            <li>First off, let me tell you all that my hair is maddening.</li>
            <li>My hair was straight!</li>
            <li>The first iron I had melted my hair and burnt out on the first use...</li>
            <li>the replacement also burnt out the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Turbo\\&quot; CHI allows you to adjust the heat temperature, while the original CHI does not---the original has a standard heat setting.  </li>
            <li>For some reason hers does not got hot even on the highest setting.  </li>
            <li>Also I found that the larger one is really much more clunkier</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s so much more easier using the smaller iron since it is lighter</li>
            <li>Sorry I rambled but I am uber happy!</li>
            <li>would not stay hot like its supposed to.</li>
            <li>The cost might make it worth buying from here rather than in-store where they fulfill the year warranty but charge twice as much.</li>
            <li>CHI products are typically pretty reliable</li>
            <li>I suspect that the plug is shorted inside the straightener as it stopped turning on, but I also wrap the cord around to store it so most likely my fault.</li>
            <li>They assured me this product is not a fake.</li>
            <li>It worked alright first time.</li>
            <li>the 2\\&quot; is so big that you won&#x27;t be able to grab pieces of hair.  </li>
            <li>It warms up fast too!</li>
            <li>This is worth every penny, and it will save me so much money.</li>
            <li>She used it the first time and it quit working halfway through.</li>
            <li>And it still works pretty well.</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>I tried it when I first got it.  </li>
            <li>Stays hot and irons out my curly hair</li>
            <li>advice is, if you know exactly what you&#x27;re getting, order it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, if you have no idea how it feels or looks, I would check it out in the stores first.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the heat my first one had.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my hair straight until I was it again. !</li>
            <li>I love the Flat Iron and it really was worth the price.</li>
            <li>I showed it to my sister, who had introduced me to this flat iron after herself using it for so many years, and she too noticed that it&#x27;s like a knock-off version.</li>
            <li>If you flat iron your hair more than 2x a month</li>
            <li>and then I put off returning it thinking that I had the full term of the warranty, but Farouk doesn&#x27;t honor the waranty since I bought it online and not in a professional salon!</li>
            <li>&quot; Flat Iron is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed using the CHI Turbo 2 inch flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t want to spend so much money for a flat iron, but since all the others I was using didn&#x27;t do such a great job, I decided to go for it.  </li>
            <li>Heats up fast and turns my unmanageable curly hair to smooth and silky soft in minutes...</li>
            <li>Love is such a strong word to use so we are in DEEP LIKE!  </li>
            <li>I have owned several in the past, both inexpensive and high end appliances, and this one is the best.  </li>
            <li>so I was positive it would work.  </li>
            <li>The iron works pretty well with the heating up fast part.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it very much, but the few times I did, it was amazing.</li>
            <li>This ia a fabulous flat iron, better than any you can buy at your local store.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ans I do agree, the smaller the hair straightener, the better (I originally had a smaller one, that my salon uses, but it also stopped working).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I live in Houston Texas and if you have been there you know our humidity is fun for hair.</li>
            <li>It eliminates the frizz as it straightens and leaves your hair shiny and super soft.</li>
            <li>The 2\\&quot; CHI is easy to maneuver and straightens my hair in bigger batches.  </li>
            <li>The first one came from a local hair salon and was fantastic for about 6 years.  </li>
            <li>I have long and thick hair and the 2 inch straightened my hair perfectly</li>
            <li>and it was nothing like the original one, it barely lasted 5 months.</li>
            <li>I thought I was happy to find another 2 inch Chi Turbo flat iron to replace the original one I have owned for at least seven years.  </li>
            <li>I love this flat iron and I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I returned it right away to amazon and received a new one in the mail within 5 days.</li>
            <li>Keep your setting low and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>it works great, heats up really quickly, and i can completely straighten my long hair in much less than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>It really makes that much of a difference in the damage and amount of time I have in the morning to get ready.</li>
            <li>It works so much better on my thick, coarse hair, flattening it quicker, and letting me take bigger chunks at a time while still doing a great job.  </li>
            <li>have curly hair and it took me 40 minutes to get it pin straight</li>
            <li>This is a knock off - not the real thing.</li>
            <li>This straightens hair but doesn&#x27;t smooth as well as hoped, especially considering the cost.</li>
            <li>Straightens hair smooth and shiny in a very short time.</li>
            <li>It is a time saver and so gentle on the hair.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>and it can get my hair extremely straight with no kinks.</li>
            <li>I have very thick,coarse hair</li>
            <li>even though it much more than I&#x27;ve ever spent on a straightner before.</li>
            <li>I was very dissapointed</li>
            <li>But I also treat my iron very well and protect it like the $100 dollar investment it is.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier to manipulate.  </li>
            <li>If all you care about is straight hair...</li>
            <li>I would tell my friends that I have curly hair and there is no way even a Chi would get it straight like the model pics.</li>
            <li>I like having the option of having straight hair</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>It gets my frizzy, curly hair soooo straight and controlled.  </li>
            <li>When I straighten my hair with the Chi, my hair STAYS straight all day and doesn&#x27;t frizz out.  </li>
            <li>AND it has cut atleast 10 minutes out of my time getting ready.</li>
            <li>With the Chi, however, handling is much smoother, and the controls are well-built</li>
            <li>High Five!</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it to everyone who would want a silky straight hair...</li>
            <li>I would not recommend it to anyone who wants a real chi.</li>
            <li>Seemed to not be the real thing.</li>
            <li>theres tends to be alot of moist in my area, but my hair would still stay straight without having to straighten over and over...</li>
            <li>It took a while, of course, because I have so much hair, but after an hour of straightening the finished product was miraculous.</li>
            <li>The 1\\&quot; CHI would have taken much longer to pass through all of my hair.    </li>
            <li>but if I could do it again, I&#x27;d get the 1 - 1 1/2 width one and be much happier.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to do as much damage to the hair as others I have used.  </li>
            <li>my hair STAYED straight.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>the supplier was also very prompt</li>
            <li>My only concern is sometimes I have to restart my wall-jack because it won&#x27;t light up/turn on.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the 2-inch size.</li>
            <li>However, as I said it worked very well when it worked.</li>
            <li>Probably not even the real chi brand.</li>
            <li>I was very upset with this product and seller.</li>
            <li>It straightens so fast and humidity doesn&#x27;t even make it frizzy or</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a straight iron because they could never handle my hair.  </li>
            <li>The straightener works really well</li>
            <li>, my hair was pin straight.  </li>
            <li>It feels like it was cheaply made and not as solid.</li>
            <li>BECAUSE THEY ARE  NOT AUTHORIZED TO SELL THE REAL THING</li>
            <li>My hair to be straight.</li>
            <li>My hair didn&#x27;t even get straight....</li>
            <li>As soon as I tried it for real</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t plan on using it a lot I wouldn&#x27;t invest that much</li>
            <li>Thanks for letting us know</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s real or not</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 12 year old daughter after researching many different models and brands.  </li>
            <li>It heats up fast, and your hair stay straight a day long (unlike the cheap ones, my hair won&#x27;t stay straight for a whole day)</li>
            <li>This is much better than the other brands.</li>
            <li>dont buy a cheap flat iron!</li>
            <li>I have long, wavy/curly hair, and have tried cheap straighteners and blow drying my hair straight before, but never with satisfactory results.</li>
            <li>And of course, there&#x27;s good amount of hair loss just like any other flat iron.</li>
            <li>Now after only a couple of months, I regret not returning it right away!</li>
            <li>the power light does not flash in the same way that the Chi does when the product is warmed up.&lt;br /&gt;Besides all of those obvious signs this is a crappy piece of junk, the straightener doesn&#x27;t get hot at all, does nothing to my hair and does not work!</li>
            <li>Maybe this product is good (i have done enough research on this product and it has good reviews), but i was unlucky and got a bad one.</li>
            <li>My hair stylist always used it when styling my hair, so after my first flat iron finally died, I decided to get the exact one that always made my hair look so fabulous when leaving the salon.  </li>
            <li>i ordered a chi gf1539 full price then 4 months later the item for some reason stops working</li>
            <li>It also did not get as hot as my old one did.  </li>
            <li>As professional women we don&#x27;t have much time in the morning so having a good straightner that can to the trick in the least amount of time</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair soft and heats up really fast!</li>
            <li>hair straigtener is not worth $100, it looks more like a $20-$30 product.</li>
            <li>I live in the south and deal with humidity!  </li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about this straightener, like I said I had the last one for a long time and used it very often, almost every day.</li>
            <li>I was not sure if a flat iron was worth this much money, but am completely satisfied with this one!</li>
            <li>The latter feature is worth the money to me alone, and the the ceramic feels much gentler to my hair</li>
            <li>Great product and is the only thing that works on my thick Hispanic hair.</li>
            <li>and they said they cannot warranty the item because its an older unit not under warranty.</li>
            <li>With the amount of money that is spent for this flat iron, it should work more than 4 months!  </li>
            <li>However, 2 days ago, after using my own the day before that, I plugged in my Chi Flat Iron only to realsie the exact same thing happened to me.</li>
            <li>I have long hair (about three inches below my shoulders) and I debated as to whether I should get the 1\\&quot; or 2\\&quot; CHI and whether I should purchase the original or turbo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I chose this flat iron, It heats up really fast and the very long swivel cord is very convenient.</li>
            <li>Meaning if your hair is kind of wavy or curly, you&#x27;ll get a larger chunk of hair that is ironed down between the plates before being pulled straight.  </li>
            <li>I had exactly this model and was crushed when it died after 8 years of loyal service.</li>
            <li>, but this iron was highly recommended by salon personnel, so I decided to dish out the money and try it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly highly recommended.</li>
            <li>you prolly wont&#x27; need the high setting     &#x3D;</li>
            <li>The product was priced high for the lack of quality.</li>
            <li>and i would highly recommend it which is just 50$.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I finally got the chi flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I have been straightening my hair for about 15 years and have tried many different flat irons.</li>
            <li>But since my hubby fixed the electrical cord on my original 2 inch Chi Turbo, I will keep this one as a back up.  </li>
            <li>My natural hair is very curly and normal texture.</li>
            <li>After using our hair is soft and straight.  </li>
            <li>This product is worth buying, especially if you have hard-to-manage hair like mine.</li>
            <li>I have straight hair with a little bit of a wave to it, as well as it gets frizzy easily.</li>
            <li>I did reread the enclosed packaging and it says in fine print that it will not honor their waranty if purchased on the internet or anywhere other than a porfessional salon.</li>
            <li>If you have hair shorter than right below your shoulders, you should probably get the smaller iron-</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it&#x27;s amazing results only last for as long as the product does and for me this was about 2.5 weeks.  </li>
            <li>My question is whether my iron is new or refurbished????</li>
            <li>so I wanted to order a new one.  </li>
            <li>I live in Florida and there&#x27;s a lot of humidity</li>
            <li>-- I live in San Francisco,</li>
            <li>I have been using my new Turbo Chi every day</li>
            <li>I think its a new design in chi.</li>
            <li>I live in Trinidad, West Indies.</li>
            <li>My friend loves this new version I got for her, and if I ever had to replace mine, that has been with me since 2008 and still works like a charm I will go with this one, no need to think about it twice.</li>
            <li>Bought it new.</li>
            <li>My hair was completely straight and silky smooth and it brought my flatiron time down from an hour to 15 minutes!  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on the cheaper versions from the drug stores---believe me the price is worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>I took a chance on the CHI straightner and it easily cuts my straighting time in half.</li>
            <li>i find that my hair is less damaged and the chi is so easy to use..</li>
            <li>It is larger than normal flattening irons and it gets really hot.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t over dry my hair and is really quick.</li>
            <li>I am very surprised Amazon allows these companys to sell to their clients.</li>
            <li>I did some pretty extensive research before deciding on a Chi Hair Straightener.</li>
            <li>Replaced first order because it was defective and the replacement arrived and now has the same problem.</li>
            <li>She has purchased a CHI in the past and it worked 100 times better.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Other than that, totally worth the money!</li>
            <li>The last ceramic flat iron I bought pulled and snagged my hair, this was so smooth.</li>
            <li>I owned a 2 inch Chi (the exact same one) for 6 years.</li>
            <li>It heats up better than the small one.</li>
            <li>I took it to a reputable salon who informed me that this iron was not authentic, but was a \\&quot;knock-off\\&quot; version.</li>
            <li>However, it definitely doesn&#x27;t get that hot</li>
            <li>I highly recommend if looking for a high quality flat iron that really works well.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this flat iron to anyone but especially African American women who are interested in quickly straightening their hair.</li>
            <li>When i visited my cousin in New Jersey in May this year, her Flat Iron just wasnt coming on after plugging it in which was strange because it worked perfectly fine the day before and days before that.</li>
            <li>I tried using the new one yesterday, and it did not work as well as my old one.</li>
            <li>with my old straighteners it would take me a long time, but with the 2\\&quot; turbo chi, my hair is straight in half the time and looks better than before.</li>
            <li>This was my first Chi product and was surprised by the low quality of it.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s a big 2 incher, she has more minutes in her day to do other things!  </li>
            <li>The first few times using this iron, it wasn&#x27;t really making my hair straight...</li>
            <li>It does not get as hot as my cheaper flat iron.  </li>
            <li>the first time i used it i could see the difference compared to store bought flat irons.</li>
            <li>So I cut my hair, which was really hurtful, and finally ended up buying this chi straightener, and I am totally amazed, how pretty my hair can look.</li>
            <li>I have extremely thick, extremely curly hair and therefore cannot use just any flat iron on my hair (many just flatten it, they do not straighten the curls, and many leave my hair poofy).</li>
            <li>I bought my most recent one on Amazon as it was a little cheaper with the shipping.</li>
            <li>I just dried my hair quickly to get it dry without bothering to really straighten it first.  </li>
            <li>CHI has never been disappointing and as expected, it is  a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>ions\\&quot; and \\&quot;far infrared technology\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The CHI got my hair about as straight as blow-drying would have and my hair frizzed as soon as I stepped outside.  </li>
            <li>Completely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently growing out some of the shorter sections and have found this tool very helpful in keeping my hair from looking like a helmet.</li>
            <li>So far no problems, though.</li>
            <li>I really thought I had totally scored!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 months now and no problems so far.</li>
            <li>It WAS NOT like the old one.  </li>
            <li>and it straightens with one pass and leaves my hair soft as silk.</li>
            <li>This was the only place that had any or was receiving any in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>It takes me about 45 minutes to get it straight which is actually not a lot of time at all</li>
            <li>actually will make my hair much softer.</li>
            <li>She wants to send it back.  </li>
            <li>It runs through my hair with ease, and leaves it looking soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>When my old straightener died, I knew I was going to get this iron.</li>
            <li>I have really naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>I bought the 2\\&quot; Turbo and it gets the job done on my course, naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>It completely straightens my curls and leaves my hair soft, silky, and shiny.</li>
            <li>After about 3 months my straightener completely quit working.</li>
            <li>The unit didn&#x27;t close on hair completely causing alot of hair pulling.</li>
            <li>It works well on my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I now have moved onto a GHD 2inch and seem to like it so far.  </li>
            <li>I have contacted AMAZON to get help and so far there has been no resolution.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to try to get resolution from this seller but SINCE THEY ARE A COMPLETE FRAUD</li>
            <li>And I would recommend one that qualifies for Amazon Prime, just because you want to have the support from Amazon directly.</li>
            <li>I went over the hair twice and it completely straightened it.  </li>
            <li>old granddaughter</li>
            <li>It makes my hair look so soft and shiney.</li>
            <li>As far as how it function, my wife decided not to try it</li>
            <li>so I contacted the Chi company directly.</li>
            <li>I love that I got the 2\\&quot; because I have a lot of hair and also really thick hair</li>
            <li>I have very curly thick hair and have never been able to get it as flat as the shop does.</li>
            <li>Most flat irons I&#x27;ve tried have worked for only a few minutes, then went right back to wavy.</li>
            <li>I wish I had invested in the CHI flat iron much sooner than I did.</li>
            <li>I have not had any problem with this flat iron and it works very well on my hair.  </li>
            <li>&quot; original but after 2 1/2 years of heavy use, it quit working, so</li>
            <li>BUT this one is not as heavy as the original</li>
            <li>I am continually frustrated with making sure I hold the iron in a certain spot so that it heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li>WAY too much money to drop on a flat iron that doesn&#x27;t even have a valid warranty!</li>
            <li>When I say hot, I mean this puppy gets HOT!  </li>
            <li>Does not get hot enough and when using the different outlets the temperature ranges.  </li>
            <li>this is my 3rd chi straightener and my 2nd turbo (my first one was a 1 inch).</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly, and cannot be blown dry straight and was barely straight after 30-45 minutes with a flat iron.</li>
            <li>but I decided that a hair ironer that costs that much and had such a great reputation should not have such an inconvenient complication</li>
            <li>It seems that the joint where the top and both handles connect is a little loose.</li>
            <li>I have long, very course hair with medium curls and poofy issues.</li>
            <li>I have very curly long hair</li>
            <li>I have real frizzy and wavy hair, and I gave up my long hair</li>
            <li>We both have long relatively straight hair.  </li>
            <li>This is my second ceramic flat iron and my first chi.</li>
            <li>We love our Chi Turbo, we have long, thick hair that only seems to get straight and silky with a Chi</li>
            <li>It still works as if it was brand new with equal heat distribution.</li>
            <li>Amazon replaced it with a new one shipped over night; I had it the next day before lunch.</li>
            <li>Now 6 years later when mine stopped working I had to order a new one.  </li>
            <li>Had I known that it was trying to pass as new but was actually refurbished</li>
            <li>This Chi does not compare to my previous 3 which were definitely worth the money</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s old Chi straighter developed a short and wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely thick, frizzes easily, and takes two hours to wash and get all of the knots out of.</li>
            <li>my first chi turbo, which i have had since 2007, still works but it takes a little bit longer since the plates don&#x27;t get as hot -- this long life expectancy is why i chose to get a 2 inch turbo.</li>
            <li>I decided I needed more coverage, other reviews say that a 2 inch flat iron is harder to manipulate.  </li>
            <li>With three teenagers getting ready at the same time, and fighting over this particular one, the other two are getting one for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>maybe  a little expensive, but I had the cheap ones and they dry your hair, and the time you save,,, It is really worthy, BUY IT!!!</li>
            <li>My last flat iron was an infrashine and that was much hotter.</li>
            <li>Price was almost half what I could&#x27;ve spent, so I also had money left to  buy her a couple more birthday presents.  </li>
            <li>After trying various other less expensive brands for years, and them not working so great or taking forever to do the job,I decided to buy the chi after my sister in law, who has super curly hair recommended it.  </li>
            <li>Bought this when I had a new style that needed a flat iron.  </li>
            <li>So while I highly recommend the CHI Turbo straightener, I would recommend the smaller widths unless you know for a fact that you prefer the larger plates.  </li>
            <li>I have spent so much time, money and effort searching for a straightener that delivers results.</li>
            <li>It is not a short in the wire, as Chi irons are sensitive to.  </li>
            <li>my grandma spent too much on me &gt;&amp;lt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this straightner last dec for my 21 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend was tired of hearing me complain about never being able to get my hair</li>
            <li>She tried some of her friends expensive one too and says she really liked this one.</li>
            <li>My thick wavy hair becomes pin straight!!!   </li>
            <li>With a more narrow plate, you have less of that happening before you start your straightening.   </li>
            <li>I debated for awhile and read all the reviews I could on the pros and cons on spending so much on this flat iron as well as between the smaller size or the larger 2inch one.  </li>
            <li>The only thing i didn&#x27;t like was to see that the price went down on it right after I ordered it.</li>
            <li>It also does not leave hair stiff (it is common to see some flat irons that leave the hair with no movement, which doesn&#x27;t look very healthy or natural).</li>
            <li>I have been using cheap flat irons for the past couple years.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very curly and can get extremely frizzy.</li>
            <li>I bought this flat iron for my 15 yeard old daughter on a recommendation of a friend.  </li>
            <li>My daughter claims it works much faster than other irons and leaves her hair silky smoothe.</li>
            <li>and if you can have hair like that everyday without even spending more than 30 miniuts occasionaly, who wouldnt pay a little over $100?  &lt;</li>
            <li>It came in today and my hair which is past my shoulders was completely straight and shiny in 10 minutes, and I did not have to blow dry it straight-ish first.</li>
            <li>Well, I was advised and found out to be true that bigger is not better in this situation, for reasons stated below.  </li>
            <li>My hair was still curly since I did not dry it that day.  </li>
            <li>but then disappointed greatly at the results.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I have to replace those is because they are hard to clean.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;l probably use it over the old flat iron I have that has just metal plates</li>
            <li>I ordered this on Feb 2.......unless it&#x27;s being ship from JAPAN there is no excuse.</li>
            <li>Product is already broken after only 3 weeks, and I no longer have the box for returns- will never purchase from amazon again and will go back to store purchases so the product quality is better and returns are easier</li>
            <li>I have thick hair and has a bit of a natural wave to it or more like it become poofy when dried.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if that happens to other people or if maybe it is just a glitch with mine, but is still works fine regardless.</li>
            <li>Apparently the CHI flat irons sold on Amazon are not up to standards.  </li>
            <li>I am white and have shoulder length hair that is super thick, wavy &amp; frizzy...</li>
            <li>The first day I used it the velvet pannels started to slide off making it a big gooy mess!</li>
            <li>I feel like with today&#x27;s technology and spending so much money on it, it should get a little hotter.</li>
            <li>I live in Louisiana where it is extremely humid.  </li>
            <li>read the other reviews on here after and found Chi makes a new version if this that is only availble from approved retailers.</li>

            <li> Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t pullout all your hair or break it!</li>
            <li> It is the best purchase ever.  </li>

            <li> This straightener worked wonderfully - for 8 months.</li>
            <li> I will not ever attempt to buy online a CHI product again - the best direction is to go to one of their authorized dealers.  </li>
            <li> Very impressed with Amazons customer service!</li>
            <li> Works great !  </li>

            <li> - he can&#x27;t believe how good my hair looks!</li>
            <li> and I loved it!  </li>
            <li> Straightens hair beautifully.</li>
            <li> But because of the great reviews and the reputation of the chi</li>
            <li> I used mine 5 times and it worked great, then the 6th time it would not turn on at all.     </li>
            <li> and you should be happy with the way you look</li>

            <li> Great IRON</li>
            <li> I was upset and truly happy when I was issued a refund.</li>
            <li> this does the job @ a great price.</li>
            <li> It worked great.</li>
            <li> The supplier was great</li>
            <li> The price on amazon is a great buy</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> great for 5 years, found this one online</li>
            <li> my wife love this iron, amazing price, excellent item and excellent quality,&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many of them in hopes of finding the perfect straightener....    </li>
            <li> great product hair is very healthy.</li>
            <li> It is simply wonderful, it doesnt damage your hair, it heats up easily.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, and it produces excellent result in the hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken very good care of it and it has never been plugged in for more than fifteen minutes at a time.</li>
            <li> I find the straightener to work as good as my sister&#x27;s that I tried before purchasing.</li>
            <li> I think the product is a good product.  </li>
            <li> I had the 1\\&quot; CHI and loved it.  </li>
            <li> this is a good product and you will like it.  </li>
            <li> I looked for a good deal and came across this seller.  </li>
            <li> but I loved it.</li>
            <li> This was a really good purchase.</li>
            <li> I asked my hair salon about this brand and they had good things to say about it.  </li>
            <li> THey are not as good as they used to be.</li>
            <li> My wife loved this while it worked.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
            <li> Good luck.</li>
            <li> Used a cheaper Chi and loved it but not this one.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I ever bought for my hair, and it is worth every cent of it!</li>
            <li> It works exceptionally well on her hair, even when damp.  </li>
            <li> It arrived in a orderly fashion and the very first time I used the iron I had salon perfect hair.  </li>
            <li> but I figured the difference in cost (~$25) would be made up by many years of great hair.</li>
            <li> Sure, it works great</li>
            <li> Yes the Chi Straightener is awesome and well worth the money, but do not buy from this company.</li>
            <li> My daughter is very pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li> Works great, and I LOVE the results (and so does everyone else).  </li>
            <li> No problems with this new best friend :P</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I have got the thickest, curliest, most unmanagable hair and my Chi makes it looks like silk!  </li>
            <li> I love this straightner!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to come home to a melted counter top or the house on fire!</li>
            <li> i love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> and i love it!</li>
            <li> I love this hair straightener!</li>
            <li> I promise you that you&#x27;ll love it and will recommend it to your own friends and family!</li>
            <li> I love this straightener!</li>
            <li> I love my CHI!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> They love it!</li>
            <li> I love this iron!  </li>
            <li> :) I&#x27;m ordering another one today and dare her to touch it!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought an older version of this chi straightners and it has been soooo good, that when one of my best friends told me she needed one.</li>
            <li> Great product and still going strong.</li>
            <li> With the Chi, it takes me about 30 min now and it looks amazing - -</li>
            <li> The difference was amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing ...</li>
            <li> That is amazing to me</li>
            <li> The handles was made of real cheap recycle plastic, which my wife complains to me about it because I ordered it (my wife use to work in the plastic injection mold industry, so she always checks out the quality of the mold and plastic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think the reason some women haven&#x27;t liked it is</li>
            <li> I am THRILLED with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and she liked it</li>
            <li> It glides so nicely through my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair spirals perfectly around a pencil, just to give you an idea of how curly it really is.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention the nice shine it gives my hair.  </li>
            <li> which is nice.</li>
            <li> My Wife liked this Hair Straightener.</li>
            <li> I wish I liked the CHI I got</li>
            <li> I used to own one of these about a year ago &amp; my friend owns one too.</li>
            <li> I know that CHI would make sure that their product is in good condition before sending to a store to sell.</li>
            <li> but well worth the money for all the time you will save and how gorgeous and shiny your hair will look!</li>
            <li> Whoa!!!This is an iron that is worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> This is well worth every penny!!!  </li>
            <li> Whether or not it is, this is a nice seller and I am happy I got so lucky in dealing with nice people.</li>
            <li> My best friend has had two, so it came highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s brand new and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Got it quickly -- as a gift for my daughter, and she says it works great</li>
            <li> salon quality from your own home : )</li>
            <li> I now own 2 of the Chi Turbo straighteners and we all love them.</li>
            <li> I think this is great, the size is amazing, however it does&#x27;t heat up as hot as I would like, but still does the job.</li>
            <li> She is very happy so far with this straightener.  </li>
            <li> By far, the best hair straightener I have purchased.</li>
            <li> And how easy it is!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Farouk chi Turbo 2 inch in 2006 and it is still going strong!</li>
            <li> not as good as the 1\\&quot; original chi</li>
            <li> I ordered this Farouk CHI hair straigtener, and when it arrived, it was in a very cheap package.</li>
            <li> people didn&#x27;t seem to like it better than the 1 inch</li>
            <li> I love the one inch</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE 2 INCH CHI.</li>
            <li> It is better than the 1 inch.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying another one, and hopefully it gets me 8 more years.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to believe the hype to realize that this is a top quality product.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> i still got it for a better price on-line</li>
            <li> The one I&#x27;ve had for 4 years does a better job.</li>
            <li> Nothing saves more time or does a better job.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it - no problems with it whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE my Chi</li>
            <li> My hair is still healthy and shiny and I use it about 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li> I love it and recommend this one.</li>
            <li> but im glad i found it on amazon :)</li>
            <li> So I thought surely a 2\\&quot; must be better.  </li>
            <li> I contacted the company, since it had been pruchased from amazon more than 30 days, and they said to send it in.     </li>
            <li> this is a great product, I received it so fast</li>
            <li> But what I don&#x27;t like is the fact that I cannot get more of a curl at the ends now because of the 2 inch width.  </li>
            <li> If you want more flexibility...stick with 1 to 1 1/2 inch straightener.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s peeling more and looks so worn out</li>
            <li> I also love that the velvet keeps me from burning myself when I am in a rush (which I always am).</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is also the best gift for any teenage girl.</li>
            <li> Most people with this length hair would have gone with the 1 inch, but given the amount of hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m what most would call, a hair snob.</li>
            <li> I got this on an Amazon Gold Box Deal and figured if it didn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;d be able to return it.    </li>
            <li> The seller was HAIR CARE PLUS AND MORE</li>
            <li> It heats up in seconds and what used to take me 45min to straighten my hair it now takes me 15min the most.  </li>
            <li> LOVE the straightner and my husband does too</li>
            <li> for an extra 50-60 bucks I would buy it at like ulta and get the FULL warranty!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a girl, this is almost better than the cell phone.  </li>
            <li> People, don&#x27;t even bother wasting your money on Conair, Vidal Sasson or any kind of cheap irons that you can get at Target or Walmart.</li>
            <li> But after I got the CHI, I am glad I made that decision.</li>
            <li> One thing to remember when using one of these is make sure you use something to protect your hair.....</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> it makes your hair look beautifuly NATURALY staright, shiny, silky, and amazingly healthy even if your hair isnt.</li>
            <li> i love my CHI which was also purchased on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I think the 1\\&quot; would have been a much better choice.</li>
            <li> Buy the Ceramic Tools unit at $35.00 --- Its so much better and lighter to handle.</li>
            <li> In fact, on Friday nights many of her friends will gather at my house to \\&quot;do their hair\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I love the Chi</li>
            <li> So after an hour of blow-drying and straightening my hair looked sort of okay</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> One of my all time, favorite purchases.</li>
            <li> I love my 2\\&quot; Chi Turbo though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments.  </li>
            <li> I would have paid more for the product to get the manufacturer&#x27;s year warranty</li>
            <li> It worked amazing while it worked, but it always seemed cheaply made.</li>
            <li> amazon offered a great price, the retail store by my house had it priced twice a much.</li>
            <li> I have tried many hair straighteners.</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> love it for the price.  </li>
            <li> I love this straightener, however, I would not advise buying the Turbo.  </li>
            <li> I used to love the CHI</li>
            <li> My 1 inch that cost me $40 works better.</li>
            <li> Its also sturdy I threw it in and out of more suitcases and drawers than I can count and it truly stood the test of time.</li>
            <li> my Walmart brand works better than these.</li>
            <li> You could probably find a cheaper one that works better.</li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;ve purchased two more for her sisters.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast, works great, never any problems.</li>
            <li> So glad, I bought the 2\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I can tell this product is a knock off for so many reasons.&lt;br /&gt;First</li>
            <li> Need I say more?</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is thicker with more wave</li>
            <li> more CHI&#x27;s will be purchased at a beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> love Amazon and will continue to purchase products from them.  </li>
            <li> this is an excellent flat iron.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is awesome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done a lot of flat ironing on my curly hair, and this is the best one that I have found!  </li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Im willing to pay more $$ if I know I am getting a good quality product.</li>
            <li> Great purchase, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It still works even after all these years just as good as when I first bought it.</li>
            <li> She has long hair and a lot of it, so the 2\\&quot; works perfect.     </li>
            <li> (because I&#x27;m worth it!!)</li>
            <li> The new iron works great</li>
            <li> It heats up nicely and straightens your hair quickly.</li>
            <li> The CHI is well worth the money if you are looking for a hair straightener that works like magic!</li>
            <li> The Farouk CHI products are wonderful as long as they don&#x27;t malfuction!!!</li>
            <li> i drop it all the time too, and have gotten it wet by leaving it around my sink, and it STILL works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I remember the good times, getting ready for prom and dances...</li>
            <li> Good investment, I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Two of my daughters practically ran to the shower Christmas morning so they could use their straighteners right away!!</li>
            <li> I received it very quickly in the mail.  </li>
            <li> could easily singe their hair off on the highest settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> the 2\\&quot; chi turbo is a great product, and worth the money if you need your hair straight.</li>
            <li> It is totally worth the price, and works so much better than those cheap irons from the discount store!</li>
            <li> That being said, I have been very lucky with my Chi.</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li> like I said, it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> Heating plate doesn&#x27;t seem to be as strong...</li>
            <li> and I was able return the item for a full credit.</li>
            <li> Worked fine for four months</li>
            <li> The product was a gift and was received in a timely manner and appears to be working fine.  </li>
            <li> The replacement is working fine now.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and it WORKS!</li>
            <li> I got lucky that I will be able to return my iron after contacting amazon customer service.</li>
            <li> don t know if i was not lucky, but some reviews were good, and others not so good, but NEVER  read it burnt the hair.</li>
            <li> However, when the red light stays on, it&#x27;s a great iron.</li>
            <li> Initially, I was happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Tried to return - no one available.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The light is on, and the heat comes off and on randomly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it is fabulous.</li>
            <li> and I was going to just use the cheap $20 one I still have.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough great things about it.  </li>
            <li> Also, the time it takes to straighten your hair with CHI is way faster than the cheap iron.</li>
            <li> I already went through 3 cheap irons, before I decided to get CHI (since it was pricey)</li>
            <li> my pocket isnt exactly filled with money, but without a doubt i would pay even $200 for this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t give 5 stars lightly ...</li>
            <li> and they weren&#x27;t 100% smooth</li>
            <li> I will continue to use my Maxi-Glide and get fabulous results.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to use and it leaves my hair lustrous and shiny.  </li>
            <li> The Farouk Chi is fabulous.</li>
            <li> Truly, it&#x27;s a fabulous product and</li>
            <li> Some work great from day 1 and last years</li>
            <li> The product appeard to be made cheap.</li>
            <li> It does leave my hair silky smooth</li>
            <li> I have used this iron many times before, and loved it, and so I decided to actually purchase one for myself.</li>
            <li> Great Flat Iron, I get a nice straight silky shine from it.  </li>
            <li> It is a great product, works better than any other I have used before.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get such a great deal, but im thinking this was not a chi product, but a knock off.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never seen her use a Christmas gift so much!!!</li>
            <li> CHI flat irons are great but buyer beware...</li>
            <li> your looking for beautiful perfectly straight hair and an iron that heats up in realy no time at all, and is completely durable, trust me youl want this Chi.</li>
            <li> You can do your hair so quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems, I love this product and it heats up very fast.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;As for how it works GREAT on long hair.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Its worth the investement!</li>
            <li> I was so excited</li>
            <li> Originally I purchased these for my daughters</li>
            <li> and i was so excited,</li>
            <li> I originally had the 1/2\\</li>
            <li> &quot; This is 100% worth the price!</li>
            <li> but WELL WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> We have used chi products for years, so we are familiar with the brand.</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair and it worked great.  </li>
            <li> Top Beauty should make that fact as clear as they do about their 30 day warranty!!!!</li>
            <li> and so far we are very happy overall.</li>
            <li> I also own a Shedu straightener and have found the 1 inch straightener gives more flexibility to try different styling like curls.</li>
            <li> I received many positive reviews about this product from my friends...</li>
            <li> I was extrememly dissapointed to find this out as my authentic CHI 2 inch flat iron was the best flat iron ever.  </li>
            <li> Basically, I straighten the top portion of my  hair and let the bottom remain curly - it actually looks pretty good.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best flat iron I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing flat iron I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I think most people could easily burn their fingers or ears by touching their actual hair just after it has moved out of the iron on heat settings 8, 9 or 10.  </li>
            <li> It does heat up super fast and is very lightweight and feels good in my hands.  </li>
            <li> because I don&#x27;t think the length of the hair really matters, I think it is thicker textured hair which does better with the two inch.  </li>
            <li> but the \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; version is cool...</li>
            <li> Aside from my girls I also work full time and go to nursing school</li>
            <li> The iron itself is like a dream come true.  </li>
            <li> They sent me a full refund once I returned both straighteners...</li>
            <li> But my point is buy this product from a more responsible company.</li>
            <li> For someone who has struggled and suffered with curly hair all my life, this is a dream come true.</li>
            <li> It literally glides through my hair, making it straight, shiny and healthy feeling.  </li>
            <li> I immediately returned it for a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife loved this gift - she has long curly hair and this iron got it smooth and silky</li>
            <li> Heats up fast, smooth, doesn&#x27;t pull or tear my hair, and so easy to use.</li>
            <li> , it heats super fast, and does a phenomenal job.</li>
            <li> This iron heats up very quickly and gets really hot.  </li>
            <li> It gets hot but doesn&#x27;t straighten my lhair easily.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more maneuverable, and doing smaller sections at a time will produce better</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to clean and heats up incredibly fast.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly and well packaged.  </li>
            <li> and I was amazed at how quickly it arrived in the mail...</li>
            <li> quick to take your money but never reply to warranty questions..............</li>
            <li> Luckily nothing happened and i stopped using it.</li>
            <li> one great thing about the whole experience is that I received a credit back to my account within 2 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Turned on once and heated up quick and then never turned on again.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend the brand but like the 1\\&quot; better.</li>
            <li> This iron heats up quickly and gets very hot.  </li>
            <li> The Chi turbo gets very hot, makes my hair look silky, and doesn&#x27;t burn my hand.  </li>
            <li> It did not get very hot at all.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product because it works properly and met my expectations as a straightening product.  </li>
            <li> It also had a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li> I e-mailed my concern to Top Beauty who quickly responded that they are very clear about their 30 day warranty to which I agree.</li>
            <li> It was recommended highly by my cousin and when she purchased hers a few months before me, I used it and was quite impressed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had soooooo many compliments on my new hairstyle.  </li>
            <li> Overall pretty good product.</li>
            <li> This one is very sturdy and love how HOT it gets.  </li>
            <li> I found this one on Amazon for under $100 and at first worried it wouldn&#x27;t be good enough, but after reading reviews, I gave it a try.   </li>
            <li> And THANKS to Amazon.com, the return process was so easy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the flat iron I received.  </li>
            <li> I found the same product in stores for $120 more than I paid here!</li>
            <li> she has enough time to straighten her hair, and it looks BETTER than when she would spend 30 min - hour trying to straighten it before!     </li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and this straightener works SO well!!</li>
            <li> After just one press your hair is STRAIGHT!!  </li>
            <li> I paid what a REAL CHI would cost!!</li>
            <li> I think that Amazon has the best prices (i&#x27;m looking to get a new one for my little sister for Christmas) and is worth the risk ...</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this flat iron!  </li>
            <li> (I have baby fine hair very prone to breakage).  </li>
            <li> The results were great, my hair was smooth and it took no time at all to straighten my thick wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money-</li>
            <li> it really is a great straightener, but i still think it damages my hear/ creates \\&quot;fly-away,\\&quot; broken pieces of hair on the top of my head.  </li>
            <li> It is worth the money....</li>
            <li> It was well worth the money,</li>
            <li> There were misspelled words in the directions, the felt on the outside was peeling and kept catching my hair and it would not stay warm for longer than three seconds before it would need to heat itself back up.  </li>
            <li> every women wants straight sexy hair and this is the solution.</li>
            <li> I think the price is well worth it.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s worth making the investment.</li>
            <li> It works and it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> so I wanted something that would work fast AND be good enough to hold.     </li>
            <li> cause it s rare this happened.</li>
            <li> It is worth the money we spend.</li>
            <li> worth everypenny</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> said that it left her hair \\&quot;greasy\\&quot;, but she&#x27;s picky about that kind of thing.     </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every dollar of the investment.  </li>
            <li> well worth the money</li>
            <li> I was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I spent a good chunk of money on.</li>
            <li> Not quite worth the money.</li>
            <li> and it works right away and leaves your hair looking and feeling silky smooth and pin straight.  </li>
            <li> I think the seller didn&#x27;t send me a good one and also the packaging was not like my other Amazon orders.</li>
            <li> I had the original real version of this item that I had ordered from amazon 4 years ago.</li>
            <li> Right now I am in the process of trying to find out whether or not Amazon can or will do anything.</li>
            <li> and she was right.  </li>
            <li> there is simply no other better hair iron around.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product and I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this seller as service was prompt, reliable &amp; accurate.  </li>
            <li> This means that she is happy with her hair and it takes her A LOT less time to get ready.    </li>
            <li> I have been using the 2 inch straightener for less than a month and for the most part am satisfied with the performance.  </li>
            <li> It was nice not having to wait a long time for it.  </li>
            <li> I bought the chi turbo after much research and was very excited to finally be getting a good quality flat iron.  </li>
            <li> My first inclination was to buy the 2\\&quot; size - that would make the process faster, right?  </li>
            <li> It is really quick and fast.  </li>
            <li> It is not that heavy or big and it is actually beautiful!</li>
            <li> The only upside was the great customer service by Amazon (even though I had to pay to ship both irons back).  </li>
            <li> you want straight hair quickly, with salon quality, bite the bullet</li>
            <li> The iron did not get very hot and it didn&#x27;t get my hair straight at all.</li>
            <li> , only thing i don&#x27;t like is that i need a high heat to straighten fast which makes my hair feel hot for a good 10 secs</li>
            <li> It heats up super fast, gives you stick straight shiny hair, no smell of the appliance to make your hair smell funky!</li>
            <li> The cost was very reasonable as well.</li>
            <li> Of course this makes it very straight</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought the two inch and will probably never go back to the one inch.  </li>
            <li> my first day at my first job...now I&#x27;m in business school, and yesterday it just stopped working.   </li>
            <li> size matters - smaller size is better -</li>
            <li> yes, this iron is more expensive, but hopefully it will last for years of top-notch straightening.</li>
            <li> Well, funny thing.</li>
            <li> I was in shock the first time I used it</li>
            <li> It saves so much TIME!</li>
            <li> Should have bought this one first.</li>
            <li> but overall I had more control with the 1\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The reason I finally up-graded was because I&#x27;m going on a trip with some girlfriends and wanted something better to take with me.  </li>
            <li> (reason why I was loyal to buying this particular straigtner).</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed!</li>
            <li> Overall I was extremely satisfied with the product and the supplier.</li>
            <li> If it had not failed within 30 days would not have received a replacement more than likely.</li>
            <li> This hair straightener was a last resort for me, I&#x27;ve gone through many of them.</li>
            <li> I returned it and got a full refund and the people from the company are really nice, but don&#x27;t waste your time ordering this product b/c</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bigger which allows it to cover more ground.  </li>
            <li> It turns out that after the first time I did my hair, the iron broke and would not turn on.</li>
            <li> I boughtmy first Turbo Chi 2\\&quot; at a salon 2 years ago.</li>
            <li> First off, let me tell you all that my hair is maddening.</li>
            <li> My hair was straight!</li>
            <li> The first iron I had melted my hair and burnt out on the first use...</li>
            <li> the replacement also burnt out the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Turbo\\&quot; CHI allows you to adjust the heat temperature, while the original CHI does not---the original has a standard heat setting.  </li>
            <li> For some reason hers does not got hot even on the highest setting.  </li>
            <li> Also I found that the larger one is really much more clunkier</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s so much more easier using the smaller iron since it is lighter</li>
            <li> Sorry I rambled but I am uber happy!</li>
            <li> would not stay hot like its supposed to.</li>
            <li> The cost might make it worth buying from here rather than in-store where they fulfill the year warranty but charge twice as much.</li>
            <li> CHI products are typically pretty reliable</li>
            <li> I suspect that the plug is shorted inside the straightener as it stopped turning on, but I also wrap the cord around to store it so most likely my fault.</li>
            <li> They assured me this product is not a fake.</li>
            <li> It worked alright first time.</li>
            <li> the 2\\&quot; is so big that you won&#x27;t be able to grab pieces of hair.  </li>
            <li> It warms up fast too!</li>
            <li> This is worth every penny, and it will save me so much money.</li>
            <li> She used it the first time and it quit working halfway through.</li>
            <li> And it still works pretty well.</li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> I tried it when I first got it.  </li>
            <li> Stays hot and irons out my curly hair</li>
            <li> advice is, if you know exactly what you&#x27;re getting, order it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, if you have no idea how it feels or looks, I would check it out in the stores first.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the heat my first one had.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my hair straight until I was it again. !</li>
            <li> I love the Flat Iron and it really was worth the price.</li>
            <li> I showed it to my sister, who had introduced me to this flat iron after herself using it for so many years, and she too noticed that it&#x27;s like a knock-off version.</li>
            <li> If you flat iron your hair more than 2x a month</li>
            <li> and then I put off returning it thinking that I had the full term of the warranty, but Farouk doesn&#x27;t honor the waranty since I bought it online and not in a professional salon!</li>
            <li> &quot; Flat Iron is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I enjoyed using the CHI Turbo 2 inch flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t want to spend so much money for a flat iron, but since all the others I was using didn&#x27;t do such a great job, I decided to go for it.  </li>
            <li> Heats up fast and turns my unmanageable curly hair to smooth and silky soft in minutes...</li>
            <li> Love is such a strong word to use so we are in DEEP LIKE!  </li>
            <li> I have owned several in the past, both inexpensive and high end appliances, and this one is the best.  </li>
            <li> so I was positive it would work.  </li>
            <li> The iron works pretty well with the heating up fast part.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it very much, but the few times I did, it was amazing.</li>
            <li> This ia a fabulous flat iron, better than any you can buy at your local store.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ans I do agree, the smaller the hair straightener, the better (I originally had a smaller one, that my salon uses, but it also stopped working).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I live in Houston Texas and if you have been there you know our humidity is fun for hair.</li>
            <li> It eliminates the frizz as it straightens and leaves your hair shiny and super soft.</li>
            <li> The 2\\&quot; CHI is easy to maneuver and straightens my hair in bigger batches.  </li>
            <li> The first one came from a local hair salon and was fantastic for about 6 years.  </li>
            <li> I have long and thick hair and the 2 inch straightened my hair perfectly</li>
            <li> and it was nothing like the original one, it barely lasted 5 months.</li>
            <li> I thought I was happy to find another 2 inch Chi Turbo flat iron to replace the original one I have owned for at least seven years.  </li>
            <li> I love this flat iron and I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I returned it right away to amazon and received a new one in the mail within 5 days.</li>
            <li> Keep your setting low and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> it works great, heats up really quickly, and i can completely straighten my long hair in much less than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> It really makes that much of a difference in the damage and amount of time I have in the morning to get ready.</li>
            <li> It works so much better on my thick, coarse hair, flattening it quicker, and letting me take bigger chunks at a time while still doing a great job.  </li>
            <li> have curly hair and it took me 40 minutes to get it pin straight</li>
            <li> This is a knock off - not the real thing.</li>
            <li> This straightens hair but doesn&#x27;t smooth as well as hoped, especially considering the cost.</li>
            <li> Straightens hair smooth and shiny in a very short time.</li>
            <li> It is a time saver and so gentle on the hair.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair</li>
            <li> and it can get my hair extremely straight with no kinks.</li>
            <li> I have very thick,coarse hair</li>
            <li> even though it much more than I&#x27;ve ever spent on a straightner before.</li>
            <li> I was very dissapointed</li>
            <li> But I also treat my iron very well and protect it like the $100 dollar investment it is.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier to manipulate.  </li>
            <li> If all you care about is straight hair...</li>
            <li> I would tell my friends that I have curly hair and there is no way even a Chi would get it straight like the model pics.</li>
            <li> I like having the option of having straight hair</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair</li>
            <li> It gets my frizzy, curly hair soooo straight and controlled.  </li>
            <li> When I straighten my hair with the Chi, my hair STAYS straight all day and doesn&#x27;t frizz out.  </li>
            <li> AND it has cut atleast 10 minutes out of my time getting ready.</li>
            <li> With the Chi, however, handling is much smoother, and the controls are well-built</li>
            <li> High Five!</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it to everyone who would want a silky straight hair...</li>
            <li> I would not recommend it to anyone who wants a real chi.</li>
            <li> Seemed to not be the real thing.</li>
            <li> theres tends to be alot of moist in my area, but my hair would still stay straight without having to straighten over and over...</li>
            <li> It took a while, of course, because I have so much hair, but after an hour of straightening the finished product was miraculous.</li>
            <li> The 1\\&quot; CHI would have taken much longer to pass through all of my hair.    </li>
            <li> but if I could do it again, I&#x27;d get the 1 - 1 1/2 width one and be much happier.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to do as much damage to the hair as others I have used.  </li>
            <li> my hair STAYED straight.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> the supplier was also very prompt</li>
            <li> My only concern is sometimes I have to restart my wall-jack because it won&#x27;t light up/turn on.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the 2-inch size.</li>
            <li> However, as I said it worked very well when it worked.</li>
            <li> Probably not even the real chi brand.</li>
            <li> I was very upset with this product and seller.</li>
            <li> It straightens so fast and humidity doesn&#x27;t even make it frizzy or</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a straight iron because they could never handle my hair.  </li>
            <li> The straightener works really well</li>
            <li> , my hair was pin straight.  </li>
            <li> It feels like it was cheaply made and not as solid.</li>
            <li> BECAUSE THEY ARE  NOT AUTHORIZED TO SELL THE REAL THING</li>
            <li> My hair to be straight.</li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t even get straight....</li>
            <li> As soon as I tried it for real</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t plan on using it a lot I wouldn&#x27;t invest that much</li>
            <li> Thanks for letting us know</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s real or not</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 12 year old daughter after researching many different models and brands.  </li>
            <li> It heats up fast, and your hair stay straight a day long (unlike the cheap ones, my hair won&#x27;t stay straight for a whole day)</li>
            <li> This is much better than the other brands.</li>
            <li> dont buy a cheap flat iron!</li>
            <li> I have long, wavy/curly hair, and have tried cheap straighteners and blow drying my hair straight before, but never with satisfactory results.</li>
            <li> And of course, there&#x27;s good amount of hair loss just like any other flat iron.</li>
            <li> Now after only a couple of months, I regret not returning it right away!</li>
            <li> the power light does not flash in the same way that the Chi does when the product is warmed up.&lt;br /&gt;Besides all of those obvious signs this is a crappy piece of junk, the straightener doesn&#x27;t get hot at all, does nothing to my hair and does not work!</li>
            <li> Maybe this product is good (i have done enough research on this product and it has good reviews), but i was unlucky and got a bad one.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist always used it when styling my hair, so after my first flat iron finally died, I decided to get the exact one that always made my hair look so fabulous when leaving the salon.  </li>
            <li> i ordered a chi gf1539 full price then 4 months later the item for some reason stops working</li>
            <li> It also did not get as hot as my old one did.  </li>
            <li> As professional women we don&#x27;t have much time in the morning so having a good straightner that can to the trick in the least amount of time</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair soft and heats up really fast!</li>
            <li> hair straigtener is not worth $100, it looks more like a $20-$30 product.</li>
            <li> I live in the south and deal with humidity!  </li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this straightener, like I said I had the last one for a long time and used it very often, almost every day.</li>
            <li> I was not sure if a flat iron was worth this much money, but am completely satisfied with this one!</li>
            <li> The latter feature is worth the money to me alone, and the the ceramic feels much gentler to my hair</li>
            <li> Great product and is the only thing that works on my thick Hispanic hair.</li>
            <li> and they said they cannot warranty the item because its an older unit not under warranty.</li>
            <li> With the amount of money that is spent for this flat iron, it should work more than 4 months!  </li>
            <li> However, 2 days ago, after using my own the day before that, I plugged in my Chi Flat Iron only to realsie the exact same thing happened to me.</li>
            <li> I have long hair (about three inches below my shoulders) and I debated as to whether I should get the 1\\&quot; or 2\\&quot; CHI and whether I should purchase the original or turbo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I chose this flat iron, It heats up really fast and the very long swivel cord is very convenient.</li>
            <li> Meaning if your hair is kind of wavy or curly, you&#x27;ll get a larger chunk of hair that is ironed down between the plates before being pulled straight.  </li>
            <li> I had exactly this model and was crushed when it died after 8 years of loyal service.</li>
            <li> , but this iron was highly recommended by salon personnel, so I decided to dish out the money and try it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly highly recommended.</li>
            <li> you prolly wont&#x27; need the high setting     &#x3D;</li>
            <li> The product was priced high for the lack of quality.</li>
            <li> and i would highly recommend it which is just 50$.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I finally got the chi flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I have been straightening my hair for about 15 years and have tried many different flat irons.</li>
            <li> But since my hubby fixed the electrical cord on my original 2 inch Chi Turbo, I will keep this one as a back up.  </li>
            <li> My natural hair is very curly and normal texture.</li>
            <li> After using our hair is soft and straight.  </li>
            <li> This product is worth buying, especially if you have hard-to-manage hair like mine.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair with a little bit of a wave to it, as well as it gets frizzy easily.</li>
            <li> I did reread the enclosed packaging and it says in fine print that it will not honor their waranty if purchased on the internet or anywhere other than a porfessional salon.</li>
            <li> If you have hair shorter than right below your shoulders, you should probably get the smaller iron-</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s amazing results only last for as long as the product does and for me this was about 2.5 weeks.  </li>
            <li> My question is whether my iron is new or refurbished????</li>
            <li> so I wanted to order a new one.  </li>
            <li> I live in Florida and there&#x27;s a lot of humidity</li>
            <li> -- I live in San Francisco,</li>
            <li> I have been using my new Turbo Chi every day</li>
            <li> I think its a new design in chi.</li>
            <li> I live in Trinidad, West Indies.</li>
            <li> My friend loves this new version I got for her, and if I ever had to replace mine, that has been with me since 2008 and still works like a charm I will go with this one, no need to think about it twice.</li>
            <li> Bought it new.</li>
            <li> My hair was completely straight and silky smooth and it brought my flatiron time down from an hour to 15 minutes!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the cheaper versions from the drug stores---believe me the price is worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> I took a chance on the CHI straightner and it easily cuts my straighting time in half.</li>
            <li> i find that my hair is less damaged and the chi is so easy to use..</li>
            <li> It is larger than normal flattening irons and it gets really hot.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t over dry my hair and is really quick.</li>
            <li> I am very surprised Amazon allows these companys to sell to their clients.</li>
            <li> I did some pretty extensive research before deciding on a Chi Hair Straightener.</li>
            <li> Replaced first order because it was defective and the replacement arrived and now has the same problem.</li>
            <li> She has purchased a CHI in the past and it worked 100 times better.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Other than that, totally worth the money!</li>
            <li> The last ceramic flat iron I bought pulled and snagged my hair, this was so smooth.</li>
            <li> I owned a 2 inch Chi (the exact same one) for 6 years.</li>
            <li> It heats up better than the small one.</li>
            <li> I took it to a reputable salon who informed me that this iron was not authentic, but was a \\&quot;knock-off\\&quot; version.</li>
            <li> However, it definitely doesn&#x27;t get that hot</li>
            <li> I highly recommend if looking for a high quality flat iron that really works well.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this flat iron to anyone but especially African American women who are interested in quickly straightening their hair.</li>
            <li> When i visited my cousin in New Jersey in May this year, her Flat Iron just wasnt coming on after plugging it in which was strange because it worked perfectly fine the day before and days before that.</li>
            <li> I tried using the new one yesterday, and it did not work as well as my old one.</li>
            <li> with my old straighteners it would take me a long time, but with the 2\\&quot; turbo chi, my hair is straight in half the time and looks better than before.</li>
            <li> This was my first Chi product and was surprised by the low quality of it.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s a big 2 incher, she has more minutes in her day to do other things!  </li>
            <li> The first few times using this iron, it wasn&#x27;t really making my hair straight...</li>
            <li> It does not get as hot as my cheaper flat iron.  </li>
            <li> the first time i used it i could see the difference compared to store bought flat irons.</li>
            <li> So I cut my hair, which was really hurtful, and finally ended up buying this chi straightener, and I am totally amazed, how pretty my hair can look.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, extremely curly hair and therefore cannot use just any flat iron on my hair (many just flatten it, they do not straighten the curls, and many leave my hair poofy).</li>
            <li> I bought my most recent one on Amazon as it was a little cheaper with the shipping.</li>
            <li> I just dried my hair quickly to get it dry without bothering to really straighten it first.  </li>
            <li> CHI has never been disappointing and as expected, it is  a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> ions\\&quot; and \\&quot;far infrared technology\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The CHI got my hair about as straight as blow-drying would have and my hair frizzed as soon as I stepped outside.  </li>
            <li> Completely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently growing out some of the shorter sections and have found this tool very helpful in keeping my hair from looking like a helmet.</li>
            <li> So far no problems, though.</li>
            <li> I really thought I had totally scored!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 months now and no problems so far.</li>
            <li> It WAS NOT like the old one.  </li>
            <li> and it straightens with one pass and leaves my hair soft as silk.</li>
            <li> This was the only place that had any or was receiving any in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> It takes me about 45 minutes to get it straight which is actually not a lot of time at all</li>
            <li> actually will make my hair much softer.</li>
            <li> She wants to send it back.  </li>
            <li> It runs through my hair with ease, and leaves it looking soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> When my old straightener died, I knew I was going to get this iron.</li>
            <li> I have really naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> I bought the 2\\&quot; Turbo and it gets the job done on my course, naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> It completely straightens my curls and leaves my hair soft, silky, and shiny.</li>
            <li> After about 3 months my straightener completely quit working.</li>
            <li> The unit didn&#x27;t close on hair completely causing alot of hair pulling.</li>
            <li> It works well on my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I now have moved onto a GHD 2inch and seem to like it so far.  </li>
            <li> I have contacted AMAZON to get help and so far there has been no resolution.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to try to get resolution from this seller but SINCE THEY ARE A COMPLETE FRAUD</li>
            <li> And I would recommend one that qualifies for Amazon Prime, just because you want to have the support from Amazon directly.</li>
            <li> I went over the hair twice and it completely straightened it.  </li>
            <li> old granddaughter</li>
            <li> It makes my hair look so soft and shiney.</li>
            <li> As far as how it function, my wife decided not to try it</li>
            <li> so I contacted the Chi company directly.</li>
            <li> I love that I got the 2\\&quot; because I have a lot of hair and also really thick hair</li>
            <li> I have very curly thick hair and have never been able to get it as flat as the shop does.</li>
            <li> Most flat irons I&#x27;ve tried have worked for only a few minutes, then went right back to wavy.</li>
            <li> I wish I had invested in the CHI flat iron much sooner than I did.</li>
            <li> I have not had any problem with this flat iron and it works very well on my hair.  </li>
            <li> &quot; original but after 2 1/2 years of heavy use, it quit working, so</li>
            <li> BUT this one is not as heavy as the original</li>
            <li> I am continually frustrated with making sure I hold the iron in a certain spot so that it heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li> WAY too much money to drop on a flat iron that doesn&#x27;t even have a valid warranty!</li>
            <li> When I say hot, I mean this puppy gets HOT!  </li>
            <li> Does not get hot enough and when using the different outlets the temperature ranges.  </li>
            <li> this is my 3rd chi straightener and my 2nd turbo (my first one was a 1 inch).</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly, and cannot be blown dry straight and was barely straight after 30-45 minutes with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> but I decided that a hair ironer that costs that much and had such a great reputation should not have such an inconvenient complication</li>
            <li> It seems that the joint where the top and both handles connect is a little loose.</li>
            <li> I have long, very course hair with medium curls and poofy issues.</li>
            <li> I have very curly long hair</li>
            <li> I have real frizzy and wavy hair, and I gave up my long hair</li>
            <li> We both have long relatively straight hair.  </li>
            <li> This is my second ceramic flat iron and my first chi.</li>
            <li> We love our Chi Turbo, we have long, thick hair that only seems to get straight and silky with a Chi</li>
            <li> It still works as if it was brand new with equal heat distribution.</li>
            <li> Amazon replaced it with a new one shipped over night; I had it the next day before lunch.</li>
            <li> Now 6 years later when mine stopped working I had to order a new one.  </li>
            <li> Had I known that it was trying to pass as new but was actually refurbished</li>
            <li> This Chi does not compare to my previous 3 which were definitely worth the money</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s old Chi straighter developed a short and wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely thick, frizzes easily, and takes two hours to wash and get all of the knots out of.</li>
            <li> my first chi turbo, which i have had since 2007, still works but it takes a little bit longer since the plates don&#x27;t get as hot -- this long life expectancy is why i chose to get a 2 inch turbo.</li>
            <li> I decided I needed more coverage, other reviews say that a 2 inch flat iron is harder to manipulate.  </li>
            <li> With three teenagers getting ready at the same time, and fighting over this particular one, the other two are getting one for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> maybe  a little expensive, but I had the cheap ones and they dry your hair, and the time you save,,, It is really worthy, BUY IT!!!</li>
            <li> My last flat iron was an infrashine and that was much hotter.</li>
            <li> Price was almost half what I could&#x27;ve spent, so I also had money left to  buy her a couple more birthday presents.  </li>
            <li> After trying various other less expensive brands for years, and them not working so great or taking forever to do the job,I decided to buy the chi after my sister in law, who has super curly hair recommended it.  </li>
            <li> Bought this when I had a new style that needed a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> So while I highly recommend the CHI Turbo straightener, I would recommend the smaller widths unless you know for a fact that you prefer the larger plates.  </li>
            <li> I have spent so much time, money and effort searching for a straightener that delivers results.</li>
            <li> It is not a short in the wire, as Chi irons are sensitive to.  </li>
            <li> my grandma spent too much on me &gt;&amp;lt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this straightner last dec for my 21 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend was tired of hearing me complain about never being able to get my hair</li>
            <li> She tried some of her friends expensive one too and says she really liked this one.</li>
            <li> My thick wavy hair becomes pin straight!!!   </li>
            <li> With a more narrow plate, you have less of that happening before you start your straightening.   </li>
            <li> I debated for awhile and read all the reviews I could on the pros and cons on spending so much on this flat iron as well as between the smaller size or the larger 2inch one.  </li>
            <li> The only thing i didn&#x27;t like was to see that the price went down on it right after I ordered it.</li>
            <li> It also does not leave hair stiff (it is common to see some flat irons that leave the hair with no movement, which doesn&#x27;t look very healthy or natural).</li>
            <li> I have been using cheap flat irons for the past couple years.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very curly and can get extremely frizzy.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron for my 15 yeard old daughter on a recommendation of a friend.  </li>
            <li> My daughter claims it works much faster than other irons and leaves her hair silky smoothe.</li>
            <li> and if you can have hair like that everyday without even spending more than 30 miniuts occasionaly, who wouldnt pay a little over $100?  &lt;</li>
            <li> It came in today and my hair which is past my shoulders was completely straight and shiny in 10 minutes, and I did not have to blow dry it straight-ish first.</li>
            <li> Well, I was advised and found out to be true that bigger is not better in this situation, for reasons stated below.  </li>
            <li> My hair was still curly since I did not dry it that day.  </li>
            <li> but then disappointed greatly at the results.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I have to replace those is because they are hard to clean.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;l probably use it over the old flat iron I have that has just metal plates</li>
            <li> I ordered this on Feb 2.......unless it&#x27;s being ship from JAPAN there is no excuse.</li>
            <li> Product is already broken after only 3 weeks, and I no longer have the box for returns- will never purchase from amazon again and will go back to store purchases so the product quality is better and returns are easier</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and has a bit of a natural wave to it or more like it become poofy when dried.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if that happens to other people or if maybe it is just a glitch with mine, but is still works fine regardless.</li>
            <li> Apparently the CHI flat irons sold on Amazon are not up to standards.  </li>
            <li> I am white and have shoulder length hair that is super thick, wavy &amp; frizzy...</li>
            <li> The first day I used it the velvet pannels started to slide off making it a big gooy mess!</li>
            <li> I feel like with today&#x27;s technology and spending so much money on it, it should get a little hotter.</li>
            <li> I live in Louisiana where it is extremely humid.  </li>
            <li> read the other reviews on here after and found Chi makes a new version if this that is only availble from approved retailers.</li>
            <li> The initial shock of the cost of the Chi flat iron made me put off buying it for a year, but I realized that I was just wasting money buying these cheaper products and that I should invest in something that would actually work (believe me that was a big deal because I am literally the cheapest person I know).</li>
            <li> I did request for a refund and sent the flat iron back but have yet to receive a credit back.</li>
            <li> I am very upset because this is not a cheap flat iron.</li>
            <li> I read multiple reviews regarding the 1 inch and 2 inch CHI flat irons and was so nervous to invest in the two inch bc</li>
            <li> Before buying this item, everyone should realize that Farouk&#x27;s return policy states that returns and/or refunds will only be made if the flat iron was bought at a salon.</li>
            <li> This is the second Chi flat iron I have bought.</li>
            <li> I recieved the flat iron back from Chi with letter saying it did not honor any Warantys if the product was purchased online.</li>
            <li> B0009V1YS2 Farouk CHI GF1539 Turbo Big 2 Inch Ceramic Flat Iron Hair Straightener]]</li>
            <li> BUT, that said, my last flat iron, I had for 5 years,</li>
            <li> this is obviously a fake/knock-off CHI and has the straightening power of a the cheapest flat iron you could pick up at wal-mart.</li>
            <li> My daughter simply loves this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> B0009V1YS2 Farouk CHI GF1539 Turbo Big 2 Inch Ceramic Flat Iron Hair Straightener]]    </li>
            <li> The flat iron did not work at all and one of the ceramic tiles was set crooked.</li>
            <li> I had my CERAMIC 1 INCH FLAT IRON as a back up</li>
            <li> B0009V1YS2 Farouk CHI GF1539 Turbo Big 2 Inch Ceramic Flat Iron Hair Straightener]]</li>
            <li> Unforunately I recently bought this Flat iron.</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron only after it was sold out of stock by the company itself.  </li>
            <li> I only used it one time and all of the lettering vanished off of the flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this one, only because I felt that my flat iron would probably need to be replaced soon.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is it doesn&#x27;t last for long.</li>
            <li> However, the Sedu tends to burn my hand without getting quite hot enough to straigten my thick (and course) curly hair in a couple of strokes.  </li>
            <li> From my experience I would recommend spending the extra bucks on a good product instead of getting disappointed by the cheapies.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s perfectly flat (and I have very long hair and live in an extremely humid area).</li>
            <li> I will mention that it is difficult getting that top half-inch of your roots, but it&#x27;s a very minor problem.  </li>
            <li> I also regretted not getting the smaller 1-1 1/2 inch one instead because I realize now that the wider plates don&#x27;t straight your hair any faster since it will run down your hair shaft in the same distance, it just clamps down a wider area of your hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black with natural, kinky hair and this flat iron definitely does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone in need of a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have since purchased a sedu flat iron</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any damage, but I also use a heat guard spray by CHI on my hair before I flat iron it.  </li>
            <li> But I think it would be so helpful to people that want the 2 inch CHI flat iron.    </li>
            <li> I called CHI and they told me that they no longer make the 2 inch version of this flat iron.    </li>
            <li> When I got the flat iron</li>
            <li> no longer manufactures the 2 inch flat iron.</li>
            <li> I purchased this CHI flat iron in June and it has already quit working.</li>
            <li> This flat iron did not do well with my medium length hair.  </li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000E31Q92 CHI Turbo Ionic Ceramic Flat Iron 2\\&quot;]]    </li>
            <li> and I use this Flat Iron 3 times a week</li>
            <li> I tried someone else&#x27;s Flat Iron and again I felt like it was burning my hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron for my daughter for Christmas</li>
            <li> I purchased the Chi Farouk 2\\&quot; flat iron for my daughter for Christmas.</li>
            <li> and i could hear it when i shook the flat iron.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot of money for a flat iron</li>
            <li> I got this iten yesterday, flat ironed my hair today and it looks just like it looks when I leave the shop.</li>
            <li> The problem with the shop is, they charge me extra becuase my hair is so long.</li>
            <li> my wife loves her chi flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair, so I never thought twice about getting the bigger size.  </li>
            <li> I have owned this flat iron for over 7 years.  </li>
            <li> Nothing else compares to this Flat Iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just Farouk Chi&#x27;s flat iron!  </li>
            <li> Bought this product for my teenage daughter that has a lot of very long hair.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and difficult to burn yourself.  </li>
            <li> It is my third iron, and it&#x27;s still holding up well, with only minimal wear.</li>
            <li> And not just the gross, frizzy-straight, i mean REALLY STRAIGHT.</li>
            <li> Either they die out, or yank your hair, don&#x27;t get hot enough, so your hair is just kind of half-straight, or make awful smells.</li>
            <li> The paddles also move back and forth like they are loose.</li>
            <li> cord.&lt;br /&gt;Second, the font on the side that says CHI turbo is not even the same as Chi&#x27;s actual font.&lt;br /&gt;The red velvet on the outside is completely different, scratchy and not nice like the actual Chi’s</li>
            <li> I have long curly, thick hair and this flat iron really works.  </li>
            <li> I feel this flat iron was not new,</li>
            <li> it left my hair straight and soft, no fly aways or dryness !!!!</li>
            <li> I have never been too crazy about the idea of buying a hair item that cost more than 50 dollars.</li>
            <li> My wife was asking for an expensive hair straigtener because the cheap one she purchased seems to stop working, or doesn&#x27;t work as well after a year.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That has been an advantage this flat iron has had over my last one and other chi&#x27;s  2.</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair and it works wonders on my hair.  </li>
            <li> It was not working nearly as well as my 1st one after a few times</li>
            <li> The cord swivels, so it&#x27;s harder to get it stuck between the ceramic plates (which was a BIG problem I&#x27;ve had w/ cheaper irons).</li>
            <li> I spent $140 on this thing and now I can&#x27;t even figure out how to return it or get my money back!</li>
            <li> , it just took me twice as long to hold onto it.</li>
            <li> It lasted me so long</li>
            <li> I use it at least 4 days a week and it straightens my thick, wavy hair incredibly fast and leaves it straight and shiny.</li>
            <li> Finally something actually breaks down two weeks BEFORE the warranty runs out instead of two weeks after!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> She has hair down to the middle of her back</li>
            <li> straight enough w/ my cheap, cruddy flat iron, so last Christmas he bought me this Chi.</li>
            <li> I, like all these other people, have been using the $25 flat irons and felt like my hair was starting to get dry and burned.  </li>
            <li> I had a different 2 Inch Flat Iron prior to purchasing the Farouk CHI and it usually takes me over an hour to do my entire head because my hair is so long.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if the product was refurbished or new.</li>
            <li> When I received the iron I will admit that I was slightly dissapointed when first opening the box, the iron looked chunky and was very heavy.  </li>
            <li> (Also I am impatient so tend to tend to take large chunks of hair rather than doing multiple small areas.)</li>
            <li> It works really well for her and is extremely well made and very heavy duty.</li>
            <li> I chose this size after my sister with medium length hair said you can do wider sections (not bigger chunks, but wider strips) than with the 1 inch that my other sister has.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even take that long to do!  </li>
            <li> It used to take a long time to straighten my hair, but not with this iron!</li>
            <li> Holding the two next to each other and playing with then you can tell the difference immediately.  </li>
            <li> Half her head was straight as a board, the other half curly as hell, which resulted in me having to go to walmart at midnight to buy one for her to finish with.</li>
            <li> considering my hair is very long.</li>
            <li> I recommend the 2\\&quot; for very long hair.</li>
            <li> Well, honestly, it&#x27;s not that much different than my old one....</li>
            <li> My straightener stopped working all of a sudden (only after a few months), so I called Farouk Systems to see what could be done in regards to their warranty policy.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair and used to take four or five tries to get my hair straight</li>
            <li> I use mid range heat setting and it flattens my frizzy, thick, wild hair in no time.  </li>
            <li> this on is definately not new.</li>
            <li> I was worried this chi would not live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> (If you have thick hair also I would highly recommend the CHI blow dryer-</li>
            <li> The Chi, overall, is not a cheap product, but for my tough to do hair it is well worth the investment.  </li>
            <li> It does not damage your hair as other flat irons do.</li>
            <li> but it was ALSO broken like the first.</li>
            <li> Cut my drying time by almost 2 hours (as long as I apply some protective serum on when still wet).  </li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my wife who used it for several years before passing it down to our daughter.  </li>
            <li> My hair is 3/4 down my back.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t do much for my hair, which is natural, very curly and very very thick.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for about three and a half months</li>
            <li> so it takes me less time to do than with a smaller one.</li>
            <li> The box it came in was the same box my previous 3 came in.</li>
            <li> Bought this with the idea it would last for years as chi typically does.</li>
            <li> the cord that plugs into the wall is about half the length of the standard Chi</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t understand why the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t warrant the flat iron unless it is not authentic or is a second.  </li>
            <li> Almost being that things appeared cheaper and the logo a little different.  </li>
            <li> In previous years I had bought a Conair and a Revlon flat iron, which basically did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> so must use a 2 inch flat iron to cut the straightening time in half.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, frizzy, hair and have spent my life getting it relaxed every six months, and blowing drying it straight.  </li>
            <li> and I read a lot of complaints that it is harder to use.  </li>
            <li> Its everything I expected.  </li>
            <li> I worry about the burnout factor of these, so hopefully it will last a few years to justify the price.</li>
            <li> I tried in different outlets, tested the button on the plug and it is dead.  </li>
            <li> My wife has been using this for 7 plus years EVERYDAY solid!!</li>
            <li> Not really.  </li>
            <li> I feel like my money was well spent.</li>
            <li> I have wasted money on numerous cheaper proucts like Revlon and Vidal Sasson straighteners, but I agree with ppl who said nothing works like a Chi.</li>
            <li> I got curious and checked the Internet and made some calls.  </li>
            <li> it would turn on for a few minutes and then turn back off.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not real.</li>
            <li> I also have bangs which this size does not work well with, but that should be expected.</li>
            <li> I probably spent over $300 on a variety on straighteners priced between $29.99 - $49.99, found at places like Target, Rite-Aid, CVS, etc....</li>
            <li> not much faster, etc...</li>
            <li> That will be the last CHI I waste money on.</li>
            <li> The company mailed it back to me saying it was a replica and not a genuine Chi.</li>
            <li> It does not work as well as I had expected, especialy for the price you&#x27;re paying for this product.  </li>
            <li> If you have long hair, it will cut the styling time in half.</li>
            <li> wasnt a Chi, but some other expensive brand).After looking at the results, I went ahead and got me a Chi right away.</li>
            <li> The straigtener gives me straighter hair in half the time (1 hour for very long hair) and my hair looks and feels healthier.</li>
            <li> I get out of the shower, blow dry my hair and straighten it in less than 15 min.  </li>
            <li> Two other things to keep in mind when choosing a straightener:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This makes Amazon just as LIABLE!</li>
            <li> It also worked a lot faster than my other irons.</li>
            <li> When I used other curling irons, my hair use to get caught and get pulled.  </li>
            <li> At times it wouldn&#x27;t turn on at all and other times</li>
            <li> Not worth the money I spent.</li>
            <li> But, I had tried other brands and CHI</li>
            <li> Small price to pay when it makes such a difference.   </li>
            <li> So in other words I have thrown 100.00 out the window.</li>
            <li> the one thing i would note, the other CHI hair products (shampoo conditioner, spray)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will ever purchase anything other than a Chi again.</li>
            <li> Since she started straightening her hair, we&#x27;ve gone thru maybe 5 other straighteners.  </li>
            <li> I recieved my order on the day that was expected and with no problems!</li>
            <li> but i am not sure what they are doing with their production now 6 years later.  </li>
            <li> Seller cleary did not do due diligence.  </li>
            <li> When I received it I realized how big it is, a bit hard to hold for a long time and hard to maneuver too because of its size, so I returned it same day.</li>
            <li> I thought I would save a few dollars buy buying this cheaper version of the CHI; however i ended up throwing money down the toilet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the tempature settings is helpful at this point since I have alot of thick hair and need to keep it on a high temp at all times.</li>
            <li> I had this Flat Iron in the past, until my daughter borrowed it, permanently.  </li>
            <li> I have been using a .Chi flat iron for the past 10 yrs.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anybody, and especially suggest it to those who have had bad luck with flat irons or have found that they \\&quot;don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I bought the 2 inch, which is a makes doing long hair a little quicker, but is also a little alkward to use.  </li>
            <li> I certainly didn&#x27;t pay 100$ for a fake brand.</li>
            <li> This flat iron straightener also burnt my hair!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money</li>
            <li> In my opinion it&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
            <li> This product may be good for others, but was HORRIBLE in my opinion.</li>
            <li> My hair is so thick and curly, but it only takes about 45 mintues to do all of it.  </li>
            <li> I am addicted to this product as it keep my hair silky and soft.</li>
            <li> RIP my CHI hair straightener, this thing lasted me 8 years and has never let me down.</li>
            <li> I pressed it down and it stuck.</li>
            <li> It is sturdy and never lets me down.</li>
            <li> Save your money and track one of those down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never use anything other than the CHI!</li>
            <li> I have long thin hair that tends to get caught in or torn by the sides of flat irons.</li>
            <li> The 2\\&quot; flat irons are hard to find.</li>
            <li> Takes much less time than any other iron I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> I had it less than 2 weeks when it burnt out.</li>
            <li> I had  previously owned a CHI.  </li>
            <li> I should have heeded the previous opinions.</li>
            <li> Compared to the cheaper strait irons (that are sold at places like Walmart for about $20-30) which took over an hour for me to get all the waves and frizz under control (and was half frizzy again by noon).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also would suspect some of my black friends (chemically treated hair or not)</li>
            <li> If you have seriously unruly hair, or if you just have longer hair, I&#x27;d definitely get this 2\\&quot; Chi...</li>
            <li> It also gets the job done in less time.</li>
            <li> It takes half the time for her to do her hair now.</li>
            <li> My $20 Conair straightener didl as well in half the time.</li>
            <li> I started off with having always cheap straighten irons, and I was always so disappointed that I could not finish my  hair like my hairdresser did it.</li>
            <li> It was a mess.</li>
            <li> Order the 2 inch if you have thick long hair and 1 inch if you have medium hair.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I recommend the turbo 2 inch for anyone with thick long hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick and long hair (half black half a of other stuff) and NO PRODUCT has allowed me to straighten my hair a well as this one... and in HALF the time.  </li>
            <li> , therefore, the paddles do not grab the hair as tightly.</li>
            <li> The hinge on the clamp is not as tight either.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so thick &amp; frizzy, so I&#x27;ve always used a 2\\&quot; or larger iron in the past.</li>
            <li> When my hair is still a little damp it doesn&#x27;t sizzle like others did</li>
            <li> My hair is a little longer that shoulder.</li>
            <li> I had a little trouble with the delivery since the seller uses DHL</li>
            <li> $116 down the drain!  </li>
            <li> and it would go all the way down to 320!</li>
            <li> but my hair is very thick and somewhat coarse and it takes me some time to flatten it all with the 1 inch.  </li>
            <li> Although I have almost shoulder length hair, it is very thick and coarse.  </li>
            <li> every few years.</li>
            <li> I can get my hair done in about 15 or 20 minutes tops; unless I&#x27;m running behind, it only takes 5-10 for a semi-acceptable hair job.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s on the heavy side.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product a few months ago and now it has stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you time on cheaper products.</li>
            <li> It is missing the side round peices that say CHI, and I have had four Chi Irons now and</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money!Chi</li>
            <li> Broke after a few months of usage.  </li>
            <li> and I use it almost everyday.  </li>
            <li> Broke after a few months of use.</li>
            <li> When it heats up it has a very weird smell and doersn&#x27;t heat up as much as it&#x27;s supposed to!</li>
            <li> I had some trouble from the beginning.</li>
            <li> Received and had issues within a few months.  </li>
            <li> I have bought many items but have never in the past had this bad expirence!</li>
            <li> it cuts your styling time in half!</li>
            <li> With this product, it took me less than 20 minutes!  </li>
            <li> This flat iron has been a big disappointment.  </li>
            <li> My CHI Turbo flat iron was broken when i received it.</li>
            <li> but it just was not the same as my old one. :-(</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t get as hot as my other straigtner either, very unhappy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the less expensive to \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; brands of flat irons and totally wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely don&#x27;t think it is awkward or hard to use.  </li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron after deciding that it would be less expensive to do my hair as opposed to going to the salon.  </li>
            <li> (my bad) The last one I had lasted ten years.  </li>
            <li> Not sure I will use Amazon anymore.  </li>
            <li> I usually spend about $60 on a curling iron (yes, to straighten my hair)</li>
            <li> The heat is not a even distribute and it stinks as far as the hype</li>
            <li> I can go out after using it and my hair doesn&#x27;t frizz and curl up like it usually did after spending an hour straightening my hair.  </li>
            <li> not only was it the wrong (1 inch instead of 2 inch)</li>
            <li> and it usually takes about an hour to straighten my hair</li>
            <li> , others fail miserably very shortly after purchase.</li>
            <li> My mother and sister both have had straighteners that have failed very shortly after the year warranty.     </li>
            <li> Judging by the reviews, the defective products seem to make up a small minority.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this item passed any inspection.</li>
            <li> THIS IS BECAUSE IT IS NOT AUTHENTIC.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if its the manufacturer that ripped me off or chi company.</li>
            <li> so it takes me longer than usual to straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair and the 2&amp;#34; wide blade saves a LOT of time.&lt;br /&gt;CHI is unbeatable!.</li>
            <li> Verdict: You can order a fake CHI flat iron and CHI</li>
            <li> After reading reviews and watching some videos i decided to invest in an expensive Flat Iron.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the Chi came broken and because it wouldn&#x27;t close completely.  </li>
            <li> It was hard for me to find</li>
            <li> The CHI logo is also a little faded!!</li>
            <li> CHI has let me down not a good iron at all !</li>
            <li> Not Thrilled with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this iron at LEAST once per day since I received it, and</li>
            <li> Of course she didnt keep the box,and looking at the website it was too late for return per policy.</li>
            <li> She has really thick hair and in about 10 minutes she can straighten her hair.</li>
            <li> my hair is thick and i have alot, so</li>
            <li> It would take forever to straighten my thick wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> so i can&#x27;t touch it w/o feeling like im gonna burn myself, but if you don&#x27;t have thick curley hair like me</li>
            <li> It was for my daughter who has a thick head of hair.</li>
            <li> and my daughter has thick wavy hair ...</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick and fuzzy hair</li>
            <li> This was a big FAKE!</li>
            <li> I was using a flat iron that just wasnt cutting it and damaging my hair.</li>
            <li> No more torn or ripped hair!</li>
            <li> Which is crazy for a flat iron</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the third one because I&#x27;m very careless with them and tend to break them.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if they produce these irons in bulk but the materials used on the iron I received was poor.  </li>
            <li> not i have wasted 127 dollars due to bad service from buzz electronics...</li>
            <li> This Flat Iron makes the impossible...</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend this bad boy.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re no good.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that I hate.</li>
            <li> It is VERY thick and wavy an never seems to cooperate.</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair</li>
            <li> If I wash my hair the night before and then straighten it in the morning before work -- it takes about 15 minutes to straighten my shoulder length, very thick hair.</li>
            <li> and it was so much less expensive than at the retail shop!</li>
            <li> She was not happy .</li>
            <li> Thye do NOT stand behind their product.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Chi for my sister, she is not happy with it at all.  </li>
            <li> I got the turbo 2 inch and when it arrived it was broken.</li>
            <li> I think some electronic component was broken inside</li>
            <li> The seller will not stand behind the product and the manufacturer will not either.  </li>
            <li> Never thought I would have gotten such crap.</li>
            <li> Th handle was broken when I received the iron</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this  product.</li>
            <li> Warranty had expired so, this Flat Iron is worthless.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the new one I ordered was a really bad replica!</li>
            <li> Worse yet is their customer service fails to return messages.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a little annoying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I ever bought this stupid iron just a waste of money.......</li>
            <li> Expensive, however Amazon&#x27;s price is a bargain.  </li>
            <li> Thinking it was just a silly thing</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I dropped it and broke the ceramic pads.  </li>
            <li> I have had this iron for two weeks shy of a year.  </li>
            <li> I sadly have to purchase another after my 8 year run.  </li>
            <li> This Chi Turbo is a fake Chi.</li>
            <li> So not happy!!!!</li>
            <li> However I&#x27;ve had it for 2 months and it has randomly STOPPED working.</li>
            <li> Side-note - As expensive as this straightner is, Chi should offer a warranty.</li>
            <li> The felt is worn but that&#x27;s all that is wrong with it.    </li>
            <li> I am out $80 and all I have is a non working FAKE Chi straightener.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Chi\\&quot; iron failed to work after about 6-7 months, so I followed the CHI process to ship for a replacement under the CHI warranty.</li>
            <li> CHI just shared with me that this device is a FAKE.  </li>
            <li> IT IS A FAKE.</li>
            <li> AND THIS SELLER IS FRAUDULENTLY SELLING A PRODUCT THAT IS FAKE</li>
            <li> This Item is a FAKE Chi product.</li>
            <li> and so this is a fake product.</li>
            <li> Very poor craftsmanship.</li>
            <li> I thought I would prefer it because it would be a faster process, however the handling was difficult and awkward.</li>
            <li> and I cried at the thought of cutting it all off</li>
            <li> This one lasted 60 days before just inexplicably failing to turn on.</li>
            <li> This is CRAZY.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just got a bad one?  </li>
            <li> I have never been inclined to write a bad review nor ever thought I would.  </li>
            <li> I do have bad luck</li>
            <li> What a bummer :(      </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed, I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t offer one :(</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> and it was nothing like this crap of a tool.</li>
            <li> Hate hate hate!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with it!  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in it and feel like I was ripped off.</li>
            <li> My daughter was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed because its like it has a lifespan of about just over 2 years.</li>
            <li> and we were both very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product is a piece of crap!</li>
            <li> Bad investment!!!</li>
            <li> Terrible, seems to be a knock off or something.  </li>
            <li> Terrible, seems to be a knock off or something.  </li>
            <li> Terrible company and product.  </li>
            <li> I must say that this is the worst iron I ever.</li>
            <li> In order to turn it ON, you had to turn it to the OFF button, which wasn&#x27;t the worst thing.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The reason for the rating.......Broke after  a month and after I threw out all the paper work. (my bad) The last one I had lasted ten years.  Not sure I will use Amazon anymore.  In March I was to receive two gift packages purchased from Amazon from my daughters.  Neither one arrived. Nothing has been resolved.</li>
            <li> I read multiple reviews regarding the 1 inch and 2 inch CHI flat irons and was so nervous to invest in the two inch bc people didn&#x27;t seem to like it better than the 1 inch and I read a lot of complaints that it is harder to use.  I love the one inch but my hair is very thick and somewhat coarse and it takes me some time to flatten it all with the 1 inch.  (Also I am impatient so tend to tend to take large chunks of hair rather than doing multiple small areas.) I LOVE THE 2 INCH CHI. Have had it about 3 months.  It works so much better on my thick, coarse hair, flattening it quicker, and letting me take bigger chunks at a time while still doing a great job.  It is better than the 1 inch.  I think the reason some women haven&#x27;t liked it is because I don&#x27;t think the length of the hair really matters, I think it is thicker textured hair which does better with the two inch.  I absolutely don&#x27;t think it is awkward or hard to use.  I am so glad I bought the two inch and will probably never go back to the one inch.  This is the greatest hair straightener ever.  (If you have thick hair also I would highly recommend the CHI blow dryer- I went all CHI and am saving probably like an hour a week in hair drying time!) Well worth the money- I wish I had invested in the CHI flat iron much sooner than I did.</li>
            <li> Product is already broken after only 3 weeks, and I no longer have the box for returns- will never purchase from amazon again and will go back to store purchases so the product quality is better and returns are easier</li>
            <li> RIP my CHI hair straightener, this thing lasted me 8 years and has never let me down. I remember the good times, getting ready for prom and dances... my first day at my first job...now I&#x27;m in business school, and yesterday it just stopped working.   I&#x27;m buying another one, and hopefully it gets me 8 more years.</li>
            <li> CHI manufactures this 2\\&quot; size, and 1\\&quot; and 0.7\\&quot; widths in the same line also.  My first inclination was to buy the 2\\&quot; size - that would make the process faster, right?  Well, I was advised and found out to be true that bigger is not better in this situation, for reasons stated below.  So while I highly recommend the CHI Turbo straightener, I would recommend the smaller widths unless you know for a fact that you prefer the larger plates.  The following section is my review for the 0.7\\&quot; (which is mistakenly advertised as 0.07\\&quot;), which I think is helpful even if you decide on the 2\\&quot; model, so forgive my copy-and-paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was suspect of the need for \\&quot;ceramic ions\\&quot; and \\&quot;far infrared technology\\&quot;, but this iron was highly recommended by salon personnel, so I decided to dish out the money and try it.  You don&#x27;t need to believe the hype to realize that this is a top quality product.  This was a case of \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;!  It is lightweight and ergonomic, heats up almost immediately, has a slider bar for varying heat from 176-356F (80-180C), and velvety felt that protects you from burns (also allows me to get closer to my ears and scalp without getting burned).  The latter feature is worth the money to me alone, and the the ceramic feels much gentler to my hair (I have baby fine hair very prone to breakage).  Two other things to keep in mind when choosing a straightener:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) size matters - smaller size is better - it&#x27;s more maneuverable, and doing smaller sections at a time will produce better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) not all ceramic is created equal - there are solid ceramic plates or plates COATED with ceramic that are cheaper.  the ceramic layer on the coated plates can peel off and is supposedly damaging to your hair (not to mention your product is ruined).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes, this iron is more expensive, but hopefully it will last for years of top-notch straightening.</li>
            <li> This product is a piece of crap! I had it less than 2 weeks when it burnt out. Save your money!</li>
            <li> i ordered this b/c of all the hype about the chi line... it really is a great straightener, but i still think it damages my hear/ creates \\&quot;fly-away,\\&quot; broken pieces of hair on the top of my head.  but the \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; version is cool... red velvet on the outsides of the product...</li>
            <li> I bought this item based on the reviews on Amazon and from what others have told me about their ceramic irons.  Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t do much for my hair, which is natural, very curly and very very thick.  The CHI got my hair about as straight as blow-drying would have and my hair frizzed as soon as I stepped outside.  As an African American woman, I would only recommend it if you have a finer grade of hair.</li>
            <li> Before buying this item, everyone should realize that Farouk&#x27;s return policy states that returns and/or refunds will only be made if the flat iron was bought at a salon. They specify that internet sales will not be refunded. Initially, I was happy with this product. However, this morning, it just stopped working. Completely. I&#x27;ve only had it for about three and a half months and I did not even use it daily. I&#x27;ve taken very good care of it and it has never been plugged in for more than fifteen minutes at a time. Right now I am in the process of trying to find out whether or not Amazon can or will do anything. If I had known about this return policy, I definately would have not bought it.</li>
            <li> Well, funny thing. The first few times using this iron, it wasn&#x27;t really making my hair straight...then I noticed the temperature control. Even though it was at the highest, I moved it to the lowest temp then back to the highest temp, and it heated up fully. LOL! Now it works great! I love it.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product and I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;I have curly hair and it took me 40 minutes to get it pin straight and it lasted for days even in humid Miami.</li>
            <li> This is a knock off - not the real thing. Dont buy it, company does not exists. Tried to return - no one available. no return address provided!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the flat iron I received.  Its everything I expected.  I received it very quickly in the mail.  It was nice not having to wait a long time for it.  The only thing i didn&#x27;t like was to see that the price went down on it right after I ordered it. i still got it for a better price on-line then I would have if I had bought it from a store though.</li>
            <li> I find the straightener to work as good as my sister&#x27;s that I tried before purchasing. I usually spend about $60 on a curling iron (yes, to straighten my hair) every few years. The only reason I have to replace those is because they are hard to clean. The straigtener gives me straighter hair in half the time (1 hour for very long hair) and my hair looks and feels healthier. It&#x27;s also easy to clean and heats up incredibly fast. I chose this size after my sister with medium length hair said you can do wider sections (not bigger chunks, but wider strips) than with the 1 inch that my other sister has. My natural hair is very curly and normal texture. I worry about the burnout factor of these, so hopefully it will last a few years to justify the price.</li>
            <li> This straightens hair but doesn&#x27;t smooth as well as hoped, especially considering the cost. The one I&#x27;ve had for 4 years does a better job.</li>
            <li> This ia a fabulous flat iron, better than any you can buy at your local store. Expensive, however Amazon&#x27;s price is a bargain.  Straightens hair beautifully. Very pleased!!</li>
            <li> My college-aged daughter asked for this item for Christmas - I&#x27;d never heard of it.  She let me try it.... Whoa!!!This is an iron that is worth every penny!!! Straightens hair smooth and shiny in a very short time.</li>
            <li> This is the second Chi flat iron I have bought. I was so hooked on the 1 inch that I just had to get the larger 2 inch model. It is a time saver and so gentle on the hair. The adjustable tempurature gauge is a plus. I recommend this product to anyone in need of a flat iron. Don&#x27;t waste your money on the cheaper versions from the drug stores---believe me the price is worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> I think this is the best hair straightener I have ever used.  It is really quick and fast.  I get out of the shower, blow dry my hair and straighten it in less than 15 min.  I was in shock the first time I used it and if you don&#x27;t like to spend a lot of time on your hair this is the way to go.  It is worth the money....trust me.  Just becareful of the temp. setting or you will burn yourself!</li>
            <li> I ordered a chi on Thursday and it came in the mail on Friday! It&#x27;s brand new and works perfectly. I found the same product in stores for $120 more than I paid here! I am THRILLED with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for how it works GREAT on long hair. Nothing saves more time or does a better job. The only issue that can arise is heat damage, but that&#x27;s with any straightener. Keep your setting low and you&#x27;ll be fine. It saves so much TIME! You can run your hair through it once and it&#x27;s perfectly flat (and I have very long hair and live in an extremely humid area). It&#x27;s a lifesaver!</li>
            <li> I bought the chi turbo after much research and was very excited to finally be getting a good quality flat iron.  When I received the iron I will admit that I was slightly dissapointed when first opening the box, the iron looked chunky and was very heavy.  The plastic holding the ceramic plates were not flush and kinda had gaps in between which worried me.  But because of the great reviews and the reputation of the chi I went ahead and tried it.  The results were great, my hair was smooth and it took no time at all to straighten my thick wavy hair.  However during the straightening process the gaps between the plastic and the plates kept pulling at my hair and ended up pulling out several strands.  Maybe I just got a bad one?  I don&#x27;t know but I decided that a hair ironer that costs that much and had such a great reputation should not have such an inconvenient complication so I returned it.  I have since purchased a sedu flat iron and I absolutely love it - no problems with it whatsoever.  The sedu was more expensive but I figured the difference in cost (~$25) would be made up by many years of great hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my wife and she loves it.  She has really thick hair and in about 10 minutes she can straighten her hair.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best flat iron I have ever owned. I have had 5 different irons. Should have bought this one first.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair straightener I have ever used.  I have very curly hair and it can get my hair extremely straight with no kinks.</li>
            <li> I purchased the CHI on advice from my \\&quot;stylist-daughter\\&quot;. This has got to be the best hair straightener I have ever used. If you are in doubt, don&#x27;t be, it is Great! Heats up fast, smooth, doesn&#x27;t pull or tear my hair, and so easy to use. I love it!</li>
            <li> I did some pretty extensive research before deciding on a Chi Hair Straightener. So far, I&#x27;m very pleased. I have long, very course hair with medium curls and poofy issues. I&#x27;m currently growing out some of the shorter sections and have found this tool very helpful in keeping my hair from looking like a helmet. Basically, I straighten the top portion of my  hair and let the bottom remain curly - it actually looks pretty good. I did get a very good price ($89.00) but there was no warranty in the box and no instructions. My question is whether my iron is new or refurbished???? So far no problems, though. The Chi hair straightening products are also very good.</li>
            <li> Not Thrilled with this purchase.  I do not see what all the hype is all about.  It does not get as hot as my cheaper flat iron.  Big mistake!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I live in the south and deal with humidity!  I used my sisters Chi once and was instantly hooked! I don&#x27;t know how I ever survived without one!  I have got the thickest, curliest, most unmanagable hair and my Chi makes it looks like silk!  I LOVE LOVE LOVE my Chi</li>
            <li> I love this straightner! I have very thick,coarse hair and it took forever to straighten. I took a chance on the CHI straightner and it easily cuts my straighting time in half. It was well worth the money, even though it much more than I&#x27;ve ever spent on a straightner before. From now on, I&#x27;ll only use this straightner!!</li>
            <li> This was a big FAKE! The first day I used it the velvet pannels started to slide off making it a big gooy mess! I was very dissapointed I really thought I had totally scored! I did request for a refund and sent the flat iron back but have yet to receive a credit back. I am very surprised Amazon allows these companys to sell to their clients. I have bought many items but have never in the past had this bad expirence!</li>
            <li> Excellent product &amp; delivered immediately!  Bought this for my daughter &amp; she says that this hair straightener is the best she&#x27;s ever used!  Because it&#x27;s a big 2 incher, she has more minutes in her day to do other things!  Price was almost half what I could&#x27;ve spent, so I also had money left to  buy her a couple more birthday presents.  Highly recommend this seller as service was prompt, reliable &amp; accurate.  I&#x27;m delighted!</li>
            <li> I think the product is a good product.  The cost was very reasonable as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron after deciding that it would be less expensive to do my hair as opposed to going to the salon.  I have not had any problem with this flat iron and it works very well on my hair.  I have not noticed any damage, but I also use a heat guard spray by CHI on my hair before I flat iron it.  I would highly recommend this flat iron to anyone but especially African American women who are interested in quickly straightening their hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I chose this flat iron, It heats up really fast and the very long swivel cord is very convenient. I love that I got the 2\\&quot; because I have a lot of hair and also really thick hair so it takes me less time to do than with a smaller one. It is not that heavy or big and it is actually beautiful! I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 months now and no problems so far. My hair is still healthy and shiny and I use it about 2-3 times a week. I love it and recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for almost identical CHI. Almost being that things appeared cheaper and the logo a little different.  Thinking it was just a silly thing I kept it.  As of 1 week after the return deadline the iron stopped working.  I tried in different outlets, tested the button on the plug and it is dead.  I feel ripped off and hope no one else will lose the $100 on this item.</li>
            <li> I had  previously owned a CHI.  So after five years when it died, I bought another.  It WAS NOT like the old one.  There were misspelled words in the directions, the felt on the outside was peeling and kept catching my hair and it would not stay warm for longer than three seconds before it would need to heat itself back up.  So I returned it and bought a Baybliss and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this iron for my sister as a gift, had it sent to her and it did not work.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> It is now March 14, 2011 and I have not receive THIS product. I ordered this on Feb 2.......unless it&#x27;s being ship from JAPAN there is no excuse. My emails have not be answered. Amazon SHOULD REMOVE them from their web-site, how irrisponsible can a company/person be! This makes Amazon just as LIABLE! Don&#x27;t you verify credentials and ethics of a company on YOUR website.   I should have heeded the previous opinions.</li>
            <li> Got it quickly -- as a gift for my daughter, and she says it works great</li>
            <li> Great product and is the only thing that works on my thick Hispanic hair. It was hard for me to find but im glad i found it on amazon :)</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this for 7 plus years EVERYDAY solid!! ZERO ISSUES!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems, I love this product and it heats up very fast.  But I also treat my iron very well and protect it like the $100 dollar investment it is.  The ceramic coating hasn&#x27;t peeled off, nor has the red velvet that protects your fingers.  I am white and have shoulder length hair that is super thick, wavy &amp; frizzy... but you can&#x27;t tell after I use this product.  I can get my hair done in about 15 or 20 minutes tops; unless I&#x27;m running behind, it only takes 5-10 for a semi-acceptable hair job.  And it lasts all day!  Compared to the cheaper strait irons (that are sold at places like Walmart for about $20-30) which took over an hour for me to get all the waves and frizz under control (and was half frizzy again by noon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only warning I would give is to start at the low to medium heat settings and work your way up.  When I say hot, I mean this puppy gets HOT!  I think most people could easily burn their fingers or ears by touching their actual hair just after it has moved out of the iron on heat settings 8, 9 or 10.  I also would suspect some of my black friends (chemically treated hair or not) could easily singe their hair off on the highest settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, there is no automatic shut off!!!  SO I always check twice that I unplugged it before leaving the house.  I don&#x27;t want to come home to a melted counter top or the house on fire!</li>
            <li> every women wants straight sexy hair and this is the solution. dont buy a cheap flat iron! this is the only product you should consider buying. we had ours for 5 years and still works like day one!</li>
            <li> bought it for a friend and she liked it</li>
            <li> Bought the Turbo 2\\&quot;.  Worked fine for four months and then, nothing.  Warranty had expired so, this Flat Iron is worthless.  $116 down the drain!  Find another product!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent hair straightening machine. I&#x27;m not sure if the tempature settings is helpful at this point since I have alot of thick hair and need to keep it on a high temp at all times. The two inch iron allow me to finish alot quicker then with the 1 inch iron. I recommend this product/brand 100%.</li>
            <li> I had the 1\\&quot; CHI and loved it.  Unfortunately, I dropped it and broke the ceramic pads.  So I thought surely a 2\\&quot; must be better.  Not really.  Sure, it works great but it&#x27;s obviously heavier than the 1\\&quot; and sometimes the back palm of my hand gets caught in the hinges. It has the temp control which I like but overall I had more control with the 1\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s much easier to manipulate.  Would highly recommend the brand but like the 1\\&quot; better.</li>
            <li> The Farouk CHI products are wonderful as long as they don&#x27;t malfuction!!! I used mine 5 times and it worked great, then the 6th time it would not turn on at all.     I contacted the company, since it had been pruchased from amazon more than 30 days, and they said to send it in.     I recieved the flat iron back from Chi with letter saying it did not honor any Warantys if the product was purchased online. What a bummer :(      I did reread the enclosed packaging and it says in fine print that it will not honor their waranty if purchased on the internet or anywhere other than a porfessional salon.</li>
            <li> This item works great!  Note: it&#x27;s on the heavy side.  I have been using cheap flat irons for the past couple years.  The reason I finally up-graded was because I&#x27;m going on a trip with some girlfriends and wanted something better to take with me.  I was tempted to get Sedu since I had used my friend&#x27;s and knew it was lightweight and worked well.  However, the Sedu tends to burn my hand without getting quite hot enough to straigten my thick (and course) curly hair in a couple of strokes.  The Chi turbo gets very hot, makes my hair look silky, and doesn&#x27;t burn my hand.  I feel like my money was well spent.</li>
            <li> I have had this iron for two weeks shy of a year.  The iron stopped working.  I thought, \\&quot;Great!  Finally something actually breaks down two weeks BEFORE the warranty runs out instead of two weeks after!\\&quot;  After contacting Farouk, I learned that the warranty is VOID if the product is purchased over the internet.  This was in no way, shape, or form disclosed to me when I purchased my iron.  DO NOT BUY!!  WAY too much money to drop on a flat iron that doesn&#x27;t even have a valid warranty!</li>
            <li> this is a great product, I received it so fast and it was so much less expensive than at the retail shop!</li>
            <li> I have had my Chi Turbo 2 in Straightener for almost 8 years now.  I have long curly hair and it works wonders on my hair.  I sadly have to purchase another after my 8 year run.  It just died on me- wont turn on.  I think the price is well worth it.  This straightener has lasted me for ever.  I have put it through hell and back--I dropped it all the time (clumsy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this bad boy.</li>
            <li> Never again ! CHI has let me down not a good iron at all ! The heat is not a even distribute and it stinks as far as the hype</li>
            <li> I bought this product a few months ago and now it has stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ans I do agree, the smaller the hair straightener, the better (I originally had a smaller one, that my salon uses, but it also stopped working).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light is on, and the heat comes off and on randomly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very upsetting.</li>
            <li> I have been using the 2 inch straightener for less than a month and for the most part am satisfied with the performance.  I like the safety feature of suede around the edges so you don&#x27;t get burned on your scalp or face when you go for the close to scalp hairs.  But what I don&#x27;t like is the fact that I cannot get more of a curl at the ends now because of the 2 inch width.  If all you care about is straight hair...this is a good product and you will like it.  If you want more flexibility...stick with 1 to 1 1/2 inch straightener.</li>
            <li> I have wasted money on numerous cheaper proucts like Revlon and Vidal Sasson straighteners, but I agree with ppl who said nothing works like a Chi.From my experience I would recommend spending the extra bucks on a good product instead of getting disappointed by the cheapies. I would tell my friends that I have curly hair and there is no way even a Chi would get it straight like the model pics. I had to eat my words when one of friends straightened my hair with her straightener(It wasnt a Chi, but some other expensive brand).After looking at the results, I went ahead and got me a Chi right away. I like having the option of having straight hair Vs going Curly (au naturel)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black with natural, kinky hair and this flat iron definitely does what it&#x27;s supposed to. The only downside is it doesn&#x27;t last for long. Overall pretty good product.</li>
            <li> I was using a flat iron that just wasnt cutting it and damaging my hair. My friend reccommended CHI so I ordered one and it is fabulous. Heats up quickly and works like a charm. I have very curly hair and it straightens with one pass and leaves my hair soft as silk. I was amazed. Its worth the investement!</li>
            <li> i love this product!!!!!!! my hair is thick and i have alot, so with my old straighteners it would take me a long time, but with the 2\\&quot; turbo chi, my hair is straight in half the time and looks better than before. i love it! and would recomend it to anyone!!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Chi (Turbo Big 2 inch) for about 6 years now. I bought my most recent one on Amazon as it was a little cheaper with the shipping. The box it came in was the same box my previous 3 came in. However, when I opened it, the straightner itself felt different- of cheaper quality. The red velvet part was already peeling from one corner. I pressed it down and it stuck. Now after only a couple of months, I regret not returning it right away! It&#x27;s peeling more and looks so worn out (I haven&#x27;t travelled with it, dropped it, and always keep in away from dust, etc.). I am very disappointed in it and feel like I was ripped off. This Chi does not compare to my previous 3 which were definitely worth the money (reason why I was loyal to buying this particular straigtner). I showed it to my sister, who had introduced me to this flat iron after herself using it for so many years, and she too noticed that it&#x27;s like a knock-off version. Furthermore, two days ago, while I was using it, I felt something was off when I was holding it. It seems that the joint where the top and both handles connect is a little loose. I now worry that it will soon fall apart.</li>
            <li> I got this for my friend&#x27;s birthday and she loves it!!! If you flat iron your hair more than 2x a month, it&#x27;s worth making the investment.</li>
            <li> This is the best CHI Iron I&#x27;ve purchased.  I&#x27;m on the third one because I&#x27;m very careless with them and tend to break them.  This one is very sturdy and love how HOT it gets.  I recommend it especially for the price I paid on AMAZON.com.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I have never been inclined to write a bad review nor ever thought I would.  But I think it would be so helpful to people that want the 2 inch CHI flat iron.    * buyers beware: I called CHI and they told me that they no longer make the 2 inch version of this flat iron.    [...]    I was extrememly dissapointed to find this out as my authentic CHI 2 inch flat iron was the best flat iron ever.  I have long and thick hair and the 2 inch straightened my hair perfectly and I could do it in about 20 mins. as opposed to a smaller iron.  After it lasted about 4 years plus it finally stop working so I wanted to order a new one.  I looked for a good deal and came across this seller.  When I got the flat iron I was so excited but then disappointed greatly at the results.  It was not working nearly as well as my 1st one after a few times I got curious and checked the Internet and made some calls.  Verdict: You can order a fake CHI flat iron and CHI no longer manufactures the 2 inch flat iron.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t want to spend so much money for a flat iron, but since all the others I was using didn&#x27;t do such a great job, I decided to go for it.  I have long curly, thick hair and this flat iron really works.  I can go out after using it and my hair doesn&#x27;t frizz and curl up like it usually did after spending an hour straightening my hair.  It sets my hair in place and that&#x27;s without using any product. It also worked a lot faster than my other irons. It glides so nicely through my hair. When I used other curling irons, my hair use to get caught and get pulled.  This is well worth every penny!!!  Just go for it!!!!</li>
            <li> It worked well for about three months...It will not heat up at all after that...Bad investment!!! It is not worth the money. I would not buy another one.  You can buy the regular one for $15 and it will last longer.</li>
            <li> this is an excellent flat iron. the first time i used it i could see the difference compared to store bought flat irons. it left my hair straight and soft, no fly aways or dryness !!!! salon quality from your own home : )</li>
            <li> I love my Chi!!!  It gets my frizzy, curly hair soooo straight and controlled.  I live in Louisiana where it is extremely humid.  When I straighten my hair with the Chi, my hair STAYS straight all day and doesn&#x27;t frizz out.  AND it has cut atleast 10 minutes out of my time getting ready.</li>
            <li> I recieved this item and it \\&quot;worked\\&quot; for 2 weeks. It did not get very hot at all. I had to send it back because it stopped working out of no where. Very dissapointed!</li>
            <li> If I had to give an award for the best product ever this iron will get it from me!! It is simply wonderful, it doesnt damage your hair, it heats up easily. I got one for my sister and she loves it too. You will not regret buying this iron.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item, [[ASIN:B0009V1YS2 Farouk CHI GF1539 Turbo Big 2 Inch Ceramic Flat Iron Hair Straightener]] and it worked well for a month or so. After that I started having problems with the straightener turning on. At times it wouldn&#x27;t turn on at all and other times it would turn on for a few minutes and then turn back off. I didn&#x27;t start giving me problems until after my \\&quot;return window\\&quot;, go figure. Next time I will just buy my straightener from a salon or legitimate seller.</li>
            <li> I have been battling with my hair for years. It is VERY thick and wavy an never seems to cooperate. In previous years I had bought a Conair and a Revlon flat iron, which basically did nothing for me. It would look as if I hadn&#x27;t even attempted to straighten it. So, I literally went for years wearing nothing but a pony tail. The initial shock of the cost of the Chi flat iron made me put off buying it for a year, but I realized that I was just wasting money buying these cheaper products and that I should invest in something that would actually work (believe me that was a big deal because I am literally the cheapest person I know). My hairdresser had used the iron on my hair before so I was positive it would work.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;     As soon as I decided to buy this product there was a nationwide backorder and no web site I could find had any in stock. This was the only place that had any or was receiving any in a reasonable amount of time. Overall I was extremely satisfied with the product and the supplier. It arrived in a orderly fashion and the very first time I used the iron I had salon perfect hair.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;     I recommend this product to ANYONE with rebellious hair. It works and it is worth the money. Don&#x27;t waste you time on cheaper products. Life&#x27;s short and you should be happy with the way you look</li>
            <li> I have three teenage daughters, a blonde, brunette and red head. I now own 2 of the Chi Turbo straighteners and we all love them. I have a 1\\&quot; and a 2\\&quot;. Originally I purchased these for my daughters and I was going to just use the cheap $20 one I still have. NO WAY!! I have borrowed the 2\\&quot; twice and I am now going to purchase our 3rd Chi Turbo for myself. It really makes that much of a difference in the damage and amount of time I have in the morning to get ready. I also love that the velvet keeps me from burning myself when I am in a rush (which I always am). Aside from my girls I also work full time and go to nursing school so I cannot be spending hours trying to fix my hair and I cried at the thought of cutting it all off so this is my simple solution.  &lt;br /&gt;This is also the best gift for any teenage girl. Two of my daughters practically ran to the shower Christmas morning so they could use their straighteners right away!!</li>
            <li> I  bought this for my wife. Happy wife happy life. She was not happy . Product stopped working after 25 days. Would not turn on. I would not recommend this model. Supplier is sending a replacement. If it had not failed within 30 days would not have received a replacement more than likely.</li>
            <li> This is my second ceramic flat iron and my first chi. My hair stylist always used it when styling my hair, so after my first flat iron finally died, I decided to get the exact one that always made my hair look so fabulous when leaving the salon.  I must say I am very impressed.  My thick wavy hair becomes pin straight!!!   1. I would recommend spending the extra on the red felt (like this one has) so you don&#x27;t burn your ears.  That has been an advantage this flat iron has had over my last one and other chi&#x27;s  2. When debating over the 1 inch or 2 inch I considered all the reviews, and finally decided on the 2 inch.  Although I have almost shoulder length hair, it is very thick and coarse.  Most people with this length hair would have gone with the 1 inch, but given the amount of hair I have I decided I needed more coverage, other reviews say that a 2 inch flat iron is harder to manipulate.  I don&#x27;t think so.  BUT, that said, my last flat iron, I had for 5 years, was also a 2 inch, so maybe I&#x27;ve just had a LOT of practice...</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that I hate. I&#x27;ve even had it chemically straightened... twice. That never worked. Most flat irons I&#x27;ve tried have worked for only a few minutes, then went right back to wavy. I live in Florida and there&#x27;s a lot of humidity here so I wanted something that would work fast AND be good enough to hold.     This did the trick. Plus it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend was tired of hearing me complain about never being able to get my hair straight enough w/ my cheap, cruddy flat iron, so last Christmas he bought me this Chi. It&#x27;s wonderful! It is my third iron, and it&#x27;s still holding up well, with only minimal wear. My hair is so thick &amp; frizzy, so I&#x27;ve always used a 2\\&quot; or larger iron in the past. With the Chi, however, handling is much smoother, and the controls are well-built (so you can&#x27;t switch it off, or move the temperature to low by accident). The cord swivels, so it&#x27;s harder to get it stuck between the ceramic plates (which was a BIG problem I&#x27;ve had w/ cheaper irons). I have been using this iron at LEAST once per day since I received it, and like I said, it&#x27;s still going strong. If you have seriously unruly hair, or if you just have longer hair, I&#x27;d definitely get this 2\\&quot; Chi... it cuts your styling time in half!</li>
            <li> This product will not burn your hair, but gets up to 380 degrees F in about three seconds.  I have the kinkiest hair known to man and it works like a charm.  My hair spirals perfectly around a pencil, just to give you an idea of how curly it really is.  I&#x27;ve used the chi iron for about 7 years now with out any dissatisfaction.  It is sturdy and never lets me down.</li>
            <li> Does not get hot enough and when using the different outlets the temperature ranges.  Not worth the money I spent.</li>
            <li> I just would like to say this is the best straighter I have ever had. I&#x27;ve had it probably about 6 years now. It has lasted through 4 moves, all the dropping and beating it could possibly ever endure. It still works even after all these years just as good as when I first bought it. It&#x27;s absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m what most would call, a hair snob. I always try to have my hair perfect before leaving the house. Straighteners are must-haves for those of us with wavy or semi-wavy hair. I&#x27;ve used many of them in hopes of finding the perfect straightener....    This hair straightener was a last resort for me, I&#x27;ve gone through many of them. Either they die out, or yank your hair, don&#x27;t get hot enough, so your hair is just kind of half-straight, or make awful smells. I got this on an Amazon Gold Box Deal and figured if it didn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;d be able to return it.    This is the best! It heats up super fast, gives you stick straight shiny hair, no smell of the appliance to make your hair smell funky! Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t pullout all your hair or break it! I highly recommend this straightener!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This Chi Turbo is a fake Chi. I returned it and got a full refund and the people from the company are really nice, but don&#x27;t waste your time ordering this product b/c it&#x27;s not real.</li>
            <li> I would leave a zero if I could. It is missing the side round peices that say CHI, and I have had four Chi Irons now and this on is definately not new. So not happy!!!!</li>
            <li> This flat iron straightener also burnt my hair!!!!!!!! Suddenly i began to smell like something burning.....oh i realized it was my hair!!!!!!!!!!!   Also the plates dont close well so i had to make a lot of pressure to close them....  Apart from the fact, the second time it didn t work. I don t know if i was not lucky, but some reviews were good, and others not so good, but NEVER  read it burnt the hair. I feel this flat iron was not new, cause it s rare this happened. May be they fix them and then they sell them again....i don t know what to think.  But well, my advice...obviously.....DON T BUY IT.  The seller was HAIR CARE PLUS AND MORE</li>
            <li> My hair is very curly and can get extremely frizzy. This flat iron is awesome. It takes me about 45 minutes to get it straight which is actually not a lot of time at all considering my hair is very long. It eliminates the frizz as it straightens and leaves your hair shiny and super soft. It does not damage your hair as other flat irons do. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I finally got the chi flat iron.  It is the best purchase ever.  It saves me time every morning and I recommend it to every one.  It heats up in seconds and what used to take me 45min to straighten my hair it now takes me 15min the most.  Not to mention the nice shine it gives my hair.  I love it!!!  If you are thinking about buying... just buy it... no need to think anymore!!</li>
            <li> LOVE the straightner and my husband does too - he can&#x27;t believe how good my hair looks!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my fiance.  It lasted 9 months and now has died. The company won&#x27;t honor the 1 year warranty since we purchased it from the internet. It MUST be bought from a salon for them to honor the warranty. Just a heads up.</li>
            <li> I had this iron for about 3 months before it stopped working and then I put off returning it thinking that I had the full term of the warranty, but Farouk doesn&#x27;t honor the waranty since I bought it online and not in a professional salon! WHAT A RIP! for an extra 50-60 bucks I would buy it at like ulta and get the FULL warranty!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> OMG.  If you&#x27;re a girl, this is almost better than the cell phone.  I had a little trouble with the delivery since the seller uses DHL and they&#x27;re no good.  The iron itself is like a dream come true.  I have very thick curly hair and it works right away and leaves your hair looking and feeling silky smooth and pin straight.  Almost like Asian hair and for anyone with my hair type, we know what that is.  It doesn&#x27;t even take that long to do!  I&#x27;ve recommended it to everyone I know.  Also, I recommend getting the 2\\&quot; over the 1\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s bigger which allows it to cover more ground.  I can&#x27;t say enough great things about it.  Highly highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I had a straightener that I purchased from Walmart about a year ago.  It would take forever to straighten my thick wavy hair.  With the Chi, it takes me about 30 min now and it looks amazing - - it leaves my hair looking so shiney.  I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> this is just amazing!!!!you will never believe what you  The CHI will do with your hair in just minutes.Forget about the hours working with your hair.  maybe  a little expensive, but I had the cheap ones and they dry your hair, and the time you save,,, It is really worthy, BUY IT!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my dsghter for her birthday.  She loves it.  I use it too. I&#x27;m going buy one for myself.   Great price.</li>
            <li> Great Flat Iron, I get a nice straight silky shine from it.  But the best part is:  No more torn or ripped hair! I have long thin hair that tends to get caught in or torn by the sides of flat irons. No problems with this new best friend :P High Five!</li>
            <li> I received many positive reviews about this product from my friends... Wanted to give it a try. Ordered it from amazon. Got it well before the estimated arrival date. It arrived in neat packing. Great product. Heats up fast and turns my unmanageable curly hair to smooth and silky soft in minutes... And of course, there&#x27;s good amount of hair loss just like any other flat iron. But, I had tried other brands and CHI is the best and I would recommend it to everyone who would want a silky straight hair... It is worth the money we spend.</li>
            <li> I thought I would save a few dollars buy buying this cheaper version of the CHI; however i ended up throwing money down the toilet. this is obviously a fake/knock-off CHI and has the straightening power of a the cheapest flat iron you could pick up at wal-mart. BOOO!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product at the end of April and I got it in a timely manner. However I&#x27;ve had it for 2 months and it has randomly STOPPED working. I used it LAST NIGHT and now it doesn&#x27;t work!? I spent $140 on this thing and now I can&#x27;t even figure out how to return it or get my money back! I&#x27;m so disappointed, I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife at the recommendation of her hair stylist.  I was floored by the price, but she loves it.  It works exceptionally well on her hair, even when damp.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> I have used this iron many times before, and loved it, and so I decided to actually purchase one for myself. It turns out that after the first time I did my hair, the iron broke and would not turn on. I returned it right away to amazon and received a new one in the mail within 5 days. The new iron works great, it just took me twice as long to hold onto it.</li>
            <li> I think this is great, the size is amazing, however it does&#x27;t heat up as hot as I would like, but still does the job. When my hair is still a little damp it doesn&#x27;t sizzle like others did which is nice. My last flat iron was an infrashine and that was much hotter.</li>
            <li> Did not appear to be an official chi, as represented.  I would not recommend it to anyone who wants a real chi.</li>
            <li> I boughtmy first Turbo Chi 2\\&quot; at a salon 2 years ago. I paid 200 bucks but I loved it. After the warranty was up, my Chi short circuited and died on me. I bought the digital Turbo Chi 2\\&quot; and had to return it because the it would not keep the temp consistant while it was on my hair. I needed it to be at 395 and it would go all the way down to 320! I returned it and looked for the orginal Big Turbo Chi 2\\&quot;. I found it and bough it again only to return it because the red felt tip was unsticking. Then the red Chi button fell out. It does not seem sturdy at all. I think its of its hinges because it not leveled with the Chi button. Again I only know this cause Im comparing it to the one I bought from the salon. I don&#x27;t think its heatting properly because it left my hair frizzy.... I found out that Chi has been making their product in China and quality has lowered. I emailed them and still no response. Thye do NOT stand behind their product. Im willing to pay more $$ if I know I am getting a good quality product. Dont waste your money!Chi is not what it used to be</li>
            <li> Bought for daughter. CHI has never been disappointing and as expected, it is  a wonderful product. would purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> Terrible, seems to be a knock off or something.  Terrible, seems to be a knock off or something.  Broke after a few months of usage.  Seemed to not be the real thing.</li>
            <li> People, don&#x27;t even bother wasting your money on Conair, Vidal Sasson or any kind of cheap irons that you can get at Target or Walmart. CHI works like a charm. It heats up fast, and your hair stay straight a day long (unlike the cheap ones, my hair won&#x27;t stay straight for a whole day) -- I live in San Francisco, theres tends to be alot of moist in my area, but my hair would still stay straight without having to straighten over and over...Also, the time it takes to straighten your hair with CHI is way faster than the cheap iron. I already went through 3 cheap irons, before I decided to get CHI (since it was pricey) But after I got the CHI, I am glad I made that decision. I totally recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Replaced first order because it was defective and the replacement arrived and now has the same problem. I don&#x27;t believe it is a problem with amazon, though I do believe it is an issue with the product and manufacturer. I have never had a problem with any items puchased from Amazon.com until now.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair with a little bit of a wave to it, as well as it gets frizzy easily. I had never thought of using a straightening iron until the girl that cuts my hair used it one on my hair.  The difference was amazing. She had used the 1 inch Chi Iron.....I bought the 2 inch, which is a makes doing long hair a little quicker, but is also a little alkward to use.  Small price to pay when it makes such a difference.   One thing to remember when using one of these is make sure you use something to protect your hair.....I use Chi Silk Infusion and haven&#x27;t had any problems with my hair drying out.....actually will make my hair much softer.</li>
            <li> First off, let me tell you all that my hair is maddening. It&#x27;s extremely thick, frizzes easily, and takes two hours to wash and get all of the knots out of. And once it dries, the knots come back! It&#x27;s a pain. My cousin let me use this straightener, and my gosh, it worked so well! It took a while, of course, because I have so much hair, but after an hour of straightening the finished product was miraculous. My hair was straight! And not just the gross, frizzy-straight, i mean REALLY STRAIGHT. This product is worth buying, especially if you have hard-to-manage hair like mine.</li>
            <li> LOVER IT. i got mine today and i was so excited, rite now im sitting here with great hair, can&#x27;t wait to use it when school starts. Order the 2 inch if you have thick long hair and 1 inch if you have medium hair. worth everypenny, only thing i don&#x27;t like is that i need a high heat to straighten fast which makes my hair feel hot for a good 10 secs so i can&#x27;t touch it w/o feeling like im gonna burn myself, but if you don&#x27;t have thick curley hair like me you prolly wont&#x27; need the high setting     &#x3D;] very happy</li>
            <li> This was a really good purchase. It was for my daughter who has a thick head of hair. It works really well for her and is extremely well made and very heavy duty. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> The first iron I had melted my hair and burnt out on the first use...the replacement also burnt out the first time I used it.  I do have bad luck but...this is rediculous.  The only upside was the great customer service by Amazon (even though I had to pay to ship both irons back).  Do not buy CHI products.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly and well packaged.  I love the Flat Iron and it really was worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have long hair (about three inches below my shoulders) and I debated as to whether I should get the 1\\&quot; or 2\\&quot; CHI and whether I should purchase the original or turbo. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I finally ended up ordering the 2\\&quot; Turbo CHI and I&#x27;m glad I did.  The \\&quot;Turbo\\&quot; CHI allows you to adjust the heat temperature, while the original CHI does not---the original has a standard heat setting.  The 2\\&quot; CHI is easy to maneuver and straightens my hair in bigger batches.  The 1\\&quot; CHI would have taken much longer to pass through all of my hair.    &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This one&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> my pocket isnt exactly filled with money, but without a doubt i would pay even $200 for this product. it makes your hair look beautifuly NATURALY staright, shiny, silky, and amazingly healthy even if your hair isnt. this is it...there is simply no other better hair iron around. and if you can have hair like that everyday without even spending more than 30 miniuts occasionaly, who wouldnt pay a little over $100?  &lt;br /&gt;if your looking for beautiful perfectly straight hair and an iron that heats up in realy no time at all, and is completely durable, trust me youl want this Chi.</li>
            <li> The CHI 2\\&quot; Flat Iron is fantastic! It heats up nicely and straightens your hair quickly. I recommend the 2\\&quot; for very long hair. Shoulder length or shorter really only needs the 1\\&quot;. My hair is a little longer that shoulder. I also have bangs which this size does not work well with, but that should be expected. Great Straightener! Best on the market!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Chi for my sister, she is not happy with it at all.  For some reason hers does not got hot even on the highest setting.  She wants to send it back.  She has purchased a CHI in the past and it worked 100 times better.  i love my CHI which was also purchased on Amazon.  Maybe hers is defective.</li>
            <li> I purchased this CHI flat iron in June and it has already quit working. I learn today when I check return policy that the return date expired in July. I am very upset because this is not a cheap flat iron. We are not talking  fifteen dollars we are talking $100.00 dollars. I will never purchase something like this again on Amazon. I will go through my hair stylist from now on. So in other words I have thrown 100.00 out the window.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas... and I&#x27;ve never seen her use a Christmas gift so much!!! She has long hair and a lot of it, so the 2\\&quot; works perfect.     With this, even when she&#x27;s in a hurry she has enough time to straighten her hair, and it looks BETTER than when she would spend 30 min - hour trying to straighten it before!     the one thing i would note, the other CHI hair products (shampoo conditioner, spray) i also bought for her... she didn&#x27;t like those... said that it left her hair \\&quot;greasy\\&quot;, but she&#x27;s picky about that kind of thing.     I don&#x27;t give 5 stars lightly ... the 2\\&quot; chi turbo is a great product, and worth the money if you need your hair straight.</li>
            <li> I debated for awhile and read all the reviews I could on the pros and cons on spending so much on this flat iron as well as between the smaller size or the larger 2inch one.  I ended up rationalizing that I&#x27;ll get the larger one because it should make straightening my hair faster and my brother&#x27;s girlfriend has the nano CHI and it works great.    The iron works pretty well with the heating up fast part.  However I saw the the plates don&#x27;t close evenly and they weren&#x27;t 100% smooth, I found my hair was getting caught along the edges and getting pulled out.  I also regretted not getting the smaller 1-1 1/2 inch one instead because I realize now that the wider plates don&#x27;t straight your hair any faster since it will run down your hair shaft in the same distance, it just clamps down a wider area of your hair.  Meaning if your hair is kind of wavy or curly, you&#x27;ll get a larger chunk of hair that is ironed down between the plates before being pulled straight.  Does that make sense?  With a more narrow plate, you have less of that happening before you start your straightening.   Also I found that the larger one is really much more clunkier, it&#x27;s so much more easier using the smaller iron since it is lighter and you move through your hair faster.    Overall, I&#x27;l probably use it over the old flat iron I have that has just metal plates but if I could do it again, I&#x27;d get the 1 - 1 1/2 width one and be much happier.</li>
            <li> This flat iron did not do well with my medium length hair.  I think the 1\\&quot; would have been a much better choice. but I found this one on sale at Amazon for $74 and couldn&#x27;t pass up such a bargain.      It does heat up super fast and is very lightweight and feels good in my hands.  If you have longer, thicker hair I think this would be an excellent choice.</li>
            <li> I have been using my new Turbo Chi every day and i love it! thanks</li>
            <li> This product may be good for others, but was HORRIBLE in my opinion. The iron did not get very hot and it didn&#x27;t get my hair straight at all. I sent this product back immediately for a refund. I will continue to use my Maxi-Glide and get fabulous results. The CHI is a no-go in my book.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money --- I tried 2 of them --- had to return them both. Buy the Ceramic Tools unit at $35.00 --- Its so much better and lighter to handle.</li>
            <li> Yes the Chi Straightener is awesome and well worth the money, but do not buy from this company. I got the turbo 2 inch and when it arrived it was broken. I had a replacement sent to me but when that straightener came in... not only was it the wrong (1 inch instead of 2 inch) but it was ALSO broken like the first. They sent me a full refund once I returned both straighteners...But my point is buy this product from a more responsible company.</li>
            <li> We love our Chi Turbo, we have long, thick hair that only seems to get straight and silky with a Chi</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 12 year old daughter after researching many different models and brands.  She has hair down to the middle of her back and it is on the thicker side.  She is very happy so far with this straightener.  I asked my hair salon about this brand and they had good things to say about it.  They did recommend buying a protective spray to put on her hair before using the iron to keep the moisture in her hair.  I did this and so far we are very happy overall.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000E31Q92 CHI Turbo Ionic Ceramic Flat Iron 2\\&quot;]]    I love this flat iron.  I have owned several in the past, both inexpensive and high end appliances, and this one is the best.  It is comfortable to use and it leaves my hair lustrous and shiny.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to do as much damage to the hair as others I have used.  For someone who has struggled and suffered with curly hair all my life, this is a dream come true.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron for my 15 yeard old daughter on a recommendation of a friend.  My daughter simply loves this flat iron.  In fact, on Friday nights many of her friends will gather at my house to \\&quot;do their hair\\&quot;.  They all claim that the CHI is the best.  My daughter claims it works much faster than other irons and leaves her hair silky smoothe.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done a lot of flat ironing on my curly hair, and this is the best one that I have found!  It is totally worth the price, and works so much better than those cheap irons from the discount store!</li>
            <li> I love this hair straightener! It runs through my hair with ease, and leaves it looking soft and shiny. The CHI is well worth the money if you are looking for a hair straightener that works like magic! Excellent product - and I was amazed at how quickly it arrived in the mail...added bonus!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product because it works properly and met my expectations as a straightening product.  It also had a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li> I probably spent over $300 on a variety on straighteners priced between $29.99 - $49.99, found at places like Target, Rite-Aid, CVS, etc....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want straight hair quickly, with salon quality, bite the bullet...shell out $115 and get this. I&#x27;ve had it for 2 years and use it every weekday with no problems, and no damage to my hair</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s old Chi straighter developed a short and wouldn&#x27;t work. Have naturally curly hair it just wouldn&#x27;t do. I found the same one on Amazon.com and ordered it.    Side-note - As expensive as this straightner is, Chi should offer a warranty. They didn&#x27;t offer one :( but my daughter is spoiled so I replaced it.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0009V1YS2 Farouk CHI GF1539 Turbo Big 2 Inch Ceramic Flat Iron Hair Straightener]]    I&#x27;ve tried the less expensive to \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; brands of flat irons and totally wasted my money.  The Farouk Chi is fabulous. It heats up quickly and it WORKS! If I wash my hair the night before and then straighten it in the morning before work -- it takes about 15 minutes to straighten my shoulder length, very thick hair. I&#x27;ve had soooooo many compliments on my new hairstyle.  It&#x27;s worth every dollar of the investment.  I promise you that you&#x27;ll love it and will recommend it to your own friends and family!</li>
            <li> I love the Chi and I use it almost everyday.  I originally had the 1/2\\&quot; original but after 2 1/2 years of heavy use, it quit working, so when I replaced it I thought I would give this one a chance.  Well, honestly, it&#x27;s not that much different than my old one....not much faster, etc... but it works wonderfully and achieves the look I desire.  The Chi, overall, is not a cheap product, but for my tough to do hair it is well worth the investment.  I don&#x27;t think I will ever purchase anything other than a Chi again.</li>
            <li> I was worried this chi would not live up to the hype. I have never been too crazy about the idea of buying a hair item that cost more than 50 dollars. It came in today and my hair which is past my shoulders was completely straight and shiny in 10 minutes, and I did not have to blow dry it straight-ish first. My hair is naturally curly, and cannot be blown dry straight and was barely straight after 30-45 minutes with a flat iron. So after an hour of blow-drying and straightening my hair looked sort of okay with my 20 dollar straightner. I live in Houston Texas and if you have been there you know our humidity is fun for hair. I was outside for an hour and with the chi my hair STAYED straight. That never happened with my cheaper straighteners. I am extremely happy with the straightening results! Sorry I rambled but I am uber happy!</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and this straightener works SO well!! I&#x27;ve finally found something that works!  I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> When my old straightener died, I knew I was going to get this iron. My best friend has had two, so it came highly recommended. I love it. The only thing that bothers me is that I have to reset the power after I plug it in everytime. I&#x27;m not sure if that happens to other people or if maybe it is just a glitch with mine, but is still works fine regardless. It&#x27;s just a little annoying.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing ... I have very curly long hair and my daughter has thick wavy hair ... we both agree that this product ROCKS!  Love is such a strong word to use so we are in DEEP LIKE!  After using our hair is soft and straight.  It also gets the job done in less time.</li>
            <li> Had to return this product.  would not stay hot like its supposed to. I think its a new design in chi. THey are not as good as they used to be.</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my teenage daughter that has a lot of very long hair. Since she started straightening her hair, we&#x27;ve gone thru maybe 5 other straighteners.  Wish I&#x27;d bought her this one from the get go!</li>
            <li> I love this straightener! It works wonders on my hair! I have really naturally curly hair and it usually takes about an hour to straighten my hair, now it only takes abot 20-30 minutes! i find that my hair is less damaged and the chi is so easy to use.. I am sooo happy.  the supplier was also very prompt I recieved my order on the day that was expected and with no problems! thank you!</li>
            <li> By far, the best hair straightener I have purchased. I have spent so much time, money and effort searching for a straightener that delivers results. I can now say that I have found it. I bought the 2\\&quot; Turbo and it gets the job done on my course, naturally curly hair. One of my all time, favorite purchases. I never travel without it.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, and it produces excellent result in the hair.</li>
            <li> I have long, wavy/curly hair, and have tried cheap straighteners and blow drying my hair straight before, but never with satisfactory results. My hair would just end up poofy and crimpy. I love my 2\\&quot; Chi Turbo though, it heats super fast, and does a phenomenal job. My hair looks silky, and shiny, and pin-straight. My only concern is sometimes I have to restart my wall-jack because it won&#x27;t light up/turn on. It always ends up working though. Would def. recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, extremely curly hair and therefore cannot use just any flat iron on my hair (many just flatten it, they do not straighten the curls, and many leave my hair poofy). This is the most amazing flat iron I have ever used. It completely straightens my curls and leaves my hair soft, silky, and shiny. It also does not leave hair stiff (it is common to see some flat irons that leave the hair with no movement, which doesn&#x27;t look very healthy or natural). I highly recommend this to anybody, and especially suggest it to those who have had bad luck with flat irons or have found that they \\&quot;don&#x27;t work.\\&quot; This is 100% worth the price!</li>
            <li> I, like all these other people, have been using the $25 flat irons and felt like my hair was starting to get dry and burned.  So, I finally decided to try the Chi that everyone was talking about.  Wow! What a difference!  It literally glides through my hair, making it straight, shiny and healthy feeling.  I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments.  Truly, it&#x27;s a fabulous product and well worth the money (because I&#x27;m worth it!!) Do yourselves a favor and give yourself this great gift, you won&#x27;t be sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add-on Note today Sept 24, 2012: Just read the above review I wrote 5 years ago and I had to update it to let you know that 5 years later and I use this Flat Iron 3 times a week and it still works perfectly!!  I tried someone else&#x27;s Flat Iron and again I felt like it was burning my hair.  I&#x27;ll never use anything other than the CHI!</li>
            <li> i ordered a chi gf1539 full price then 4 months later the item for some reason stops working i did not ask for a return i asked for an exchange but the response from the seller was 90 days already passed from purchase time so basically brushed me off....now the box has a card for a 1 year manufacturer warranty i called the manufacturer and they said they cannot warranty the item because its an older unit not under warranty. so  basically this  Buzz Electronics store here on amazon is selling stuff as current year product but its not i have wasted 127 dollars due to bad service from buzz electronics...buyer beware.....quick to take your money but never reply to warranty questions..............</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron for my daughter for Christmas it worked for about 6 months and just one day wouldn&#x27;t turn on and seller would not replace</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend as a present and it was a great purchase.  It is larger than normal flattening irons and it gets really hot.  This means that she is happy with her hair and it takes her A LOT less time to get ready.    Great purchase, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The product was a gift and was received in a timely manner and appears to be working fine.  My concern is that there is no manufacturer&#x27;s warranty which I didn&#x27;t realize at the time of purchase.  I e-mailed my concern to Top Beauty who quickly responded that they are very clear about their 30 day warranty to which I agree. I just don&#x27;t understand why the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t warrant the flat iron unless it is not authentic or is a second.  I would have paid more for the product to get the manufacturer&#x27;s year warranty had I realized that it was not offered.  Top Beauty should make that fact as clear as they do about their 30 day warranty!!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this when I had a new style that needed a flat iron.  A friend let me borrow hers, which cost over $200.  I found this one on Amazon for under $100 and at first worried it wouldn&#x27;t be good enough, but after reading reviews, I gave it a try.   This iron heats up very quickly and gets really hot.  I use mid range heat setting and it flattens my frizzy, thick, wild hair in no time.  I highly recommend if looking for a high quality flat iron that really works well.</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever used.  I was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have had my 2\\&quot; Turbo for over 3 years now and it&#x27;s worked perfectly. I&#x27;ve traveled all over with it and have just thrown it in my bag numerous times and it&#x27;s lasted. The felt is worn but that&#x27;s all that is wrong with it.    That being said, I have been very lucky with my Chi. It seems to be a hit or a miss with them. Some work great from day 1 and last years, others fail miserably very shortly after purchase. My mother and sister both have had straighteners that have failed very shortly after the year warranty.     I think that Amazon has the best prices (i&#x27;m looking to get a new one for my little sister for Christmas) and is worth the risk ... just keep in mind there is a risk. Judging by the reviews, the defective products seem to make up a small minority. I will be contacting Amazon before my purchase though, to inquire about their return policy for this item. The cost might make it worth buying from here rather than in-store where they fulfill the year warranty but charge twice as much.</li>
            <li> This straightener worked wonderfully - for 8 months. Which is crazy for a flat iron I spent a good chunk of money on. CHI products are typically pretty reliable so I have to wonder what happened here. Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the 2-inch size. I thought I would prefer it because it would be a faster process, however the handling was difficult and awkward.</li>
            <li> The product appeard to be made cheap. The product was priced high for the lack of quality. Not sure if the product was refurbished or new.</li>
            <li> CHI flat irons are great but buyer beware...I have purchased three total in the last 3 years and only one of them (an ichi purchased through jcpenney salon) has lasted beyond a year.  This one lasted 60 days before just inexplicably failing to turn on. It is not a short in the wire, as Chi irons are sensitive to.  It just stopped turning on. That will be the last CHI I waste money on.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these straightners and they both are defective! They don&#x27;t get as hot as my other straigtner either, very unhappy.</li>
            <li> My wife loved this while it worked. It died after 1 1/2 years of use. That&#x27;s unacceptable to me for the price.</li>
            <li> I would give this product 3 1/2 stars if I could. I had this straightener for about 2 1/2 years before it stopped working. It worked amazing while it worked, but it always seemed cheaply made. This was my first Chi product and was surprised by the low quality of it. However, as I said it worked very well when it worked.</li>
            <li> Great IRON but it broke within MONTHS, I dont know if I got a defective model but I wasnt it expecting to break</li>
            <li> Broke after a few months of use. Too bulky. Probably not even the real chi brand.</li>
            <li> I got this straightener as a Christmas gift in 2007. The 2\\&quot; flat irons are hard to find. I use it at least 4 days a week and it straightens my thick, wavy hair incredibly fast and leaves it straight and shiny. Dropped it numerous times, once even cracked the plug and repaired with electrical tape. I suspect that the plug is shorted inside the straightener as it stopped turning on, but I also wrap the cord around to store it so most likely my fault. If this is a \\&quot;fake\\&quot; Chi or coated ceramic, then they definitely have me fooled. Tried to replace it but honestly nothing else compares!!</li>
            <li> My straightener stopped working all of a sudden (only after a few months), so I called Farouk Systems to see what could be done in regards to their warranty policy. I gave her the information on the box she asked for and she informed me that this product is counterfeit and not made by their company. I contacted this seller with my issue and they were SO compliant! I was upset and truly happy when I was issued a refund. They assured me this product is not a fake. Whether or not it is, this is a nice seller and I am happy I got so lucky in dealing with nice people.</li>
            <li> I was very upset with this product and seller. After about 3 months my straightener completely quit working. I mailed it to the Chi manufacturer that was on the insert that came with it. The company mailed it back to me saying it was a replica and not a genuine Chi. The seller would not contact me back. I am out $80 and all I have is a non working FAKE Chi straightener.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Chi Farouk 2\\&quot; flat iron for my daughter for Christmas. The flat iron did not work at all and one of the ceramic tiles was set crooked. I&#x27;m not sure how this item passed any inspection. Very poor craftsmanship. My daughter was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The on and off switch was on reverse and sometimes didn&#x27;t shut off unless I unplugged it. The unit didn&#x27;t close on hair completely causing alot of hair pulling. I returned it.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Chi\\&quot; iron failed to work after about 6-7 months, so I followed the CHI process to ship for a replacement under the CHI warranty. CHI just shared with me that this device is a FAKE.  I will not ever attempt to buy online a CHI product again - the best direction is to go to one of their authorized dealers.  Hope this helps someone prevent making the same mistake that I made.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my wife who used it for several years before passing it down to our daughter.  It still works as if it was brand new with equal heat distribution.</li>
            <li> I love my CHI!  My hair is so thick and curly, but it only takes about 45 mintues to do all of it.  It straightens so fast and humidity doesn&#x27;t even make it frizzy or anything.  The only thing that bothers me is sometimes the setting button will move while I&#x27;m straightening and it&#x27;ll have to heat up again.  Other than that, totally worth the money!</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and has a bit of a natural wave to it or more like it become poofy when dried.  I had a different 2 Inch Flat Iron prior to purchasing the Farouk CHI and it usually takes me over an hour to do my entire head because my hair is so long.  With this product, it took me less than 20 minutes!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for almost a year now.  I have very thick, frizzy, hair and have spent my life getting it relaxed every six months, and blowing drying it straight.  I&#x27;ve never used a straight iron because they could never handle my hair.  But with this one, I have not needed a blow dryer since I got it!  Now my hair is straighter than it has ever been in my life, which I thought I would never see.  Of course this makes it very straight so I can&#x27;t get any shape or curls from it(which is what I was going for). Cut my drying time by almost 2 hours (as long as I apply some protective serum on when still wet).  Great product and still going strong.</li>
            <li> I have had this for 7 years and it still works and has the same results as when I purchased it in 2005 great product hair is very healthy. It hasn&#x27;t damaged it yet</li>
            <li> After reading reviews and watching some videos i decided to invest in an expensive Flat Iron. My CHI Turbo flat iron was broken when i received it. I think some electronic component was broken inside and i could hear it when i shook the flat iron. Since i was traveling abroad when i got my CHI, i didn&#x27;t have time to return it or contact the seller. I gave it a try and used it. It worked alright first time. While i was using it second time i saw flames and was terrified that either i will get a shock or burn my hair. Luckily nothing happened and i stopped using it. Maybe this product is good (i have done enough research on this product and it has good reviews), but i was unlucky and got a bad one. I think the seller didn&#x27;t send me a good one and also the packaging was not like my other Amazon orders. It was wrapped up in a brown paper with a regular print out of my order. I had my CERAMIC 1 INCH FLAT IRON as a back up and i would highly recommend it which is just 50$.</li>
            <li> It is a great product, works better than any other I have used before. If you have the money, go for it!</li>
            <li> I have very thick and long hair (half black half a of other stuff) and NO PRODUCT has allowed me to straighten my hair a well as this one... and in HALF the time.  Ever since I started using it, I&#x27;ve been constantly asked if I received that Japanese straightener perm treatment.  Nope.  No perm.  Just Farouk Chi&#x27;s flat iron!  Note:  My hair is 3/4 down my back.  If you have hair shorter than right below your shoulders, you should probably get the smaller iron- the 2\\&quot; is so big that you won&#x27;t be able to grab pieces of hair.  It&#x27;s a lot of money for a flat iron but WELL WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> I started off with having always cheap straighten irons, and I was always so disappointed that I could not finish my  hair like my hairdresser did it. I have real frizzy and wavy hair, and I gave up my long hair last  year since I did not know how to handle it.  So I cut my hair, which was really hurtful, and finally ended up buying this chi straightener, and I am totally amazed, how pretty my hair can look. And how easy it is! This is the best product I ever bought for my hair, and it is worth every cent of it!</li>
            <li> My Wife liked this Hair Straightener. She tried some of her friends expensive one too and says she really liked this one.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this flat iron!  It works well on my naturally curly hair.  It warms up fast too!</li>
            <li> This iron heats up quickly and gets very hot.  It used to take a long time to straighten my hair, but not with this iron!</li>
            <li> CHI was recommended to me by a friend....and she was right.  This is much better than the other brands.</li>
            <li> I have been straightening my hair for about 15 years and have tried many different flat irons. I am african american and my hair is about 4 inches away from being to my waist. I got this iten yesterday, flat ironed my hair today and it looks just like it looks when I leave the shop. I have very curly thick hair and have never been able to get it as flat as the shop does. The problem with the shop is, they charge me extra becuase my hair is so long. This is worth every penny, and it will save me so much money. The last ceramic flat iron I bought pulled and snagged my hair, this was so smooth. amazon offered a great price, the retail store by my house had it priced twice a much.</li>
            <li> I have tried many hair straighteners. Non of them worked as well as this one to straighten the hair. I am glad I bought it. The protection on the sides helps prevent accidental burns. It heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li> love it for the price.  not as good as the 1\\&quot; original chi i purchased from a salon - but i needed a larger one and this does the job @ a great price.</li>
            <li> The straightener works really well, my hair was pin straight.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s amazing results only last for as long as the product does and for me this was about 2.5 weeks.  In my opinion it&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Bought as a Christmas present for wife. She used it the first time and it quit working halfway through. Half her head was straight as a board, the other half curly as hell, which resulted in me having to go to walmart at midnight to buy one for her to finish with. Amazon replaced it with a new one shipped over night; I had it the next day before lunch. Very impressed with Amazons customer service! The replacement is working fine now.</li>
            <li> I love this straightener, however, I would not advise buying the Turbo.  Why?  CHI continually has problems with the cord connection. Sometimes it stays on, sometimes not.  I am continually frustrated with making sure I hold the iron in a certain spot so that it heats up quickly.  The regular CHI does not have this problem.  I&#x27;ve had 3 Turbos and all did the same thing.  However, when the red light stays on, it&#x27;s a great iron.</li>
            <li> I did not use the Chi Iron. When I received it I realized how big it is, a bit hard to hold for a long time and hard to maneuver too because of its size, so I returned it same day. And THANKS to Amazon.com, the return process was so easy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item in feb 2009 for over $125 US Dollars. It was recommended highly by my cousin and when she purchased hers a few months before me, I used it and was quite impressed.  It worked great. When i visited my cousin in New Jersey in May this year, her Flat Iron just wasnt coming on after plugging it in which was strange because it worked perfectly fine the day before and days before that. Had no problems at all. However, 2 days ago, after using my own the day before that, I plugged in my Chi Flat Iron only to realsie the exact same thing happened to me. I live in Trinidad, West Indies. I am very disappointed because its like it has a lifespan of about just over 2 years. This is CRAZY. WHAT SHOULD I DO... IM TOLD THIS HAS LIFETIME WARRANTY!!! [[ASIN:B0009V1YS2 Farouk CHI GF1539 Turbo Big 2 Inch Ceramic Flat Iron Hair Straightener]]</li>
            <li> I owned a 2 inch Chi (the exact same one) for 6 years. It lasted me so long and I loved it!  I even convinced about 10 of my friends to buy one.  Now 6 years later when mine stopped working I had to order a new one.  I am not sure if they produce these irons in bulk but the materials used on the iron I received was poor.  Holding the two next to each other and playing with then you can tell the difference immediately.  It feels like it was cheaply made and not as solid. It also did not get as hot as my old one did.  I used to love the CHI but i am not sure what they are doing with their production now 6 years later.  I had to send it back.  I now have moved onto a GHD 2inch and seem to like it so far.  I wish I liked the CHI I got but it just was not the same as my old one. :-(</li>
            <li> And it still works pretty well. I had no idea what this cost... my grandma spent too much on me &gt;&amp;lt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted I don&#x27;t use it every day. Doesn&#x27;t over dry my hair and is really quick.</li>
            <li> I purchased this straightner last dec for my 21 year old daughter. We have used chi products for years, so we are familiar with the brand. Bought this with the idea it would last for years as chi typically does. within 7 months my daughter called and said the plates were sliding off the handle and glue was everywhere. Of course she didnt keep the box,and looking at the website it was too late for return per policy. I was excited to get such a great deal, but im thinking this was not a chi product, but a knock off. $120, is alot to spend on a straightner that only lasted months and not used regular.</li>
            <li> Works great !  It heats up better than the small one. If you have long hair, it will cut the styling time in half.</li>
            <li> Do NOT buy from &#x27;&#x27;Ideal Beauty Store Storefront&#x27;&#x27; this person is selling FAKE/REPLICAS. When I received my iron yesterday I noticed that the iron turns on when you put it on &#x27;&#x27;OFF&#x27;&#x27; &amp; off when you put it on &#x27;&#x27;ON&#x27;&#x27;. When it heats up it has a very weird smell and doersn&#x27;t heat up as much as it&#x27;s supposed to! The CHI logo is also a little faded!! I used to own one of these about a year ago &amp; my friend owns one too. I know that CHI would make sure that their product is in good condition before sending to a store to sell. I got lucky that I will be able to return my iron after contacting amazon customer service.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the Chi came broken and because it wouldn&#x27;t close completely.  The supplier was great and I was able return the item for a full credit.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron and I highly recommend it.  After trying various other less expensive brands for years, and them not working so great or taking forever to do the job,I decided to buy the chi after my sister in law, who has super curly hair recommended it.  After just one press your hair is STRAIGHT!!  You can do your hair so quickly and easily.  I know it&#x27;s a bit pricey, but well worth the money for all the time you will save and how gorgeous and shiny your hair will look!</li>
            <li> BUYER BEWARE!!!  DO NOT TRUST THIS SELLER!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;This is the second Chi hair straightener that I have owned.  The first one came from a local hair salon and was fantastic for about 6 years.  This one was quite the opposite. I had some trouble from the beginning. It worked about 2 out of 5 times. sometimes it would not even go on. I contacted the seller and was told that I could return it and get a refund but when they get it back and they test its operation I will be charged a hefty restocking fee if it works.  I decided to keep it because I didn&#x27;t want to take a chance losing any money.  It continued to work intermittently for several months till about 7 months in.  Now it will not work at all.  The seller will not stand behind the product and the manufacturer will not either.  THIS IS BECAUSE IT IS NOT AUTHENTIC.  IT IS A FAKE. AND THIS SELLER IS FRAUDULENTLY SELLING A PRODUCT THAT IS FAKE BECAUSE THEY ARE  NOT AUTHORIZED TO SELL THE REAL THING. I have contacted AMAZON to get help and so far there has been no resolution.  I will continue to try to get resolution from this seller but SINCE THEY ARE A COMPLETE FRAUD I DOUBT THEY WILL COOPERATE.</li>
            <li> my wife loves her chi flat iron. It takes half the time for her to do her hair now. That is amazing to me</li>
            <li> Got it for my girlfriend and she absolutely loves it! I could not be happier with the purchase that I made!</li>
            <li> It gets hot but doesn&#x27;t straighten my lhair easily.My 1 inch that cost me $40 works better. I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and we were both very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This Flat Iron makes the impossible... My hair to be straight. I don&#x27;t use it very much, but the few times I did, it was amazing. I have very thick curly hair and the 2&amp;#34; wide blade saves a LOT of time.&lt;br /&gt;CHI is unbeatable!.</li>
            <li> I had exactly this model and was crushed when it died after 8 years of loyal service. I cannot say enough good things about this straightener, like I said I had the last one for a long time and used it very often, almost every day. Its also sturdy I threw it in and out of more suitcases and drawers than I can count and it truly stood the test of time. This is the only straighter I will ever buy.</li>
            <li> Hate hate hate!!!!! What I got must have been a knock off!!! Don&#x27;t buy! Never thought I would have gotten such crap. I had a chi that I got from a beauty supply and it was nothing like this crap of a tool. Not sure if its the manufacturer that ripped me off or chi company. My hair didn&#x27;t even get straight....my Walmart brand works better than these.</li>
            <li> I bought an older version of this chi straightners and it has been soooo good, that when one of my best friends told me she needed one. I knew I had to buy her a Chi. As professional women we don&#x27;t have much time in the morning so having a good straightner that can to the trick in the least amount of time it&#x27;s just what we need, and this Chi does that without burning the hair. My friend loves this new version I got for her, and if I ever had to replace mine, that has been with me since 2008 and still works like a charm I will go with this one, no need to think about it twice. And I would recommend one that qualifies for Amazon Prime, just because you want to have the support from Amazon directly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product before and it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same&lt;br /&gt;quality.  Heating plate doesn&#x27;t seem to be as strong...could it be&lt;br /&gt;defective??</li>
            <li> I have only used this a couple of times.  However, I have to say that this is the best flatiron that i have ever used.  I tried it when I first got it.  My hair was still curly since I did not dry it that day.  I went over the hair twice and it completely straightened it.  As soon as I tried it for real I just dried my hair quickly to get it dry without bothering to really straighten it first.  I then used the flatiron and it worked like a dream.  My hair was completely straight and silky smooth and it brought my flatiron time down from an hour to 15 minutes!  I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> It does not work as well as I had expected, especialy for the price you&#x27;re paying for this product.  You could probably find a cheaper one that works better.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair soft and heats up really fast! I have really thick hair and used to take four or five tries to get my hair straight but this is great! Good investment, I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My wife loved this gift - she has long curly hair and this iron got it smooth and silky</li>
            <li> My daughter is very pleased with the product.  She says it is the best hair straightener she has ever used.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these for my 17 yr. old granddaughter and now I&#x27;ve purchased two more for her sisters. With three teenagers getting ready at the same time, and fighting over this particular one, the other two are getting one for Christmas.  They love it!</li>
            <li> I have had this Chi for over 3 years now.  Works great, and I LOVE the results (and so does everyone else).  I have really long hair, so I never thought twice about getting the bigger size.  I will mention that it is difficult getting that top half-inch of your roots, but it&#x27;s a very minor problem.  I would definitely recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Excellent price offerred by Amazon for an Excellent product!! Stays hot and irons out my curly hair no problems!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using the CHI Turbo 2 inch flat iron.  I have long curly hair and it worked great.  But....it stopped working 4-5 months after I received it!  It doesn&#x27;t turn on.  With the amount of money that is spent for this flat iron, it should work more than 4 months!  Worse yet is their customer service fails to return messages.  Terrible company and product.  I am moving my business elsewhere and suggest you looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I love this iron!  I have long, thick hair.  One time over each section and I&#x27;m good to go.  Takes much less time than any other iron I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> I was not sure if a flat iron was worth this much money, but am completely satisfied with this one! The price on amazon is a great buy and I would definitely recommend buying this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great deal! It heats up fast, works great, never any problems. I&#x27;ve had it for a year, and I use it all the time. It makes my hair look so soft and shiney. Try using the CHI heat products to protect your hair.</li>
            <li> I have owned this flat iron for over 7 years.  I have had hair to my shoulders to 6\\&quot; below my shoulders while using it. So glad, I bought the 2\\&quot;.  Easy to use and difficult to burn yourself.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Received and had issues within a few months.  Sent it back to the manufacturer who stated this is not a Farouk model and therefore counterfeit and not covered by warranty.  This seller is pushing counterfeit goods knowingly or unknowingly.  The manufacturer told my wife how to check for knock offs.  Seller cleary did not do due diligence.  DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS SELLER!</li>
            <li> This Item is a FAKE Chi product. I have had the Chi Turbo 2&amp;#34; straightener from Ulta for 6+ years and before that I had another one. I can tell this product is a knock off for so many reasons.&lt;br /&gt;First the cord that plugs into the wall is about half the length of the standard Chi cord.&lt;br /&gt;Second, the font on the side that says CHI turbo is not even the same as Chi&#x27;s actual font.&lt;br /&gt;The red velvet on the outside is completely different, scratchy and not nice like the actual Chi’s is.&lt;br /&gt;The “on/off” switch is flipped and not in the correct direction it should be.&lt;br /&gt;And the power light does not flash in the same way that the Chi does when the product is warmed up.&lt;br /&gt;Besides all of those obvious signs this is a crappy piece of junk, the straightener doesn&#x27;t get hot at all, does nothing to my hair and does not work! They should be ashamed of themselves for ripping people off. BUYER BEWARE!</li>
            <li> Need I say more? I am addicted to this product as it keep my hair silky and soft. Thank you CHI</li>
            <li> This hair straightener never worked when plugged in. I took it to a reputable salon who informed me that this iron was not authentic, but was a \\&quot;knock-off\\&quot; version. I paid what a REAL CHI would cost!!</li>
            <li> My wife was asking for an expensive hair straigtener because the cheap one she purchased seems to stop working, or doesn&#x27;t work as well after a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I ordered this Farouk CHI hair straigtener, and when it arrived, it was in a very cheap package. The handles was made of real cheap recycle plastic, which my wife complains to me about it because I ordered it (my wife use to work in the plastic injection mold industry, so she always checks out the quality of the mold and plastic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair straigtener is not worth $100, it looks more like a $20-$30 product. The Revelon, Conair, etc.. for $20-30 looks more expensive then this \\&quot;professional\\&quot; straigthener. As far as how it function, my wife decided not to try it and I returned it back to Amazon. She choose to go to a store where she can look and feel the product before buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice is, if you know exactly what you&#x27;re getting, order it from Amazon. Otherwise, if you have no idea how it feels or looks, I would check it out in the stores first. Good luck.</li>
            <li> Beware! I had the original real version of this item that I had ordered from amazon 4 years ago. Mine stopped working a couple of weeks ago and I was looking to replace mine. Unfortunately the new one I ordered was a really bad replica! I plugged it in and it smelled horrid! The \\&quot;velvet\\&quot;, sides started melting off! It was a mess. I didn&#x27;t even bother using that on my hair. I immediately returned it for a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the other reviews on here after and found Chi makes a new version if this that is only availble from approved retailers. Save your money and track one of those down.</li>
            <li> Th handle was broken when I received the iron so I cannot give a review until I receive an unbroken product.</li>
            <li> I thought I was happy to find another 2 inch Chi Turbo flat iron to replace the original one I have owned for at least seven years.  BUT this one is not as heavy as the original, therefore, the paddles do not grab the hair as tightly. The paddles also move back and forth like they are loose. I am disappointed with it!  But since my hubby fixed the electrical cord on my original 2 inch Chi Turbo, I will keep this one as a back up.  I have extremely thick and fuzzy hair so must use a 2 inch flat iron to cut the straightening time in half.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Farouk chi Turbo 2 inch in 2006 and it is still going strong! I also own a Shedu straightener and have found the 1 inch straightener gives more flexibility to try different styling like curls. I recommend the turbo 2 inch for anyone with thick long hair. The 2 inch reduces the time it takes to straighten hair. The red fleece covering also helps protect hands from the heat.</li>
            <li> I had this Flat Iron in the past, until my daughter borrowed it, permanently.  I then bought a one inch and she eventually took that one, too. :) I&#x27;m ordering another one today and dare her to touch it!  We both have long relatively straight hair.  I prefer the 2 inch because of the heat control and it covers the length faster.  My daughter&#x27;s hair is thicker with more wave but she prefers the 2 inch for the same reason.  Nothing else compares to this Flat Iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5-22-13 update to my review.  This flat iron has been a big disappointment.  It doesn&#x27;t have the heat my first one had.  The hinge on the clamp is not as tight either.  Apparently the CHI flat irons sold on Amazon are not up to standards.  Another reviewer noted they do not warranty them when purchased through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Any more CHI&#x27;s will be purchased at a beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> my wife love this iron, amazing price, excellent item and excellent quality,&lt;br /&gt;on 2 inch this the best brand...&lt;br /&gt;Amazing</li>
            <li> Have one like this for years and it just wore out from use.  Best price I have found.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Works great. Can&#x27;t think of anything else to write.  It keeps my hair straight until I was it again. !</li>
            <li> this is my 3rd chi straightener and my 2nd turbo (my first one was a 1 inch). i ordered this to replace my regular chi straightener which had died after daily use for 3 years. my first chi turbo, which i have had since 2007, still works but it takes a little bit longer since the plates don&#x27;t get as hot -- this long life expectancy is why i chose to get a 2 inch turbo. it works great, heats up really quickly, and i can completely straighten my long hair in much less than 10 minutes. i drop it all the time too, and have gotten it wet by leaving it around my sink, and it STILL works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron. I have had it for 2 1/2 years and it died today. I would definitely buy it again. If you don&#x27;t plan on using it a lot I wouldn&#x27;t invest that much</li>
            <li> I must say that this is the worst iron I ever.It hasn&#x27;t been a year yet and the protective cover came off and the plug cracked.I&#x27;m sorry I ever bought this stupid iron just a waste of money.......Warning don&#x27;t buy anything from a company on here called Yellow Deals they will send you junk products and take your money and they have nerves to not respond to your emails they are a piece of trash company so be warned......</li>
            <li> I have this flatiron and I gave this one as Christmas gift.  The recipient couldn&#x27;t be happier-she loves it.  I recommend this flatiron to everyone.</li>
            <li> Unforunately I recently bought this Flat iron. It seemed fishy to me so I contacted the Chi company directly. They do not make this brand and so this is a fake product. I certainly didn&#x27;t pay 100$ for a fake brand. In the process of getting it returned. Thanks for letting us know it&#x27;s real or not</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron only after it was sold out of stock by the company itself.  I only used it one time and all of the lettering vanished off of the flat iron.  In order to turn it ON, you had to turn it to the OFF button, which wasn&#x27;t the worst thing.  I would have kept it, but it didn&#x27;t heat up enough to straighten my hair.  My hair looked like Buckwheat from the Lil Rascals.  And so I said to myself this junk has got to go back.  Had I known that it was trying to pass as new but was actually refurbished I would have just kept it moving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one great thing about the whole experience is that I received a credit back to my account within 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Amazon and will continue to purchase products from them.  Some times inconveniences just happen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this  product. I have been using a .Chi flat iron for the past 10 yrs. I ordered this one, only because I felt that my flat iron would probably need to be replaced soon.  I tried using the new one yesterday, and it did not work as well as my old one. I would like to return it, as it seems to be defective.</li>
            <li> I got sent a defective product. It works, but not as well as my last Chi (supposedly the same product) and when I set it to &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; it is on, and when it&#x27;s &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; it&#x27;s off.</li>
            <li> Bought it new. Turned on once and heated up quick and then never turned on again. Very disappointing. Used a cheaper Chi and loved it but not this one.</li>
            <li> I had the same straightener -worked great for 5 years, found this one online and it was nothing like the original one, it barely lasted 5 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a teacher so spending over $150 on a hair straightener was a lot for me. It does leave my hair silky smooth and it doesn&#x27;t leave a burning smell in my hair. However, it definitely doesn&#x27;t get that hot so it takes me longer than usual to straighten my hair.  I feel like with today&#x27;s technology and spending so much money on it, it should get a little hotter. Shoot, for over $150, it should straighten my hair and turn it into 18k gold! Not quite worth the money. My $20 Conair straightener didl as well in half the time.</li>
