            <li> These extensions were super thin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other extensions similar to these, and have treated them in the same manner.</li>
            <li> A complete waste of money</li>
            <li> Had to cut it due to being too long, but because so inexpensive that didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> I have spent 1000s $$ on extentions</li>
            <li> Not real, I tried to dye them and they didn&#x27;t take any color and putting heat on them is like putting heat on plastic.</li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s 100% human hair</li>
            <li> SPENT ON EXTENTIONS!</li>
            <li> They are thinner than other ones I have had</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;ash&amp;#34; color is a dark brown.....</li>
            <li> not worth it.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair &amp; just wanted to use these for the look of highlights.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> You can feel the slickness of the plastic hair and see the very noticeable fake sheen on the hair.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.... but fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The hair was nothing that i had expected, it was very thin and stringy, and nk where near being 18inches.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money...</li>
            <li> Only negative is they are VERY THIN</li>
            <li> They are a little thin</li>
            <li> Seriously, nobody has hair that thin.</li>
            <li> but if you have thick hair, order two sets!</li>
            <li> I waiting forever for these to come and when they came i was disapointed real thin clips dont want to clip down not t</li>
            <li> they are not a very good exstenstion they almost feel fake i dont like them at all</li>
            <li> Too thin</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve seen worse).  </li>
            <li> but I have thin hair</li>
            <li> These extensions are extremely thin and scraggly-looking.  </li>
            <li> Thin feels fake</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in the hair, especially since i work at a hair salon.</li>
            <li> It is so fake looking</li>
            <li> Look and feels fake.</li>
            <li> ill paint them darker.</li>
            <li> They shed a ton, and the hair breaks like crazy.</li>
            <li> These are fake hair!</li>
            <li> these are really thin and bad quality!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t curl and looks very fake.</li>

            <li> Quality of hair is tops and the color perfect match for my hair.  Had to cut it due to being too long, but because so inexpensive that didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;ash&amp;#34; color is a dark brown.....</li>
            <li> Easy to wear, matched my hair color perfectly! I loved them!</li>
            <li> Very thin...can&#x27;t even be applied to one row...not worth it. I could have gone in the store and bought a pack of human hair</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this. Too thin</li>
            <li> I like it! I would definitely buy this product again!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to all my friends that like to do extensions.</li>
            <li> Quality was great. I&#x27;ve bought a lot of extensions from many online stores spending over $100 each set. And the quality of these were just as great. And it blended perfectly with my out hair. I am on a budget with school payments and needed some extra umph For my nursing school graduation with my hair  being shoulder length and that&#x27;s exactly what I got. These were a steal! Highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t worn these yet but I did curl them to match my hair and they look so good. The color matched perfect and there is enough hair. I do not think they are 100% real human hair. It&#x27;s probably a synthetic blend.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted...thanks!</li>
            <li> It is very good and very easy to put it on your hair. I always pay a lot to hair stylist to add several with glue, and I have to make an appointment&lt;br /&gt;To do it. This one in case of emergency at home in five minutes.</li>
            <li> The brown is very red.</li>
            <li> The hair was pretty good (I&#x27;ve seen worse).  Not sure it&#x27;s 100% human hair (it may be) but didn&#x27;t curl with a curling iron the way human hair would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair was a good match color-wise</li>
            <li> I would more than likely reccoment this product. It shipped early. The color is perfect. The length &amp; lifetime of the extensions is high</li>
            <li> These extensions were super thin. I can&#x27;t even use them in my hair. They look like crap. Seriously, nobody has hair that thin. Nobody.</li>
            <li> Love it, color was perfect! Works great with heat iron and curling iron.</li>
            <li> Very good quality curls easily love them 5*</li>
            <li> I like that it has multiple highlights and blends well with my own hair color. I have very fine hair, so to find a product that  I can pass as my own is nice.</li>
            <li> I opened this and laughed. It is so fake looking I gave it to my niece to play with. A complete waste of money</li>
            <li> I have spent 1000s $$ on extentions these are a perfect match! Great quality BEST MONEY IVE EVER SPENT ON EXTENTIONS!</li>
            <li> does not give volume to my hair at all. And the clip ons are not as descrete as I would like them to be</li>
            <li> Hair looks nice but is not human hair. Doesn&#x27;t curl and looks very fake. I ordered the ash brown and blonde mix and it was more like red and blonde mixed. Overall not too happy. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> Thin feels fake&lt;br /&gt;Not like Sallys human hair&lt;br /&gt;Feels looks like horse hair&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m Mexican and kind of looks like fake clip on</li>
            <li> Omg! Luv these! They feel real. Have not tried w/curling iron yet. I have dark brown hair &amp; just wanted to use these for the look of highlights. They are perfect for me. Only negative is they are VERY THIN so would NOT recommend if trying to add length to short hair.</li>
            <li> they are not a very good exstenstion they almost feel fake i dont like them at all</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Great quality. And same exact color as my hair. I&#x27;m very very happy with the out come. I would deff recommend this to all my friends that use extensions ! Will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Love the color.definitely will buy more!! Thanks</li>
            <li> OMG the color matches PERFECT!! I am a cosmetologist and this is the first time I have ordered extensions and not had to color them before I could use them! They are thinner than other ones I have had but I have thin hair so they match amazingly! No one noticed I had them in at all!! Very awesome price!</li>
            <li> I waiting forever for these to come and when they came i was disapointed real thin clips dont want to clip down not t</li>
            <li> Hair matches PERFECTLY, however it is very thin.  The 70g is not even nearly enough for my head so I just ordered another 70g in hopes that will help give me more volume.  I wish they offered 120g, so I wouldn&#x27;t have to use 14 pieces... I may have to sew them all (14) together myself to make it 7 pieces to get the volume I want.  But for price, i&#x27;m satisfied....mainly because it matches my hair color identically.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Dont buy\\&quot;. Dont waste your money...these are really thin and bad quality! I even find some of the hair is shedding. On the positive side, they did match my hair color.</li>
            <li> These are fake hair! Not real, I tried to dye them and they didn&#x27;t take any color and putting heat on them is like putting heat on plastic.</li>
            <li> there is no way that these come close to 70 g,,they are so freakin thin you better order 4 bundles jusyt to get to a normal pack like you would get at a beauty suppy store,,come on folks have a little pride with people that want to be your loyal customers,,if you have a good quality product,,this is not</li>
            <li> These extensions are extremely thin and scraggly-looking.  Not worth it. The color, however, matched my hair perfectly, so its unfortunate that the quality is so poor.</li>
            <li> Took forever to come in. Look and feels fake. You can feel the slickness of the plastic hair and see the very noticeable fake sheen on the hair. They do fit my color exactly and also the description and color posted. I bought two sets and only needed one. They&#x27;re pretty heavy but look nice when in. They do shed a little and tangle easily.</li>
            <li> These actually melted to my iron the one and only time i used them.</li>
            <li> These worked great !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with these but if you have thick hair, order two sets!</li>
            <li> OMG i look so great in them my hair is dark brown and it looks real well on me... the roots show alittle though but its ok. ill paint them darker. love it thank you</li>
            <li> Package looked opened, hair was cut shorter than 18&amp;#34; and had been curled.  (Maybe from someone else that had ordered and sent back - then I got it???)  And yes, as mentioned by someone else, very very thin.&lt;br /&gt;However, color matched perfectly and was delivered on time.</li>
            <li> THEY SAID IT WOULD BE A MONTH BEFORE I GOT THEM AND THEY CAME IN ABOUT 1 WEEK.  THE COLORS ARE EXACTLY AS SHOWN ON THE WEBSITE.  VERY HAPPY!</li>
            <li> The hair was nothing that i had expected, it was very thin and stringy, and nk where near being 18inches. I was very disappointed in the hair, especially since i work at a hair salon. Very poor quality.... but fast shipping.</li>
            <li> no parece ke sea cabel</li>
            <li> This is my third pack! I love these extensions!! They are a little thin so I wear two packs to do a full head!</li>
            <li> NOT 100% human hair. When dyed, a lot of the stands stayed white/ blonde. They shed a ton, and the hair breaks like crazy. I&#x27;ve had other extensions similar to these, and have treated them in the same manner. Although I treat all my extensions the same, and with good care, these just don&#x27;t hold a candle. I do not recommend these, and I would not buy them again.</li>
