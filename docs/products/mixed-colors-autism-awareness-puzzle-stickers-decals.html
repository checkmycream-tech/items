            <li> Very Nice. smaller than I thought, but good for the price.  Proud to be able to represent Autism Awareness.</li>
            <li> Happy w/ my purchase!</li>
            <li> my friends love my nails for autism awareness mouth and there was plenty for all of April.</li>
            <li> I love how they spread the awareness of autism!! I have  a problem with the stickers they are very small and they easily break.</li>
            <li> Kind of disappointed because the stickers didn&#x27;t even last for a week, especially with a clear coat on top of them.</li>
            <li> These stickers are cute nail art with a message. They are small so tricky to apply (use tweezers). The edges also peel after only a few days of normal life. I clear-coated over them to help protect them but they still peel. Maybe another layer or two would have been better. Ok product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for a friend whose child has autism. She was delighted. I thought they were a cute way to spread awareness.</li>
            <li> They were perfect for Autism Awareness Day/Month.</li>
            <li> These puzzles are so small and fragile that they will easily fold when taking off of the clear strip they come on. Also, you can only wear them for a short period of time because once you begin washing your hands they will un-glue.</li>
            <li> Great I team fast shipping. my grandson autistic. I took the stickers to my nail place and everyone loves them they&#x27;re thinking about ordering them in putting them in their salon easy to use fabulous product</li>
            <li> I love these! Everyone who seen my nails love them as well. i am looking to buy lots more. I have them for my two kids whom i love very much.</li>
            <li> Cute but Don&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li> I love these. Just take them to my nail salon and they put them on. Very great and at the right price</li>
            <li> I used this product under my salon gel nails and they look fantastic and stay great!  You get enough to do a few manicures worth if you only use them on one or two nails.  I will be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> Kind of difficult to put on</li>
            <li> The right size sticker for nails. I love them. Perfect for supporting Autism Awareness. Everyone love them. I recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> These are very cute once they are on and they stayed on no problem but they were a little difficult to apply alone.  I recommend having someone to help you apply them.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> They are so tiny!! The picture makes them larger than the actual ones.  Maybe you should say the image is enlarged to show how distinctive the shapes are.  I got my nail tech to make large ones to be seen &amp; she put little gems in them. Oh I used them by having the ladies to used them to post on our pages...an up close pic of the hands...</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. Always happy with amazon.</li>
            <li> very hard to put on but i love them would buy again</li>
            <li> Love these decals!!! Easy to use and stay on great when applying a good top coat over them. I have ordered several sets of these over the past year and have received many compliments on how great they look. A fabulous and fun way to spread Autism Awareness!</li>
