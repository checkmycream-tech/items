    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Best scrunchie ever had .</li>
            <li>Awesome.</li>
            <li>I was really happy to find them on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>I keep buying these because they are just great.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s 6 times, which doesn&#x27;t even look that good, maybe I just need to throw them</li>
            <li>Price was good.</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>to be honest</li>
            <li>These also are just the perfect size, and are very soft and interesting with the pattern of the fabric.</li>
            <li>I do agree with another reviewer and wish there were more colors</li>
            <li>but they work well which matters more.</li>
            <li>are my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Glide smoothly love it</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for, and these are just okay, not horrible, but</li>
            <li>just okay.</li>
            <li>These were okay.</li>
            <li>I gave away most of them as a gift, but I did kept one or two for myself.</li>
            <li>I purchased them for a trip and will be buying more soon.</li>
            <li>The colors are okay, wish they would come out with even more selection of colors.</li>
            <li>Pull apart easily.  </li>
            <li>These are sweet very comfortable scrunchies in fun colors.</li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>These are very soft and look nice.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I would buy them again, but they are not bad.</li>
            <li>They are washable, they don&#x27;t fall apart, they don&#x27;t pull on the hair, and the elastic doesn&#x27;t wear out quickly.</li>
            <li>I like the colors (I might not use the pink, but other 4 neutral colors are great) and price was quite good when I bought these (but it&#x27;s gone up).</li>
            <li>I definitely want more of these scrunchies!</li>
            <li>Pretty and Practical!  </li>
            <li>I have tried to find something like that without any success.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad to accept the snaggy quality because these are much more dressy than average ties or scrunchies.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased these in the past and they were great.</li>
            <li>The price was very good compared to other sellers, and the scrunchies look nice, but they stretch out so much after just a few uses that they don&#x27;t really hold a ponytail.</li>
            <li>I sighed with relief when I slipped one of these on my hair for the first time.</li>
            <li>I give them 4 stars because the &#x27;frilliness&#x27; that makes them attractive and dressy also makes them a bit delicate.</li>
            <li>These seemed very large, too large to use as pony tail holders for my thing hair.</li>
            <li>Very flimsy.  </li>
            <li>Really like the lacy look of these and the colors.</li>
            <li>so much better for my black hair than the elastic hair pieces.  </li>
            <li>These are the closet, and they are much prettier than the sausage-like shape of my old ones.</li>
            <li>Wish they had a few more colors in the pack.</li>
            <li>I have long but thin hair and when used over a hair tie, I only have to twist this over once (doubled over) -- which makes for a very attractive</li>
            <li>i bought a set over a year ago and am just now needing to replace them, and i use them pretty much daily.  </li>
            <li>the two i have left still work, but after almost daily use they have simply seen better days.  </li>
            <li>They are pretty and all, but after several usage, they will lose their elasticity</li>
            <li>multiple tiny bands of elastic hidden by soft decorative looping make this scrunchy fit snug and comfortably.</li>
            <li>Great colors and highly recommend especially for thin hair!</li>
            <li>These are so soft and comfy...</li>
            <li>Might be good for small children, but not perhaps for adult heavy hair.</li>
            <li>only use left for them is purely decorative while using a stronger elastic underneath.</li>
            <li>I first used them I had to twist the scrunchie about 3-4 times for my daughter&#x27;s ponytail - versus 2 times of other ponytail holders.</li>
            <li>I have thin waist length hair and these hold a pony for me all day, stay secure and no damage to m hair!</li>

            <li> I have very long, heavy hair. I had two old scrunchies made of something like terry cloth and they were the only ones that didn&#x27;t hurt me by being a tad too tight. The two war horses finally stretched out and are almost useless. I have tried to find something like that without any success. These are the closet, and they are much prettier than the sausage-like shape of my old ones. I sighed with relief when I slipped one of these on my hair for the first time. My pony tail is neatly pulled back without my scalp feeling like it&#x27;s being pinched!</li>

            <li> like several other reviewers, i have long, thick hair and cant find much that i dont either end up stretching out or breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; i bought a set over a year ago and am just now needing to replace them, and i use them pretty much daily.  I cant find anything else that can handle my hair so well.  to be honest the two i have left still work, but after almost daily use they have simply seen better days.  I do agree with another reviewer and wish there were more colors but they work well which matters more.</li>

            <li> These are so soft and comfy...so much better for my black hair than the elastic hair pieces.  I definitely want more of these scrunchies!</li>
            <li> These are very soft and look nice. Wish they had a few more colors in the pack. Price was good.</li>
            <li> I have had these before but could no longer find them locally.  I was really happy to find them on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;They are my favorite.  I have really thick hair and the others I have tried are too tight.</li>

            <li> The affordability along with the comfort of these scrunchies are the reason to buy! I like the versatile colors that match with anything!</li>
            <li> Goody products never disappoint.  These will do for ballet buns as well as face-washing. Can&#x27;t go wrong with the price.</li>
            <li> Best scrunchie ever had . Glide smoothly love it love it</li>
            <li> I have thin waist length hair and these hold a pony for me all day, stay secure and no damage to m hair! Great colors and highly recommend especially for thin hair!</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, and these are just okay, not horrible, but just okay. I don&#x27;t think I would buy them again, but they are not bad.</li>
            <li> Pretty and Practical!  Does what it is designed to do. . . keep your hair in place without damaging your hair.  Don&#x27;t let the 80&#x27;s vibe prevent you from buying these!</li>
            <li> Very flimsy.  Pull apart easily.  Poor quality</li>
            <li> These were okay. I gave away most of them as a gift, but I did kept one or two for myself. They are pretty and all, but after several usage, they will lose their elasticity (I think it&#x27;s &#x27;cause I have a lot of  hair though).</li>
            <li> Really like the lacy look of these and the colors. Good quality.</li>
            <li> multiple tiny bands of elastic hidden by soft decorative looping make this scrunchy fit snug and comfortably. i have mid-back length hair, and I only have to wrap it around once and it holds my hair in place.</li>
            <li> Awesome. This product does not pull your hair. I purchased them for a trip and will be buying more soon.</li>
            <li> These also are just the perfect size, and are very soft and interesting with the pattern of the fabric. Worth the price!</li>
            <li> received compliments with these</li>
            <li> I keep buying these because they are just great. They are washable, they don&#x27;t fall apart, they don&#x27;t pull on the hair, and the elastic doesn&#x27;t wear out quickly. The colors are okay, wish they would come out with even more selection of colors.</li>
