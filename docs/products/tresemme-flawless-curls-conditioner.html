            <li>Kept the hold of styles I would do, I really enjoy this product and plan on buying it again :)</li>
            <li>and it seemed that my hair would fall out easily?</li>
            <li>I wished it would have smoothed out my hair so that I could comb through it easily.</li>
            <li>-light</li>
            <li>use daily without buildup  -great</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic and takes a lot of the frizz out of my curls leaving them curly and manageable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only product I use and trust to give me my perfect natural curls!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair a lot less frizzy and it smells so good!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have a closet full of hair products.  </li>
            <li>I use a styling creme on top of it, and my very fine, dry, curly hair is almost frizz-free.</li>
            <li>Healthy, shiny, soft hair!</li>
            <li>but it is totally worth it.  </li>
            <li>I must say that my curls feel amazingly soft and bouncy :)  </li>
            <li>It is really a terrific product that does not weigh my hair down but gives it control and keeps it from being so fly away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy with wavy to curly hair as it gets longer and this has been the best product I can find to style my hair without it getting hard and crunchy and keeping my hair from getting overly dry and frizzly.</li>
            <li>I have fine curly hair and when I recently started bleaching it, nothing worked to keep it manageable, until I tried this TRESemme product.</li>
            <li>It helps my hair so much when I need something to help awake</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I used too much product?</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and delivery, and very well packaged.  </li>
            <li>Buying it in bulk off Amazon is much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This is the only product I have found that works effectively to soften the long ringlet curls.</li>
            <li>have wavy hair, not curly, and most products like gel and mousse make it crunchy and weight it down.</li>
            <li>So more deep conditioning and hydration are essential.</li>
            <li>and I have the most difficult time finding a product for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my HG hair product and cannot live without it.  </li>
            <li>Soft curls!</li>
            <li>I love how it keeps my hair soft and smooth and doesn&#x27;t make it all sticky and icky like all the other products I&#x27;ve tried before this.  </li>
            <li>, I also tried the Olive oil root stimulator cream and at first it was awesome but at the end of the day, again my hair was really dry :(</li>
            <li>I was looking for hydration for my natural curls and found this product.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t use anything else on my natural curls.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use much so this last pack of 6 I purchased has lasted over 2 years now.</li>
            <li>Nothing compares to it as far as I&#x27;m concern and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li>Curls are really soft.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately it left my curls very lifeless.</li>
            <li>Lightweight on your hair, and your hair moves naturally.</li>
            <li>She has very fine curly hair and this product adds body and managability to otherwise thin and frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>The reviews swayed my decision and I&#x27;m so glad I took the plunge especially since it&#x27;s so hard to find.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great for everyday use, I use a pump and a half for long hair and then naturally dry</li>
            <li>Definitely test this product out if you looking for touchable, soft curls!</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t \\&quot;love it\\&quot; was because i had some trouble detangleling my hair while wet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been backing off of hot tools because the Texas heatwave has dried and fried my hair enough.</li>

            <li> It will get stiff if you use to much.</li>
            <li> have a hard time finding it in stores, and when I do it&#x27;s usually five bucks or more.</li>
            <li> those curly q&#x27;s up from being so dry especially from the heat</li>
            <li> but it left it way too dry</li>
            <li> The curls bounce up just as well as with any curling gel, but they are far softer and less loaded with sticky product.</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t dry crunchy, is featherlight, and holds waves and curls without frizz for an entire day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Be careful when you buys this, as it is currently much more expensive than when I purchased the pack of 6.</li>
            <li> It works as well as more expensive brands and maintains my curl and leaves my hair looking less frizzy.</li>
            <li> but I always seem to come back to this after trying other products.</li>
            <li> and I can even use it on dry hair.  </li>
            <li> and I have noticed that I have not received a single compliment since I was out.  </li>
            <li> Apply liberally to wet hair and let air dry.</li>
            <li> it seems to weigh my hair down and it becomes flat compared to if I didn&#x27;t have product in my hair.</li>
            <li> The delivery was speedy, the package was undamaged, and the goods work just as I expected to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent time and money with no success until I tried this TRESemme Hydration Lotion.  </li>
            <li> I only need about 3 pumps after a shower and I have hair just past my shoulder.  </li>
            <li> Everyone has different needs to style their curly hair, so I have discovered that it is difficult to use other reviews to use on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I add Gene Juarez Curl Creme to my ends for the small amount of stickiness that I need.  </li>
            <li> , I looked in quite a few! -</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s difficult for me to find a product that actually moisturizes without buildup.</li>
            <li> I have crazy unruly dry bushy curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I was frustrated when I couldn&#x27;t find it anymore in my local stores - and believe me</li>
            <li> I have thin curly/wavy hair</li>
            <li> Seriously!  </li>
            <li> I live in Texas so the humidity is awful for frizz.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect</li>
            <li> and I was afraid it had been removed from the TRESemme line.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is some good stuff.  I have crazy unruly dry bushy curly hair.  After the shower, put this in and My hair looks nice and tame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased pantene&#x27;s curl gel to compare the two.  Will see which one fairs best once it arrives tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Invest in Tresemme its good.  Tresemme curly hair conditioner is a excellent product as well.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a hair product since Keratase discontinued their moisture creme (nutri sculpt).  I&#x27;ve spent time and money with no success until I tried this TRESemme Hydration Lotion.  It&#x27;s perfect for my natural curly hair.  Everyone has different needs to style their curly hair, so I have discovered that it is difficult to use other reviews to use on my hair.  This is NOT sticky!  It does a nice job of moisturizing my hair.  I add Gene Juarez Curl Creme to my ends for the small amount of stickiness that I need.  Perfect!  What&#x27;s better?  I get a six-pack of this product for the price I used to pay for one 6-ounce Keratase Nutri Sculpt.</li>
            <li> Soft curls! Doesn&#x27;t make your curls crunchy.</li>
            <li> I have wavy to curly hair and I have the most difficult time finding a product for my fine hair.  I can&#x27;t use mousse, it makes it frizzy, and gel makes it crispy but this is perfect.  It gives my hair control, keeps it from being fly away and I can even use it on dry hair.  I have had to order it online now because I can&#x27;t find it in the stores but it is totally worth it.  I only need about 3 pumps after a shower and I have hair just past my shoulder.  It is really a terrific product that does not weigh my hair down but gives it control and keeps it from being so fly away.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find this creme in stores by my house and the deal here was too good to pass up. The delivery was speedy, the package was undamaged, and the goods work just as I expected to. I would definitely order this product from here again.</li>
            <li> Finally something that works! It makes my hair a lot less frizzy and it smells so good! I use it every time I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have found for my curly hair.  It holds the curl, but isn&#x27;t crunchy or sticky.  I was frustrated when I couldn&#x27;t find it anymore in my local stores - and believe me, I looked in quite a few! - so I was relieved to find that I could order it here!</li>
            <li> Oh my goody two shoes!!!!! I love this lotion. It awakes my curls and make them shine like a diamond ring...... It helps my hair so much when I need something to help awake those curly q&#x27;s up from being so dry especially from the heat</li>
            <li> My hair use to look like Larry&#x27;s from the 3 stooges! Seriously!  I used Infusium 23 but it left it way too dry and it seemed that my hair would fall out easily?, I also tried the Olive oil root stimulator cream and at first it was awesome but at the end of the day, again my hair was really dry :( Then I found out that it is flammable! So I said, \\&quot;Forget it.\\&quot;  Then I came on to amazon and read all your reviews about this product and i bought it. I must say that my curls feel amazingly soft and bouncy :)  The only reason I didn&#x27;t \\&quot;love it\\&quot; was because i had some trouble detangleling my hair while wet. I don&#x27;t know if I used too much product? I wished it would have smoothed out my hair so that I could comb through it easily. I&#x27;ve only used it once, so I guess I have to wait and see. I&#x27;ll let you gals know. Oh, I also bought the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Healthy, shiny, soft hair! Kept the hold of styles I would do, I really enjoy this product and plan on buying it again :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been backing off of hot tools because the Texas heatwave has dried and fried my hair enough. So more deep conditioning and hydration are essential. I was looking for hydration for my natural curls and found this product. The reviews swayed my decision and I&#x27;m so glad I took the plunge especially since it&#x27;s so hard to find. The lotion creme is wonderful on damp or dry hair and makes my curls look and feel good. The smell is pleasant too.</li>
            <li> -light weight formula  -can use daily without buildup  -great price  I use this twice daily to moisturize and style my hair. product instantly helps me to define my style and does not build up in my scalp. I have thin curly/wavy hair and it&#x27;s difficult for me to find a product that actually moisturizes without buildup. This gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I live in Texas so the humidity is awful for frizz.  This stuff is great for everyday use, I use a pump and a half for long hair and then naturally dry and my curls are defined and not greasy like with serum or crunchy like with gel. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I buy this product in bulk. I won&#x27;t use anything else on my natural curls. Apply liberally to wet hair and let air dry.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and years. I&#x27;m a guy with wavy to curly hair as it gets longer and this has been the best product I can find to style my hair without it getting hard and crunchy and keeping my hair from getting overly dry and frizzly. However when I wear a hat with this product in my hair it seems to weigh my hair down and it becomes flat compared to if I didn&#x27;t have product in my hair. It&#x27;s not perfect but I always seem to come back to this after trying other products. I do like that it has a fairly neutral aroma to it.  I don&#x27;t have to use much so this last pack of 6 I purchased has lasted over 2 years now.</li>
            <li> I have had curly, frizzy hair all  my life.  This is the first product that made my hair look GREAT!  I get several compliments on my hair DAILY!  I have been out for a while and I have noticed that I have not received a single compliment since I was out.  No joke.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and delivery, and very well packaged.  It&#x27;s my HG hair product and cannot live without it.  I&#x27;ve been using this for years now and will continue to use it.  I love how it keeps my hair soft and smooth and doesn&#x27;t make it all sticky and icky like all the other products I&#x27;ve tried before this.  Nothing compares to it as far as I&#x27;m concern and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> Great stuff !! I have used this on my hair for years.... Curls are really soft.</li>
            <li> My daughter cannot find this product anywhere and was pleased to find it on Amazon at an excellent price.  She has very fine curly hair and this product adds body and managability to otherwise thin and frizzy hair.  She gets compliments all the time.  Wonderful product that will be repurchased.</li>
            <li> I have fine curly hair and when I recently started bleaching it, nothing worked to keep it manageable, until I tried this TRESemme product. I used their flawless curls shampoo and conditioner as well. Just two or three pumps of the lotion and I can comb my hair without tangles. The curls bounce up just as well as with any curling gel, but they are far softer and less loaded with sticky product. I am ordering extra, just to have it on hand. It&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I have wavy hair, not curly, and most products like gel and mousse make it crunchy and weight it down. This stuff doesn&#x27;t dry crunchy, is featherlight, and holds waves and curls without frizz for an entire day.&lt;br /&gt;I have a hard time finding it in stores, and when I do it&#x27;s usually five bucks or more. Buying it in bulk off Amazon is much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Great For my Curly hair!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only product I use and trust to give me my perfect natural curls! I am obsessed!</li>
            <li> REALLY HAPPY WITH PRODUCT, TYVM!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it left my curls very lifeless.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. This product is excellent,  I been using it on my daughter who has curly hair and it leaves her hair amazing..</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It&#x27;s light and does a great job of reducing frizz while making your hair softer and shinier. I use a styling creme on top of it, and my very fine, dry, curly hair is almost frizz-free.</li>
            <li> Best natural curl product out there. Lightweight on your hair, and your hair moves naturally. It will get stiff if you use to much.</li>
            <li> I have a closet full of hair products.  This one is a keeper.  I have used it for 2 years now.  Order it on line only because I can not find it in the stores.</li>
            <li> This product does what it advertises. It works as well as more expensive brands and maintains my curl and leaves my hair looking less frizzy.</li>
            <li> Somehow - I do not know why, my hair has returned to the look I had in grammer school. This is the only product I have found that works effectively to soften the long ringlet curls. I bought 12 of these because I couldn&#x27;t find it locally and I was afraid it had been removed from the TRESemme line.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic and takes a lot of the frizz out of my curls leaving them curly and manageable. I use this with the Tresemme shaping milk as well. Be careful when you buys this, as it is currently much more expensive than when I purchased the pack of 6. Definitely test this product out if you looking for touchable, soft curls!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my curly hair and I love how it leaves my hair, i will buy it again. :)</li>
