    <ol>
            <li>but the color is amazing!!!</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Manic Panic Semi-Permanent Hair Dye is a GREAT PRODUCT for the adventurious.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been dying my own hair for years and never had this happen.</li>
            <li>it was ok..</li>
            <li>and I have tried most brands.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Did they change something because I have used manic panic before and the color used to come out so much better and not wash out after 2 days.</li>
            <li>I love the shade of this dye.</li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>Fudge is better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve dyed my hair with many of Manic Panic&#x27;s colors before, including this one many years ago.</li>
            <li>The front of my hair went neon while most of my hair just turned a salmon color.</li>
            <li>It was a perfect cotton candy color and when i died my mannequin&#x27;s hair with this color again it came out as a great hot pink.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it works best to mix this with some of the more vibrant colors if you&#x27;re looking for less pop, or a good fade.</li>
            <li>First off, I LOVE the color of this item!</li>
            <li>It smells fine and doesn&#x27;t wreck havoc on my hair.</li>
            <li>Either way the color is fantastic</li>
            <li>far I have used 2 out of the 3 pinks SE offers and they all turned out beautifully!</li>
            <li>I love how it looks right after I dye my hair, but the pigment washes out almost immediately.</li>
            <li>Great FUN &amp; Personal Expression!!!</li>
            <li>Product was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Awesome it came a little earlier than it claimed :)</li>
            <li>Got here quickly and exactly as described!</li>
            <li>The color is pretty, for 2 days!</li>
            <li>Pretty color, but incredibly diluted, I feel like you could mix a darker pink with conditioner and get twice as much.</li>
            <li>This is okay as it is easy enough to refresh or let it fade, and try another color.</li>
            <li>i love the fact that its not tested on animals and that its completely vegan it also helps condition my hair after bleaching</li>
            <li>So yes, the name Cotton Candy Pink is very fitting.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li>First time using manic panic even tho</li>
            <li>And I have used Manic Panic many times before in different colors with no problem.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m willing to try..</li>
            <li>I used manic panic when I was younger and it worked so much better.</li>
            <li>My first application lasted maybe 5-6 days.</li>
            <li>i love this dye so much it always does the job and last for 3-4 months</li>
            <li>It fades extremely quick, even if you avoid washing and only rinse with cool water.</li>
            <li>If you want a hot or bright pink, go for a different dye.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Left light brown hair with high lights  nice and shiny but no sign of pink.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Special Effects, in my experience (remember: everyone&#x27;s hair is different!), is bright, vibrant, and long</li>
            <li>So in order for the pink to be able to even linger in your hair, you&#x27;d have to refrain from washing it.</li>
            <li>This is not the real Manic Panic - Do not buy it</li>
            <li>but the price is too much..</li>
            <li>dudes this isnt the real manic panic</li>
            <li>so I think it is pretty obvious which one is worth your money.</li>
            <li>I tried COTTON CANDY PINK on blonde hair and was very pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>, Special Effects is the same price on Amazon</li>
            <li>The product is gentle on the hair, while providing vivid coloring.</li>
            <li>Price was high.</li>
            <li>I did a dip dye in pink with the hair dye and at first it looked pretty cool, even without bleaching my natural blond hair, but after washing my hair 2-3 times the color was completely out.</li>
            <li>This light pink didn&#x27;t stick to my daughters hair at all.</li>
            <li>I tried coloring on bleached hair but couldn&#x27;t get the right color even after following the instructions on the bottle.</li>
            <li>so I went ahead and bought it instead of Hot Hot Pink.</li>
            <li>I will always be an avid supporter of Punky Colour, and this attempt at manic panic was definitely motivation to stick with my trusty ole punky.</li>
            <li>love how this dye is &amp;#34;vegan&amp;#34; or at least it says it is.</li>
            <li>After dying, my hair felt silky and soft whereas with Manic Panic did nothing to help the state of my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would not waste my time or money on this product again.</li>
            <li>Does not last more than a few washes.</li>
            <li>If you want to go PINK or BLUE or YELLOW with your hair, this is an easy and inexpensive way to do it.</li>
            <li>This color pink is exactly what I was going for.</li>
            <li>I used the whole jar with the pink.</li>
            <li>Because my daughter wants her hair pink</li>
            <li>Consistancy was very watery compared to other brands.  </li>
            <li>Showed up quickly, I&#x27;ve used it twice now, the pink isn&#x27;t as dark as the dye, in my hair it comes out as a very faded baby pink color, so I guess that&#x27;s cotton candy,</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have been dying my hair unnatural colors for at least 6 years and have yet to find a light pink that holds up!</li>
            <li> Turns out that just using this alone creates a pastel pink affect anyway, no other supplies needed.</li>
            <li> Luckily it washed out completely in 2 days (which is sad</li>
            <li> I let the dye sit for about 30 minutes and barely even pink.</li>
            <li> Also even if you leave it in your hair for several hours.. (or as long as you can keep it in), it will still wash out within a week to 10 days.</li>
            <li> I suggest you do the same if you&#x27;re wanting any shade of pink hair.</li>
            <li> It lasts quite a while too (assuming you take proper extreme hair color care).</li>
            <li> There are only a few places that it actually dyed my hair.</li>
            <li> The second round only lasted 3-4 days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although, I have found a product that succeeded at everything that Manic Panic failed at; Special Effects.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Before applying Cotton Candy Pink, my hair was bleached and toned to a combination of white and pale yellow.</li>
            <li> The little color I got didn&#x27;t even last long.</li>
            <li> I wanted to do pastel pink hair</li>
            <li> Alright,I want to start out this review by saying that I have been dying my hair pink for 3 years</li>
            <li> Cotton Candy Pink</li>
            <li> I dilute it a bit with conditioner for a pastel pink and one jar lasts me FOREVER.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it only lasts a few days.</li>
            <li> but I wanted pastel pink hair</li>
            <li> I already ordered SFX Cupcake Pink and Atomic Pink from this seller.</li>
            <li> Note that the actual color of the container is a pale pink.  </li>
            <li> They do not cover half the hair and fade away very easily even with cold water!</li>
            <li> the money spent!</li>
            <li> I got so upset I will say this is a rip off and not worth</li>
            <li> my hair barely even resembled pink, it even looked like a weird shade of orange in some places.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Flamingo Pink was a very similar experience, the only difference was that instead of looking vaguely orange it looked vaguely red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was wasted effort-and wasted money!</li>
            <li> This color alone will do very little to nothing for hair that isn&#x27;t bleached within an inch of its life.  </li>
            <li> This one, however, I am not pleased with at all.</li>
            <li> However, the color is very very pale.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, there is one thing they do have in common; they are both vegan</li>
            <li> have used Manic Panic twice before (Cotton Candy Pink and Pink Flamingo) and it turned out horribly both times.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> I am not happy, I will be changing color brand</li>
            <li> You can dilute those dyes with conditioner to get yourself the color that this product fails to produce.</li>
            <li> I guess Which is sad and disappointing.</li>

            <li> it was ok.. I tried coloring on bleached hair but couldn&#x27;t get the right color even after following the instructions on the bottle. The little color I got didn&#x27;t even last long. It washed out after two washes.</li>
            <li> I wanted to do pastel pink hair so I thought I would use this to create a lighter dye. Turns out that just using this alone creates a pastel pink affect anyway, no other supplies needed. So yes, the name Cotton Candy Pink is very fitting. If you want a hot or bright pink, go for a different dye.&lt;br /&gt;I love how this dye is &amp;#34;vegan&amp;#34; or at least it says it is. It smells fine and doesn&#x27;t wreck havoc on my hair. Great product.</li>
            <li> Alright,I want to start out this review by saying that I have been dying my hair pink for 3 years and I have tried most brands.&lt;br /&gt;I have used Manic Panic twice before (Cotton Candy Pink and Pink Flamingo) and it turned out horribly both times.&lt;br /&gt;With Cotton Candy Pink my hair barely even resembled pink, it even looked like a weird shade of orange in some places. Luckily it washed out completely in 2 days (which is sad considering I wasn&#x27;t even making an effort to get it out)&lt;br /&gt;Flamingo Pink was a very similar experience, the only difference was that instead of looking vaguely orange it looked vaguely red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although, I have found a product that succeeded at everything that Manic Panic failed at; Special Effects.&lt;br /&gt;Special Effects, in my experience (remember: everyone&#x27;s hair is different!), is bright, vibrant, and long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;So far I have used 2 out of the 3 pinks SE offers and they all turned out beautifully! After dying, my hair felt silky and soft whereas with Manic Panic did nothing to help the state of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;However, there is one thing they do have in common; they are both vegan friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Special Effects is the same price on Amazon so I think it is pretty obvious which one is worth your money.</li>
            <li> First time using manic panic even tho I&#x27;ve  dye my hair multiple  times. I used atomic turquoise  and that one.</li>
            <li> NOT GREAT FOR LIGHT COLORED HAIR</li>
            <li> I did a dip dye in pink with the hair dye and at first it looked pretty cool, even without bleaching my natural blond hair, but after washing my hair 2-3 times the color was completely out.</li>
            <li> I think the color is swell- I love how it looks right after I dye my hair, but the pigment washes out almost immediately. So in order for the pink to be able to even linger in your hair, you&#x27;d have to refrain from washing it. Too pricey for the quality in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Manic Panic Semi-Permanent Hair Dye is a GREAT PRODUCT for the adventurious. If you want to go PINK or BLUE or YELLOW with your hair, this is an easy and inexpensive way to do it. The product is gentle on the hair, while providing vivid coloring. I tried COTTON CANDY PINK on blonde hair and was very pleased with the result. As it is SEMI permanent, it does eventually fade and wash out. This is okay as it is easy enough to refresh or let it fade, and try another color. Great FUN &amp; Personal Expression!!!</li>
            <li> This is not the real Manic Panic - Do not buy it</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t take on my daughters hair I used the whole jar with the pink. Did they change something because I have used manic panic before and the color used to come out so much better and not wash out after 2 days. I am not happy, I will be changing color brand I guess Which is sad and disappointing.</li>
            <li> Product was shipped quickly. I had no issues with that. And I have used Manic Panic many times before in different colors with no problem. This one, however, I am not pleased with at all. I lightened my hair before use &amp; I left the dye on for a lengthy amount of time and it didn&#x27;t work. There are only a few places that it actually dyed my hair. And this wasn&#x27;t user error either. I&#x27;ve been dying my own hair for years and never had this happen.</li>
            <li> Note that the actual color of the container is a pale pink.  This color alone will do very little to nothing for hair that isn&#x27;t bleached within an inch of its life.  I&#x27;ve found it works best to mix this with some of the more vibrant colors if you&#x27;re looking for less pop, or a good fade.</li>
            <li> Left light brown hair with high lights  nice and shiny but no sign of pink.</li>
            <li> Want to try this product..I&#x27;m not looking for something to last..Because my daughter wants her hair pink and she&#x27;s only 10..So I just want to give her a pop of color without damaging her hair and I know the color will not last...so I&#x27;m willing to try..but the price is too much..I got this somewhere else for actually 5.99...so u guys just look around you&#x27;ll find it cheaper...can&#x27;t wait to try it</li>
            <li> dudes this isnt the real manic panic</li>
            <li> It worked fantastically, as always with Manic Panic!</li>
            <li> i love this dye so much it always does the job and last for 3-4 months i love the fact that its not tested on animals and that its completely vegan it also helps condition my hair after bleaching</li>
            <li> I will not be buying anymore of these hair products from MANIC PANIC. They do not cover half the hair and fade away very easily even with cold water! I let the dye sit for about 30 minutes and barely even pink. I got so upset I will say this is a rip off and not worth the money spent!</li>
            <li> The jar was way smaller than i thought but the color is amazing!!! It was a perfect cotton candy color and when i died my mannequin&#x27;s hair with this color again it came out as a great hot pink. Either way the color is fantastic</li>
            <li> I love the shade of this dye. It lasts quite a while too (assuming you take proper extreme hair color care). I dilute it a bit with conditioner for a pastel pink and one jar lasts me FOREVER.&lt;br /&gt;I do leave it on for an hour instead of time suggested on jar, though.</li>
            <li> Okay. First off, I LOVE the color of this item! However, the color is very very pale. Also even if you leave it in your hair for several hours.. (or as long as you can keep it in), it will still wash out within a week to 10 days. Be prepared to reapply constantly.</li>
            <li> I used manic panic when I was younger and it worked so much better. This light pink didn&#x27;t stick to my daughters hair at all.</li>
            <li> Awesome it came a little earlier than it claimed :)</li>
            <li> Got here quickly and exactly as described! Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li> Title says it all! I have been dying my hair unnatural colors for at least 6 years and have yet to find a light pink that holds up! This was wasted effort-and wasted money! The color is pretty, for 2 days! I will always be an avid supporter of Punky Colour, and this attempt at manic panic was definitely motivation to stick with my trusty ole punky.</li>

            <li> Consistancy was very watery compared to other brands.  Price was high. Color didn&#x27;t last. I would not waste my time or money on this product again.</li>
            <li> Pretty color, but incredibly diluted, I feel like you could mix a darker pink with conditioner and get twice as much.</li>
            <li> This color pink is exactly what I was going for. Unfortunately, it only lasts a few days. My first application lasted maybe 5-6 days. Then I re-dyed it. The second round only lasted 3-4 days. Time to try a different brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dyed my hair with many of Manic Panic&#x27;s colors before, including this one many years ago. Before applying Cotton Candy Pink, my hair was bleached and toned to a combination of white and pale yellow. I knew this was one of the weakest colors but I wanted pastel pink hair so I went ahead and bought it instead of Hot Hot Pink. The front of my hair went neon while most of my hair just turned a salmon color. Nothing like the jar or swatches. It fades extremely quick, even if you avoid washing and only rinse with cool water. I already ordered SFX Cupcake Pink and Atomic Pink from this seller. I suggest you do the same if you&#x27;re wanting any shade of pink hair. You can dilute those dyes with conditioner to get yourself the color that this product fails to produce.</li>
