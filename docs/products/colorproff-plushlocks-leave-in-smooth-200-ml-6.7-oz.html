            <li>Love this whole line!!!</li>
            <li>and it makes my fair less frizzy and smelling great.</li>
            <li>The best part is this product does not leave your hair greasy like other products I have tried.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair so smooth and easy to style.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a great leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sold on the smooth ride of this line of hair products... Contended IjL</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m big on smell, and this smells great.</li>
            <li>Smooth and NO frizz.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling and looking smooth, which is what it&#x27;s supposed to do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>only gripe is that the product had leaked in the box and it wasn&#x27;t sealed, but that has nothing to do with how great this product works.  </li>
            <li>Super excited about the whole process!!!!</li>
            <li>Thus far, everything I have tried from this brand is exceptional.</li>
            <li>I see a significant increase in fade when I run out.</li>
            <li>My hair dresser recommended this for me after a brazilian blowout, and she never disappoints with her recommendations, so I ordered it feeling pretty confident I&#x27;d like it.  </li>
            <li>OK, this does absolutely nothing!</li>
            <li>I have very fine, straight hair</li>
            <li>It is a great leave-in conditioner that leaves my hair easy to manage without being weighted down.</li>
            <li>What an amazing product to make you hair soft and silky after you flatiron.  </li>
            <li>The amazing part is the whole line of smoothing products by this company is effective for coarse hair.</li>
            <li>It smells quite good and seems like the same product.</li>
            <li>This product in particular is my favorite blow drying creme or leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have wavy/frizzy hair and this product smooths out my frizz beautifully without leaving a heavy residue.  </li>
            <li>This product is light weight, yet really helps control the frizz of my curls.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>LOVE all the Color Proof products I have purchased so far.</li>
            <li>My color stays fresh all month.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for all your help ang the lightning fast shipping........:)</li>
            <li>When I flat iron my hair with it my hair looks so nice.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair smelling great and feeling soft all day long.</li>
            <li>I have grey frizzy hair and this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair super clean, soft, manageable, and preserves the color better than any I&#x27;ve ever used...and I&#x27;ve used a lot of different brands before!</li>
            <li>I have been looking for this product my whole life!</li>
            <li>After the first use I could see a very noticeable difference in how smooth, soft, and manageable my hair is.</li>
            <li>The oil is not available by ColorProff, but works extremely well in combo with their wonderful smoothing products.</li>
            <li>I am able to wash my hair and walk out the door knowing it will dry in a nice style without having to use a hot iron to tame the ends.</li>
            <li>I bought because I use all ColorProof curly hair line products which are in blue bottles...but works great none the less.</li>
            <li>The product I received came in a pink bottle and I absolutely love the smell.</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>This might be more than what other use, but my hair is very porous, curly, fine,  and just above my waist.  </li>
            <li>This smells like cookie dough which isn&#x27;t a smell I particularly want in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Like most of the ColorProff Plush hair line products I have tried, they are perfect for a man with coarse, thick hair that is tough to control.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for thicker, color treated hair.</li>
            <li>It is really a good product and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>but I received a pink bottle of ColorProff PlushLocks Leave in Smooth,</li>
            <li>Although I am not taking the time to do my hair, my hair feels soft and smooth once dry.  </li>
            <li>the new pureology line that I was using before my research brought me here.</li>
            <li>~in Smooth does double duty as extra conditioner &amp; frizz control as well as helping detangle!</li>
            <li>I get very frizzy in the humidity here in the South, but this stuff is major.  </li>
            <li>hair is so soft and silky!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly the same as the one I buy in the salon.</li>
            <li>I also use this brand of shampoo and conditioner and can&#x27;t say enough positive about this product line.  </li>
            <li>I applied the oil and this plushlocks again on the second day after washing to add a little more moisture.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper to buy on Amazon than at my local salon.</li>
            <li>If I want to wear my hair natural and curly I also put this product in the reduce the frizz.</li>
            <li>It turns my naturally curly and frizzy hair extremely soft and not frizzy at all.  </li>
            <li>For course, thick hair, it does not get better than ColorProff</li>
            <li>If you have frizzy hair or dry hair, I highly reccomend using this!</li>
            <li>I have really sturdy coarse curly hair and currently have the Brazilian keratin blowout treatment.  </li>
            <li>It left my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Too much will make your hair feel weighed down.</li>

            <li> Too much will make your hair feel weighed down.</li>
            <li> but this makes my hair soft and shiny without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Love it, highly recommend for people who hate humidity in their hair</li>
            <li> It leaves my course, thick hair much softer and manageable.</li>
            <li> I doubt I will want to go back to the other products I have on hand.</li>
            <li> I foil my hair which leaves it dry</li>
            <li> I use every time before I blow dry</li>
            <li> and I normally get the pink bottle, so I was not sure I was going to get the correct stuff.</li>
            <li> I can use it on my hair wet or dry &amp; never look greasy.</li>
            <li> The description was correct, though, and I received the pink bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put it in my wet hair overnight and style my hair in the morning.</li>
            <li> This comes in a Pink bottle.  </li>
            <li> I use it all throughout my hair before I blow dry and it cuts down the time I have to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> And this is the same as their other products, pricey but only need a very small amount.</li>
            <li> I have dry, thick, coarse, heavy hair growing out from a short cut</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> The last time I had my hair highlighted it got really dry and dull.  </li>

            <li> I love this line of products.  I use this occasionally.</li>
            <li> Smell is good. Works ok. More drying than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> This product is light weight, yet really helps control the frizz of my curls. I can use it on my hair wet or dry &amp; never look greasy. My daughters also have curly hair &amp; PlushLocks Leave~in Smooth does double duty as extra conditioner &amp; frizz control as well as helping detangle! And it smells great!</li>
            <li> Love this whole line!!! this conditioner is awesome!! It makes your hair so smooth and easy to style. Gives it shine and bounce. the best hair product I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> Helps with the frizz. Too much will make your hair feel weighed down.</li>
            <li> leave in conditioner for curly corse hair. use it every time. It keeps the frize down and doe not leave a build up feeling behind.</li>
            <li> Love Color Proof. Thus far, everything I have tried from this brand is exceptional. Worth the price. A little goes a long way and I also use on my ends daily. No issues with greasy feeling or weighing my hair down even on day three. Product works as described. Highly recommend for thicker, color treated hair. It works!</li>
            <li> This was a great price and what I was looking for!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Burt</li>
            <li> Love the product, it arrived in a very appropriate time frame. Thank you. Irene Smith</li>
            <li> Great on curly hair. Made my curls defined and bouncy.</li>
            <li> Smells like a vanilla cupcake - I love this.</li>
            <li> THIS CAN BE PUT ON ANY TIME WHICH IS GREAT FOR COMPLETE HAIR CARE, AND CONSTANT HAIR CARE.THANK YOU;  PERFECT</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use this product every day because I think it sticks around for a while even after a shampoo which I do daily.  But it works GREAT.  Smells like cake batter to me!  But don&#x27;t eat it!!!</li>
            <li> This product works great! My hair was easier to brush through than with previous haircare products. I just don&#x27;t care for the smell of this product. Otherwise, it is awesome!</li>
            <li> The last time I had my hair highlighted it got really dry and dull.  This product is amazing. It left my hair soft and shiny. My hair did not feel weighted down or oily. LOVE all the Color Proof products I have purchased so far. And this is the same as their other products, pricey but only need a very small amount.</li>
            <li> Great product. Leaves your hair smelling great and feeling soft all day long. Much cheaper to buy on Amazon than at my local salon.</li>
            <li> Love it, highly recommend for people who hate humidity in their hair</li>
            <li> this is the best prouct, better priced online than in beauty stores! great for all hair types and smells great too</li>
            <li> Every product I have tried in the line has been amazing. This product in particular is my favorite blow drying creme or leave in conditioner. The product I received came in a pink bottle and I absolutely love the smell. I use it all throughout my hair before I blow dry and it cuts down the time I have to straighten my hair. If I want to wear my hair natural and curly I also put this product in the reduce the frizz. The best part is this product does not leave your hair greasy like other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> I love all Color Proof products, thank you</li>
            <li> Good product, use it all of the time before using my curling iron.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look like what I purchased at my salon.  Wonder about authenticity of this product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It&#x27;s such a great leave in conditioner. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair look slimy, you can&#x27;t even tell there&#x27;s a leave in conditioner in my hair. It leaves my course, thick hair much softer and manageable. I&#x27;ll purchase more when this runs out because I really love it.</li>
            <li> I use this every day whether I shampoo my hair or not.  It is a great leave-in conditioner that leaves my hair easy to manage without being weighted down.</li>
            <li> This product was introduced to me at my hair salon,  and I absolutely love it!!! It smells fabulous, and this product makes my hair incredibly smooth,  and shiny!!!!! About the seller.... Another AMAZING!!!!! I ordered this product on a Friday evening,  and recieve it Monday afternoon!!!!!! Super excited about the whole process!!!!</li>
            <li> Finally, a smoother that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling like gunk.</li>
            <li> This leave-in straightener/conditioner is amazing! It has the consistency of a lotion and smells just like cake batter! Plus it leaves my hair frizz-free all day!</li>
            <li> Finally a product that controls frizz! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Like most of the ColorProff Plush hair line products I have tried, they are perfect for a man with coarse, thick hair that is tough to control. This Leave-In Smooth product delivers the best in smooth, frizz free results. The amazing part is the whole line of smoothing products by this company is effective for coarse hair. If you want even better results try this hair smoothing line up with some Macadamian Oil found at most exclusive hair product specialty stores... The oil is not available by ColorProff, but works extremely well in combo with their wonderful smoothing products. For course, thick hair, it does not get better than ColorProff and I&#x27;ve tried everything for my thick, tough to handle patch of hair on top of my equally as difficult lamebrain...I&#x27;m sold on the smooth ride of this line of hair products... Contended IjL</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo line it works great and my color is lasting much better.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of vanilla frosting!!!!</li>
            <li> Great for curls - no frizz.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this leave in conditioner. I started using it as recommended by my hair stylist. The picture on the posting is a blue bottle and I normally get the pink bottle, so I was not sure I was going to get the correct stuff. The description was correct, though, and I received the pink bottle.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is so soft and silky! I have very fine, straight hair and it doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy or weighed down at all.</li>
            <li> This left a rough unpleasant coating on my hair.  I have really sturdy coarse curly hair and currently have the Brazilian keratin blowout treatment.  I can use tons of product on my hair typically.  This felt terrible on my hair and did not do anything positive for me.</li>
            <li> This smells like cookie dough which isn&#x27;t a smell I particularly want in my hair.  Also, it has a heavy feeling in my hair..</li>
            <li> Really like this product. I foil my hair which leaves it dry but this makes my hair soft and shiny without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> This a great product ,I shall order it again . it seems to stop my hair from going frizzy..</li>
            <li> The smell alone is amazing and the way it makes your hair is just absolutely amazing. If you have frizzy hair or dry hair, I highly reccomend using this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m big on smell, and this smells great. I put it in my wet hair overnight and style my hair in the morning. Doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy, even when applied at the roots. Keeps my hair smooth and healthy!</li>
            <li> I have wavy/frizzy hair and this product smooths out my frizz beautifully without leaving a heavy residue.  I also use this brand of shampoo and conditioner and can&#x27;t say enough positive about this product line.  It leaves my hair super clean, soft, manageable, and preserves the color better than any I&#x27;ve ever used...and I&#x27;ve used a lot of different brands before!</li>
            <li> What an amazing product to make you hair soft and silky after you flatiron.  Try the shampoo and conditioner for even better results.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s exactly the same as the one I buy in the salon. My color stays fresh all month. I see a significant increase in fade when I run out.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I get very frizzy in the humidity here in the South, but this stuff is major.  Leaves your hair smooth and silky!</li>
            <li> Yes, this product smells like vanilla cake batter. It is very pleasant to work through the hair along with the shine treatment oil. Gives your hair a sleek look without weighing it down. I applied the oil and this plushlocks again on the second day after washing to add a little more moisture. I used the shampoo, conditioner, shine treatment, and plush locks products. After the first use I could see a very noticeable difference in how smooth, soft, and manageable my hair is. I doubt I will want to go back to the other products I have on hand. I have dry, thick, coarse, heavy hair growing out from a short cut so there are lots of ends at different lengths. These products have made a remarkable difference. I am able to wash my hair and walk out the door knowing it will dry in a nice style without having to use a hot iron to tame the ends.</li>
            <li> This comes in a Pink bottle.  I bought because I use all ColorProof curly hair line products which are in blue bottles...but works great none the less.</li>
            <li> I do not know if this is a different product than I ordered but I received a pink bottle of ColorProff PlushLocks Leave in Smooth, the bottle I had before was blue and I ordered a blue bottle.  I will try it I will know if it is the same as I have used in the past.  It smells quite good and seems like the same product.</li>
            <li> Love this product and it smells amazing. Good to use on color treated hair also. I use every time before I blow dry and it makes my fair less frizzy and smelling great.</li>
            <li> I love this product line.  Much better then the new pureology line that I was using before my research brought me here. Thank you so much for all your help ang the lightning fast shipping........:)</li>
            <li> I use this on days that I am lazy and do not blowdry my hair. Other days, I use the HeatProof anti-frizz cr&amp;egrave;me. Although I am not taking the time to do my hair, my hair feels soft and smooth once dry.  I have also found myself using this on my ends at times. It is really a good product and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> great product for frizzy hair - and SO much cheaper than salon prices</li>
            <li> I do not know how I ever lived without this product.  It turns my naturally curly and frizzy hair extremely soft and not frizzy at all.  I wish this were sold in a bigger bottle because I never want to run out!  You will not be disappointed with this at all!</li>
            <li> I have curly and sometimes frizzy hair - this product is a great frizz tamer.  Definitely recommend this product and will buy again.</li>
            <li> great product and smells like vanilla cake.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this product my whole life! I have grey frizzy hair and this stuff is amazing. When I flat iron my hair with it my hair looks so nice. It works like a leave in conditioner. My hair is beautiful again.  Smooth and NO frizz.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this stuff!  It reminds me of oatmeal cookies!  My hair dresser recommended this for me after a brazilian blowout, and she never disappoints with her recommendations, so I ordered it feeling pretty confident I&#x27;d like it.  As usual, she didn&#x27;t disappoint!  I love ColorProof!  I use about a quarter sized amount and run it through my hair.  This might be more than what other use, but my hair is very porous, curly, fine,  and just above my waist.  It leaves my hair feeling and looking smooth, which is what it&#x27;s supposed to do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is that the product had leaked in the box and it wasn&#x27;t sealed, but that has nothing to do with how great this product works.  Maybe the seller should consider sealing and wrapping to prevent this.  I smelled it before I even opened the box and knew I&#x27;d be seeing some leakage.</li>
            <li> shampoo &amp; conditioner in this line work OK, this does absolutely nothing!</li>
