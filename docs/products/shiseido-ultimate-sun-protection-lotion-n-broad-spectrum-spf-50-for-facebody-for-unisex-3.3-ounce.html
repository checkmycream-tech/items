            <li>One of the best sunscreens I have used.</li>
            <li>Excellent product!</li>
            <li>It is really a very nice product!!!</li>
            <li>this seems to be the best!!</li>
            <li>This is one of the best sunscreens that I have used.  </li>
            <li>This is perfect and I have no lines.</li>
            <li>Best sun protection on the market, great for oily skin and perfect touch.&lt;br /&gt;Worth to buy more than one unit.</li>
            <li>Great if you want to wear it under makeup.</li>
            <li>But this sunscreen doesn&#x27;t require a lot of rubbing in and does a great job of protecting you from the sun.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t matter how good the ingredients are if they&#x27;re expired.</li>
            <li>Always liked this brand</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn every kind of sunscreen, powder, etc..</li>
            <li>On days I am not at the beach I am still outdoors but am able to stay in more shaded areas.</li>
            <li>On top of the lotion sunscreen, I layer with Shiseido&#x27;s sunscreen foundation on top.  </li>
            <li>While this product protects me from burning from the midday sun, I have still been getting more and more tanned and more and more freckles have been appearing all over my face.  </li>
            <li>note, this sunscreen is runnier than most drugstore sunscreens.</li>
            <li>Love the way this smells</li>
            <li>This is the best overall sunscreen I have been able to find.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t leave a oily aspect.</li>
            <li>I know it is kind of pricey for a whole body sunscreen</li>
            <li>It also has a really smooth feel after it sets, like a makeup primer, which is an added bonus.</li>
            <li>This is the third bottle I have owned and Amazon had a good deal.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is super watery and needs to be layered on quite a bit for adequate sun protection.</li>
            <li>I like this spf because it is not greasy but moisturizing and good for a long day outdoors.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sticky, very smooth on face after application and it helps cover my old scars!  </li>
            <li>I do wear a hat with a large brim, too, but light reflects off the water and the sand.  </li>
            <li>so it is easily absorbed.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Overall my favorite sunscreen right now!</li>
            <li>I expected a lot better than this from Shiseido and regret spending so much money on it; it wasn&#x27;t any better than something you can find at the drug store.</li>
            <li>It is VERY VERY water resistant.</li>
            <li>Seemed more greasy and smelled somewhat different.  </li>
            <li>I will likely try their sunscreen in cream form and see if I get more protection that way.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m starting to inch towards purchasing a sun guard mask but want to see if there&#x27;s any sunscreen out there that works better before I go that (embarrassing) route.</li>
            <li>but for me it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s definitely worth paying a little more to protect your skin.  </li>
            <li>I am out in the sun at the beach from 10:30am - 2:30 pm as much as 5 days a week sometimes.  </li>
            <li>but my girls only need one coating (applied 30 minutes before) to keep them burn free for 3-4 hours at the beach.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This is an spf 50, so I think a small amount like this still is effective while not causing too much whiteness.</li>
            <li>Goes on with a white cast, but once you adequately rub it in and wait 5-10 min, the whiteness goes away.</li>
            <li>Very natural looking too!</li>
            <li>I actually mix it with a foundation that is a bit dark on me and it makes a fantastic tinted moisturizer that way -- just use a matte foundation.</li>
            <li>The key to controlling the white cast is not to use too much.</li>
            <li>If I was less lazy I would have returned it, but I honestly didn&#x27;t even think it was worth the trouble.</li>

            <li> With other sunscreens that have a high SPF, I have to really rub in the sunscreen for a while until I don&#x27;t see the white on my skin, usually because it&#x27;s so thick.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t feel the same as previous versions.  </li>
            <li> For everyday I prefer Anew Ultimate spf25 day cream as it does not sting my eyes like shiseido&#x27;s does.</li>

            <li> Sometimes I put it on before the gym, and it never burns like other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Contacted shiseido and they said it had less active ingredient</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s a small bottle, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say I use half a teaspoon for my face.</li>
            <li> I do reapply one or both everyday.  </li>
            <li> I found that it didn&#x27;t last very long and was really unpleasant to reapply because of how greasy it is.</li>

            <li> Didn&#x27;t feel the same as previous versions.  Seemed more greasy and smelled somewhat different.  Contacted shiseido and they said it had less active ingredient so they must have replaced it with greasy ingredient.  Needs work.</li>
            <li> One of the best sunscreens I have used. This is the third bottle I have owned and Amazon had a good deal. I do a lot of outside watersports.</li>
            <li> just used once. have no idea how it screen the sunlight. but it&#x27;s not oily on your face, so that i will come back</li>
            <li> It is very fluid so it is easily absorbed.  Great if you want to wear it under makeup.</li>
            <li> I am out in the sun at the beach from 10:30am - 2:30 pm as much as 5 days a week sometimes.  On days I am not at the beach I am still outdoors but am able to stay in more shaded areas. So I am outdoors anywhere from 5-7 days a week during the times mentioned above for work.  On top of the lotion sunscreen, I layer with Shiseido&#x27;s sunscreen foundation on top.  I do reapply one or both everyday.  While this product protects me from burning from the midday sun, I have still been getting more and more tanned and more and more freckles have been appearing all over my face.  I do wear a hat with a large brim, too, but light reflects off the water and the sand.  I will likely try their sunscreen in cream form and see if I get more protection that way.

            <li> This sunscreen is super watery and needs to be layered on quite a bit for adequate sun protection. I found that it didn&#x27;t last very long and was really unpleasant to reapply because of how greasy it is. After a couple of hours I just wanted to take a shower because of how oily and slimy I felt. I expected a lot better than this from Shiseido and regret spending so much money on it; it wasn&#x27;t any better than something you can find at the drug store. If I was less lazy I would have returned it, but I honestly didn&#x27;t even think it was worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> Best sun protection on the market, great for oily skin and perfect touch.&lt;br /&gt;Worth to buy more than one unit. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> This is my go-to sunscreen for summer. It is VERY VERY water resistant. It&#x27;s the only one that keeps my girls from being burned. I know it is kind of pricey for a whole body sunscreen but my girls only need one coating (applied 30 minutes before) to keep them burn free for 3-4 hours at the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note, this sunscreen is runnier than most drugstore sunscreens.</li>
            <li> it made me to ashy looking</li>
            <li> This lotion is not easy to soak in the skin and leaves white marks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky, very smooth on face after application and it helps cover my old scars!  Very natural looking too!</li>
            <li> Shiseido does not disclose expiration dates on their sunblock so you may be using an expired product. Doesn&#x27;t matter how good the ingredients are if they&#x27;re expired.</li>
            <li> It is really a very nice product!!! will recommend to everyone in need of a sunscreen!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. I am in the sun a lot, and it stays on and protects my face. It also doesn&#x27;t sting if you sweat. Sometimes I put it on before the gym, and it never burns like other sunscreens. It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, either. I actually mix it with a foundation that is a bit dark on me and it makes a fantastic tinted moisturizer that way -- just use a matte foundation. I use MAC studio fix for this purpose.</li>
            <li> Always liked this brand it&#x27;s easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t leave a oily aspect.</li>
            <li> Runny, like the consistency of milk. Goes on with a white cast, but once you adequately rub it in and wait 5-10 min, the whiteness goes away. The key to controlling the white cast is not to use too much. I&#x27;d say I use half a teaspoon for my face. This is an spf 50, so I think a small amount like this still is effective while not causing too much whiteness. It also has a really smooth feel after it sets, like a makeup primer, which is an added bonus. Overall my favorite sunscreen right now!</li>
            <li> Love the way this smells and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. This is my second bottle. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is the ultimate product for the sun. I&#x27;ve worn every kind of sunscreen, powder, etc.. this seems to be the best!!</li>
            <li> I like this spf because it is not greasy but moisturizing and good for a long day outdoors. For everyday I prefer Anew Ultimate spf25 day cream as it does not sting my eyes like shiseido&#x27;s does.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best sunscreens that I have used.  I guess for some people, the runny consistency can be bothersome but for me it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted. With other sunscreens that have a high SPF, I have to really rub in the sunscreen for a while until I don&#x27;t see the white on my skin, usually because it&#x27;s so thick.  But this sunscreen doesn&#x27;t require a lot of rubbing in and does a great job of protecting you from the sun.  Although it&#x27;s a small bottle, a little goes a long way and it&#x27;s definitely worth paying a little more to protect your skin.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is the best overall sunscreen I have been able to find.  I wear sun sleeves and need something to protect my shoulders and hands.  This is perfect and I have no lines.</li>
