    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Works great, also!</li>
            <li>This is a great moisturizer!</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, it&#x27;s an excellent product.</li>
            <li>Excellent product though and</li>
            <li>very good product with a awesome price</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>I had a really fair skin before I moved to Honolulu.</li>
            <li>but I think not as fair as before.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>Bought it because it got good reviews, I didn&#x27;t like the watery consistency</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>the price it is an awesome product I would recommend it highly !</li>
            <li>Quick service, great product.</li>
            <li>Will purchase more HadaLabo skincare.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve got to say that it worked a lot better than I was expecting.</li>
            <li>After maybe around one month, I see my skin looks cleaner and better...</li>
            <li>The texture is more watery than what you would imagine a lotion to be.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep on using it to be sure of how well it works otherwise.</li>
            <li>Instead of looking noticeably paler, my face and neck look more even-toned.</li>
            <li>have noticed my skin brightening and looking much more clear&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>when it comes to skin care products, japanese companies are the best.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I haven&#x27;t seen a huge whitening difference after using it for more than 2 years, but I still continue using it because I do think it helps with moisturizing my face.</li>
            <li>The Milk and Toner combo is perfect for my dry skin</li>
            <li>, my forever dry skin feels more supple and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Going to start bathing in it to see if it can even out the rest of my body&#x27;s skintone too!!!</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is so light and absorbent that I haven&#x27;t had a problem with either.</li>
            <li>The effect was so clear it was really surprising.</li>
            <li>I use it after I clean and wash my face.</li>
            <li>this whitening lotion has made my skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li>In Honolulu I enjoyed outdoor sooo much</li>
            <li>gave 4 stars, because actually I feel good every morning after I applied this liquid on my face.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re supposed to pour a dime-sized amount on to clean palms, rub them together, then pat the product onto your face until it&#x27;s fully absorbed.</li>
            <li>but after I apply it on my face it feels super super sticky.</li>
            <li>this is a really sticky toner,.the texture is really light and watery</li>
            <li>As most reviewers said, this lotion is very watery and you don&#x27;t need a lot to cover the whole face.</li>
            <li>Definitely buying more of this stuff once I run out.</li>
            <li>but it did moisturize my skin pretty well.</li>
            <li>A light grey bruise-ish looking birthmark on the side of my face always bothered me, even though most people could barely tell it was there.</li>
            <li>Amazon does not allow external links in their reviews, but a quick google search will reveal scientific papers confirming that arbutin is hydrolyzed by skin bacteria to hydroquinone and that hydroquinone is carcinogenic, can be absorbed through the skin, and is under investigation by FDA.     </li>
            <li>So I was a little worried that I&#x27;d end up with uneven light/dark patches if I didn&#x27;t put it on perfectly or evenly.</li>
            <li>I really like the HadaLabo skincare line..</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t really hydrate and the product was sticky and non-absorbant.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing but can get sticky if you don&#x27;t apply the Milk (Lotion/pink label.</li>
            <li>It is recommended that you gently pat it onto your face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I also have extremely sensitive combination oily/dry skin which is prone to both eczema and breakouts (thanks a lot, parents).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually only gotten this recently, so I&#x27;m not sure about the moisturizing effect yet, I mean, it feels good, but I think I&#x27;ll need some more observational time to decide if it smooths out my skin or</li>
            <li>I only applied it once, and it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>No break outs so far!</li>
            <li>There was a clear line between where there was mask and on the edges of my face where the mask did not cover.</li>
            <li>do not waste your money on this stuff.</li>
            <li>The lotion itself, though runny, moisturizes very well, but it&#x27;s not the kinda thing I want to rub into my skin on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>My face feels supple and soft after each application</li>
            <li>I gave this product a shot since other reviewers seemed to rave about the properties, but I really felt like I was just putting straight glycerin on my face-</li>
            <li>a pale person, I am plagued with having any flaw on my skin stand out significantly.</li>
            <li>Fortunately for me, it only lightened my skin slightly and flatteringly.</li>
            <li>But you only need a few drops to pat on your face for full coverage.</li>
            <li>As other reviews have covered, the stuff is really liquidy</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like the HadaLabo skincare line..this whitening lotion has made my skin nice and soft. Not only that but I do some whitening effect and acne scars are slowly disappearing. Will purchase more HadaLabo skincare.</li>
            <li> very good product with a awesome price</li>
            <li> Product arrived only two days after I placed my order! Quick service, great product. As other reviews have covered, the stuff is really liquidy but once you start applying it does get sticky, just pat it in until the stickiness subsides. Entire bottle is in Japanese, but it comes with a sticker on the cellophane wrap with English instructions, ingredients, and manufacturer info. Works great, also! I only applied it once, and it worked pretty well. I got it because I noticed I was getting darker from biking around, and my skin lightened up a shade or two just from that. Not sure if you should leave it on or wash it off, but I rinsed my face off after about half and hour and I&#x27;ve got to say that it worked a lot better than I was expecting. Face wasn&#x27;t dry, wasn&#x27;t irritated, wasn&#x27;t  negatively affected at all! Definitely buying more of this stuff once I run out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my fourth bottle at this point. I don&#x27;t know if it actually whitens but it helps keep my dry skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> I gave this product a shot since other reviewers seemed to rave about the properties, but I really felt like I was just putting straight glycerin on my face- it didn&#x27;t really hydrate and the product was sticky and non-absorbant.  I even woke up with sticky face the next day.  I bought the matching hyaluronic acid cream with it and same thing.  Not a good line of skin care if you ask me.</li>
            <li> This is the Toner so it&#x27;s very watery and usually drips down my arm before I can even apply it to my face lol. But you only need a few drops to pat on your face for full coverage. It&#x27;s very moisturizing but can get sticky if you don&#x27;t apply the Milk (Lotion/pink label. The Toner is blue labeled). No break outs so far! The Milk and Toner combo is perfect for my dry skin</li>
            <li> I bought this to make my skin brighter. I had a really fair skin before I moved to Honolulu. In Honolulu I enjoyed outdoor sooo much and I realized my skin so dull and looked rough.&lt;br /&gt;I found this product. After maybe around one month, I see my skin looks cleaner and better...but I think not as fair as before.&lt;br /&gt;Well...I&#x27;ll see the result after I finish this product.&lt;br /&gt;I gave 4 stars, because actually I feel good every morning after I applied this liquid on my face.</li>
            <li> Bought it because it got good reviews, I didn&#x27;t like the watery consistency but it did moisturize my skin pretty well.</li>
            <li> do not waste your money on this stuff. you might as well use water. I followed another review on amazon that gave instructions on how to use it since it only came in a foreign language and still...nothing.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer! The texture is more watery than what you would imagine a lotion to be. I only use about 5 drops each time so this bottle will last me for a while. I use it after I clean and wash my face. It is recommended that you gently pat it onto your face.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do ha. I use it in the morning in conjunction with the Arbutin Milk (aka moisturizer) and my face seems to have brightened over time.</li>
            <li> I found this stuff on a forum talking about skin care products that give the quickest results. This stuff wasn&#x27;t a letdown! I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually only gotten this recently, so I&#x27;m not sure about the moisturizing effect yet, I mean, it feels good, but I think I&#x27;ll need some more observational time to decide if it smooths out my skin or what... but! I did make a diy lotion mask from this, and I think I left it on for too long (I used to sleep with mask sometimes, so I left this on for 30 mins) but when I removed it, my face literally whitened. There was a clear line between where there was mask and on the edges of my face where the mask did not cover. The effect was so clear it was really surprising. I&#x27;ll keep on using it to be sure of how well it works otherwise.</li>
            <li> Considering I don&#x27;t understand a word of what&#x27;s written on the bottle, I worried about the whitening aspect of this stuff. If you&#x27;ve tried self-tanner before, you know that if you just slap it on without the proper instructions or experience you&#x27;ll end up looking like an alligator wearing orange knee and elbow pads. So I was a little worried that I&#x27;d end up with uneven light/dark patches if I didn&#x27;t put it on perfectly or evenly. Fortunately for me, it only lightened my skin slightly and flatteringly. Instead of looking noticeably paler, my face and neck look more even-toned. I&#x27;m only a tiny bit paler overall, but my skin looks like it glows a bit. No tricks or preparation to it - just apply it to your face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have extremely sensitive combination oily/dry skin which is prone to both eczema and breakouts (thanks a lot, parents). This moisturizer is so light and absorbent that I haven&#x27;t had a problem with either. I&#x27;m still not sure how often you should apply it - I&#x27;ve seen anything from twice a day to twice a week - but I&#x27;ve been using it every night for the past week with no ill affects. I noticed a big difference in skin tone after only two days of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very pleased. Especially considering I&#x27;m still not completely sure what I&#x27;m putting on my face...</li>
            <li> The active ingredient that whitens skin is arbutin, which has been associated with hydroquinone, a chemical previously used in skin-whitening products but has been banned in the EU as a carcinogen.    EDIT:  Source:  Active Ingredients Used in Cosmetics: Safety Survey by Council of Europe. Committee of Experts on Cosmetic Products (2008) (from page 34 onward) (can be found on google books). \\&quot;Hydroquinone has been classified by the IARC as a category 3 carcinogen,\\&quot; which means while it has produced cancer in animal studies, there is not enough data from humans yet. The recommended maximum concentration of arbutin in a product is 0.04%  The hada labo websites do not describe the concentration of arbutin in their products. Furthermore, arbutin is not regulated in the US and other countries the way it is in the EU.    Amazon does not allow external links in their reviews, but a quick google search will reveal scientific papers confirming that arbutin is hydrolyzed by skin bacteria to hydroquinone and that hydroquinone is carcinogenic, can be absorbed through the skin, and is under investigation by FDA.     The lotion itself, though runny, moisturizes very well, but it&#x27;s not the kinda thing I want to rub into my skin on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> As most reviewers said, this lotion is very watery and you don&#x27;t need a lot to cover the whole face. Nonetheless, it&#x27;s an excellent product. My T-zone is oily and this diminishes the shine. And not to mention, it does feel moisturizing. My face feels supple and soft after each application</li>
            <li> In Japan, lotion MEANS toner and milk MEANS the equivalent of American lotion. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so watery. Excellent product though and the toner (i.e. lotion) also contains Hyaluronic Acid so it too will be moisturizing...</li>
            <li> It takes a little while to get used to the texture of the products...they are thin but they work wonders and absorb into the skin quickly&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed my skin brightening and looking much more clear&lt;br /&gt;For the price it is an awesome product I would recommend it highly !</li>
            <li> when it comes to skin care products, japanese companies are the best. shirojun is not expensive, but keeps my skin as moist as the other expensive lotions do.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this out after reading a review left by Jin Joson,&lt;br /&gt;As a pale person, I am plagued with having any flaw on my skin stand out significantly. A light grey bruise-ish looking birthmark on the side of my face always bothered me, even though most people could barely tell it was there. It was located just on the cheekbone so I felt like the slightly darker color in that place made my face look unevenly contoured.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion totally takes care of that.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, my forever dry skin feels more supple and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Going to start bathing in it to see if it can even out the rest of my body&#x27;s skintone too!!!</li>
            <li> Honestly, I haven&#x27;t seen a huge whitening difference after using it for more than 2 years, but I still continue using it because I do think it helps with moisturizing my face. You&#x27;re supposed to pour a dime-sized amount on to clean palms, rub them together, then pat the product onto your face until it&#x27;s fully absorbed. Don&#x27;t use cotton pads.</li>
            <li> I use this often and I like it a lot.  4 stars because I don&#x27;t like how Amazon gives you no idea what is inside these products.  Make shopping easier Amazon, or affiliates! I do know now, because it has an in English, an ingredients list glued to the side. The only reason I ordered was because of a blogger recommendation. But c&#x27;mon! It&#x27;s In another language that uses characters, and on an English language website. Help a girl out.</li>
            <li> this is a really sticky toner,.the texture is really light and watery but after I apply it on my face it feels super super sticky.After few time use with the Hadalabo shirojyun Medicated Bihaku Whitening Cream my face started to break out terribly. Maybe its just not work for me D:</li>
