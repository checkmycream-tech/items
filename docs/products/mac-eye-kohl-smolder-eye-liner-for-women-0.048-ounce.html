            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>This pencil looks great and goes on so smoothly.  </li>
            <li>But it is real, genuine product.</li>
            <li>good packaging Appropriate for mail box, and nature protection&lt;</li>
            <li>a nice gift for a women.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes but this mac liner isnt the best had to burn the tip for darkey</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>It really is amazing and cheap for a MAC product!</li>
            <li>Love Love Love MAC makeup!</li>
            <li>This eyeliner did not go on very smoothly.  </li>
            <li>this eye pencil glides on easy and has a nice pigment to it.</li>
            <li>Supplier shipped quickly and the product arrived in good time.</li>
            <li>I LOVE MAC&#x27;s Smolder eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>Nothing more.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t count on these being authentic MAC pencils anymore.</li>
            <li>, my top liner would end up on my lower lid.</li>
            <li>I prefer Ulta&#x27;s eye liner for the softness, but this stays on a lot better.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>A 99 cent drugstore eyeliner does better than this one.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen anything in the product line that&#x27;s better</li>
            <li>Buyer, know that there are many M.A.C. knock offs</li>
            <li>May be ok for some ladies</li>
            <li>/&gt;The eyeliner Helps Enhance the look, and is secured many hours, is waterproof&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>I love Mac products and often purchase them at a discount on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Glides on nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Seems to be getting better</li>
            <li>the more I use it, softening the lead.</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>i am satisfied about the</li>
            <li>i love</li>
            <li>BUT I do love this SMOLDER.</li>
            <li>it could be used by any women and make their eyes more sexy and lovely</li>
            <li>but it is more on the gray side than I thought it would be as well.</li>
            <li>I use it every sinlge day :)</li>
            <li>I love MAC products and I swear by them.</li>
            <li>I really love this eyeliner alot and will buy again,</li>
            <li>I thought it would be better than other leading eye liner since Mac is an awesome product.</li>
            <li>fast and good service!!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It chips and splinters really easy.  </li>
            <li>Cap stays on, easy to use.</li>
            <li>Shipped super fast, but not the quality I was expecting after hearing so many good things about MAC products.</li>
            <li>MAC hands down makes the best kohl eyeliner out there.</li>
            <li>Its the best eyeliner MAC carries(aside from the black track gel liner)</li>
            <li>absolute favorite eyeliner!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a huge price difference.  </li>
            <li>Plus it is not smudge free...</li>
            <li>Smooth glide on and did not run.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean off.i</li>
            <li>Last all day wear and great quality</li>
            <li>although the prices may be cheap, you are not getting genuine products.</li>
            <li>The liner glides on smooth, and stays all day without smudging.  </li>
            <li>The Smolder goes on smoothly, evenly, and is long-lasting.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper and does not apply smoothly.</li>
            <li>This particular seller had a great price and FAST shipping.</li>
            <li>Love this product, just always pony up the dough and go to a true MAC supplier if you want to make sure you get the real thing.</li>
            <li>The liner lasts a long time, so $15 for an eyeliner that lasts a year or more is a good deal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this wasn&#x27;t even Mac.</li>
            <li>I removed my original review.</li>
            <li>originally bought this pencil at the Mac counter Macy&#x27;s</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s all off from the original product.</li>
            <li>This is my first MAC product and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Got this brand new kohl pencil in new packaging in great time</li>
            <li>Very bold black color, great for lining under the eyes.  </li>
            <li>great and what i expected</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for the prompt delivery :)</li>
            <li>product is hypoallergenic ... and is ideal for gifts or for everyday use</li>
            <li>This is a good basic eyeliner with no frills.</li>
            <li>Its like a lot of my other eyeliners, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it for full price but it was packaged very nice.</li>
            <li>I received it quickly and it was unopened new product 100% authentic.</li>
            <li>I can easily emulate what I see on people that I really like without using a lot of product or sticking myself in the eye.</li>
            <li>For the first time I ordered an eye liner online and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>i guess worth what i paid for.</li>
            <li>when it is freshly sharpened it slides on a bit easier but</li>
            <li>I was amazed by the intense color of this pen, it is very smooth, easy to apply and last all nignt!</li>
            <li>The original product goes on much smoother than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is definitely a superior choice to other makeups.  </li>
            <li>The product came right away, it was exactly as what was stated it would be.</li>
            <li>use it almost everyday.very soft and easily erased.</li>
            <li>I really like it very much !</li>
            <li>I need to buy cosmetics in the store first</li>
            <li>However, something was definitely off about this eyeliner and all in all I should have known better.  </li>
            <li>I am not entirely convinced this is truly an authentic MAC product.  </li>
            <li>I love anything MAC and this eyeliner is no different.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t purchased anything from Amazon since and will most definitely not buy makeup!!!</li>
            <li>Stays on long, washes off with relative ease and always looks great.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Been using this for the last 5 months love it just need to use a primer with it</li>
            <li>I gave it several days to be sure.  </li>
            <li>so I knew exactly what to expect.</li>
            <li>I was concerned that at this low of a price it would mot be authentic.</li>
            <li>I will but more in the future I think!</li>
            <li>Love this eye liner, it goes on smooth and dark</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different kohl eyeliner&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li>I have tried other liners and none go on and stay on as nice as this.</li>
            <li>You can easily smudge it when first applying, but later sets pretty well.</li>
            <li>Compared to ones I&#x27;ve had in the past, this one is good though.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner does a really nice job and gives me the black lining I am looking for.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t like it much.</li>
            <li>It comes so fast .I</li>
            <li>When I saw it on Amazon for much cheaper than their website</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely convinced this seller is selling fakes of M.A.C. eye kohl I&#x27;ve been using SMOLDER since I was 15</li>
            <li>I have really oily skin so at the end of the day</li>
            <li>Very beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Excellent company</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is real Mac products.</li>
            <li>I expected more from mac.</li>
            <li>highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and purchase permanent MAC items at the store so that you know you&#x27;re getting the real deal.</li>
            <li>Also, when I sharpen it, it break and I had to keep sharpening it and lost much of the pencil</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Turns out that NOBODY is legally authorized to sell MAC but MAC stores, their website, Nordstroms, and Saks Fifth Ave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like an eyeliner that only takes light pressure and one draw to apply.</li>
            <li>give you the whole raccoon eye look or make my eyes itchy.</li>
            <li>So when I found it on Amazon for much cheaper, I was ecstatic.</li>
            <li>MAC has a strict policy to sell its products only in genuine MAC stores or their online website.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for this awsome price!</li>
            <li>However, at least then you will know you are getting a \\&quot;real\\&quot; and good quality product.</li>
            <li>Always loved MAC stuff I&#x27;ve been using it for at least 7 years now.</li>
            <li>For the eyeliner that I received, the wood was a very cheap quality compared to other MAC eyeliners I have owned.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many other name brand eyeliners</li>
            <li>I have used other liners that are better.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth as all get out and stays on all day long.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite black eyeliners.</li>
            <li>My only issue is that is fades really quickly</li>
            <li>I bought this for cosplay purposes, Captain Jack Sparrow particularly.  </li>
            <li>I wish it was a little more water proof.</li>
            <li>Lovely long lasting texture.</li>
            <li>It takes a lot of application to get a good coat on which is frustrating if you are going for a heavier line.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something that was dark and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>The product said it was NEW, but it looks used and re-sharpened.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live with this.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is darkly pigmented, and goes on smooth with no tugging.  </li>
            <li>A bit light for a black kohl.</li>
            <li>While the pencil was sharpened, it had been clearly used.  </li>
            <li>I finally understand why there&#x27;s so much hype about MAC</li>
            <li>was too soft...</li>
            <li>The logo on the box when compared to a real MAC box is obviously counterfeit.</li>
            <li>This is far from what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>You get a huge long pencil, unlike other high end eyeliners.  </li>
            <li>This product came quickly and I know I&#x27;ll have it for a month or longer because even using it daily doesn&#x27;t wear it down as fast as the cheaper products.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is very smooth and very creamy, very black and will last you a long time.</li>
            <li>the top but the bottom not good ..</li>
            <li>I usually run over to Macy&#x27;s to get my eye pencil, but seeing as it was available on Amazon, I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this is some sort of fake style thing from the Mid East</li>
            <li>And the applicator isn&#x27;t soft enough.</li>
            <li>but I have no regrets.  </li>
            <li>BEWARE, spend the extra money and go directly to the MAC website, don&#x27;t put junk in your eyes or on your face.</li>
            <li>If the eye liner itself was a little softer it would be a nice color, but it is extremely hard and even trying it on my hand</li>
            <li>other MAC liners I have are much softer/smoother</li>
            <li>The color is NOT dark, it doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly, especially when I tried to wash it off...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super hard to tell and I wouldn&#x27;t take the chance.</li>
            <li>It is much tougher to use and I find I have to go over the line several times to get the dark shade I used to get.</li>
            <li>I wish it was a little more oil based, not so dry; I think it might go on a little smoother.</li>
            <li>I was excited it was not good for eye liner</li>
            <li>The color is very bold &amp; dramatic.</li>

            <li> My favorite eye liner ever!</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> This pencil looks great and goes on so smoothly.  </li>
            <li> But it is real, genuine product.</li>
            <li> good packaging Appropriate for mail box, and nature protection&lt;</li>
            <li> a nice gift for a women.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes but this mac liner isnt the best had to burn the tip for darkey</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> It really is amazing and cheap for a MAC product!</li>
            <li> Love Love Love MAC makeup!</li>
            <li> This eyeliner did not go on very smoothly.  </li>
            <li> this eye pencil glides on easy and has a nice pigment to it.</li>
            <li> Supplier shipped quickly and the product arrived in good time.</li>
            <li> I LOVE MAC&#x27;s Smolder eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> Nothing more.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t count on these being authentic MAC pencils anymore.</li>
            <li> , my top liner would end up on my lower lid.</li>
            <li> I prefer Ulta&#x27;s eye liner for the softness, but this stays on a lot better.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> A 99 cent drugstore eyeliner does better than this one.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen anything in the product line that&#x27;s better</li>
            <li> Buyer, know that there are many M.A.C. knock offs</li>
            <li> May be ok for some ladies</li>
            <li> /&gt;The eyeliner Helps Enhance the look, and is secured many hours, is waterproof&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> I love Mac products and often purchase them at a discount on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Glides on nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Seems to be getting better</li>
            <li> the more I use it, softening the lead.</li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> i am satisfied about the</li>
            <li> i love</li>
            <li> BUT I do love this SMOLDER.</li>
            <li> it could be used by any women and make their eyes more sexy and lovely</li>
            <li> but it is more on the gray side than I thought it would be as well.</li>
            <li> I use it every sinlge day :)</li>
            <li> I love MAC products and I swear by them.</li>
            <li> I really love this eyeliner alot and will buy again,</li>
            <li> I thought it would be better than other leading eye liner since Mac is an awesome product.</li>
            <li> fast and good service!!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It chips and splinters really easy.  </li>
            <li> Cap stays on, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Shipped super fast, but not the quality I was expecting after hearing so many good things about MAC products.</li>
            <li> MAC hands down makes the best kohl eyeliner out there.</li>
            <li> Its the best eyeliner MAC carries(aside from the black track gel liner)</li>
            <li> absolute favorite eyeliner!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a huge price difference.  </li>
            <li> Plus it is not smudge free...</li>
            <li> Smooth glide on and did not run.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean off.i</li>
            <li> Last all day wear and great quality</li>
            <li> although the prices may be cheap, you are not getting genuine products.</li>
            <li> The liner glides on smooth, and stays all day without smudging.  </li>
            <li> The Smolder goes on smoothly, evenly, and is long-lasting.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper and does not apply smoothly.</li>
            <li> This particular seller had a great price and FAST shipping.</li>
            <li> Love this product, just always pony up the dough and go to a true MAC supplier if you want to make sure you get the real thing.</li>
            <li> The liner lasts a long time, so $15 for an eyeliner that lasts a year or more is a good deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this wasn&#x27;t even Mac.</li>
            <li> I removed my original review.</li>
            <li> originally bought this pencil at the Mac counter Macy&#x27;s</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all off from the original product.</li>
            <li> This is my first MAC product and I love it.  </li>
            <li> Got this brand new kohl pencil in new packaging in great time</li>
            <li> Very bold black color, great for lining under the eyes.  </li>
            <li> great and what i expected</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for the prompt delivery :)</li>
            <li> product is hypoallergenic ... and is ideal for gifts or for everyday use</li>
            <li> This is a good basic eyeliner with no frills.</li>
            <li> Its like a lot of my other eyeliners, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it for full price but it was packaged very nice.</li>
            <li> I received it quickly and it was unopened new product 100% authentic.</li>
            <li> I can easily emulate what I see on people that I really like without using a lot of product or sticking myself in the eye.</li>
            <li> For the first time I ordered an eye liner online and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> i guess worth what i paid for.</li>
            <li> when it is freshly sharpened it slides on a bit easier but</li>
            <li> I was amazed by the intense color of this pen, it is very smooth, easy to apply and last all nignt!</li>
            <li> The original product goes on much smoother than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is definitely a superior choice to other makeups.  </li>
            <li> The product came right away, it was exactly as what was stated it would be.</li>
            <li> use it almost everyday.very soft and easily erased.</li>
            <li> I really like it very much !</li>
            <li> I need to buy cosmetics in the store first</li>
            <li> However, something was definitely off about this eyeliner and all in all I should have known better.  </li>
            <li> I am not entirely convinced this is truly an authentic MAC product.  </li>
            <li> I love anything MAC and this eyeliner is no different.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t purchased anything from Amazon since and will most definitely not buy makeup!!!</li>
            <li> Stays on long, washes off with relative ease and always looks great.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Been using this for the last 5 months love it just need to use a primer with it</li>
            <li> I gave it several days to be sure.  </li>
            <li> so I knew exactly what to expect.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that at this low of a price it would mot be authentic.</li>
            <li> I will but more in the future I think!</li>
            <li> Love this eye liner, it goes on smooth and dark</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different kohl eyeliner&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I have tried other liners and none go on and stay on as nice as this.</li>
            <li> You can easily smudge it when first applying, but later sets pretty well.</li>
            <li> Compared to ones I&#x27;ve had in the past, this one is good though.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner does a really nice job and gives me the black lining I am looking for.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like it much.</li>
            <li> It comes so fast .I</li>
            <li> When I saw it on Amazon for much cheaper than their website</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely convinced this seller is selling fakes of M.A.C. eye kohl I&#x27;ve been using SMOLDER since I was 15</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin so at the end of the day</li>
            <li> Very beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Excellent company</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is real Mac products.</li>
            <li> I expected more from mac.</li>
            <li> highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and purchase permanent MAC items at the store so that you know you&#x27;re getting the real deal.</li>
            <li> Also, when I sharpen it, it break and I had to keep sharpening it and lost much of the pencil</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Turns out that NOBODY is legally authorized to sell MAC but MAC stores, their website, Nordstroms, and Saks Fifth Ave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like an eyeliner that only takes light pressure and one draw to apply.</li>
            <li> give you the whole raccoon eye look or make my eyes itchy.</li>
            <li> So when I found it on Amazon for much cheaper, I was ecstatic.</li>
            <li> MAC has a strict policy to sell its products only in genuine MAC stores or their online website.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended for this awsome price!</li>
            <li> However, at least then you will know you are getting a \\&quot;real\\&quot; and good quality product.</li>
            <li> Always loved MAC stuff I&#x27;ve been using it for at least 7 years now.</li>
            <li> For the eyeliner that I received, the wood was a very cheap quality compared to other MAC eyeliners I have owned.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many other name brand eyeliners</li>
            <li> I have used other liners that are better.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth as all get out and stays on all day long.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite black eyeliners.</li>
            <li> My only issue is that is fades really quickly</li>
            <li> I bought this for cosplay purposes, Captain Jack Sparrow particularly.  </li>
            <li> I wish it was a little more water proof.</li>
            <li> Lovely long lasting texture.</li>
            <li> It takes a lot of application to get a good coat on which is frustrating if you are going for a heavier line.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that was dark and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> The product said it was NEW, but it looks used and re-sharpened.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live with this.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is darkly pigmented, and goes on smooth with no tugging.  </li>
            <li> A bit light for a black kohl.</li>
            <li> While the pencil was sharpened, it had been clearly used.  </li>
            <li> I finally understand why there&#x27;s so much hype about MAC</li>
            <li> was too soft...</li>
            <li> The logo on the box when compared to a real MAC box is obviously counterfeit.</li>
            <li> This is far from what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> You get a huge long pencil, unlike other high end eyeliners.  </li>
            <li> This product came quickly and I know I&#x27;ll have it for a month or longer because even using it daily doesn&#x27;t wear it down as fast as the cheaper products.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is very smooth and very creamy, very black and will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> the top but the bottom not good ..</li>
            <li> I usually run over to Macy&#x27;s to get my eye pencil, but seeing as it was available on Amazon, I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this is some sort of fake style thing from the Mid East</li>
            <li> And the applicator isn&#x27;t soft enough.</li>
            <li> but I have no regrets.  </li>
            <li> BEWARE, spend the extra money and go directly to the MAC website, don&#x27;t put junk in your eyes or on your face.</li>
            <li> If the eye liner itself was a little softer it would be a nice color, but it is extremely hard and even trying it on my hand</li>
            <li> other MAC liners I have are much softer/smoother</li>
            <li> The color is NOT dark, it doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly, especially when I tried to wash it off...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super hard to tell and I wouldn&#x27;t take the chance.</li>
            <li> It is much tougher to use and I find I have to go over the line several times to get the dark shade I used to get.</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little more oil based, not so dry; I think it might go on a little smoother.</li>
            <li> I was excited it was not good for eye liner</li>
            <li> The color is very bold &amp; dramatic.</li>
            <li> While this eyeliner is highly pigmented I find it to be slightly softer than the eyeliners I buy from MACs actual website.  </li>
            <li> I have discussed this product with professional make-up artists and they prefer it to other brands.  </li>
            <li> maybe a fake name brand on low quality product.. fell apart and liner crumbled easily,</li>
            <li> I was never able to really use this as it fell apart as I tried to use it.</li>
            <li> Not sure this was really Mac.  </li>
            <li> not sure if it is a real mac product however</li>
            <li> Applies silky and easy and isn&#x27;t too difficult to wash off</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take long before it runs on my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Last longer than other eye liner I bought.</li>
            <li> I would definitely purchase this eyeliner or any other  M.A.C. eyeliner again.</li>
            <li> But the first time I used the eye liner, it was so hard and sharp that I almost stabbed myself!</li>
            <li> Have used Mac eyeliners always, but this one is dry, very dry.</li>
            <li> Not soft like my other Mac eyeliners.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also pretty stiff so uncomfortable if you have sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> Big make up fan, so its the truth when I say it does not glide on not worth the money!</li>
            <li> Not really for me.</li>
            <li> But spend those extra few dollars and buy the Mac sharper as well.</li>
            <li> Not real</li>
            <li> My only problem is, it smudges a bit a few hours in.</li>
            <li> This goes on creamy and smooth and will go on thick or thin.  </li>
            <li> sorry, but I still have not tested long enough to give my opinion on this new product.</li>
            <li> I usually buy the waterproof one and this is not it, I gave it to my teen daughter</li>
            <li> I love Kohl pencils but was disappointed with this one.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t ever use any other.</li>
            <li> First I got the wrong color sent to me</li>
            <li> If you choose to buy this product on this site or other sites to get a better deal, you may likely get a fake inferior product with fake MAC packaging.  </li>
            <li> This is a fact:  It is illegal for anyone other than the real M.A.C. to sell their cosmetics.</li>
            <li> It takes a while for me to make it look dark.</li>
            <li> It was shouldering but not overly dark.</li>
            <li> I have plenty of boxed real products to compare this fake one too.&lt;br /&gt;BUYER</li>
            <li> Product does not stay on all day and is not worth purchasing as a specialty item.</li>
            <li> I am not a true make up wearer and do not understand alot of application and other techniques women get over the years from playing around</li>
            <li> It runs down your eyes.</li>
            <li> and it is a dark black.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so black.</li>
            <li> I knew it was not jet black when I ordered it</li>
            <li> If you wish, you can make the blackest of black lines.</li>
            <li> Goes on black, stays black through the day.  </li>
            <li> The black did not come off as a very dark black.</li>
            <li> This dumb person sent me a USED generic MAC eye pencil!</li>
            <li> Box was a little smooshed from shipping but</li>
            <li> Careful though, it can be hard to control sometimes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any trouble with the ones I&#x27;ve bought in the store or MAC counter.</li>
            <li> Not easy to apply at all.</li>
            <li> very dark black!!</li>
            <li> The seller offered me 25.00 to take down my negative comments.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed at first, but what else is it supposed to do?...just get it.</li>
            <li> Hardly goes on like the cheap crap...</li>
            <li> and I got lazy and didn&#x27;t want to go to MAC anymore and deal with the bitchy attitude and looks from those MAC girls</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I am convinced this is NOT the same product: in terms of consistency, color, boldness--</li>
            <li> But, just not a very good product at all.  </li>
            <li> Limited edition stuff, you may have to buy it on here, but , it is illegal for the seller to sell it.</li>
            <li> it was really hard for eye</li>
            <li> I have to press really hard and apply 3-4 times in order for it to show up.</li>
            <li> Not even cheap drugstore eyeliner goes on this horrible!</li>
            <li> Unless, you&#x27;re dishonest and are ripping people off.</li>
            <li> must&#x27;ve been through at least 10-12.</li>
            <li> Big waist of money for a fake!</li>
            <li> Usually eyeliner smudges on me like cray, but not this!</li>
            <li> I have to press very hard for it to show up, imagine having to press that hard on your eye........</li>
            <li> sorry :/</li>
            <li> Not happy with this Mac eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Too hard, very, very difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> It was terrible, and frankly I&#x27;d like my money back, and I&#x27;m not going to be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the color is faded when applied and it doesn&#x27;t work well in the waterline.</li>
            <li> You seriously can&#x27;t go wrong with this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> so I am a bit sad</li>
            <li> How could you go wrong?!</li>
            <li> THIS IS A FAKE MAC LINER!</li>
            <li> She harassed me in emails and demanded that I remove the bad review and accused me of being a competitor, another seller, which I am not.</li>
            <li> Bad purchase.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed when I received this eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I stupidly bought this from the seller, &amp;#34;super spa&amp;#34;, she is no longer selling it.</li>
            <li> I was appalled when she opened it and commented that it was used.</li>
            <li> This stuff was horrible!!!!</li>
            <li> It looks horrible under the lower lash area.....</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product!  Excellent transaction!</li>
            <li> I usually buy the waterproof one and this is not it, I gave it to my teen daughter and she likes it.</li>
            <li> I need to buy cosmetics in the store first where I can see if I need it, weather it matches my skin etc. Kelley</li>
            <li> I am used to Urban decay&#x27;s 24/7 and wanted to give this mac kohl  try but I don&#x27;t like it much. It takes a while for me to make it look dark. And the applicator isn&#x27;t soft enough. Plus it is not smudge free... Not really for me.</li>
            <li> I think the quality of the product didn&#x27;t match the quality I am used to from this brand name... maybe a fake name brand on low quality product.. fell apart and liner crumbled easily, sorry :/</li>
            <li> O que eu posso dizer da MAC? A melhor maquiagem... Pena custar tão caro no Brasil.&lt;br /&gt;Esse lapis é bem macio e pigmenta muito bem. Uma maravilha para esfumar e substitui o delineador...</li>
            <li> The MAC pencil I purchased from this seller was advertised as \\&quot;brand new\\&quot; and in fact, it wasn&#x27;t.  While the pencil was sharpened, it had been clearly used.  Would NEVER purchase from this seller again!</li>
            <li> I bought this last week.It comes so fast .I use it almost everyday.very soft and easily erased.I&#x27;m happy buying this product.maybe I will get another one.</li>
            <li> I LOVE MAC&#x27;s Smolder eyeliner.  When I saw it on Amazon for much cheaper than their website I was ecstatic.  That&#x27;s a huge price difference.  However, something was definitely off about this eyeliner and all in all I should have known better.  While this eyeliner is highly pigmented I find it to be slightly softer than the eyeliners I buy from MACs actual website.  It doesn&#x27;t take long before it runs on my eyes.  For the eyeliner that I received, the wood was a very cheap quality compared to other MAC eyeliners I have owned.  It chips and splinters really easy.  I am not entirely convinced this is truly an authentic MAC product.  However, if it is then it must have been their \\&quot;duds\\&quot; that came off of their production line.  That would make sense considering the price comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I have found that since I have purchased this from Amazon I don&#x27;t use it anymore.  I prefer my cheaper Cover Girl eyeliners from my local drugstore.  It&#x27;s a shame too because this was my go-to eyeliner.  So until I get another one from an actual MAC store then I think I am just going to trash the one I got on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I would recommend this eyeliner...BUT, I would recommend going to an actual MAC store or their website.  I know it sucks to put out a few more dollars for something.  However, at least then you will know you are getting a \\&quot;real\\&quot; and good quality product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this wasn&#x27;t even Mac. It was terrible, and frankly I&#x27;d like my money back, and I&#x27;m not going to be ordering again.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is the bomb dot com! I love anything MAC and this eyeliner is no different.I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This liner is what it says it is. Nothing more. I was a little disappointed at first, but what else is it supposed to do?...just get it. Ou know ou want Mac cosmetics ..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this is some sort of fake style thing from the Mid East but it still works awesome for the price :) the shipping took a week but, again for the priced it rocked!</li>
            <li> Edit: I removed my original review. This listing has changed drastically since I ordered mine 3 years ago. The price is different, the images are different, lots of things are different. I wouldn&#x27;t count on these being authentic MAC pencils anymore. It&#x27;s super hard to tell and I wouldn&#x27;t take the chance. Dropping the rating.</li>
            <li> This dumb person sent me a USED generic MAC eye pencil! The product said it was NEW, but it looks used and re-sharpened. I haven&#x27;t purchased anything from Amazon since and will most definitely not buy makeup!!! I give this rating ZERO STARS. thank you.</li>
            <li> The product came right away, it was exactly as what was stated it would be. Works like it should. I would recommend and would buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely convinced this seller is selling fakes of M.A.C. eye kohl I&#x27;ve been using SMOLDER since I was 15 (I&#x27;m 21!) and I got lazy and didn&#x27;t want to go to MAC anymore and deal with the bitchy attitude and looks from those MAC girls so I got it from this seller. BIG MISTAKE. I&#x27;ve never had any trouble with the ones I&#x27;ve bought in the store or MAC counter. This stuff was horrible!!!! The color is NOT dark, it doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly, especially when I tried to wash it off...it came off on my eyes all clumpy! Not even cheap drugstore eyeliner goes on this horrible! I&#x27;m so upset I just didn&#x27;t get off my ass and get it at the MAC store. Big waist of money for a fake! Don&#x27;t make my mistake!</li>
            <li> I love Kohl pencils but was disappointed with this one. It good but its not mindblowing. Doesn&#x27;t give the effect some of my cheaper pencils do . it doesnot smudge so that is one good aspect.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be better than other leading eye liner since Mac is an awesome product. I have really oily skin so at the end of the day, my top liner would end up on my lower lid.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this product but I have no regrets.  This eyeliner does a really nice job and gives me the black lining I am looking for.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Excellent company</li>
            <li> Best eye-liner I&#x27;ve ever used. Bye bye drug store brands! I finally understand why there&#x27;s so much hype about MAC make up.. it&#x27;s actually really good! And for the price compared to in-store?! How could you go wrong?!</li>
            <li> I was amazed by the intense color of this pen, it is very smooth, easy to apply and last all nignt!</li>
            <li> Not saying that they aren&#x27;t good-- they are. But the first time I used the eye liner, it was so hard and sharp that I almost stabbed myself! I prefer Ulta&#x27;s eye liner for the softness, but this stays on a lot better.</li>
            <li> Of Course makes great products, but I just LOVE this pen.  I glides so nice and color is beautiful!  LOVE LOVE LOVE IT.  Box was a little smooshed from shipping but not Mac or sellers fault.  Thank you so much for the prompt delivery :)</li>
            <li> As a long-time user of MAC products, this eye kohl is the ultimate product.  Stays on long, washes off with relative ease and always looks great.  Great for the &#x27;smoky eye&#x27; look.</li>
            <li> Its like a lot of my other eyeliners, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it for full price but it was packaged very nice.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite black eyeliners. Smolder from MAC goes on great and it is a dark black.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is real Mac products.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the eyeliner is great! I wish it was a little more water proof. The thickness and darkness is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> this eye pencil glides on easy and has a nice pigment to it. But that&#x27;s all it has going for it. It runs down your eyes. I expected more from mac. I will not be repurchasing this eye liner again. A 99 cent drugstore eyeliner does better than this one.</li>
            <li> shipped really fast, got it a few days after I made the purchase.  I love this mac pencil and at this price you just can&#x27;t beat it! highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Applies smoothly, great for lines or smudges around your eyes. Cap stays on, easy to use. I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner! Best eyeliner I have ever used</li>
            <li> I have discussed this product with professional make-up artists and they prefer it to other brands.  If you are looking for smudge then this is for you.  It goes on great and then after an hour or two under eye smudge. This happens even when I apply a great eye fix cream.  Mac has a terrific reputation, I don&#x27;t get it.  I have tried some of their eye products over the years on and off.  Haven&#x27;t seen anything in the product line that&#x27;s better</li>
            <li> I was never able to really use this as it fell apart as I tried to use it. I resharpened the tip, tried again, same result.</li>
            <li> This is a fact:  It is illegal for anyone other than the real M.A.C. to sell their cosmetics. Buyer, know that there are many M.A.C. knock offs just as Louis Vouitton has numerous Knock Offs. Do yourself a favor and purchase permanent MAC items at the store so that you know you&#x27;re getting the real deal. Limited edition stuff, you may have to buy it on here, but , it is illegal for the seller to sell it. Just know that. Call MAC at their number on their website and check to see if they have an amazon account before buying your products. Chances are, they don&#x27;t. I&#x27;m not saying that all the makeup on amazon is counterfeit, but, I know for a fact that some of it is. This review is not of any one product or company selling on here. If you are legit, than this cautionary statement shouldn&#x27;t bother you. Unless, you&#x27;re dishonest and are ripping people off.</li>
            <li> Did not like it... May be ok for some ladies but I wasn&#x27;t one of them&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like the raccoon eyes it left.. was too soft... worked good&lt;br /&gt;on the top but the bottom not good ..</li>
            <li> Not sure this was really Mac.  Not soft like my other Mac eyeliners.  Just not convinced.  Lid does not stay on.</li>
            <li> originally bought this pencil at the Mac counter Macy&#x27;s and it&#x27;s supposedly the same one but  does not go on the same way at all.</li>
            <li> It smears periodically</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner! Very bold black color, great for lining under the eyes.  Applies silky and easy and isn&#x27;t too difficult to wash off</li>
            <li> Excellent: cost, quality and delivery of the product.&lt;br /&gt;Good delivery date of the product&lt;br /&gt;Very good packaging Appropriate for mail box, and nature protection&lt;br /&gt;The product is hypoallergenic ... and is ideal for gifts or for everyday use&lt;br /&gt;The eyeliner Helps Enhance the look, and is secured many hours, is waterproof&lt;br /&gt;Purchase: recommended 100%&lt;br /&gt;Good experience in purchasing</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this eyeliner.  It was shouldering but not overly dark. Smooth glide on and did not run.  Easy to clean off.i will buy it again.</li>
            <li> My daughter will only use Mac eyeliner loves the way it goes on and stays on.  Last all day wear and great quality</li>
            <li> The only eyeliner that works for me. Love it!</li>
            <li> One of the best kohls I have used. But spend those extra few dollars and buy the Mac sharper as well. It is after all a pencil. Lovely long lasting texture.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading an article where it was used and wanted to mimic the technique. Unfortunately, the color is faded when applied and it doesn&#x27;t work well in the waterline. Also, when I sharpen it, it break and I had to keep sharpening it and lost much of the pencil</li>
            <li> I love Mac products and often purchase them at a discount on Amazon. Saves me a lot of money for a wonderful product. Thanks!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an eyeliner that smudges, this eyeliner is for you. Careful though, it can be hard to control sometimes.</li>
            <li> Glides on nice and smooth. Great staying power. Fast shipping. And great price. I will be repurchasing this item again. Try it</li>
            <li> Love Love Love MAC makeup! This product came quickly and I know I&#x27;ll have it for a month or longer because even using it daily doesn&#x27;t wear it down as fast as the cheaper products. Can&#x27;t wait to buy more!</li>
            <li> I really like it. it smudges, but I still liek it.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A FAKE MAC LINER! I WEAR MAC SMOLDER AND IT IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT COLOR PENCIL TIP AND IT IS SOFTER AND GOES ON DARKER! FRAUD</li>
            <li> Change from waxy eyeliners. Great for smoky eyes.</li>
            <li> A bit light for a black kohl. Seems to be getting better the more I use it, softening the lead.</li>
            <li> You seriously can&#x27;t go wrong with this eyeliner. Its the best eyeliner MAC carries(aside from the black track gel liner)</li>
            <li> Shipped super fast, but not the quality I was expecting after hearing so many good things about MAC products. It takes a lot of application to get a good coat on which is frustrating if you are going for a heavier line. It&#x27;s also pretty stiff so uncomfortable if you have sensitive eyes. I don&#x27;t regret spending 15 bucks to try it out, but i won&#x27;t be ordering this product again.</li>
            <li> Been using this for the last 5 months love it just need to use a primer with it</li>
            <li> My favorite eye liner ever! This stuff is it. I won&#x27;t ever use any other. It stays on forever and it&#x27;s so black. I have tried so many other name brand eyeliners this is the blackest one I have ever found. I won&#x27;t ever go back!</li>
            <li> For the first time I ordered an eye liner online and was not disappointed. Got this brand new kohl pencil in new packaging in great time</li>
            <li> when I saw mac liner I was excited it was not good for eye liner it can be a good pencil it was really hard for eye</li>
            <li> I stupidly bought this from the seller, &amp;#34;super spa&amp;#34;, she is no longer selling it. Turns out the item shipped to me was a counterfeit product. The logo on the box when compared to a real MAC box is obviously counterfeit. Turns out that NOBODY is legally authorized to sell MAC but MAC stores, their website, Nordstroms, and Saks Fifth Ave.&lt;br /&gt;So although the prices may be cheap, you are not getting genuine products. The seller offered me 25.00 to take down my negative comments. She harassed me in emails and demanded that I remove the bad review and accused me of being a competitor, another seller, which I am not. I am simply a MAC junky. I have plenty of boxed real products to compare this fake one too.&lt;br /&gt;BUYER BEWARE, spend the extra money and go directly to the MAC website, don&#x27;t put junk in your eyes or on your face.</li>
            <li> This pencil looks great and goes on so smoothly.  No musss, no fuss.  I would purchse again in a heartbeat</li>
            <li> absolute favorite eyeliner!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t had any problem. very good</li>
            <li> got here promptly. works ok. i guess worth what i paid for. not sure if it is a real mac product however</li>
            <li> Always loved MAC stuff I&#x27;ve been using it for at least 7 years now. Last longer than other eye liner I bought.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner did not go on very smoothly.  I like an eyeliner that only takes light pressure and one draw to apply. This was not the case with this eyeliner.  I went back to Cover Girl.</li>
            <li> Usually I&#x27;m very satisfied with MAC&#x27;s product quality but this eyeliner is GARBAGE! It doesn&#x27;t even stay on even with primer!</li>
            <li> i am satisfied about the fast and good service!!&lt;br /&gt;The product is incredible for me!! very dark black!! i love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;i definitely recomended for all the person!!!</li>
            <li> It compares to what you buy from Maybelline. Product does not stay on all day and is not worth purchasing as a specialty item.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live with this. Must have if I were stranded on an island this is what I&#x27;d take.</li>
            <li> Stays put. Doen&#x27;t give you the whole raccoon eye look or make my eyes itchy. The color is very bold &amp; dramatic. I don&#x27;t know if i&#x27;d say it&#x27;s smudgable/blendable....but it&#x27;s a descent eyeliner. Esp for the price Amazon has it listed. :D</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that was dark and easy to apply. This is far from what I was looking for. I have to press really hard and apply 3-4 times in order for it to show up. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes but this mac liner isnt the best had to burn the tip for darkey look to!</li>
            <li> I have been using this smolder kohl eyeliner from MAC for YEARS ... must&#x27;ve been through at least 10-12. So when I found it on Amazon for much cheaper, I was ecstatic. Unfortunately I am convinced this is NOT the same product: in terms of consistency, color, boldness-- it&#x27;s all off from the original product. It is much tougher to use and I find I have to go over the line several times to get the dark shade I used to get. The original product goes on much smoother than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Too hard, very, very difficult to apply. If the eye liner itself was a little softer it would be a nice color, but it is extremely hard and even trying it on my hand I have to press very hard for it to show up, imagine having to press that hard on your eye........</li>
            <li> Usually eyeliner smudges on me like cray, but not this! It really is amazing and cheap for a MAC product!</li>
            <li> got 2 for a quarter of the price, excellent service, excellent quality. Would recommend to any one wanting to try this product.</li>
            <li> It smears if you use an eyelash curler.  It looks horrible under the lower lash area.....smudges all over the place.  I gave it several days to be sure.  But, just not a very good product at all.  Oh, well.  Keep looking.</li>
            <li> I have always used MAC eye kohl liners and was expecting this to work just as wonderfully as all the rest.  I was really disappointed when I received this eyeliner.  It doesn&#x27;t work at all.  I have to dip it into a gel liner to get it to show up at all.  Bad purchase.</li>
            <li> Big make up fan, so its the truth when I say it does not glide on not worth the money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this eyeliner before so I knew exactly what to expect. I received it quickly and it was unopened new product 100% authentic.</li>
            <li> Works well. I was concerned that at this low of a price it would mot be authentic. But it is real, genuine product. Great price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I like the way this eyeliner goes on and stays on. The color is perfect. I would order this again.</li>
            <li> How embarrassing, I bought this as a gift. I was appalled when she opened it and commented that it was used.</li>
            <li> This is my first MAC product and I love it.  The liner glides on smooth, and stays all day without smudging.  I have tried other liners and none go on and stay on as nice as this.</li>
            <li> Not real MAC-- doesn&#x27;t go on, like the eyeliner from the store or counter!!!</li>
            <li> Not happy with this Mac eyeliner. Have used Mac eyeliners always, but this one is dry, very dry. Not easy to apply at all.</li>
            <li> I am not a true make up wearer and do not understand alot of application and other techniques women get over the years from playing around BUT I do love this SMOLDER. I can easily emulate what I see on people that I really like without using a lot of product or sticking myself in the eye.</li>
            <li> I have used other liners that are better. The black did not come off as a very dark black. I was disappointed with my purchase.</li>
            <li> First I got the wrong color sent to me and I KNOW mac smolder and this is NOT it. Hardly goes on like the cheap crap...</li>
            <li> MAC hands down makes the best kohl eyeliner out there. The Smolder goes on smoothly, evenly, and is long-lasting.  Can also be smudged to create a smoky eye look.  This particular seller had a great price and FAST shipping. Was very pleased! :)</li>
            <li> This does not look and feel like the actual MAC eye pencil that I am used to using. It&#x27;s cheaper and does not apply smoothly. I usually run over to Macy&#x27;s to get my eye pencil, but seeing as it was available on Amazon, I gave it a try. Not the same quality pencil, I am actually tempted to return it because I feel it was a cheap generic rip-off. Hope Amazon can do something about this. This is what I get for purchasing MAC products on Amazon.</li>
            <li> a nice gift for a women. it could be used by any women and make their eyes more sexy and lovely</li>
            <li> when it is freshly sharpened it slides on a bit easier but other MAC liners I have are much softer/smoother so I am a bit sad this one is not the same. I knew it was not jet black when I ordered it but it is more on the gray side than I thought it would be as well.</li>
            <li> great and what i expected and i would order again if i needed to have a good day thank you</li>
            <li> I love this eye liner!!!  You get a huge long pencil, unlike other high end eyeliners.  This goes on creamy and smooth and will go on thick or thin.  I will buy this over and over again.  It&#x27;s the perfect color for that smokey look.</li>
            <li> love it! I use it every sinlge day :)</li>
            <li> I really like it very much ! it&#x27;s very good and useful! I will but more in the future I think!</li>
            <li> Love this eye liner, it goes on smooth and dark, it is a good pencil to smudge for a smokey eye look.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is very smooth and very creamy, very black and will last you a long time. My only issue is that is fades really quickly</li>
            <li> This eye liner definitely makes a statement when applied. If you wish, you can make the blackest of black lines. I wish it was a little more oil based, not so dry; I think it might go on a little smoother.</li>
            <li> Loved it! I&#x27;ve tried many different kohl eyeliner&lt;br /&gt;. This is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> MAC kohl eyeliner is a great product.  You can easily smudge it when first applying, but later sets pretty well. Great for smoky eye and water-line. MAC has a strict policy to sell its products only in genuine MAC stores or their online website.  If you choose to buy this product on this site or other sites to get a better deal, you may likely get a fake inferior product with fake MAC packaging.  Love this product, just always pony up the dough and go to a true MAC supplier if you want to make sure you get the real thing. The liner lasts a long time, so $15 for an eyeliner that lasts a year or more is a good deal.</li>
            <li> This Eye Liner is perfect. It goes on perfect everytime! And wears all day! Highly recommended for this awsome price!</li>
            <li> I love MAC products and I swear by them. This is a good basic eyeliner with no frills. My only problem is, it smudges a bit a few hours in. Compared to ones I&#x27;ve had in the past, this one is good though.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth as all get out and stays on all day long. I really love this eyeliner alot and will buy again,</li>
            <li> Dear sirs,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sorry, but I still have not tested long enough to give my opinion on this new product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for cosplay purposes, Captain Jack Sparrow particularly.  This is definitely a superior choice to other makeups.  Goes on black, stays black through the day.  Very easy to apply.  I can see why this was a favourite of women through the decades.  Nothing beats kohl.  Supplier shipped quickly and the product arrived in good time.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is darkly pigmented, and goes on smooth with no tugging.  I would definitely purchase this eyeliner or any other  M.A.C. eyeliner again.</li>
