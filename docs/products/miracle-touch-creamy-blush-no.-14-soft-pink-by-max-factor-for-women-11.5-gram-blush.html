            <li>It gives a very natural look and blends wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice consistency; I don&#x27;t like many of the cream blushes on the market because they are too sticky, this is not.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how lovely and creamy</li>
            <li>like this product and will order more from Amazon.</li>
            <li>BUT, I put some on and I have to tell you it&#x27;s just lovely.  </li>
            <li>This was a Lisa Eldridge recommendation and I do love it.</li>
            <li>This is a nice light creamy blush that can be &amp;#34;built up&amp;#34; to make a darker shade if that is wanted, or applied once.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this cream blush.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Very very soft and blends beautifully.  </li>
            <li>I thought when I first saw it that it would be to bright</li>
            <li>Lovely colour, easy to apply, blends well, lasts all day</li>
            <li>Cheeks may appear too bright at first because you have to rub it on but just blend lightly, wait a minute</li>
            <li>The application is always smooth and looks healthy.  </li>
            <li>Great for my &#x27;mature&#x27; skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very very fair and my hair is silver white, with light eyes</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>powdered blushes make fine lines when I smile.  </li>
            <li>you have a large budget and like cream blush, my all-time favorite is La Prairie cream blush.  </li>
            <li>I keep it in my gym bag for a quick look, using it on my lips or cheeks.  </li>
            <li>It is a very pretty color.  </li>
            <li>The color is very pretty.</li>
            <li>My new favorite blush.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easy and really looks nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It blends very smoothly, whether it&#x27;s applied to bare skin or layered over foundation (works with my bareMinerals Original Foundation SPF; Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer; and my Laura Mercier Moisture Supreme Foundation).</li>
            <li>Anyway, this is a very nice replacement and the coloring is very flattering for fair skin, dark blonde hair coloring.</li>
            <li>You need a light touch as the color can become quite intense.</li>
            <li>The color is lovely and soft on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Got it when promised and tried it out right away.</li>
            <li>I ad just a touch more of the Max Factor cream blush and with such a small amount I have wonderful soft glowing</li>
            <li>This is so easy to blend and looks so natural.</li>
            <li>When I first opened the box from Amazon (which contained another item I ordered)</li>
            <li>It gives just the right amount of pink or blush when you need it and blends VERY easily.</li>
            <li>: I found this easy to apply and really like how natural the color looks on me.</li>
            <li>I am 65 year old and have been using powder blushes for most of my adult life.  </li>
            <li>I really like this cream blush.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love this color, purely based it on other reviews for a cream blush, as an alternative blush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pale with yellow undertones and it works great.</li>
            <li>Great color compromise - a little pink plus coral</li>
            <li>The color is a nice peachy pink, not too orange, but no blue undertones.  </li>
            <li>It looks very natural even in winter.</li>
            <li>It only takes a super small amount and it blends in easily.</li>
            <li>As a woman with &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; skin I appreciate the fact that it  does not &amp;#34;settle&amp;#34; into any fine lines or look odd on my skin.  </li>
            <li>A soft blush that looks very natural.</li>
            <li>The Max Factor Creamy Blush goes in easily in a clear wash of color.</li>
            <li>color description: vibrant but sheer reddish-coral.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I saw it advertised on a video by a British makeup artist who was intensifying the beauty of an older model.</li>
            <li>Wish I could find it where I live - Will definitely be purchasing again!!!</li>
            <li>Blending ability like no other.</li>
            <li>little goes a long way so use it lightly on your checks for a sunny appearance.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money; wish they had it it the US - hard to find here.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t like the powder blushes which leave too much product and hard to blend.</li>
            <li> usually apply a little right after I have smoothed on moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Better and less expensive than the top brands in my opinion</li>
            <li> Easier to avoid the dry clownish look you can get from powder blush.</li>
            <li> The container is really small but it will last a long while because a lil goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pinky coral and would work for a wide range of skin tones.</li>
            <li> It still comes off too pink for me.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It does fade over time, but it lasts longer than other powder blushes I have used.</li>
            <li> Recently, I have not liked they way</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Goes on not to transparently, not too dark.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Too pink and not easy to spread across the cheeks.</li>
            <li> only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because the product is VERY SMALL.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> The pot is a bit small, but it&#x27;s concentrated.  </li>
            <li> I sometimes mix it with a silky highlighter just to thin it out and make it easier to spread, but that is not necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Wonderful shade and easy to apply. Wish Max Factor was sold in the US.</li>
            <li> Liked the way it goes on but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how lovely and creamy this product is.  I keep it in my gym bag for a quick look, using it on my lips or cheeks.  It gives a very natural look and blends wonderfully.  Wish I could find it where I live - Will definitely be purchasing again!!!</li>
            <li> Purchased this after watching L.E.&#x27;s video on Youtube.  The pot is a bit small, but it&#x27;s concentrated.  The color is a nice peachy pink, not too orange, but no blue undertones.  Just like in the video.  It has a nice consistency; I don&#x27;t like many of the cream blushes on the market because they are too sticky, this is not.  I sometimes mix it with a silky highlighter just to thin it out and make it easier to spread, but that is not necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a large budget and like cream blush, my all-time favorite is La Prairie cream blush.  Silky, goes on like a dream, and nice colors.  But then, last time I bought that it was $70.  (Though it did last for years.)  Anyway, this is a very nice replacement and the coloring is very flattering for fair skin, dark blonde hair coloring.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only knocking off one star b/c if the size -- it&#x27;s tiny! But everything else about it is great. It blends very smoothly, whether it&#x27;s applied to bare skin or layered over foundation (works with my bareMinerals Original Foundation SPF; Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer; and my Laura Mercier Moisture Supreme Foundation).</li>
            <li> Great color compromise - a little pink plus coral&lt;br /&gt;Better and less expensive than the top brands in my opinion</li>

            <li> I am 65 year old and have been using powder blushes for most of my adult life.  Recently, I have not liked they way powdered blushes make fine lines when I smile.  So in search of creamy blushes I came across Max Factor Miracle Touch creamy blush and I am very pleased with this product.  A small amount goes a long way.  The color is lovely and soft on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually apply a little right after I have smoothed on moisturizer.  Then I apply the powder foundation over the blush.  Once finished I ad just a touch more of the Max Factor cream blush and with such a small amount I have wonderful soft glowing look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product and will order more from Amazon.</li>
            <li> My new favorite blush.  I&#x27;m stocking up in case it they stop making it.</li>
            <li> The Max Factor Creamy Blush goes in easily in a clear wash of color. You need a light touch as the color can become quite intense.</li>
            <li> color description: vibrant but sheer reddish-coral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;review: I found this easy to apply and really like how natural the color looks on me.</li>
            <li> This product was demonstrated on a website and sounded good.  It is a very pretty color.  It goes on easy and really looks nice.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because the product is VERY SMALL.  When I first opened the box from Amazon (which contained another item I ordered) I thought this was a sample they had thrown in.  But no, it was the $16 product!  Beware</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize it was coming from overseas so it took a while BUT, I put some on and I have to tell you it&#x27;s just lovely.  Very very soft and blends beautifully.  Looks like a &amp;#34;born with it&amp;#34; blush to the cheek.  I&#x27;m very very fair and my hair is silver white, with light eyes and it works perfectly with my skin tone, hair color and eye color.</li>
            <li> Small package, but rich color, so it&#x27;s appropriately small. Great color and consistency. Goes on not to transparently, not too dark.</li>
            <li> I like this product but I don&#x27;t think that I would bother ordering it again as it took a while to get it here. I believe Max Factor now comes out of Europe.</li>
            <li> Shade works well with my olive skin. It looks very natural even in winter.</li>
            <li> This was a Lisa Eldridge recommendation and I do love it. It&#x27;s a pinky coral and would work for a wide range of skin tones. I&#x27;m very pale with yellow undertones and it works great. Nice creamy formula too.</li>
            <li> This product makes you look as if the sun has kissed your face.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way so use it lightly on your checks for a sunny appearance.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love this color, purely based it on other reviews for a cream blush, as an alternative blush. It still comes off too pink for me. The consistency is good. I&#x27;ll reserve this for a suntan in the summer.</li>
            <li> This is a nice light creamy blush that can be &amp;#34;built up&amp;#34; to make a darker shade if that is wanted, or applied once.  It all depends on personal preference.  As a woman with &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; skin I appreciate the fact that it  does not &amp;#34;settle&amp;#34; into any fine lines or look odd on my skin.  I use it over a tinted moisturizer during the day.  The application is always smooth and looks healthy.  I&#x27;m told it looks &amp;#34;beautiful&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Too pink and not easy to spread across the cheeks. It isn&#x27;t creamy at all.</li>
            <li> No comments at all,  original items perfect response and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream blush. I apply it using a brush. It only takes a super small amount and it blends in easily. The color is really beautiful! It does fade over time, but it lasts longer than other powder blushes I have used. I wish it lasted from morning until bedtime, but I don&#x27;t think anything does.</li>
            <li> It gives just the right amount of pink or blush when you need it and blends VERY easily. I saw it advertised on a video by a British makeup artist who was intensifying the beauty of an older model.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Lovely colour, easy to apply, blends well, lasts all day</li>
            <li> I am using my husbands account. I love this cream blush. The color is very pretty. I thought when I first saw it that it would be to bright but it&#x27;s not once it&#x27;s applied to your cheek. The container is really small but it will last a long while because a lil goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Got it when promised and tried it out right away. It is an amazing product. Love it. Its a must get.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the powder blushes which leave too much product and hard to blend. This is so easy to blend and looks so natural. Blending ability like no other.Well worth the money; wish they had it it the US - hard to find here.</li>
            <li> The only blush that doesn&#x27;t make me look like a clown. Great for my &#x27;mature&#x27; skin. I love it! I hope it lasts because it&#x27;s currently unavailable. A small amount goes a long way. Very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> A soft blush that looks very natural. Easier to avoid the dry clownish look you can get from powder blush.</li>
