            <li>The reviews were great for the shampoo, supplements and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Hair stylist recommended this brand product to me (vitamins) and I decided to try this very nice moisturizing conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I am not noticing any magnificent difference, but I am not noticing any greater hair loss either.  </li>
            <li>good luck üçÄ with that.</li>
            <li>It was a fairly good product.  </li>
            <li>After I started using the shampoo and conditionerr i noticed an even better results!  </li>
            <li>Detangles my hair and leaves it feeling nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Nice smell though.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and the conditioner leave my hair smelling wonderful and feeling so soft.</li>
            <li>Product seemed OK to me.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not in love with the smell.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m honestly only subscribing to this product along with the shampoo because it&#x27;s recommended that these two products be used in conjunction with the oral supplements because work best when used together.</li>
            <li>love this conditioner</li>
            <li>Love It</li>
            <li>and she couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
            <li>It was ok...</li>
            <li>I lost more hair doing this-</li>
            <li>I love the system.</li>
            <li>So healthy and strong.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair look pretty nice</li>
            <li>It leaves her hair clean, silky and easy to comb after the shower.  </li>
            <li>What good is a product that is supposed to help you to grow better hair when all it does is damage your current hair?  </li>
            <li>after much research into products for thinning hair and trying many with no result, I found Viviscal.</li>
            <li>I love this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the help!!</li>
            <li>For those of you that don&#x27;t know, full, thick beautiful hair is a great perk of pregnancy and this shampoo and conditioner has cut down on her hair loss, which was frequent at times.  </li>
            <li>, I recommend it to any and everyone that&#x27;s looking to grow healthy long hair.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really say this is a moisturizering conditioner</li>
            <li>However I will state this much at this point, my hair does not fall out as much, but I can&#x27;t say I have a lot of knew growth.</li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner makes my hair really soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I quit with it completely!!</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and she has been very pleased with the product and all it promised to do, it delivered.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, so far I enjoy the product.</li>
            <li>She would highly recommend for any hair type, as her&#x27;s is long, straight and colored.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li>I‚Äôm too busy to spend minutes banging a container against my hand to get it out of a bottle.  </li>
            <li>My hair would still be all tangled and didn&#x27;t seem soft.</li>
            <li>As far as the supplements are concerned, it&#x27;s too early to comment on their efficacy.</li>
            <li>I used this shampoo just conditioner, only to have my fine hair turn into a matted mess of snarls, impenetrable by a detangling comb.  </li>
            <li>This product, and its counterpart shampoo, are dangerous for fine or baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li>There are no strong scents but a clean smell.  </li>
            <li>I do not think it is worth buying this and expecting a result any different from any other standard product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s any different than most other moisturizing conditioners.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awful to get older and start losing the beautiful hair I used to have, but it is life and sad to say, something that happens to so many of us.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately this particular bottle has gritty, white little shards in it.  </li>
            <li> I used it a few times so far</li>
            <li> hair is perm not natural</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and very wavy</li>
            <li> /&gt;Being the optimistic person I am, I figured it was possibly a clarifying process to rid other product from my hair and once this process was over, it wouldn&#x27;t tangle anymore.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair dry or greasy either.</li>
            <li> The shampoo left my hair a dry, tangled and knotted mess.</li>
            <li> it is also very dry.</li>
            <li> These are 15 minutes of my life that I am not getting back, not to mention my wasted money on this product.  </li>
            <li> and it did not really condition at all.</li>
            <li> The only thing I do not like is how difficult the bottle is to squeeze, and I am not a weak person...</li>
            <li> Sharp slivers of plastic in the product.  </li>
            <li> Also the bottle I received has little shardes in he conditioner as well.</li>
            <li> Product smells like old stale chemical.&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li> I was incorrect; it only made matters worse.  </li>
            <li> After rinsing my hair I could hardly could a comb through it.&lt;br /&gt;I am afraid to use this particular bottle any longer.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s the shampoo or this</li>
            <li> It felt as though there were small pieces of glass shard in it and cut my hands.</li>
            <li> Plus there were sharp little shards of hard plastic in the conditioner - like a bottle had broken and no one had bothered to sift out the pieces and instead let it go into the batch of condition.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, the bottle is a hard plastic which makes it near impossible to squeeze out the product.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very hard to get out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> My hair became difficult to brush and it didn&#x27;t lather.</li>
            <li> Well, I was wrong-</li>
            <li> but I got real bad breakage days after using both.&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this product recently, after I read all the reviews.  I can&#x27;t tell whether it works yet.&lt;br /&gt;I hope it does. I used it a few times so far and I think my hair grows faster...</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s the shampoo or this but I got real bad breakage days after using both.&lt;br /&gt;My hair was wonderful before just wanted faster growth.&lt;br /&gt;I will not be getting it from either of these.&lt;br /&gt;Yes I took the pill üíä also I&#x27;m still is taking them with omega XL.&lt;br /&gt;I had to use protein to stop the breakage.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is perm not natural maybe it&#x27;s that.&lt;br /&gt;Well good luck üçÄ with that.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li> Product seemed OK to me. Did not do anything noticeable to my hair, but did not cause any downside. I also do not like at all the way it smells. Rather unpleasent. I do not think it is worth buying this and expecting a result any different from any other standard product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about 2 weeks now so I feel it&#x27;s too soon to report any results. I like the way it smells though! The only thing I do not like is how difficult the bottle is to squeeze, and I am not a weak person...it just hurts your hands and you have to give it all you got. I would recommend if you have arthritis or sore/weak hands, to transfer it ahead of time into an easier to squeeze bottle. Other than that, so far I enjoy the product.</li>
            <li> makes my hair sot and shiny .</li>
            <li> What good is a product that is supposed to help you to grow better hair when all it does is damage your current hair?  This product, and its counterpart shampoo, are dangerous for fine or baby fine hair.  I used this shampoo just conditioner, only to have my fine hair turn into a matted mess of snarls, impenetrable by a detangling comb.  Even after using a tried-and-true deep conditioner/detangler, it still took me over 15 minutes to comb out my chin-length hair.  These are 15 minutes of my life that I am not getting back, not to mention my wasted money on this product.  I do not recommend this product or its counterpart shampoo, which I had tried separately.  Both products cause the same tangle/matting issue.  Additionally, the bottle is a hard plastic which makes it near impossible to squeeze out the product.  I‚Äôm too busy to spend minutes banging a container against my hand to get it out of a bottle.  Proceed with caution.</li>
            <li> Had shards of plastic in it. Will never buy again!</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference in my hair and it did not really condition at all. My hair would still be all tangled and didn&#x27;t seem soft.</li>
            <li> I like the way my hair felt after using this product but I&#x27;m not in love with the smell. I&#x27;m only using once a week because of the smell.</li>
            <li> The product does soften the effect of the shampoo though both make your hair feel coarse - and thicker, somewhat.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair look pretty nice</li>
            <li> I bought both shampoo and condtioner, but do not know if the are reliable or will work in my hair</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really say this is a moisturizering conditioner, I&#x27;m honestly only subscribing to this product along with the shampoo because it&#x27;s recommended that these two products be used in conjunction with the oral supplements because work best when used together. As far as the supplements are concerned, it&#x27;s too early to comment on their efficacy. I believe packet inserts states results may start showing after 3 months of consecutive use and I&#x27;m only 7 weeks into taking supplements. However I will state this much at this point, my hair does not fall out as much, but I can&#x27;t say I have a lot of knew growth. Remember this product only claims it aid in re growth of existing hair follicles, not to grow hair where there is already permanent baldness.</li>
            <li> Sharp slivers of plastic in the product.  Production issues? Called and nothing was done about it. Never buying again</li>
            <li> Detangles my hair and leaves it feeling nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I love this conditioner and I use the vitamins as well.</li>
            <li> Hair stylist recommended this brand product to me (vitamins) and I decided to try this very nice moisturizing conditioner.  I am still trying the Viviscal products.  I was taking the vitamins regularly but ran out.  Am about to start them again.  I am not noticing any magnificent difference, but I am not noticing any greater hair loss either.  I am hoping that over time, this product will prove to be a help in improving the condition (and quantity) of my hair.  It&#x27;s awful to get older and start losing the beautiful hair I used to have, but it is life and sad to say, something that happens to so many of us.  If I can just hold it off for now, I will be happy.</li>
            <li> It was a fairly good product.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s any different than most other moisturizing conditioners.</li>
            <li> Definitely makes hair feel fuller and thicker but it&#x27;s very hard to get out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I will not buy this again. It felt as though there were small pieces of glass shard in it and cut my hands. I was in shock. I wanted to return this, but Amazon just refunded my money and I threw the product away.</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing for me. My hair became difficult to brush and it didn&#x27;t lather. Nice smell though.</li>
            <li> I use the shampoo the conditioner and the supplements all together and my hair is growing like weeds. So healthy and strong. The shampoo and conditioner makes my hair really soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Love It, I recommend it to any and everyone that&#x27;s looking to grow healthy long hair.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t feel like I had conditioned my hair at all after I used it.  Plus there were sharp little shards of hard plastic in the conditioner - like a bottle had broken and no one had bothered to sift out the pieces and instead let it go into the batch of condition.  That was in both bottles of conditioner I bought, so I know it wasn&#x27;t an isolated incident.  I won&#x27;t be buying this brand again.</li>
            <li> My wife read about this shampoo and conditioner in a pregnancy magazine and it said it would help maintain your hair afterwards.  I bought it for her to begin using during the end of her pregnancy and she couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  For those of you that don&#x27;t know, full, thick beautiful hair is a great perk of pregnancy and this shampoo and conditioner has cut down on her hair loss, which was frequent at times.  It leaves her hair clean, silky and easy to comb after the shower.  She can&#x27;t wait to see how well it works after she has the baby.  There are no strong scents but a clean smell.  A little goes a long way and she has been very pleased with the product and all it promised to do, it delivered.  She would highly recommend for any hair type, as her&#x27;s is long, straight and colored.  She uses both the Shampoo and Conditioner and she would recommend the combination.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair dry or greasy either.</li>
            <li> I have been taking Vivascal vitamins with incredible results.  After I started using the shampoo and conditionerr i noticed an even better results!  I love this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I cannot find the place to ask a question so if anyone could respond here that would be great! I have thick hair and very wavy it is also very dry. I am scared the shampoo and conditioner will break my hair off . Also the bottle I received has little shardes in he conditioner as well. I see a lot of people posting about this. Has anyone gotten any answers as to why ? Thanks for the help!!</li>
            <li> Product smells like old stale chemical.&lt;br /&gt;Used only once, can&#x27;t continue.&lt;br /&gt;Doubt it will help hair but fear it may clog hair follicles.</li>
            <li> It was ok... I did not notice any difference... but I am still using it.</li>
            <li> after much research into products for thinning hair and trying many with no result, I found Viviscal. The reviews were great for the shampoo, supplements and conditioner.  The shampoo left my hair a dry, tangled and knotted mess. I thought that the conditioner perhaps would rectify this problem. I was incorrect; it only made matters worse.  I worked for 40 minutes trying to get the knots and tangles out. I lost more hair doing this- the sink was full!!!&lt;br /&gt;Being the optimistic person I am, I figured it was possibly a clarifying process to rid other product from my hair and once this process was over, it wouldn&#x27;t tangle anymore. Well, I was wrong- there is no difference; it continues to tangle and knot so I quit with it completely!!</li>
            <li> They added some sort of sandy mix to this conditioner in an effort to make you feel like it is doing something. I tried this with the shampoo and supplement and there was no change in the appearance of my hair anywhere on my head.</li>
            <li> It definitely mousturisess my hair while helping with the growtj.</li>
            <li> I use the vitamins daily. The shampoo and the conditioner leave my hair smelling wonderful and feeling so soft. I love the system. My hair is growing so quickly!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this conditioner in the store several times and never had a problem with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately this particular bottle has gritty, white little shards in it.  After rinsing my hair I could hardly could a comb through it.&lt;br /&gt;I am afraid to use this particular bottle any longer.</li>
