            <li> So thankful that I found this product and my favorite color on Amazon.  I had searched all the stores in my area and it just is not stocked on shelves anymore.  What a treat to find it!  Thank you for a convenient and timely way to purchase a product that I thought was &amp;#34;gone forever&amp;#34;!!</li>
            <li> I wear this color more than anything else. It lasts all day but I&#x27;m so disappointed that it has been discontinued. : (</li>
            <li> My fav color that they have discontinued! I was excited to see they had it on Amazon, I have been through countless tubs of this and that is not like me at all. I usually move on to something else way before I finish it, but that is just how much I like this color.</li>
            <li> My wife likes the Revlon Color Stay product. She uses the Peach color which you can no longer purchase in the local store&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Hate this! worst ever</li>
            <li> Love everything about this lipstick.  Great moisturizing in winter. Nice color.</li>
            <li> I do wear this product daily.  I don&#x27;t like how my lips are dry after applying.  I do wear a lot of lip gloss to moisten them.  The product does not last as long as another product I also use.</li>
            <li> I wish Revlon would bring this product back! It lasts and stays out of lip lines - a problem as we age. Colors are true and stay that way. I&#x27;ve tried them all and this is still the best!</li>
            <li> So put a lot on, rub your lips quickly, then let it set, it feels smooth after that. They have never made my lips dry. I&#x27;ve always put chap stick before, even with these. I don&#x27;t usually reapply either, these I didn&#x27;t have to. I have some Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Hibiscus tinted lip balm that I put on later in the day, even over this lipstick, didn&#x27;t affect the color at all. Its a natural looking color, even on red heads! A little more pink than orange.</li>
            <li> These are the best long lasting lipstick I&#x27;ve ever worn. U literally have to use water resistant makeup remover to take it off. On me it last all day and night. Absolutely hands down my  favorite ‚ò∫üëçüëè</li>
            <li> Its okay, but looks like neon color instead of peach.</li>
            <li> Love the fact I can put this lip color on in the morning and it lasts all day.  Hard to find peach color in local stores.  Would have given 5 stars but what makes color stay long lasting  also makes your lips very dry.  I keep Burts Bees-no color with me to put on top when lips start feeling dry.</li>
            <li> I purchased this years ago and couldn&#x27;t find it on the shelf anymore, so I turned to Amazon and voila! It works great with my red hair and fair skin. It goes on like a gloss. Then, it dries for an all day wear without coming off--my hubby especially loves the fact that he doesn&#x27;t have to worry about lipstick coming off on him! ;) I like the drier feeling, because chapstick and gloss always feel like they wear off after five minutes. Without the wet feeling, it doesn&#x27;t feel like I always need to reapply; therefore, I never worry about it! But chapstick does works well over it if you&#x27;d like the moisture.</li>
            <li> The first time I bought this it was a nice glossy peach..the one I received this time was a matte and I really did not like it.  In fact, I bought two and I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Once in a while a product lives up to it&#x27;s hype. This one does. It doesn&#x27;t dry our your lips and it does stay on. It arrived at my home well on time.</li>
            <li> The.  World&#x27;s.  Best.  Lip.  Color.  It really, truly does stay on all day long.  Through coffee, breakfast in the car, lunch.  This color is my favorite for all year long.  I have strawberry blond hair, fair skin, and blue eyes.  It&#x27;s a matte finish, not glossy.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite lipstick for years and still using it. Unfortunately some of the shades like this one(prized peach) is not available at the store anymore and I am so glad that I found it here. But when I got the lipstick it is not at all the same than what I&#x27;m used to. Its chalky dry. I don&#x27;t know if I just got a bad one or its an old stock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the seller and they were very prompt. But I wasn&#x27;t going to spend money on shipping and going through all that. So, to the trash it went :(</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick, it stays all day and the color is great!!!!</li>
            <li> It stays over 24 hours, I love it</li>
            <li> Love the staying &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; of this lipstick‚Ä¶it really does stay on all day.  Prized Peach is my favorite color of the five other color I have.  Prized Peach is why it says not too pink with a touch yellow to warm it up.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the color.  I was looking for a light peach color.  This is way to dark.  Threw it away.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this color (065 Prized Peach) when first applied. But be warned that unlike other Colorstay shades, it changes drastically after a couple of hours. It goes from this gorgeous peach to a chalky PINK. So beware of this shade. But if you&#x27;re looking for a review of this brand of lip color, I give it two thumbs up. I use almost nothing else. It lasts ALL day AND night, and looks great. I do use lip balm on top of it and re-apply that occasionally to keep my lips from feeling dry. Some shades last longer than others, meaning that some will still be on your lips when you wake up in the morning, even though you washed your face the night before.</li>
            <li> A nice summer color of lipstick.</li>
            <li> I am still upset that I can no longer find this at a reasonable price.  Will relish my last tube before I have to find a new perfect lipstick.</li>
            <li> I am a Revolon ColorStay Ultimate Liquid Lipstick addict!  I have nearly every color and this is now my NEW FAVORITE!!  Its the perfect color for summer!!  Not too dark, not too light.  I wear it so often and it looks good with any type of makeup (day or night, heavy or light).  This stuff, in general, really stays on well.  I wont go a single day without Revlon ColorStay Ultimate Liquid Lipstick, and I used to work at one of thier major competitors where I got stuff for free... so I think that&#x27;s saying a lot!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the color I wanted. I asked for prized peach and got something very different. I have calledup customer service tons of times only to hear, I would hear back from the them... nothing so far.. 3 months on I still on hunt for the color.</li>
