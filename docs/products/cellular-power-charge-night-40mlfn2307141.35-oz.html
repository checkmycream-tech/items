    <ol>
            <li>This one is the best.</li>
            <li>and it has been working perfectly ever since.</li>
            <li>Good Housekeeping stated it was the best</li>
            <li>this night cream has a great reputation and deservedly so&lt;</li>
            <li>AMAZING results!  </li>
            <li>Most wonderful product I have ever had</li>
            <li>If feels good going on and has a nice smell.  </li>
            <li>This is a great serum, my skin feels softer and  fine lines and wrinkles are softening.  </li>
            <li>However, on two separate occasions while running errands with no makeup on I was told I have nice skin.  </li>
            <li>I have had better luck with Lancome&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Skin does look better texture-wise.  </li>
            <li>Outstanding product,very pleased my skin has never looked more beautiful,I do hope</li>
            <li>As for the product itself I LOVE the way it makes my skin feel and look.  </li>
            <li>My face has regained some of the healthy glow that I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I find that I do need to use 3 pumps not the 1 or 2 that are recommended, but then I always use more than is recommended in all the La Prairie products and I cover my neck as well.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product, and this is a great price.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling so great, so soft after applying.  </li>
            <li>This product is great - you can see results in only a few days - makes your face feel wonderful and removes fine lines.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and so far it has proved to be quite good.</li>
            <li>box was original, product was unopened , unused , authentic and fresh.</li>
            <li>I still can&#x27;t afford the whole line, but in this case, something is definitely better than nothing.</li>
            <li>Thankfully some kind person wrote and explained that yes both sides should be dispensing and then told me I could clear out the clogged side with a needle or a pin.  </li>
            <li>Definitely the quickest response (positive) I have experienced with any skin product since Accutane.  </li>
            <li>Adult acne (I&#x27;m 53), still a bit of an issue on the sides of my face and cheeks, but also seems to be getting better.  </li>
            <li>It was a cheap price in relation to that charged by high-end department stores; but if it is unusable, any price is too high.</li>
            <li>Results are visible after first use.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m still on my first bottle.  </li>
            <li>Although this product cost more than other skincare products, I feel it was worth the added expense.  </li>
            <li>Top Ten continues to offer this product,cannot live without it</li>
            <li>and I have tried a lot of high end skin care lines.</li>
            <li>Not sure how authentic, although looks like, or may be not as fresh it is, but given the price 50% off retail, will continue to use, likely wont order again, and try to purchase from their official site, since always getting gifts with purchases as well as in department stores, you are getting what you are paying bottom line...</li>
            <li>Ordinarily I love this product, but the jar I opened tonight, which I purchased on November 19, 2014, is so old and dried up that it will not even pump out of the jar.  </li>
            <li>the expire date is very near</li>
            <li>This pretty well sours me on ordering from Fragrance Net ever again.  </li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t particularly like the fact that I cannot tell at all how much of the product is left, how close I am to running out and needing to reorder.  </li>
            <li>It was a little more current as I recall, but still expired before it was sent.</li>
            <li>I have used many skin creams in the past - all of them promising to improve the overall quality of my skin and make me look years younger.  </li>
            <li>I do not notice any major difference so far</li>
            <li>When I first tried this product I was only getting the yellow cream and not the blue gel</li>
            <li>Seemed a little pricey at first, but when I totaled the products I was currently using (over 3 months, versus what this costs), I don&#x27;t have a problem with the cost.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> My produce is half yellow color. Not sure if it can  still be used. And not the same one as I wanted to buy from the advertising.</li>
            <li> Most wonderful product I have ever had and I have tried a lot of high end skin care lines. From La Mer to Cle de peau beaute. This one is the best. Results are visible after first use. Got a lot of complements on my skin complexion .&lt;br /&gt;The box was original, product was unopened , unused , authentic and fresh.</li>
            <li> this night cream has a great reputation and deservedly so&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that my pores are smaller&lt;br /&gt;my skin tone ( especially the brown spots) are almost gone&lt;br /&gt;and my skin feels smoother --&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its very cold and dry here I think its a miracle that my skin is surviving&lt;br /&gt;this well---thanks to this cream</li>
            <li> This is a great serum, my skin feels softer and  fine lines and wrinkles are softening.  I would highly recommend this product, and this is a great price.</li>
            <li> the expire date is very near</li>
            <li> This product is great - you can see results in only a few days - makes your face feel wonderful and removes fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend - is expensive but well wroth the money!</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any changes.  Be careful when you buy this expensive face product because they DO NOT ALLOW RETURNS once opened.  How else do you try it if you don&#x27;t open the stuff?  I have had better luck with Lancome&#x27;.  And it is $100.00 cheaper.  LS  Alaska</li>
            <li> I have used many skin creams in the past - all of them promising to improve the overall quality of my skin and make me look years younger.  After using this product for one week, I have not only noticed a difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance, but also a dramatic change in fine lines and dark spots.  The product came in a sealed box and the product code on the box matched the one on the bottle.  Although this product cost more than other skincare products, I feel it was worth the added expense.  By the way, you only need to use a small amount every night so it should last a long time.</li>
            <li> Have used it for one week.  Skin does look better texture-wise.  Adult acne (I&#x27;m 53), still a bit of an issue on the sides of my face and cheeks, but also seems to be getting better.  Definitely the quickest response (positive) I have experienced with any skin product since Accutane.

I still can&#x27;t afford the whole line, but in this case, something is definitely better than nothing.</li>
            <li> I do not notice any major difference so far but I&#x27;m still on my first bottle.  However, on two separate occasions while running errands with no makeup on I was told I have nice skin.  If feels good going on and has a nice smell.  I would definitely buy again</li>
            <li> Product expired....You need to read my review on the La Prairie Cellular Eye contour cream. It was a little more current as I recall, but still expired before it was sent.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product,very pleased my skin has never looked more beautiful,I do hope Top Ten continues to offer this product,cannot live without it</li>
            <li> I read the reviews so I decided to try it and so far it has proved to be quite good.</li>
            <li> Not sure how authentic, although looks like, or may be not as fresh it is, but given the price 50% off retail, will continue to use, likely wont order again, and try to purchase from their official site, since always getting gifts with purchases as well as in department stores, you are getting what you are paying bottom line...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the combo serum &amp; cream together would like the choice to use one or the other.</li>
            <li> Well why not try it I said. Good Housekeeping stated it was the best and I agree with their trials and results.</li>
            <li> Good...excelente product</li>
            <li> Ordinarily I love this product, but the jar I opened tonight, which I purchased on November 19, 2014, is so old and dried up that it will not even pump out of the jar.  When I opened it and got some of the cream out, it had an off-scent and off-color (very dark yellow).  This pretty well sours me on ordering from Fragrance Net ever again.  It was a cheap price in relation to that charged by high-end department stores; but if it is unusable, any price is too high.</li>
            <li> this is a MUST in every woman&#x27;s skin-care line-up!  AMAZING results!  SEE the difference.</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give this product a 5 star rating is bc the dispenser can get clogged from time to time.  When I first tried this product I was only getting the yellow cream and not the blue gel, both are supposed to be equally dispensed.  At the time I was not sure what I was supposed to be getting so I wrote Amazon and asked the question.  Thankfully some kind person wrote and explained that yes both sides should be dispensing and then told me I could clear out the clogged side with a needle or a pin.  I did so and it has been working perfectly ever since. I also don&#x27;t particularly like the fact that I cannot tell at all how much of the product is left, how close I am to running out and needing to reorder.  As for the product itself I LOVE the way it makes my skin feel and look.  My face has regained some of the healthy glow that I was looking for.  It leaves my face feeling so great, so soft after applying.  I find that I do need to use 3 pumps not the 1 or 2 that are recommended, but then I always use more than is recommended in all the La Prairie products and I cover my neck as well.</li>
