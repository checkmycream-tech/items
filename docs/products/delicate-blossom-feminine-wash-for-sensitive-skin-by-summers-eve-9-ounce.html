            <li> I feel this cleans well and does not make me itchy!  I would reccomend to anyone with sensitive skin.  It also has a mild scent.  I was a little apprehensive with &amp;#34;blossom&amp;#34; in the name, but it doesn&#x27;t have a strong floral smell at all.  Just fresh and light.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter where you put it (of course not the eyes). There is no stinging what so ever. I have been using it for a while and everything has gone smoothly. I have noticed and improvement and i definalty recommend it if you are looking for a product to clean up.</li>
            <li> I did not see any difference or improvement after using this product.  I&#x27;m uncertain how the other reviewers had a different experience.</li>
            <li> Use for one year now never use soap again.  Take a long handle brush put small amount on brush and clean vag.&lt;br /&gt;No more fishy smell ever!  Dr says its a ph balance issue this fixed it.  Can go all day and night no odor.  Safe to use daily very gentle love this product take it on vacations or trips.  Also comes in wipes to keep in your bag for freshening up or during period</li>

            <li> Keeps the outside part of the vagina clean, but I don&#x27;t think that the inside feels the same way. I&#x27;ve found the Bulb Syringe and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> Better than the wipes, just do not use this product too often.</li>
            <li> Pretty small for the price</li>
            <li> It smells much more soapy and synthetic than I expected. I personally prefer the morning paradise scent, but not by much</li>
            <li> Not much you can say about a vagina wash. BUT it is a very good smelling and low sudsy crotch wash that helps you feel clean and fresh. I used it in the shower once a week in addition to normal washing to keep things clean, fresh and PH balanced. This is a good item to use after intercourse as well. GREAT scent and GREAT results!</li>
            <li> Very gentle! Very natural</li>

            <li> This product is amazing and i like the scent of this product.I will be defiently purchase this again.Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live without this stuff.  I have no idea how I used to wash myself with just water!  This is very delicate and always leaves me feeling (and apparently smelling) fresh...and yummy, or so I&#x27;m told. ;)</li>
            <li> This is really nice feminine wash, I will buy it again. It keeps me clean all day. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Really really old and dirty package. Not the same one as the image showed. Future buyer might want to think twice before purchasing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years now, never had a problem! love it</li>
            <li> I liked this product, has a very nice scent to it and the scent was not too powerful.  Will recommend to other people.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin so usually anything irritates my skin. This stuff does smell like a wet dog but I feel very clean down there. :) It leaves no trace of that wet dog smell either.</li>
            <li> it actually made it smell worst down there</li>
            <li> I really thought this product would work for me!&lt;br /&gt;i got this for a slight vaginal odor i was having, especially after my cycle. the product seemed to be working at first but one day the odor was just unreal. it really isnt good for everyday use. but even when i used it once a week it still was horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i stopped using this product and only cleaned myself with water. then my &#x27;doctor&#x27; told me to douche but use braggs apple cider vinegar and soak it in a tampon and then insert the tampon for 30mins to an hour. BOOM! problem solved!</li>
            <li> Great product! It made me smile I liked it so much I think I cried when it arrived!! Simply AWESOME!</li>
            <li> it has a quite pleasent smell, you can create bubbles with the liquid. Gentle, cannot say much about the effect, it seems more like a maintainance product but not actully would help much if you have big issue.</li>
            <li> Keeps things fresh and clean much better then ordinary body wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super sensitive and using regular soap is not an option for me unless I want to itch like crazy! I have tried other washes, but this works very well for me. I love the sensitive skin line and I had tried all of the scents, I love them all. It smells great, is an awesome cleaner, is very affordable and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I like the scent of this; have used other varieties of sensitive skin wash in this brand.</li>
