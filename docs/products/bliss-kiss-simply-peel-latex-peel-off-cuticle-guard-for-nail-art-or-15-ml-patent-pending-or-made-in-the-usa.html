            <li>BUT, my step daughter insisted that we get it (because it is what her favorite YouTube nail art person uses), so we gave it a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I was worried it would break off as I was pulling it out, or not be able to handle a ton of nail polish spillage.</li>

            <li>so you know when its dry, peels off perfectly.</li>
            <li>It did sting a bit when I got it in a cut on my finger, and when wet it smells like a car tire, but the perfect use more than make up for it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks SO much to simplynailogical for making her video on the best peel off stuff...</li>

            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many times i just put it on and peeled it for fun!</li>
            <li>Sooo cool!</li>
            <li>It glitters when it is done drying and peels off super easy!</li>

            <li>Dries extremely fast and is so easy to use!</li>
            <li>I always you it for nailart for easy cleanup and something I just play around with it because it&#x27;s so fun to peel off</li>
            <li>Clean up is literally a breeze.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to clean up with acetone anymore</li>
            <li>Clean up can be a pain.</li>
            <li>You still have to clean a bit around the nail and cuticle</li>
            <li>so I have to clean there with nail polish remover</li>
            <li>Peel is super easy to apply, dries quickly, and peels off in one piece.</li>

            <li>The brush applicator makes it easy to apply and get right up to the cuticle.</li>
            <li>The applicator is a normal nail polish brush and its very easy to brush on with.  </li>
            <li>Fast and safe delivery.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it is an absolute life saver when it comes to nail art.</li>
            <li>i really recommend if you love nail art and painting your nails</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure I could always find another brush to use if it really bothered me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard nothing but good things about this product and was so stoked to actually get it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth, dries fast, and peels easily.</li>

            <li>all the way up to the first knuckle!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed to create my ombre nail art!</li>
            <li>Effective at keeping polish mess at bay when doing a more involved manicure.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it</li>
            <li>Still learning the right thickness needed, but it does the job</li>
            <li>I  used it right away for ombré  nails</li>
            <li>I want to say firstly that the only reason I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars is because of my own inabilities.</li>
            <li>It makes nail art so much easier to clean up.</li>
            <li>Only downfall is that it has a very strong fishy odor.</li>
            <li>they gave me a full refund, so thanks.</li>
            <li>Loving this product, I&#x27;m not a professional</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t get it all off the first time, it also rubs off very easily like white glue.  </li>
            <li>The Shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>It dries super quickly and it dries clear</li>
            <li>First time using it.</li>
            <li>First I&#x27;d like to say thank you for the fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Simply Peel!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Perhaps a different brand of latex I&#x27;ve seen on Amazon which gives you MUCH more product of Latex.</li>
            <li>That said, it does exactly what it states.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using it</li>
            <li>So glad I finally bought some!</li>
            <li>I will be buying more for bliss kiss in the future.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to get some more later!</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li>I bought Simply Peel about a month ago, and I love everything about it.</li>
            <li>Beside that I love this product and will definitely buy it again when I run out.</li>
            <li>10/10 would DEFINITELY recommend. :)</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased a Latex Skin Barrier for polishing my nails</li>
            <li>Works amazing but the brush gets dirty and clogged really easily but is a very easy fix</li>
            <li>but it really does peel right off the finger when you&#x27;re done painting.</li>
            <li>simply peel is amazing and it really comes in handy, when your doing a messy manicure or any type of messy nail design, It drys fast and the best part is , when its completely dry is drys with glitter😍</li>
            <li>quick dry and peel off easily.</li>
            <li>This product does dry differently (in a better way) than just any ol&#x27; liquid latex.</li>
            <li>Talk about making things EASY and SIMPLE!</li>
            <li>Works very well easy to use only thing</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is an amazing product to have it you get messy with any nail art.</li>
            <li>Very heplful for nail art.</li>
            <li>The shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li>you have to put so much on</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t ready to do my nails &amp; still wanted to test this</li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>so clearly I&#x27;m having too much fun with it.</li>
            <li>but it works very well.</li>
            <li>Makes doing nail art so much easier.</li>
            <li>I am having a problem with it getting very clumpy though.</li>
            <li>Makes nail art so much easier and quicker.</li>
            <li>SO MUCH</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re worry about it costing to much trust</li>
            <li>so that you know it&#x27;s ready.</li>
            <li>very pricey for what you get</li>
            <li>But then, what would one expect with Liquid Latex, which is really what this stuff is.</li>
            <li>It is on the very pricey side</li>
            <li>Makes it so much easier for me.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really nothing, haha.</li>
            <li>It makes nail art, water marbling, sponging, gradients, etc so much easier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been very hesitant when it comes to putting products on my skin, so I&#x27;ve always used nailpolishes remover and washed my hands thoroughly</li>
            <li>/&gt;Always remember to close it real</li>
            <li>This stuff is a bit pricey, but it does really work.</li>
            <li>But now that I have this its much easier.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m absolutely in heaven.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be purchasing more in the near future!</li>
            <li>This product makes clean up so much easier when doing certain nail art techniques, such as gradients or water marble.</li>
            <li>It does come off in one piece and has made the clean up job much easier, especially after stamping.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to know that when I want to try something new that this will help keep the mess at bay</li>
            <li>It sparkles when dry, and is easy to peel off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Something else I really like about this particular product is that the brush is just like a nailpolish brush.</li>
            <li>It does dry clear and sparkly which is cute.</li>
            <li>it not only dries quickly</li>
            <li>and it has gotten a little better</li>
            <li>Also, it comes with the same amount of product as an OPI bottle if you were wondering if it is worth it.</li>
            <li>me is worth every penny, especially if you&#x27;re not a pro like me.</li>
            <li>and it normally comes off in one try.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same satisfying feeling as when we used to pour Elmer&#x27;s glue on our hands, let it dry, then peeled it off in grade school.</li>
            <li>The product is difficult to apply, thickens very quickly, and to top it off, the brush broke 8 fingers in.  </li>
            <li>They were a bit less effective than regular tape.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a new one to me.</li>
            <li>It dries clear which is really fabulous because then you know when it&#x27;s all the way dry!!</li>
            <li>The glitter that you see when it dries is so appealing compared to some other gross liquid latex products I have tried.</li>
            <li>i just got my first bottle a while ago ,but im totally going to buy another one soon😊</li>
            <li>Application is exactly the same as nail polish, except it goes on your cuticles/finger.</li>
            <li>Generally works very well.</li>
            <li>It is easily used and comes off with just a little tug.</li>
            <li>The simply peel is much cheaper although this brush is a bit big for getting right in there</li>
            <li>Worth every single penny.</li>
            <li>It shows me when its dry and comes right off when I&#x27;m finished with my nail art.</li>
            <li>Dries clear but it has glitter</li>
            <li>It dries clear</li>
            <li>Arrived early.</li>
            <li>And then it peels off completely in one piece.  </li>
            <li>looks very well only I recommend that u spread it everywhere</li>
            <li>The smell is definitely present but really, compared to nail polish and polish remover..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll look completely new.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>The brush is different it is not like your normal brush</li>
            <li>The brush that it comes with is big enough that if you are water-marbling you can easily cover your whole finger but small and precise enough to get into the small crevices by your cuticle.</li>
            <li>It dries fast (and glittery), peels off all in one piece with no little bits left behind, and application is easy.</li>
            <li>, it not only tells you when it&#x27;s dry (and ready for nail art!)</li>
            <li>I have been keeping it closed even between applications because I know latex can dry quickly.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t spread the peel far enough.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this as a barrier to keep my nail polish from getting on my skin though I&#x27;ve only done one manicure using this so far..</li>
            <li>put down a layer of the barrier and peel it off when you are ready!</li>
            <li>If you enjoy painting your nails but hate dealing with the cleanup that comes with it, I strongly encourage you to purchase this!</li>
            <li>It paints on like pink nail polish, but then turns clear when it is dry and ready to be peeled off.</li>
            <li>The first few times I tried it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Bliss Kiss Simply Peel since it first came on the market a few months ago.</li>
            <li>with this product I can make a mess and not worry about because this product really works.</li>
            <li>Was a very gloopy mess even after massively shaking the bottle, overtime</li>
            <li>Just be mindful of drying it out, you have to let it dry completely and try to do a few fingers at a time because it is really sticky</li>
            <li>The directions recommend to apply to every other finger which makes sense until you get the hang of keeping your fingers very far apart</li>

            <li> BUT, my step daughter insisted that we get it (because it is what her favorite YouTube nail art person uses), so we gave it a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>

            <li> Love love love it...</li>
            <li> Tried it as soon as I walked in the door with it :)</li>
            <li> You do need to make sure that your fingers do not touch though since if they do it will pull off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I got this.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you coat where you need to.</li>

            <li> Super easy to use...goes on great and peels off quickly.</li>
            <li> Simply Peel is simply amazing!!</li>
            <li> so you know when its dry, peels off perfectly.</li>
            <li> It did sting a bit when I got it in a cut on my finger, and when wet it smells like a car tire, but the perfect use more than make up for it.  </li>
            <li> Thanks SO much to simplynailogical for making her video on the best peel off stuff...</li>
            <li> I have found it best to put a good thick layer on if you want it easy to peel off.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and makes nail projects easier to clean up!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many times i just put it on and peeled it for fun!</li>
            <li> Sooo cool!</li>
            <li> It glitters when it is done drying and peels off super easy!</li>
            <li> It peels off in one piece, applies very easily, and sparkles when dry (which is pretty awesome!).</li>

            <li> Very fast drying and effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it for water-marbling, and while it works just fine</li>
            <li> We enjoy using this and it serves its purpose.</li>
            <li> Oh and it works great for regular fingernail polishing too, not just water marbling.</li>

            <li> , I bought it from the original</li>
            <li> Love it so much!</li>
            <li> Dries extremely fast and is so easy to use!</li>
            <li> I always you it for nailart for easy cleanup and something I just play around with it because it&#x27;s so fun to peel off</li>
            <li> Clean up is literally a breeze.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to clean up with acetone anymore</li>
            <li> Clean up can be a pain.</li>
            <li> You still have to clean a bit around the nail and cuticle</li>
            <li> so I have to clean there with nail polish remover</li>
            <li> Peel is super easy to apply, dries quickly, and peels off in one piece.</li>
            <li> It dries super fast and is so GLITTERY!!!  </li>
            <li> I apply it around my nails when doing gradients or ombré designs and it peels right off for easy clean up.</li>
            <li> The brush applicator makes it easy to apply and get right up to the cuticle.</li>
            <li> The applicator is a normal nail polish brush and its very easy to brush on with.  </li>
            <li> Fast and safe delivery.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is an absolute life saver when it comes to nail art.</li>
            <li> i really recommend if you love nail art and painting your nails</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure I could always find another brush to use if it really bothered me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard nothing but good things about this product and was so stoked to actually get it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth, dries fast, and peels easily.</li>
            <li> I am confident that anyone who tries it will love it!</li>
            <li> It works amazingly and you really don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> Quick drying, you can see.</li>
            <li> My daughters LOVE getting creative with their manis with Simply Peel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply, it dries fast, and removal is an ease.</li>
            <li> all the way up to the first knuckle!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed to create my ombre nail art!</li>
            <li> Effective at keeping polish mess at bay when doing a more involved manicure.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it</li>
            <li> Still learning the right thickness needed, but it does the job</li>
            <li> I  used it right away for ombré  nails</li>
            <li> I want to say firstly that the only reason I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars is because of my own inabilities.</li>
            <li> It makes nail art so much easier to clean up.</li>
            <li> Only downfall is that it has a very strong fishy odor.</li>
            <li> they gave me a full refund, so thanks.</li>
            <li> Loving this product, I&#x27;m not a professional</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t get it all off the first time, it also rubs off very easily like white glue.  </li>
            <li> The Shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> It dries super quickly and it dries clear</li>
            <li> First time using it.</li>
            <li> First I&#x27;d like to say thank you for the fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Simply Peel!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Perhaps a different brand of latex I&#x27;ve seen on Amazon which gives you MUCH more product of Latex.</li>
            <li> That said, it does exactly what it states.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using it</li>
            <li> So glad I finally bought some!</li>
            <li> I will be buying more for bliss kiss in the future.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to get some more later!</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I bought Simply Peel about a month ago, and I love everything about it.</li>
            <li> Beside that I love this product and will definitely buy it again when I run out.</li>
            <li> 10/10 would DEFINITELY recommend. :)</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased a Latex Skin Barrier for polishing my nails</li>
            <li> Works amazing but the brush gets dirty and clogged really easily but is a very easy fix</li>
            <li> but it really does peel right off the finger when you&#x27;re done painting.</li>
            <li> simply peel is amazing and it really comes in handy, when your doing a messy manicure or any type of messy nail design, It drys fast and the best part is , when its completely dry is drys with glitter😍</li>
            <li> quick dry and peel off easily.</li>
            <li> This product does dry differently (in a better way) than just any ol&#x27; liquid latex.</li>
            <li> Talk about making things EASY and SIMPLE!</li>
            <li> Works very well easy to use only thing</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is an amazing product to have it you get messy with any nail art.</li>
            <li> Very heplful for nail art.</li>
            <li> The shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li> you have to put so much on</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t ready to do my nails &amp; still wanted to test this</li>
            <li> Haha</li>
            <li> so clearly I&#x27;m having too much fun with it.</li>
            <li> but it works very well.</li>
            <li> Makes doing nail art so much easier.</li>
            <li> I am having a problem with it getting very clumpy though.</li>
            <li> Makes nail art so much easier and quicker.</li>
            <li> SO MUCH</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re worry about it costing to much trust</li>
            <li> so that you know it&#x27;s ready.</li>
            <li> very pricey for what you get</li>
            <li> But then, what would one expect with Liquid Latex, which is really what this stuff is.</li>
            <li> It is on the very pricey side</li>
            <li> Makes it so much easier for me.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really nothing, haha.</li>
            <li> It makes nail art, water marbling, sponging, gradients, etc so much easier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been very hesitant when it comes to putting products on my skin, so I&#x27;ve always used nailpolishes remover and washed my hands thoroughly</li>
            <li> /&gt;Always remember to close it real</li>
            <li> This stuff is a bit pricey, but it does really work.</li>
            <li> But now that I have this its much easier.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m absolutely in heaven.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be purchasing more in the near future!</li>
            <li> This product makes clean up so much easier when doing certain nail art techniques, such as gradients or water marble.</li>
            <li> It does come off in one piece and has made the clean up job much easier, especially after stamping.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to know that when I want to try something new that this will help keep the mess at bay</li>
            <li> It sparkles when dry, and is easy to peel off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Something else I really like about this particular product is that the brush is just like a nailpolish brush.</li>
            <li> It does dry clear and sparkly which is cute.</li>
            <li> it not only dries quickly</li>
            <li> and it has gotten a little better</li>
            <li> Also, it comes with the same amount of product as an OPI bottle if you were wondering if it is worth it.</li>
            <li> me is worth every penny, especially if you&#x27;re not a pro like me.</li>
            <li> and it normally comes off in one try.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same satisfying feeling as when we used to pour Elmer&#x27;s glue on our hands, let it dry, then peeled it off in grade school.</li>
            <li> The product is difficult to apply, thickens very quickly, and to top it off, the brush broke 8 fingers in.  </li>
            <li> They were a bit less effective than regular tape.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a new one to me.</li>
            <li> It dries clear which is really fabulous because then you know when it&#x27;s all the way dry!!</li>
            <li> The glitter that you see when it dries is so appealing compared to some other gross liquid latex products I have tried.</li>
            <li> i just got my first bottle a while ago ,but im totally going to buy another one soon😊</li>
            <li> Application is exactly the same as nail polish, except it goes on your cuticles/finger.</li>
            <li> Generally works very well.</li>
            <li> It is easily used and comes off with just a little tug.</li>
            <li> The simply peel is much cheaper although this brush is a bit big for getting right in there</li>
            <li> Worth every single penny.</li>
            <li> It shows me when its dry and comes right off when I&#x27;m finished with my nail art.</li>
            <li> Dries clear but it has glitter</li>
            <li> It dries clear</li>
            <li> Arrived early.</li>
            <li> And then it peels off completely in one piece.  </li>
            <li> looks very well only I recommend that u spread it everywhere</li>
            <li> The smell is definitely present but really, compared to nail polish and polish remover..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll look completely new.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> The brush is different it is not like your normal brush</li>
            <li> The brush that it comes with is big enough that if you are water-marbling you can easily cover your whole finger but small and precise enough to get into the small crevices by your cuticle.</li>
            <li> It dries fast (and glittery), peels off all in one piece with no little bits left behind, and application is easy.</li>
            <li> , it not only tells you when it&#x27;s dry (and ready for nail art!)</li>
            <li> I have been keeping it closed even between applications because I know latex can dry quickly.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t spread the peel far enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this as a barrier to keep my nail polish from getting on my skin though I&#x27;ve only done one manicure using this so far..</li>
            <li> put down a layer of the barrier and peel it off when you are ready!</li>
            <li> If you enjoy painting your nails but hate dealing with the cleanup that comes with it, I strongly encourage you to purchase this!</li>
            <li> It paints on like pink nail polish, but then turns clear when it is dry and ready to be peeled off.</li>
            <li> The first few times I tried it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bliss Kiss Simply Peel since it first came on the market a few months ago.</li>
            <li> with this product I can make a mess and not worry about because this product really works.</li>
            <li> Was a very gloopy mess even after massively shaking the bottle, overtime</li>
            <li> Just be mindful of drying it out, you have to let it dry completely and try to do a few fingers at a time because it is really sticky</li>
            <li> The directions recommend to apply to every other finger which makes sense until you get the hang of keeping your fingers very far apart</li>
            <li> It goes on white but dries clear with little GLITTERS in it.</li>
            <li> Only thing I don&#x27;t like is sometimes when I peel it off, it messes up the edges a little but that can be easily fixed.</li>
            <li> The only thing we noticed is that if you put your fingers too close together, even when it&#x27;s dry, our fingers will stick and peel it off.</li>
            <li> really is that easy- put this on the skin around your nail (dont get it on your nail because then you will have weird spots when you peel it off), paint your nails as usual, and then peel it off!</li>
            <li> We are no longer frustrated with the clean up of water marble designs, and my 7 year old can now paint her nails and have them look decent when the process (mess) is over!&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can add the liquid latex in an empty nail polish bottle, to resemble this product and you can also get it in different colors.</li>
            <li> so I just painted it onto the back of my hand and spent a while peeling it off.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted to buy some peel latex for a long time.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve gone without this product for so long, but now I&#x27;ll never be without it!</li>
            <li> The only problem I&#x27;ve encountered is the product not fully drying and sticking to the latex on other fingers, tools, etc.</li>
            <li> and it takes a bit to dry</li>
            <li> and it takes 2 minutes to dry.</li>
            <li> Then it sparkles when dry</li>
            <li> Takes time to dry</li>
            <li> so you know its dry.  </li>
            <li> I like to experiment with nail art like marbling and such and I don&#x27;t like wasting tape or trying to keep from staining my fingers as I do work with dark colors at times.</li>
            <li> The latex came off in one piece no matter how hard I pulled, and it completely took the excess nail polish out!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t finally paint my nails and design them without the Polish leaving a mess.</li>
            <li> Not really for me, but</li>
            <li> much harder to use than advertised.  </li>
            <li> It has lasted awhile already, and when it&#x27;s empty</li>
            <li> And there is absolutely NO residue or smell-</li>
            <li> I probably didn&#x27;t put a thick enough layer on and it would come apart and take a lot of rubbing to finally get all of it off after a manicure.</li>
            <li> You can buy it on MyBlissKiss.com or nailcarehq.com for a little less and from the actual producer but either way</li>
            <li> and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Easy to use but smell bad</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I don&#x27;t like the smell of latex, but that&#x27;s just my preference and wouldn&#x27;t deter me from repurchasing this in any way.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I eventually broke down and purchased a bottle.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product over any other liquid latex skin protector!</li>
            <li> The only negative about this product is that over time it gets a little clumpy, but is still usable.</li>
            <li> Luckily I am not allergic to latex.</li>
            <li> Doing marble nails took half the time with this, AND no need to use drying acetone</li>
            <li> I also use it as a peel off base when swatching different polishes on my nails and the manicures peel right off.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little smelly...</li>
            <li> A little pricey</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few brands.</li>
            <li> I use it to cover the skin around my nails when doing messy nail designs.</li>
            <li> Ladies and the few gentleman out there</li>
            <li> your missing out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve let it sit upright for a few days now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just plain liquid latex and it doesn&#x27;t even come close to the ease of using this.  </li>
            <li> No more messy nails</li>
            <li> This product changed the way I water marble, I virtually have no clean up!</li>
            <li> No more mess!</li>
            <li> Just be careful while it&#x27;s on because your fingers will stick together if they tough and</li>
            <li> Smell isn&#x27;t bad, really don&#x27;t mind it.  </li>
            <li> not sure who to contact about that....</li>
            <li> Works well, does as it says and actually does smell pretty horrible.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d purchase this brand again.</li>
            <li> And who does not love holo?</li>
            <li> You can usually just grab it with your finger tips and peel it off in one piece- takes about 2 seconds</li>
            <li> If the nail polish dries, it will become hard to take off even with latex</li>
            <li> I mean, it</li>
            <li> I mean, what can I say?</li>
            <li> but when it came it didnt work because it was broken and dried up!</li>
            <li> If you have a tough time staying within your nail bed while painting your nails use this product!</li>
            <li> Totally addicted!</li>
            <li> so my cuticles take a beating, this has changed the game!</li>
            <li> But really bad smell.</li>
            <li> It smells really bad - but works well</li>
            <li> It does have a weird smell but it isnt horrible.</li>
            <li> : the brush tip came off while cleaning it :(</li>
            <li> My daughter tried using glue and water forever and absolutely hated it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Works well, smells awful, perhaps that&#x27;s how all liquid latex smells</li>
            <li> I also saw that you can use as a base coat and just peel your polish off instead of using polish remover!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Haven&#x27;t used this, but just buy liquid latex. You can buy it for about 11 dollars, plus you can get a much bigger quantity on here. That&#x27;s basically what this product is. It peels off the same and it dries in about one minute. You can add the liquid latex in an empty nail polish bottle, to resemble this product and you can also get it in different colors.</li>
            <li> I have seen this all over instagram and it&#x27;s awesome! SPARKLE SOARKLE YO!💅💅💅</li>
            <li> Great product! Works very well easy to use only thing it&#x27;s a little smelly... But that&#x27;s with any nail polish type of product. Arrived early. Very happy with the seller.</li>
            <li> We enjoy using this and it serves its purpose. The only thing we noticed is that if you put your fingers too close together, even when it&#x27;s dry, our fingers will stick and peel it off.</li>
            <li> First time using it. Will definitely not be my last!</li>
            <li> Fast and safe delivery. Very heplful for nail art. quick dry and peel off easily. But really bad smell. I thought it&#x27;s rotted.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product</li>
            <li> Still learning the right thickness needed, but it does the job</li>
            <li> Easy to use but smell bad</li>
            <li> Works great!! This is my fave liquid latex for nail art and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few brands. Great for searching and cleanup.</li>
            <li> It works great!! I  used it right away for ombré  nails and they look great! I could not be happier :)</li>
            <li> The shipping was really fast. I use it to cover the skin around my nails when doing messy nail designs. The brush is like a nail polish brush, and is very easy to apply. It does have a weird smell but it isnt horrible. It sparkles when dry, and is easy to peel off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips :&lt;br /&gt;- when you apply it, DONT let the latexed nail touch another latexed nail. It will stick and just peel off both fingers&lt;br /&gt;- after finishing a nail design, take off the latex. If the nail polish dries, it will become hard to take off even with latex barrier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is an amazing product to have it you get messy with any nail art. It will last you, and is refillable.</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing! it not only dries quickly but it also peels off very nicely. I definently recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  It dries super fast and is so GLITTERY!!!  SPARKLES EVERYWHERE.  And then it peels off completely in one piece.  It did sting a bit when I got it in a cut on my finger, and when wet it smells like a car tire, but the perfect use more than make up for it.  Tempted to buy a second bottle right now.  :D :D</li>
            <li> PERFECT!!  Great for getting the perfect manicure!  No more mess!</li>
            <li> I want to say firstly that the only reason I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars is because of my own inabilities. The product works great at perfectly covering exactly  what needs to be covered. I did around all of my nails before starting with the nail polish. I think this was my mistake because by the time I got to the last nail, the latex would like peeling off of the finger I started with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bliss Kiss Simply Peel since it first came on the market a few months ago. I can&#x27;t do nail art without it!! I wrote an in-depth review here: http://www.bettysbeautybombs.com/2015/02/14/bliss-kiss-simply-peel-liquid-latex-review/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I use this whenever I&#x27;m doing stamping nail art, watermarbling, or using cuticle remover. It dries clear which is really fabulous because then you know when it&#x27;s all the way dry!! Plus, the glitter shows through. :) And who doesn&#x27;t like glitter?! This product does dry differently (in a better way) than just any ol&#x27; liquid latex. I&#x27;ve purchased a giant bottle of this and I&#x27;m almost out again!! Time to buy more!</li>
            <li> Works well, smells awful, perhaps that&#x27;s how all liquid latex smells but it&#x27;s a new one to me. The brush applicator makes it easy to apply and get right up to the cuticle. It does dry clear and sparkly which is cute. I have found it best to put a good thick layer on if you want it easy to peel off. The first few times I tried it I probably didn&#x27;t put a thick enough layer on and it would come apart and take a lot of rubbing to finally get all of it off after a manicure. It&#x27;s great to use for stamping when your design gets the edges of your finger. The directions recommend to apply to every other finger which makes sense until you get the hang of keeping your fingers very far apart so they don&#x27;t touch because it does stick together! I&#x27;ve tried it for water-marbling, and while it works just fine you have to put so much on and it takes a bit to dry that I find tape is still easier for me.</li>
            <li> Works amazing but the brush gets dirty and clogged really easily but is a very easy fix</li>
            <li> It works! Dries clear but it has glitter so you can see it. I&#x27;m a bit ashamed to admit this but I wasn&#x27;t ready to do my nails &amp; still wanted to test this so I just painted it onto the back of my hand and spent a while peeling it off. It&#x27;s the same satisfying feeling as when we used to pour Elmer&#x27;s glue on our hands, let it dry, then peeled it off in grade school. Haha so clearly I&#x27;m having too much fun with it. It&#x27;s great though. A little pricey but it works very well.</li>
            <li> Makes doing nail art so much easier. Great product.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is so helpful. I am having a problem with it getting very clumpy though. I have been keeping it closed even between applications because I know latex can dry quickly. Oh well. Love the sparkles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: the brush tip came off while cleaning it :( not sure who to contact about that....</li>
            <li> Makes nail art so much easier and quicker. Very fast drying and effective.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is an absolute life saver when it comes to nail art. The glitter that you see when it dries is so appealing compared to some other gross liquid latex products I have tried. The brush that it comes with is big enough that if you are water-marbling you can easily cover your whole finger but small and precise enough to get into the small crevices by your cuticle. Also, it comes with the same amount of product as an OPI bottle if you were wondering if it is worth it. You can buy it on MyBlissKiss.com or nailcarehq.com for a little less and from the actual producer but either way this is a MUST buy.</li>
            <li> Love, love love!! This makes nail art so easy, and I love the sparkle!</li>
            <li> I purchased simply peel on the official website but I had no idea they sold it on amazon too. Anyways this product is just amazing like I love it I always you it for nailart for easy cleanup and something I just play around with it because it&#x27;s so fun to peel off and I LOVE IT SO MUCH it&#x27;s an amazing product. I really recommend this product it works great and it takes 2 minutes to dry. So buy it you won&#x27;t regret it so ya buy it !!! :)</li>
            <li> OMGAHHH i absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! I can&#x27;t tell you how many times i just put it on and peeled it for fun! Thanks SO much to simplynailogical for making her video on the best peel off stuff...THIS IS THE ALL TIME WINNER! i luuuuuuuuv this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps i wish i was getting paid to say this lololololllololollol</li>
            <li> Good stuff and delivered very quickly pleased !!!</li>
            <li> looks very well only I recommend that u spread it everywhere bc sometimes the paint still gets on my skin. If I don&#x27;t spread the peel far enough.</li>
            <li> The brush isn&#x27;t cumbersome to swipe around your cuticles, and it peels in a snap without leaving cracked polish pieces on your manicure.  I am a convert and will be buying extras, just to have on-hand.  Gradients and stamping, here I come!</li>
            <li> First I&#x27;d like to say thank you for the fast shipping! Simply Peel is a great product! It&#x27;s easy to apply, it dries fast, and removal is an ease. I&#x27;ll be purchasing more in the near future! This product is great for marbling and keeping nail polish off cuticle and skin around the nail. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Worked perfectly for our nail art.</li>
            <li> Magic! I paint this around my nails easy peasy. It goes on white but dries clear with little GLITTERS in it. I love it. Once I&#x27;ve used polish on my nails I just stick two fingers together because latex sticks to itself and they come off. I pull it off my nail and use that to peel off the others. Instant perfection.</li>
            <li> Loving this product, I&#x27;m not a professional so when it comes to doing my nail is not so easy peasy for me but with this product I can make a mess and not worry about because this product really works. Ladies and the few gentleman out there if you&#x27;re worry about it costing to much trust me is worth every penny, especially if you&#x27;re not a pro like me. BTW my shipping date was 5/18 to 5/20 and I got it way before I was supposed to (5/15) so I&#x27;m a really happy customer.</li>
            <li> I was just using white Elmer&#x27;s glue before I bought this. This works SO well. It dries super quickly and it dries clear so you know when you&#x27;re ok to continue with your nail art. It makes cleanup so easy! I&#x27;ve also used it to protect my skin while using cuticle remover and that worked well also. My only complaint is that I don&#x27;t like the smell of latex, but that&#x27;s just my preference and wouldn&#x27;t deter me from repurchasing this in any way.</li>
            <li> simply peel is amazing and it really comes in handy, when your doing a messy manicure or any type of messy nail design, It drys fast and the best part is , when its completely dry is drys with glitter😍 what else could you ask for. 😊❤️ i really recommend if you love nail art and painting your nails your missing out😘 i just got my first bottle a while ago ,but im totally going to buy another one soon😊</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Simply Peel! This product makes clean up so much easier when doing certain nail art techniques, such as gradients or water marble. It peels off in one piece, applies very easily, and sparkles when dry (which is pretty awesome!). I recommend this product over any other liquid latex skin protector!</li>
            <li> This product came highly recommended by many, and now i can see why! I recently got into water marbling my nails and the only thing i didn&#x27;t like about it was the cleanup, because there&#x27;s literally polish everywhere...all the way up to the first knuckle! So let me tell ya, this liquid latex is a Godsend! Super easy to use...goes on great and peels off quickly. I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve gone without this product for so long, but now I&#x27;ll never be without it! Application is exactly the same as nail polish, except it goes on your cuticles/finger. Then it sparkles when dry so that you know it&#x27;s ready. Sooo cool! I am confident that anyone who tries it will love it! Oh and it works great for regular fingernail polishing too, not just water marbling. I also saw that you can use as a base coat and just peel your polish off instead of using polish remover! Don&#x27;t waste your time and money on &#x27;taping&#x27; your nails - this stuff is the BEST!!</li>
            <li> Came on time. Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> very pricey for what you get</li>
            <li> Works well, does as it says and actually does smell pretty horrible. But then, what would one expect with Liquid Latex, which is really what this stuff is. The caveat is that when you use this for a border to protect the nail bed from the nail polish, it ends up clinging to the nail polish and then when you go to pull it off it takes off the polish with it. Not really for me, but they gave me a full refund, so thanks.</li>
            <li> Great product!  The best out there!!!</li>
            <li> This works great for doing special painting treatments on your nails, like the make  up sponge ombre technique. I watched a video the reviewed all available methods for thus and this one was rated the best quality fir the price. Just be careful while it&#x27;s on because your fingers will stick together if they tough and it will peel off when you spread them apart!</li>
            <li> Great product, came very well packaged. Only downfall is that it has a very strong fishy odor.</li>
            <li> what is this? This was coagulationT.T</li>
            <li> Seriously awesome for nail art!  I&#x27;ve tried just plain liquid latex and it doesn&#x27;t even come close to the ease of using this.  I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> It dries fast (and glittery), peels off all in one piece with no little bits left behind, and application is easy.</li>
            <li> I use this product for all of my nail art, suddenly gradients &amp; water marbles are a piece of cake!  I especially love the glitter, it not only tells you when it&#x27;s dry (and ready for nail art!) but also makes it easier to remove.  Love love love this product!</li>
            <li> The brush is different it is not like your normal brush it don&#x27;t brush on  but its ok but I will not get another one myself</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this Bliss Peel. It makes clean up unbelievably easy. It is on the very pricey side so I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d purchase this brand again. Perhaps a different brand of latex I&#x27;ve seen on Amazon which gives you MUCH more product of Latex. That said, it does exactly what it states.</li>
            <li> For its oz to price, it&#x27;s a great deal. It&#x27;s smooth, dries fast, and peels easily. This is my first time using it and I&#x27;m on love. I mean, it GLITTERS. I love it.</li>
            <li> Works well. Takes time to dry</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  Was a very gloopy mess even after massively shaking the bottle, overtime I put the brush in big globs of goo were stuck in the liquid latex.</li>
            <li> It peels amazingly, and cheap for how good the quality is!</li>
            <li> We waited excitedly for this product to arrive so we could have a mani/pedi party.  My 11 and 14 year olds wanted to try marbleing and things that required a peel.  The product is difficult to apply, thickens very quickly, and to top it off, the brush broke 8 fingers in.  Elmers Glue works better!</li>
            <li> Makes it so much easier for me.  Love it</li>
            <li> Luckily I am not allergic to latex. It does what it is suppose to but omg it reeks of ammonia. On the side it says it&#x27;s used as a preservative.  That ingredients contained is latex, water, ammonia, and glitter.</li>
            <li> much harder to use than advertised.  Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Makes cleanup a breeze. And who does not love holo?</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed to create my ombre nail art! Super easy to use</li>
            <li> I have always wanted to buy some peel latex for a long time. So glad I finally bought some! The Shipping was super fast. I will be buying more for bliss kiss in the future. This stuff has changed my nail stamping!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this as a barrier to keep my nail polish from getting on my skin though I&#x27;ve only done one manicure using this so far.. but it&#x27;s been awesome. I also have some liquid palisade from kiesque and enjoy both that and this! The simply peel is much cheaper although this brush is a bit big for getting right in there but I&#x27;m sure I could always find another brush to use if it really bothered me lol The smell is definitely present but really, compared to nail polish and polish remover.. it&#x27;s really nothing, haha. Can&#x27;t wait to do more gradients and water marbles!</li>
            <li> The best and most affordable liquid latex barrier for nails! Dries extremely fast and is so easy to use! LOVE it!</li>
            <li> The best liquid latex out there! I&#x27;ve tried a couple different ones and this one is the best. Great customer service as well.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It works amazingly and you really don&#x27;t need much. It goes on great and easy, and peels off so smoothly! It has lasted awhile already, and when it&#x27;s empty I plan on ordering another one. Makes painting your nails so much easier and cleaner! :)</li>
            <li> Great product works well for nail art</li>
            <li> the product was great and the shipping. It came like 2 days before but anyways great product👌🏼😏👏🏼</li>
            <li> I love this product . No more messy nails</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had watched several YouTube videos on nail art, and most of them used some sort of product like this, but since this is not readily available in stores, I was hesitant to say the least. BUT, my step daughter insisted that we get it (because it is what her favorite YouTube nail art person uses), so we gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is perfect! We are no longer frustrated with the clean up of water marble designs, and my 7 year old can now paint her nails and have them look decent when the process (mess) is over!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really is that easy- put this on the skin around your nail (dont get it on your nail because then you will have weird spots when you peel it off), paint your nails as usual, and then peel it off! It paints on like pink nail polish, but then turns clear when it is dry and ready to be peeled off. You can usually just grab it with your finger tips and peel it off in one piece- takes about 2 seconds and you are done! And there is absolutely NO residue or smell- it is like you didn&#x27;t even have anything on to begin with!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are into nail art (especially water marble), then this is a must have! Super impressed with this product- will absolutely buy this again!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s very easy to use and works great!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, my niece loves it. It dries clear so you know when its dry, peels off perfectly. No complaints! Thank you!</li>
            <li> My daughter tried using glue and water forever and absolutely hated it. Her birthday came by and with her birthday money she bought a simply peel. She can&#x27;t stay away from it now. Thank you bliss kiss!</li>
            <li> Love the product and Amazon makes it happen quicky!</li>
            <li> Wonderful. Worked great. Can&#x27;t wait to get some more later!</li>
            <li> Ok everything about this was suppose to be amazing but when it came it didnt work because it was broken and dried up!</li>
            <li> Its very useful when you are doing your nails. It saves you time from cleaning up your cuticles</li>
            <li> Amazing product really love it..</li>
            <li> Simply Peel is amazing! It makes nail art so much easier to clean up.</li>
            <li> Amazing! I was worried it would break off as I was pulling it out, or not be able to handle a ton of nail polish spillage. Neither occurred! The latex came off in one piece no matter how hard I pulled, and it completely took the excess nail polish out! Doing marble nails took half the time with this, AND no need to use drying acetone</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. So easy to put on &amp; take off. It makes doing my nails so easy. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is sometimes when I peel it off, it messes up the edges a little but that can be easily fixed. I will definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!!! Great for doing nailart and not getting polish all over the sides of your nail</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! Anyone who says &amp;#34;glue is just as good&amp;#34; obviously doesn&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about. This product is revolutionary, and is a fraction of the price of some of the more expensive brands out there. You can buy a 2oz refil bottle of Simply Peel for just a bit over the price of a 10mL bottle of Liquid Palisade!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply Peel is super easy to apply, dries quickly, and peels off in one piece. It makes nail art, water marbling, sponging, gradients, etc so much easier. Clean up is literally a breeze. Worth every single penny.</li>
            <li> Great product, makes my life so much easier with nail art.  Would definitely buy again.  Smell isn&#x27;t bad, really don&#x27;t mind it.  Love the sparkle.  I&#x27;ll be a repeat customer, going to get the oil next!</li>
            <li> Great product, was looking online for a product like this, found many good reviews, girls on instagram are using it with ease.</li>
            <li> This works SO well! Love.</li>
            <li> I have never tried Elmers glue or anything like that. I&#x27;ve always been very hesitant when it comes to putting products on my skin, so I&#x27;ve always used nailpolishes remover and washed my hands thoroughly instead.&lt;br /&gt;This product I&#x27;ve come to love in just a matter of minutes. I&#x27;ve had it for weeks now, I bought it from the original website.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something that will blow you away and make nailart 10x faster, this is definitely the product for you. I made a collage and totally overdid my finger, so you can get an idea of how great this product is.&lt;br /&gt;The best part; it came off in one piece.&lt;br /&gt;The only downfall is that yes, the brush might get chunky. If it ever happens to you, you can super easily take a qtip and remove it. It&#x27;ll look completely new.&lt;br /&gt;Always remember to close it real tight.&lt;br /&gt;Something else I really like about this particular product is that the brush is just like a nailpolish brush. It makes it really easy to get all around.&lt;br /&gt;I know it took the developer multiple months, she tried it on herself and she tested out 6 different liquid latex products and she sent this to 35 nail artists before she started selling it, to make sure they all liked it.&lt;br /&gt;This was not done by someone that just wanted to get a brand out like big companies. There was a lot of thought put into this.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re still questioning wether or not to buy this, I suggest checking out her website; nailcarehq.com</li>
            <li> Generally works very well. The only problem I&#x27;ve encountered is the product not fully drying and sticking to the latex on other fingers, tools, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend for every nail art lover</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! Talk about making things EASY and SIMPLE! Quick drying, you can see. Easy to use. My daughters LOVE getting creative with their manis with Simply Peel.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> Since its latex it has a funny smell but it works great</li>
            <li> Effective at keeping polish mess at bay when doing a more involved manicure. Love the sparkles in it!</li>
            <li> Perfect! It does what it should and is sparkly too. Dries quickly and peels perfectly every time.  Ordering more.  Totally addicted!</li>
            <li> If you have a tough time staying within your nail bed while painting your nails use this product! It glitters when it is done drying and peels off super easy! Totally worth it and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I truly love this product. It&#x27;s the perfect latex barrier for me as far as nail art. I apply it around my nails when doing gradients or ombré designs and it peels right off for easy clean up. I also use it as a peel off base when swatching different polishes on my nails and the manicures peel right off. I love the glitter in it when it dries :) so creative!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of different types of liquid tape both latex and glue and I&#x27;ve been a bit underwhelmed.  They were a bit less effective than regular tape.  I&#x27;ve read a lot of good reviews about this brand, but balked at the thought of paying 15 bucks for this stuff.  I eventually broke down and purchased a bottle.  It works almost as well as you see on instagram or youtube. It does come off in one piece and has made the clean up job much easier, especially after stamping.  I&#x27;m very impressed.  This stuff is a bit pricey, but it does really work.</li>
            <li> I use Simply Peel Latex Barrier when I do nail art, and it is perfect! It shows me when its dry and comes right off when I&#x27;m finished with my nail art. This product changed the way I water marble, I virtually have no clean up! It is perfect for that lady (or guy) who loves nail polish and doing nail art. I have a blog and change my polish often so my cuticles take a beating, this has changed the game! Oh by the way its perfect for that day you want glitter polish on but know it has to come off the next day... put down a layer of the barrier and peel it off when you are ready!</li>
            <li> I have used Ana&#x27;s cuticle oil for months and love it. So when I saw she had the latex barrier I had to try! Love it so much! Easy to use and makes nail projects easier to clean up!</li>
            <li> Amazing... Love love love it... Tried it as soon as I walked in the door with it :)</li>
            <li> Great product. Arrived sooner than eta.</li>
            <li> This is so worth the money, it dries fast, easy peel off and best of all I don&#x27;t need to clean up with acetone anymore</li>
            <li> Works great, still stink!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. It delivers as promised! It&#x27;s a cleaner, faster way of doing my nails. Easy to apply and easy to take off.&lt;br /&gt;This review was submitted by my wife, since I purchased for her.</li>
            <li> I bought Simply Peel about a month ago, and I love everything about it. It peels off well and its easy to get close to the cuticle. The only negative about this product is that over time it gets a little clumpy, but is still usable. Beside that I love this product and will definitely buy it again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this item, and I know I will end up order even more so that I will not run out. It is easily used and comes off with just a little tug. You do need to make sure that your fingers do not touch though since if they do it will pull off. It&#x27;s nice to know that when I want to try something new that this will help keep the mess at bay</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I got this. I like to experiment with nail art like marbling and such and I don&#x27;t like wasting tape or trying to keep from staining my fingers as I do work with dark colors at times. Clean up can be a pain. But now that I have this its much easier. You still have to clean a bit around the nail and cuticle but it really does peel right off the finger when you&#x27;re done painting. Just make sure you coat where you need to. Sometimes I misjudge and don&#x27;t coat my finger lower enough so I have to clean there with nail polish remover but otherwise, works like a charm. Just be mindful of drying it out, you have to let it dry completely and try to do a few fingers at a time because it is really sticky and you&#x27;ll end up pulling it right off if you&#x27;re doing too many fingers at a time.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff! It is amazing!</li>
            <li> works excellent, will use it for gradient nail art, marbling etc...</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this product.</li>
            <li> Got it in 2 days and I love it !!</li>
            <li> Returned product because it contained latex.</li>
            <li> Purchased as part of my granddaughter&#x27;s birthday present. She asked for it and I was only to happy to buy it. She says it works really well and is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> It smells really bad - but works well</li>
            <li> This is the second peel-off barrier I&#x27;ve tried for nail art and I love it! I won&#x27;t try anything else. It peels off easily, in one piece, and is so easy to apply. It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard nothing but good things about this product and was so stoked to actually get it.  However, when it did arrive it was quite coagulated and globby, not liquid at all.  I&#x27;ve let it sit upright for a few days now and it has gotten a little better (so I don&#x27;t have to just lob it onto my finger) but it definitely isn&#x27;t as great as I thought.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t finally paint my nails and design them without the Polish leaving a mess. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> does the job but had to reapply to 3 fingers as started to peel off before finished applying</li>
            <li> Simply Peel is simply amazing!! Best latex barrier/base coat on the market. 10/10 would DEFINITELY recommend. :)</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased a Latex Skin Barrier for polishing my nails and I&#x27;m absolutely in heaven.  I purchased this as a recommendation from a YouTube blogger and she is 100% correct that it works great.  It dries within 1-2 minutes of putting it on and it sparkles so you know its dry.  The applicator is a normal nail polish brush and its very easy to brush on with.  Pulling it off is very easy as well and it normally comes off in one try.  If you don&#x27;t get it all off the first time, it also rubs off very easily like white glue.  If you enjoy painting your nails but hate dealing with the cleanup that comes with it, I strongly encourage you to purchase this!</li>
            <li> My package came in great time.... I love it, so pretty and works great.. it&#x27;s perfect</li>
            <li> Wow. I mean, what can I say? It&#x27;s awesome! It does stick to itself, just like the directions say... Otherwise, it is THE best peel off out there.</li>
    </ol>
