            <li>I absolutely love these lotions.</li>
            <li>I also love the triple berry swirl.  </li>
            <li>I would also recommend using it after showering when your skin is more moist so you can spread the lotion easily.</li>
            <li>I feel like I got a huge amount of it for the price as well.</li>
            <li>I like them all, buy as of right now, strawberry cheesecake is my favorite.</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing smell of all not only that</li>
            <li>This is definitely my favorite scented lotion so far!</li>
            <li>it was definatley worth the price, and i&#x27;m hoping they make a body wash...</li>
            <li>All the other scents in this line pretty much have the same delicious quality.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s great is this lotion has fantastic moisture to last all day long, a soft smell</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells exactly like strawberry cheese</li>
            <li>You will def get noticed..and ppl will know exactly what scent it is..</li>
            <li>I love this lotion but for the price the bottle needs to be alot bigger!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I would rate higher if the smell didn&#x27;t disappear so fast</li>
            <li>I really do wanna eat it.</li>
            <li>This has a really tasty scent.</li>
            <li>Like really...</li>
            <li>I wouldnt normally pay 17$ for a bottle of lotion</li>
            <li>The lotion is nice and thick.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It leaves your skin soft and hydrated, but without a sticky residue - can be easily used in the morning a few minutes before putting on clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent lasts for hours and makes your skin really soft.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t need to wear expensive perfumes (my cost-saving thinking) and makes me feel like I&#x27;ve treated myself to \\&quot;the good stuff\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>This disappointed me because I love HEMP products, but the smell was light and it doesn&#x27;t last at all.</li>
            <li>It is extremely nourishing but thick, more like a body butter than a lotion, so I would use it sparingly.</li>
            <li>It smells really just like strawberry cheesecake, not too strong or artificial, not too vanilla-y</li>

            <li> Very nice lotion. Makes your skin feel great. Scent is Great! I definitely enjoyed my lotion.</li>
            <li> Smells so good! Great moisturizer</li>
            <li> Came in 3 days. Love this lotion. Definitely recommend. you&#x27;ll want to eat but its not edible smells so good.</li>
            <li> I have had these Hempz lotions in Lemon Squares, Strawberry Cheesecake and Vanilla Creme Brulee for months since my stylist gave me the hand lotion for a holiday present two years ago.  I love them all!  Each morning after my shower I decide what \\&quot;smell mood\\&quot; I&#x27;m in and choose.  What&#x27;s great is this lotion has fantastic moisture to last all day long, a soft smell so I don&#x27;t need to wear expensive perfumes (my cost-saving thinking) and makes me feel like I&#x27;ve treated myself to \\&quot;the good stuff\\&quot;.  If I had to rate them: Vanilla Creme Brulee, my favorite dessert, then Lemon Squares, Strawberry.  This company knows how to create a wonderful product which smells good, makes me feel feminine, fun and kissable.  It needs a warning label tho, &#x27;keep your husband away during application or you&#x27;ll get distracted&#x27;. ;)  Wonderful gift for a husband to get his wife when he needs to get out of the doghouse.  Beats flowers and has lasting benefits, for you both.  Enjoy your yum!</li>
            <li> I went to a local hair salon in my town today called Hair Matters, and the owner said that since she didn&#x27;t like the smell of this lotion (she found it overpowering,) that I could have the leftover sample. Not only does it smell good, but the scent stays on your skin for hours, which is great. It is extremely nourishing but thick, more like a body butter than a lotion, so I would use it sparingly. In addition, the reason she said it was overpowering is also because of this- a little goes a long way with this lotion so don&#x27;t use too much. I would also recommend using it after showering when your skin is more moist so you can spread the lotion easily. I am really happy to get this and will be buying more very soon from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing smell of all not only that but the lotion is really good and on top of that organic. What a find love it and am going to give it for gifts this year.</li>
            <li> I bought this Berry Cheese Cake candle and it smelled so good i wanted to eat it...so i decided to google cheese cake lotion and this one came up. I wouldnt normally pay 17$ for a bottle of lotion ive never even smelled before. But after reading the reviews and people saying how good it smelled i decided to order it. Dear god does it smell good. I really do wanna eat it. Im def. gonna buy some of the other scents of this lotion.</li>
            <li> As a general rule, I&#x27;m not a huge fan of fruity and florally scents. This is an exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells exactly like strawberry cheese cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;artificial&amp;#34; strawberry scent found in other lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is just grown up enough for me but also makes my children happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and feel great on my skin. I really love the smell. I buy more every time I run out. The smell is addictive. The lotion is nice and thick.</li>
            <li> I picked this up in TJ Maxx for $9.99 and I love it! This has a really tasty scent. The great thing about it is that the scent doesn&#x27;t fade after you put it on. It seems to linger all day. I feel like I got a huge amount of it for the price as well. All the other scents in this line pretty much have the same delicious quality. Great way to treat yourself :)</li>
            <li> i bought this yesterday at TJ-max,after i opened up the bottle to smell it... i ran up to the register and bought it. i want to start off with this. when people tell me that their lotions smell so good, they want to eat it... i just looked at them like they were crazy, but this lotion... i&#x27;m so tempted to jut put it in a bowl and eat it. not only does it smell delicious, it is so moisturizing, and the scent lasts all day. when i smell this lotion it makes me feel happy... if that makes any sense. it was definatley worth the price, and i&#x27;m hoping they make a body wash... because that lotion... is heaven. go head and buy it because trust me... it will be gone before you know it.</li>
            <li> I finally purchase my frist hempz lotion. And am happy cause it smells really good.  You will def get noticed..and ppl will know exactly what scent it is.. (strawberry). Unlike some other brands that make scented lotions you can tell what it is. I keep reaplying. I plan to purchase other scents. Would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Expensive, small container, and totally worth it!!! This smells wonderful, absolutely delectable! I don&#x27;t know how they got this lotion to smell so perfect.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful. Reminds me of a Strawberry shake more than anything.</li>
            <li> This disappointed me because I love HEMP products, but the smell was light and it doesn&#x27;t last at all. I would rate higher if the smell didn&#x27;t disappear so fast</li>
            <li> This is definitely my favorite scented lotion so far! It smells really just like strawberry cheesecake, not too strong or artificial, not too vanilla-y neither, I bought them as gift for friends but can&#x27;t resist so I kept one bottle for myself. Will buy it again!</li>
            <li> This is my FAVORITE body lotion brand EVER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves your skin soft and hydrated, but without a sticky residue - can be easily used in the morning a few minutes before putting on clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is divine. Like really... Strawberry cheesecake... I keep sniffing my skin throughout the day... It is addictive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus I love the ingredients! No mineral oil, yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried the Strawberry Cheesecake, Vanilla Creme Brulee and Mint Chocolate Cocoa... ALL of them are AMAZING !!! The scent lasts for hours and makes your skin really soft. The scent will even stay on your PJs for days if you use it before bed... LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!!</li>
            <li> I like this, smells great and feels great. I will be reordering once this is empty</li>
            <li> I love this lotion but for the price the bottle needs to be alot bigger!</li>
            <li> Smooth transaction and a great product...Thanks!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these lotions. I have had strawberry cheesecake, orange dream cupcake and the sugar lemon. I like them all, buy as of right now, strawberry cheesecake is my favorite. Great lotions!</li>
            <li> This lotion smells great.  I also love the triple berry swirl.  The lemon is good as well.  Works well as a body lotion with a hint of fragrance for those of us who prefer food over floral.</li>
