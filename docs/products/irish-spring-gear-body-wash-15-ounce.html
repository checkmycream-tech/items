    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Smells great!</li>
            <li>Great smelling body wash</li>
            <li>You may want to check the scent out in a brick and mortar store, but Amazon&#x27;s price is good.  </li>
            <li>The smell lingers for a couple of hours and does a good job at cleaning.</li>
            <li>that well, not as good as a pumice stone would anyway.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice product and would recommend.</li>
            <li>It serves the purpose and it is good and refreshing.</li>
            <li>and I would buy this on my own</li>
            <li>There are pros and cons to most everything.  </li>
            <li>Most body wash users utilize some sort of loofa, sponge, or washcloth, all of which will be more abrasive than itsy-bitsy pellets included here.  </li>
            <li>An okay product</li>
            <li>but I wished it stated FOR MEN on the label, its more fragrant than soap.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>; aside, I love the look.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent.  </li>
            <li>The smell is nice--clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li>This is a great product - fresh, clean scent lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Good product with gentle smell for your showers.</li>
            <li>but it washes off easily</li>
            <li>and I think it makes it feel a bit thicker than most men&#x27;s body washes and you exit the shower with your skin feeling smooth and really clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>While the new &amp;#34;Gear&amp;#34; body wash is not as strong, it still has a fresh attractive smell to it.  </li>
            <li>texture is smooth and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really, it is a nice soap, and as such it does its job, but this is claiming to me more than that, and I’m not so sure that it lives up to that claim.  </li>
            <li>Irish Spring is a great brand, and this body wash reflects that.</li>
            <li>Decent body wash, smells nice.</li>
            <li>If you are going to buy this on Amazon, consider going to the store to smell it first and make sure it&#x27;s what you want.</li>
            <li>I also like that it has exfoliating beads to get a deeper clean.  </li>
            <li>And it made me feel clean.  </li>
            <li>It is the same fresh Irish Spring scent that builds a good lather for a great shower experience with “odor neutralizers” that lasts the 24 hours as advertised..  </li>
            <li>Full bottle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good, but I think you have to take much more than other body washes.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stay totally true to that age old scent that so many of us really enjoy, and it doesn&#x27;t make you want to never try anything new again, but it&#x27;s decent for what it is: strong and long-lasting soap that leaves you feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>He liked the exfoliating part of it, but wished that there was a tropical scent instead of the &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; scent of Irish Spring.  </li>
            <li>The scent is not exactly like the Irish Spring of yore, but it&#x27;s nice and refreshing and not too strong.  </li>
            <li>The body wash has a pretty strong scent that leaves you smelling like the soap for quite a while after your bath, and if you&#x27;re like me and enjoy that, then this soap is definitely for you.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of the scent of the original Irish Spring soap, but have often had issues with the harshness of the soap on my skin.</li>
            <li>Even though this body wash is unisex, this smells like what hot guys from abercrombie &amp; fitch would use.</li>
            <li>and when I got this it was like a nice trip down memory lane with the good old Irish Spring scent.</li>
            <li>Very nice and long lasting!</li>
            <li>That makes me sad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two-stars for a body wash that cleans decently but smells funny and misses the expectations mark.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how much exfoliation you&#x27;re going to achieve with the little beads in this, but it leaves you feeling fresh and clean and smelling great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall if you enjoy classis Irish Spring then this soap will not disappoint you in any way.</li>
            <li>Thankfully (and much to its credit), it rinses away flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s about as much as you can say about them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does not lather very well at all.</li>
            <li>I really like the pieces of pumice</li>
            <li>Using this alone will not create so much foam</li>
            <li>so you won&#x27;t have to use too much product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find that they really work</li>
            <li>It can clean the skin totally.</li>
            <li>It washed away just fine and did not leave me with dry skin.  </li>
            <li>how much more manly am I going to feel if I can scrub down with bits of lava in my soap?  </li>
            <li>Just some clever marketing there.  </li>
            <li>I can highly recommend this body wash.</li>
            <li>Fourteen year old boys do not like to put much effort into their showers, aside from singing.</li>
            <li>The exfoliating action is great--it lathers really well</li>
            <li>I’d like to think that it does, but the sad amount of volcanic pieces here (really, volcanic?) make me wonder how much good they are really doing.</li>
            <li>I can think of no negative aspects</li>
            <li>Slightly gritty texture helps keep skin exfoliated, fresh, and not dull looking.</li>
            <li>This body wash for some reason though wasn&#x27;t too harsh on the skin and the scent, while not totally true to the Irish Spring tradition is quite nice and refreshing altogether.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this product because I&#x27;m generally a fan of Irish Spring stuff anyway and</li>
            <li>exfoliating elements are sparse, causing me to wonder if it really does all that it claims to.&lt;br /&gt;The lather isn’t as thick as you’d like, thus making me use more in order to get it</li>
            <li>Only recently did I try their traditional scented body wash and found even it had that strong fresh musky smell I remembered from the bar soap back when.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a bit expensive for what it is - just a basic body wash with a pretty good scent.</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed is that the typically appealing Irish Spring scent is missing, replaced with something faintly reminiscent of Elmer&#x27;s glue.  </li>
            <li>My 14 year old boy likes the smell and the fact that the &#x27;dots&#x27; (exfoliating scrubs) helps him get cleaner.</li>
            <li>It feels strange at first</li>
            <li>So far, this has not been drying.</li>
            <li>If this had more grit, it would likely be just too harsh as Irish Spring tends to be very drying in general.</li>
            <li>Irish Spring has a particular scent that one either likes or doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>My teenage son particularly likes it.</li>
            <li>The grit is not that concentrated as I assume this is for everyday use, it&#x27;s similar to a polish from Body Shop vs their exfoliating products which are more gritty.</li>
            <li>You know what you are getting with Irish Spring, a scent that has spanned generations and the new Gear Body Wash continues that tradition.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re kind of silly for a man who has hair - they just get caught up in the hair and don&#x27;t exfoliate anything at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sort of pointless rather than cool.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not enough abrasive material to feel as though you&#x27;re getting any sort of exfoliation help, even when using bare hands, which you probably won&#x27;t be.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d prefer a nice clean lake instead of cruddy exfoliants.</li>
            <li>really boils down to what it is</li>

            <li> They are the typical exfoliation beads you find in lots of gels these days, just black in color instead.  </li>
            <li> The problem is the little exfoliating beads.</li>
            <li> closely and you&#x27;ll see small black &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34; beads in it, which are supposedly volcanic minerals</li>
            <li> I would probably use this with a loofa rather than plain.</li>
            <li> but my one complaint is you need to use a TON of it each</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t imagine spending a day all gluey.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weird.  </li>

            <li> Decent body wash, smells nice. It isn&#x27;t the &amp;#34;sudsiest&amp;#34; wash in the world.</li>
            <li> There are pros and cons to most everything.  How you decide whether or not the pros outweigh the cons really boils down to what it is you want out of a product.  I’ll just lay out my observance:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The smell is nice.&lt;br /&gt;The cleanse feels thorough.&lt;br /&gt;The texture is smooth and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The exfoliating elements are sparse, causing me to wonder if it really does all that it claims to.&lt;br /&gt;The lather isn’t as thick as you’d like, thus making me use more in order to get it everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So really, it is a nice soap, and as such it does its job, but this is claiming to me more than that, and I’m not so sure that it lives up to that claim.  I’d like to think that it does, but the sad amount of volcanic pieces here (really, volcanic?) make me wonder how much good they are really doing.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of the scent of the original Irish Spring soap, but have often had issues with the harshness of the soap on my skin. This body wash for some reason though wasn&#x27;t too harsh on the skin and the scent, while not totally true to the Irish Spring tradition is quite nice and refreshing altogether. The body wash has a pretty strong scent that leaves you smelling like the soap for quite a while after your bath, and if you&#x27;re like me and enjoy that, then this soap is definitely for you. however, if you don&#x27;t prefer the smell like soap part. you may want to look elsewhere for your hygienic needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall if you enjoy classis Irish Spring then this soap will not disappoint you in any way. It doesn&#x27;t stay totally true to that age old scent that so many of us really enjoy, and it doesn&#x27;t make you want to never try anything new again, but it&#x27;s decent for what it is: strong and long-lasting soap that leaves you feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> My 14 year old boy likes the smell and the fact that the &#x27;dots&#x27; (exfoliating scrubs) helps him get cleaner. Fourteen year old boys do not like to put much effort into their showers, aside from singing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s another body wash. I think it&#x27;s a bit expensive for what it is - just a basic body wash with a pretty good scent. The problem is the little exfoliating beads. They&#x27;re kind of silly for a man who has hair - they just get caught up in the hair and don&#x27;t exfoliate anything at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make matters worse, these plastic microbeads pollute the water supply - and I live on the shores of Lake Erie. I&#x27;d prefer a nice clean lake instead of cruddy exfoliants.</li>
            <li> This Irish Spring Gear Body Was definitely *feels* exfoliating, and my skin and does not leave my skin as dry feeling (or itchy) as some other body washes do.  So it does what it says.  The scent is not exactly like the Irish Spring of yore, but it&#x27;s nice and refreshing and not too strong.  You may want to check the scent out in a brick and mortar store, but Amazon&#x27;s price is good.  I can highly recommend this body wash.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t used bar soap in years and when I got this it was like a nice trip down memory lane with the good old Irish Spring scent. I&#x27;m on the fence about the beads and understand their purpose. Haven&#x27;t decided whether I like the gritty feeling yet. Nice product and would recommend.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this product because I&#x27;m generally a fan of Irish Spring stuff anyway and how much more manly am I going to feel if I can scrub down with bits of lava in my soap?  That sounds like a recipe for awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed is that the typically appealing Irish Spring scent is missing, replaced with something faintly reminiscent of Elmer&#x27;s glue.  Interestingly enough, it actually has the initial consistency of Elmer&#x27;s as well, minus the stickyness.  It&#x27;s gooey.  It&#x27;s weird.  Can&#x27;t imagine spending a day all gluey.  Thankfully (and much to its credit), it rinses away flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How about those lava flecks?  Well, they&#x27;re in there.  That&#x27;s about as much as you can say about them.  There&#x27;s not enough abrasive material to feel as though you&#x27;re getting any sort of exfoliation help, even when using bare hands, which you probably won&#x27;t be.  Most body wash users utilize some sort of loofa, sponge, or washcloth, all of which will be more abrasive than itsy-bitsy pellets included here.  It&#x27;s sort of pointless rather than cool.  That makes me sad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two-stars for a body wash that cleans decently but smells funny and misses the expectations mark.</li>
            <li> i recommend it. It serves the purpose and it is good and refreshing. I will buy again for the price point</li>
            <li> You know what you are getting with Irish Spring, a scent that has spanned generations and the new Gear Body Wash continues that tradition.  It is the same fresh Irish Spring scent that builds a good lather for a great shower experience with “odor neutralizers” that lasts the 24 hours as advertised..  I also like that it has exfoliating beads to get a deeper clean.  Another quality product from Irish Spring.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good, but I think you have to take much more than other body washes. I would probably use this with a loofa rather than plain.</li>
            <li> Great smelling body wash but my one complaint is you need to use a TON of it each time.&lt;br /&gt;It does not lather very well at all.</li>
            <li> I really like the pieces of pumice (I guess that&#x27;s what it is) in the body wash.  It feels strange at first but it washes off easily and I believe it does work as an exfoliate.  I got a 3 for one price deal that gave me a very low (under $3) total per unit price so it&#x27;s a value to me.</li>
            <li> It can clean the skin totally.</li>
            <li> Good product with gentle smell for your showers.</li>
            <li> An okay product but I wished it stated FOR MEN on the label, its more fragrant than soap.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner. Full bottle. Smells great!</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Very nice and long lasting!</li>
            <li> Irish Spring has a particular scent that one either likes or doesn&#x27;t.  Although I like the scent, I got it for my husband who regularly uses body washes and prefers a different odor.  He liked the exfoliating part of it, but wished that there was a tropical scent instead of the &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; scent of Irish Spring.  If you are going to buy this on Amazon, consider going to the store to smell it first and make sure it&#x27;s what you want.</li>
            <li> Even though this body wash is unisex, this smells like what hot guys from abercrombie &amp; fitch would use. Using this alone will not create so much foam however it creates a lot of foam once you use a loofah so you won&#x27;t have to use too much product. The smell lingers for a couple of hours and does a good job at cleaning.</li>
            <li> Irish Spring bar soap was a staple in our house growing up.  Only recently did I try their traditional scented body wash and found even it had that strong fresh musky smell I remembered from the bar soap back when. While the new &amp;#34;Gear&amp;#34; body wash is not as strong, it still has a fresh attractive smell to it.  It&#x27;s thick silvery color is also very masculine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look closely and you&#x27;ll see small black &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34; beads in it, which are supposedly volcanic minerals but that&#x27;s doubtful.  Just some clever marketing there.  They are the typical exfoliation beads you find in lots of gels these days, just black in color instead.  I don&#x27;t find that they really work that well, not as good as a pumice stone would anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But &amp;#34;minerals&amp;#34; aside, I love the look.  I love the scent.  And it made me feel clean.  It washed away just fine and did not leave me with dry skin.  No bells and whistles here unlike some brands that need it.  Irish Spring is a great brand, and this body wash reflects that. I&#x27;d definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Not the same smell as Irish Spring Soap, I didnt like the smell, I willn&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product - fresh, clean scent lasts all day. Slightly gritty texture helps keep skin exfoliated, fresh, and not dull looking. My son uses this every other day so he doesnt get too exfoliated. The grit is not that concentrated as I assume this is for everyday use, it&#x27;s similar to a polish from Body Shop vs their exfoliating products which are more gritty. If this had more grit, it would likely be just too harsh as Irish Spring tends to be very drying in general. So far, this has not been drying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much exfoliation you&#x27;re going to achieve with the little beads in this, but it leaves you feeling fresh and clean and smelling great.  Isn&#x27;t that what you want from body wash?  And the scent is NOT overpowering as I feared it might be.  My teenage son particularly likes it.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice--clean and refreshing. The exfoliating action is great--it lathers really well and I think it makes it feel a bit thicker than most men&#x27;s body washes and you exit the shower with your skin feeling smooth and really clean afterwards. I can think of no negative aspects and I would buy this on my own so it gets five stars.</li>
