            <li>Great product at a great price.  </li>
            <li>I was reasonably happy with Couvre, but it tended to ruin pillow cases and leave marks on head rests and the color was a bit off.</li>
            <li>I am happy I found out about it.</li>
            <li>Great.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use!love it!</li>
            <li>I just wish there was something that worked as good X-fusion but was waterproof.</li>
            <li>Good concealer.</li>
            <li>Dabbing as opposed to brushing with light moisture works best</li>
            <li>This was a great product for making you look like you have hair and it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Great coverage, easy applicatio, lots of compliments.  </li>
            <li>Perfect coverage for new growth at 3 weeks on.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use to hide the sheen of the scalp and make the hair look fuller and thicker.  </li>
            <li>Very good product, but the price is too high for the amount of product that you get.</li>
            <li>and this was too light of a color to pass on my head, probably a great product just to light.</li>
            <li>Excellent cover up for bald spots to make them almost invisible once white scalp doesn&#x27;t show through hair.</li>
            <li>After researching better solutions for disguising thinning hair without using a &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; that dripped when you sweated etc...</li>
            <li>My hairdresser has recommended it after seeing my results to many of his clients.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t believe how much better this product does until I used the Topik.</li>
            <li>All together I love this.</li>
            <li>ok, but fibers powder are better and stay longer...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m more confident about my hair.</li>
            <li>I love it, does everything they claim it will do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s does cover the scalp well and makes your hair feel very full</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, great results ,I have fine hair and looks more volume  instantly not to good for lines do , but I&#x27;m happy with the product .</li>
            <li>follow instructions, easy to use, does not wear off overnight, and I went to the gym and did cardio with no problem.</li>
            <li>I used a &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; spray until I got used to the way to apply it and it comes out fine now.</li>
            <li>This product works ok for a quick cover up in the front to fill in a bit if your wear a pony tail.</li>
            <li>This stuff is such a great color match and texture that I just comb my hair over it and go.</li>
            <li>Great product, but recently doubled in price, which will stop me from another purchase.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>Got into online school because of it, and since I purchased this my confidence is skyrocketing, I love it so much</li>
            <li>I have light red hair and the light brown is a nice color match.</li>
            <li>this product is super.  </li>
            <li>While a bit of this product does come off during the day, overall I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>A bit time consuming but worth it. &#x27;</li>
            <li>Nothing is worth a 100% markup overnight.</li>
            <li>First purchased it when the product was about $25.</li>
            <li>That being said, I have used Dermatch for more than 7 years and like it enough to continue to buy it.</li>
            <li>The best product for someone like me, very thin hair with scalp shining through .</li>
            <li>It worked great for my dark blonde hair.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>The result is cleaner, more subtle, and easy to reapply or touch up at any time (I keep it in my car -</li>
            <li>The skin is very shiney and blotchy with almost no hair but lots around it.  </li>
            <li>Just takes time to onow how much to apply.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair look so much fuller and</li>
            <li>Dermatch covers balding spots very well.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty much like having a new head of hair.</li>
            <li>Putting it on took some practice to get the right amount of water mixed in and the right application technique.</li>
            <li>It is mostly the odd look of the hair that will keep me from using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I used Minoxodil topical for several years - consistently- without much improvement and used Topik hair fibers for over a year religiously to make the thinning less noticeable with what I thought were good results but you could still see my scalp and was self conscious.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 16 and battling hair loss, I was devastated due to me not being able to go out in public because of my hair loss.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s where natural daylight sometimes shows me new &amp; unexpected hairs that need touch-up).</li>
            <li>looks natural.</li>
            <li>It does not irritate your scalp - I have a sensitive scalp.  </li>
            <li>It looks natural and doesn&#x27;t rub off.</li>
            <li>I have light brown hair some would say dark blonde</li>
            <li>It has such a weird matte look and if that only stayed on the scalp and not in the hair I wouldn&#x27;t mind that matte finish, but there is no way to keep it out of the hair so it completely changes the look and color of your hair and not in a good way.  </li>
            <li>Yikes - looks obvious and a bit like putting foundation directly into your hair.  </li>
            <li>The downside of it, is that it&#x27;s kind of difficult to get on.</li>
            <li>The other thing - this works really well to cover roots between colorings.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a guy with long hair I recommend to cut it short because applying with long hair is way too much effort.</li>
            <li>then I adjust my faucet to be a steady drip, I part my hair and wet the applicator - load with color - dab the part area (and next to it) and repeat.</li>
            <li>Too much can look oained and too little can expose scalp.</li>

            <li> Too much can look oained and too little can expose scalp.</li>
            <li> bought it for her, but she seems to think it is too much trouble to look like a normal person.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time.  </li>
            <li> If you put too much on or it is too wetly applied it may make your hair dull.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times on my thinning hair and it appears to cover the bare spots well.</li>
            <li> I have written  to the company with this complaint without results, apparently this is the only way they make this product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get it too wet.</li>
            <li> t cover like I expected it to.</li>
            <li> My male neighbor started using it after I introduced him to this product and now he uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have tried other concealers but none of them stays on your head as well as this one.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if this is an issue with the product, or just her attitude, but I won&#x27;t be buying this or a bunch of other products ever again.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that it dulls the hair around the root area.  </li>
            <li> I just ordered dark brown and if that&#x27;s to dark I will mix the two to see what I can come up with.</li>
            <li> I used to have to glue down the rest of my hair over the spot even with Couvre.  </li>
            <li> Afterwards I comb through my hair and then take a Kleenex and wipe toward my hair at the hairline to remove any excess, then dry and style your hair as usual.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like hard to use</li>
            <li> Not really a good product</li>
            <li> The product is hard to get on the sponge and then difficult to get it on the scalp.  </li>
            <li> so my hair does not look so thin.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the texture or look, and find it to have been a very expensive product for such unpleasant cosmetic results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too difficult to use anywhere but the front because you can&#x27;t see what your doing.</li>
            <li> Also makes your hair feel really dirty.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product at a great price.  Lasts forever! Colors the scalp are where my hair is thinning. looks natural.</li>
            <li> I wish this product worked better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pros:  It&#x27;s does cover the scalp well and makes your hair feel very full&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cons:  It has such a weird matte look and if that only stayed on the scalp and not in the hair I wouldn&#x27;t mind that matte finish, but there is no way to keep it out of the hair so it completely changes the look and color of your hair and not in a good way.  Also makes your hair feel really dirty.  It is mostly the odd look of the hair that will keep me from using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally prefer X-fusion.  I just wish there was something that worked as good X-fusion but was waterproof.</li>
            <li> Dermatch works great! I used Couvre for years to cover a bald spot the size of my fist on the back of my head. I was reasonably happy with Couvre, but it tended to ruin pillow cases and leave marks on head rests and the color was a bit off. My problem was caused by complications from surgery.  The skin is very shiney and blotchy with almost no hair but lots around it.  While a bit of this product does come off during the day, overall I am very pleased.  The color match is perfect.  Putting it on took some practice to get the right amount of water mixed in and the right application technique. I used to have to glue down the rest of my hair over the spot even with Couvre.  This stuff is such a great color match and texture that I just comb my hair over it and go. Thank you Dermatch!</li>
            <li> I have been using dermatch 4 years. I have tried other concealers but none of them stays on your head as well as this one. And I am going to the pool and steam room as well.</li>
            <li> Excellent cover up for bald spots to make them almost invisible once white scalp doesn&#x27;t show through hair.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like hard to use</li>
            <li> Good concealer. Just takes time to onow how much to apply. Too much can look oained and too little can expose scalp. Dabbing as opposed to brushing with light moisture works best</li>
            <li> I have post menopausal hair loss but have had thinning hair for a number of years. I used Minoxodil topical for several years - consistently- without much improvement and used Topik hair fibers for over a year religiously to make the thinning less noticeable with what I thought were good results but you could still see my scalp and was self conscious. After researching better solutions for disguising thinning hair without using a &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; that dripped when you sweated etc...Well let me tell you this product it the BEST. You &amp;#34;dab&amp;#34; it on with the applicator, it does not run or come off unless you use shampoo/soap. They advertise you can swim in it. I have told anyone that would listen about this product. My hairdresser has recommended it after seeing my results to many of his clients. The other thing - this works really well to cover roots between colorings. It does not irritate your scalp - I have a sensitive scalp.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. Tips: When applying you need to re-dampen the applicator between dabbings. Don&#x27;t get it too wet. I do this after towel drying my hair, I apply my hair products then I adjust my faucet to be a steady drip, I part my hair and wet the applicator - load with color - dab the part area (and next to it) and repeat. Afterwards I comb through my hair and then take a Kleenex and wipe toward my hair at the hairline to remove any excess, then dry and style your hair as usual. If you put too much on or it is too wetly applied it may make your hair dull. I used a &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; spray until I got used to the way to apply it and it comes out fine now. A side note, I ran out and I went back to the Topik until my product arrived and I couldn&#x27;t believe how much better this product does until I used the Topik. I will NEVER run out of Dermatch AGAIN!!</li>
            <li> I have light brown hair some would say dark blonde and this was too light of a color to pass on my head, probably a great product just to light. I just ordered dark brown and if that&#x27;s to dark I will mix the two to see what I can come up with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 16 and battling hair loss, I was devastated due to me not being able to go out in public because of my hair loss. Got into online school because of it, and since I purchased this my confidence is skyrocketing, I love it so much it&#x27;s pretty much like having a new head of hair. It looks natural and doesn&#x27;t rub off. The downside of it, is that it&#x27;s kind of difficult to get on. If you&#x27;re a guy with long hair I recommend to cut it short because applying with long hair is way too much effort. All together I love this.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it. Makes my hair look so much fuller and color is perfect. Wish it was cheaper but it is what it is. First purchased it when the product was about $25. It has gone up quite a bit.</li>
            <li> The product is hard to get on the sponge and then difficult to get it on the scalp.  When it was on it didn:t cover like I expected it to.</li>
            <li> ok, but fibers powder are better and stay longer...</li>
            <li> Dermatch covers balding spots very well. A bit time consuming but worth it. &#x27;Just wish it lasted longer for the price.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time.  Very good product, but the price is too high for the amount of product that you get.</li>
            <li> This was a great product for making you look like you have hair and it is easy to apply. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have a hypothyroid problem and my hair has been in &amp;#34;free-fall&amp;#34;.  This colors my scalp so my hair does not look so thin.  Lasts from shampoo to shampoo.  No shedding.  I am happy I found out about it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that my wife ever used this.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for her, but she seems to think it is too much trouble to look like a normal person.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if this is an issue with the product, or just her attitude, but I won&#x27;t be buying this or a bunch of other products ever again.</li>
            <li> Great.  Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Very easy to use!love it!</li>
            <li> Great product, but recently doubled in price, which will stop me from another purchase.  Nothing is worth a 100% markup overnight.</li>
            <li> The best product for someone like me, very thin hair with scalp shining through . It covers scalp well.  The only negative is that it dulls the hair around the root area.  I have written  to the company with this complaint without results, apparently this is the only way they make this product. That being said, I have used Dermatch for more than 7 years and like it enough to continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> Perfect coverage for new growth at 3 weeks on.</li>
            <li> It worked great for my dark blonde hair.&lt;br /&gt;Just follow instructions, easy to use, does not wear off overnight, and I went to the gym and did cardio with no problem.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Will buy again! Great price!</li>
            <li> This product works ok for a quick cover up in the front to fill in a bit if your wear a pony tail. It&#x27;s too difficult to use anywhere but the front because you can&#x27;t see what your doing. I would suggest using Caboki for all around fill when wearing your hair down.the Caboki looks unnatural along the front hairline so I use both products and I&#x27;m more confident about my hair. Not really a good product if your gonna sweat or get snowed or rained on. Smash a hat on your head or wear a scarf for weather &amp; exercise.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever found to hide thinning hair.  The color selection is quite varied and matches well. No matter what color I dye my hair.  It is very easy to use to hide the sheen of the scalp and make the hair look fuller and thicker.  I have been using this product for years  after a medical incident and no one can ever tell.  It washes out with regular shampoo and stays put until it is washed out.  As a woman it has been a god send to me but it works just as well for men.  My male neighbor started using it after I introduced him to this product and now he uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> Great coverage, easy applicatio, lots of compliments.  Beat of all stays on!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times on my thinning hair and it appears to cover the bare spots well. I have light red hair and the light brown is a nice color match.</li>
            <li> Yikes - looks obvious and a bit like putting foundation directly into your hair.  I didn&#x27;t like the texture or look, and find it to have been a very expensive product for such unpleasant cosmetic results. Use the Joan Rivers powder products instead.  The result is cleaner, more subtle, and easy to reapply or touch up at any time (I keep it in my car - that&#x27;s where natural daylight sometimes shows me new &amp; unexpected hairs that need touch-up).</li>
            <li> this product is super.  will buy again.  have used before so this is a repeat order</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, great results ,I have fine hair and looks more volume  instantly not to good for lines do , but I&#x27;m happy with the product . I just use on middle where I had some lost 😬</li>
            <li> Great product. I love it, does everything they claim it will do.</li>
