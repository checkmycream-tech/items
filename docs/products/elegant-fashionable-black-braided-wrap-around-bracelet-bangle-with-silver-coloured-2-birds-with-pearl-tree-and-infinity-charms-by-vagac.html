            <li> I have bought several of these bracelets on Amazon in different colors. I see them circulated all over Facebook for three and four times the price that I paid for it.  It&#x27;s not fine jewelry, but it works!</li>
            <li> Bought it for someone I know. It took a while to arrive but she loved it</li>
            <li> Love the design but hard to fasten, can&#x27;t do by yourself</li>
            <li> The bracelet was priced very reasonably and so far I&#x27;ve worn it several times and it has not broken so I&#x27;d say it was a good purchase for the price!</li>
            <li> i bought this item as a gift for a dear friend&lt;br /&gt;who really  like this item !</li>
            <li> It looks amazing! The fit is just right thanks to the adjustable band. the clasp makes it so that it can be worn by anyone, one size fits all. I have a larger wrist and it fits me. My 12 year old niece has a small wrist and it fits her perfectly. They are great for picking out the right one that fits the personality of the person that you have chosen to gift this item to. So many choices. Beautiful soft leather and suede rope, with alloy metal. will not tarnish and they are just elegant and classy all wrapped into one. A must have for the person that likes to change their jewelry on a daily basis. I have bought many and will continue to do so</li>
            <li> Clasp broke and fell off the first day.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for</li>
            <li> Broke the first day my girlfriend wore it.</li>
            <li> I really like the bracelet.  The only problem is that, although it is adjustable, the smallest setting is still too big for my wrist.  It would be great if it could be made a bit smaller.</li>
            <li> It looks amazing! The fit is just right thanks to the adjustable band! I would definitely recommend this to my close friends.</li>
            <li> Broken when I received it.</li>
            <li> Clasp broke and lost bracelet in less than 3 hours.</li>
            <li> Love this bracelet for the price vary nice and shipped fast</li>
            <li> To big for wrist.  Unfortunately can&#x27;t use. Don&#x27;t know how this could fit anyone. My boyfriend who is a big guy tried it to see how it fit (not that he would wear) it was even to large for his wrist.</li>
            <li> Clasp broke very quickly and is cheaply made. It&#x27;s easily fixed with jewelry replacement chain. Love the look and the charms!</li>
            <li> fell apart before i could even get it on</li>
            <li> I love this bracelet and have no regrets about buying it. However, this item took way too long to arrive. Will not buy from seller again.</li>
            <li> absolutely love i need more wrist :)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even fit broke the first few minutes I got it</li>
