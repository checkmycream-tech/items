            <li>May just be defective top, however the scent is still awesome.</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>Song of India perfume oils are usually of good quality.</li>

            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this fragrance!</li>
            <li>Song of india has been a favorite of mine since for ever,Kirshna Musk is a Favorite of mine</li>
            <li>I love this stuff..  </li>
            <li>i love the smell</li>
            <li>I really love it, it&#x27;s probably my favorite musk</li>
            <li>just lovely...if you love musk, you&#x27;ll love this one...</li>
            <li>i really enjoy this scent.</li>
            <li>I originally stated this product did not have a smell and gave it a rating of 1 star.  </li>
            <li>It developed a very subtle pleasant scent which solidified into a wonderful surprise.  </li>
            <li>2 concerns I have are I wish I could find it in the darker color like it used to be, to me that one was even more potent than this one, it seemed to adhere to my skin and last longer.</li>
            <li>If you love this, I definitely suggest &#x27;persian garden&#x27; by kuumba made, or &#x27;love&#x27; by auric blends.</li>
            <li>need to come in larger size, other wise I love it....</li>
            <li>It smells slightly different than the solid version but still very nice.</li>
            <li>I found it in a small shop when I was on vacation and didn&#x27;t think I would be able to ever get more.</li>
            <li>it gently surounds me!</li>
            <li>krishna musk perfume oil is exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li>Overall I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>I would say it works for both men and women, but personally it lay more on the feminine side for me.</li>
            <li>to make them aware of the batch, but they were very non co-operative.</li>
            <li>at first you may not smell too much, but as the day progresses the smell lingers and grows.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really wear it</li>
            <li>very senual</li>
            <li>Comes with way to much packaging,  so it is never broken</li>
            <li>it starts off with strong notes of sandalwood and then mellows and smells a little sweet.</li>
            <li>; by kuumba made, or &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; by auric blends, almost.&lt;br /&gt;This is a very creamy, &#x27;clean&#x27;, mysterious, seductive scent..</li>
            <li>This song of India scent has an amazing long lasting scent.</li>
            <li>I have gotten in the small fancy bottle, which is nice also.</li>
            <li>It did come very quickly in the mail; quicker than I expected.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite scented oils but the scent is not very strong at all...</li>
            <li>The perfume in the oil was barely evident  with only carrier oil in bottle.</li>
            <li>Slightly spicy, but soft and clean.</li>
            <li>i was looking for a fragrance that smelled hippie-ish and natural but not overwhelmed by patchouli.</li>
            <li>I think the 12cc size is the largest I&#x27;ve seen so far.</li>
            <li>, soft, different..get compliments all the time.  </li>
            <li>My favorite flavor for the past 20 years!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very subtle, but lovely.  </li>
            <li>I can barely smell it after I put it on and only then...no one can ever smell it on me &amp;</li>

            <li> I have been wearing this oil for a long time (years) now.</li>
            <li> however I don&#x27;t always re-order right away when I run out because while I think the price isn&#x27;t too bad for this type of product I think it&#x27;s a little spendy for a constant re-purchase, especially as fast as I usually go thru it.</li>
            <li> The consistency and fragrance is reminiscent of of Kiehls musk oil of the 70&#x27;s-which is now a watered down version.  </li>

            <li> I have been searching for a thick, long lasting musk and this is the one.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> But other than that the scent is spot on compared to other brands if Krishna musk I&#x27;ve had; it lasts all day (when it rolls on).</li>
            <li> The product received was not fresh stock.</li>
            <li> For my body temp/external environment, it took a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> i think it is a watered down version of what I first bought...very disappointed.</li>

            <li> I originally stated this product did not have a smell and gave it a rating of 1 star.  What I did not know was the oil needs time to wade before the scent becomes strengthen.  For my body temp/external environment, it took a few minutes.  It developed a very subtle pleasant scent which solidified into a wonderful surprise.  Give it some time for it to attach to you.</li>
            <li> Love this! I found it in a small shop when I was on vacation and didn&#x27;t think I would be able to ever get more. Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> Love it! It&#x27;s as close to the</li>
            <li> Song of india has been a favorite of mine since for ever,Kirshna Musk is a Favorite of mine I  am ALWAYS asked what is that? The Kirshna Musk is also an aroma of your envirement I don&#x27;t really wear it it gently surounds me! Thank you</li>
            <li> I love this stuff..  although the roller ball it came with was bunk.  It&#x27;s very subtle, but lovely.  I get lots of compliments on it.</li>

            <li> i was looking for a fragrance that smelled hippie-ish and natural but not overwhelmed by patchouli. i like patchouli but my co-workers do not. krishna musk perfume oil is exactly what i was looking for. it starts off with strong notes of sandalwood and then mellows and smells a little sweet. i love the smell and i haven&#x27;t had problems with the fragrance fading away too soon.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this oil for a long time (years) now. I really love it, it&#x27;s probably my favorite musk however I don&#x27;t always re-order right away when I run out because while I think the price isn&#x27;t too bad for this type of product I think it&#x27;s a little spendy for a constant re-purchase, especially as fast as I usually go thru it. 2 concerns I have are I wish I could find it in the darker color like it used to be, to me that one was even more potent than this one, it seemed to adhere to my skin and last longer. 2d, I wish it were manufactured in a lager bottle. I think the 12cc size is the largest I&#x27;ve seen so far. If anyone has any information on my concerns please let me know.</li>
            <li> In the past I have only bought this scent in the solid version but decided to try the oil this time. It smells slightly different than the solid version but still very nice.</li>
            <li> just lovely...if you love musk, you&#x27;ll love this one...very senual, soft, different..get compliments all the time.  need to come in larger size, other wise I love it....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only forfeiting a star on this one because the rollerball is finicky sometimes it&#x27;s not rolling.... Which is it&#x27;s one function and that&#x27;s upsetting. But other than that the scent is spot on compared to other brands if Krishna musk I&#x27;ve had; it lasts all day (when it rolls on). It did come very quickly in the mail; quicker than I expected. Overall I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this fragrance!</li>
            <li> My favorite flavor for the past 20 years! Comes with way to much packaging,  so it is never broken</li>
            <li> Good quality.Song of India perfume oils are usually of good quality. I like the roll on so that I can carry when I travel.</li>
            <li> The product received was not fresh stock. The perfume in the oil was barely evident  with only carrier oil in bottle. Contacted seller (Xtremek)  to make them aware of the batch, but they were very non co-operative. Very disappointed with the quality.</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling musk oil I&#x27;ve ever experienced!!! I wished they made these in larger sized bottles!!!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scented oils but the scent is not very strong at all...</li>
            <li> i really enjoy this scent. the musk grows stronger as it you wear it, but its not overpowering.  hopefully this vendor will restock this scent.</li>
            <li> Beautiful gentle musky flower fragrance!  Love it!  I will order again!</li>
            <li> This scent is so very beautiful. I could almost compare it to &amp;#34;persian garden&amp;#34; by kuumba made, or &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; by auric blends, almost.&lt;br /&gt;This is a very creamy, &#x27;clean&#x27;, mysterious, seductive scent.. at first you may not smell too much, but as the day progresses the smell lingers and grows. I would say it works for both men and women, but personally it lay more on the feminine side for me. If you love this, I definitely suggest &#x27;persian garden&#x27; by kuumba made, or &#x27;love&#x27; by auric blends. mmmmmm.</li>
            <li> I have bought this repeatedly over the years. It has become a part of my lifestyle. I often have people tell me how nice I smell. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This song of India scent has an amazing long lasting scent. I have gotten in the small fancy bottle, which is nice also. I tried this bottle with the roll on thinking it would be easier to apply, but the ball doesn&#x27;t roll.. May just be defective top, however the scent is still awesome. I get lots of compliments. Slightly spicy, but soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I can barely smell it after I put it on and only then...no one can ever smell it on me &amp; I cannot either. i think it is a watered down version of what I first bought...very disappointed.</li>
