    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>used the sin bra with a bathing suit and it worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Brilliantly!!  </li>
            <li>Awesome product....</li>
            <li>This item works well, and I have been very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Get creative people!</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and does just what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li>This product DOES actually lift &amp; create the cleavage as promised without a bra - perfect for those plunging neck lines.</li>
            <li>If you purchase, make sure the outfit &amp;/or</li>
            <li>The product would probably be better if better instructions were provided.</li>
            <li>Be sure not to leave them on for over 6 hours</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s still adhesive still on them (despite lots of washing)</li>
            <li>I have c cups, so maybe itll work better on a or b cups</li>
            <li>Might  be ideal for smaller sizes</li>
            <li>and it stayed stuck and, after five or six hours was easily removed.  </li>
            <li>I tried to gently peel them off using warm water and it did absoultly nothing.</li>
            <li>After wearing for afternoon, found that when I removed I had some kind of skin reaction which would last for more than a week.  </li>
            <li>&quot; many times and never had the same kind of reaction.  </li>
            <li>This product  is not for anyone who measurements are a full DD.</li>
            <li>and I recommend taking them off in the shower because I believe it must have been the saltwater that made them so easy to remove the first time.</li>
            <li>the event is worth the after-effects.</li>
            <li>It obviously stuck but how safe is it?    </li>
            <li>I am a D cup the product does lift but it is far from secure.  </li>
            <li>when I took them off the following morning it literally ripped off the top layer of skin in two places.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m quite sure I will be left with scars.  </li>
            <li>but i used two on each breast to be sure that they will hold for the entire evening!</li>
            <li>I used it under a bandeau bikini top IN THE LAKE, IN A POOL, SWEATING, ON A BOAT, and then out for the entire night....</li>
            <li>However, i think being careful when removing them next time may make the process more satisfying.</li>
            <li>So my vote is not for the large breasted.</li>
            <li>The tapes really work</li>
            <li>It really did work.  </li>
            <li>This product is definitely not for women with full breast.</li>
            <li>The second one came off alot easier after soaking a warm wet flannel on it.  </li>
            <li>It sounded like a good idea, but I&#x27;m not very impressed.</li>
            <li>It really does lift your breasts, but whatever they put in the glue may either be TOXIC or react with someone who has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>my skin on both breasts still don&#x27;t look like they normally do</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to find out what exactly is in the glue, but everything I find about the product is in Spanish.</li>
            <li>The shape the tape creates looks natural and lopsided.</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t remember enough from my school days to understand what to do with the tape?  </li>
            <li>These worked great until I tried taking them off and they ripped my skin off leaving large bloody open wounds on my chest!</li>
            <li>I was surprised when I received this item and it was in Spanish....</li>
            <li>First one to get the lift I wanted, second one to smooth down any areas that looked weird because of the first one.</li>
            <li>I slowly peeled the product off (it stung) and now the skin where the product covered looks like it has a mild sunburn.</li>
            <li>I have never had a reaction to any other glue type substance, and didn&#x27;t think that I had very sensitive skin.</li>

            <li> I agree with some of the other reviewers that they lift a little bit, but they do not offer ANY support and even though I cleaned my skin beforehand, they came off in the first hour.</li>
            <li> No major damage to where I won&#x27;t be using them again.  </li>
            <li> I agree with the last customer, you have to be careful when removing them.  </li>
            <li> but it was hopeless and the illustrations are not clear either.</li>
            <li> a total of about 15 hours WET AND DRY.</li>
            <li> Prior to purchasing this product, I was aware that the instructions were in spanish, but I did not know it would be complicated to use.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an inch long and will defo scar!!!  </li>
            <li> * Be careful when using this product.</li>
            <li> A little disappointed but i kind of expected it.</li>
            <li> Its such a shame that they work but are risky to remove with the potential to seriously damage your skin.</li>
            <li> At least it came with the nipple pasties so it wasn&#x27;t a complete waste of a purchase.</li>
            <li> Not a fun look.</li>
            <li> However, Plan on having residue on your boobs for the next few days!!</li>
            <li> Plus it kinda pinches at your skin a little sometimes while you&#x27;re wearing them.</li>
            <li> I can now wear my tank tops since gaining a little weight.  </li>
            <li> So, they work but if not removed with care very, very SLOWLY you will be left with sores.  </li>
            <li> BE VERY CAREFUL!!</li>
            <li> I also cannot believe that it will hold up my drooping small tea bags so probably a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I gave 3 stars for they hurt my skin and take a little with them  when i removed the tape leaving a scar!</li>
            <li> Remove them slowly and carefully!!!</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> The first one I removed...  TOOK MY SKIN OFF LEAVING ME WITH A PAINFUL WOUND!!!!   </li>
            <li> The directions are in spanish and it smelled horrible, like it came from a farm.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, at the end of the night, I removed the tape as well as some of my skin.  </li>
            <li> And the sticky tape leaves glue residue on your skin that collects fragments &amp; particles from your clothing and ends up looking dirty.</li>

            <li> This product DOES actually lift &amp; create the cleavage as promised without a bra - perfect for those plunging neck lines. However, Plan on having residue on your boobs for the next few days!! The stuff HURTS when you try to take it off. And the sticky tape leaves glue residue on your skin that collects fragments &amp; particles from your clothing and ends up looking dirty. Not a fun look. Plus it kinda pinches at your skin a little sometimes while you&#x27;re wearing them. If you purchase, make sure the outfit &amp;/or the event is worth the after-effects.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely not for women with full breast. The product would probably be better if better instructions were provided. Prior to purchasing this product, I was aware that the instructions were in spanish, but I did not know it would be complicated to use. This product  is not for anyone who measurements are a full DD.</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I received this item and it was in Spanish....I had read the reviews but somehow missed the comments about the product being in Spanish and from Mexico, or they were not there when I read the reviews. Because of that, I do not know if they have instructions on how to remove the product without damaging your skin. I slowly peeled the product off (it stung) and now the skin where the product covered looks like it has a mild sunburn. I hope that is not permanent! Also I question the type and the quality of the adhesive used. It obviously stuck but how safe is it?    I would not recommend this product to anyone and will be throwing the unused portion away.</li>
            <li> I agree with some of the other reviewers that they lift a little bit, but they do not offer ANY support and even though I cleaned my skin beforehand, they came off in the first hour. What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> This item works well, and I have been very pleased with it. Very comfortable and does just what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> After wearing for afternoon, found that when I removed I had some kind of skin reaction which would last for more than a week.  I tried it on several different times and always got the same reaction.  Finally threw the remainder out, because of the reaction I got from this product.  On the reverse side I have used the actual \\&quot;Bring It UP\\&quot; many times and never had the same kind of reaction.  I do not recommend this knock off to anyone.</li>
            <li> I am a D cup the product does lift but it is far from secure.  The shape the tape creates looks natural and lopsided. At least it came with the nipple pasties so it wasn&#x27;t a complete waste of a purchase.</li>
            <li> Leave a sticky residue on my skin that i DO NOT like. I stopped using them after two applications.  Also the directions were in SPANISH so I COULD NOT read them. I ended up having to watch a Youtube video (ew).   Not sure how usefel they can be when the tape shows at the top; can&#x27;t make cleavage if the tape is showing :-/</li>
            <li> The name itself is spanish Sin Bra meaning in english without bra , but not for my DD cups. So my vote is not for the large breasted.</li>
            <li> used the sin bra with a bathing suit and it worked wonderfully. was in and out of the ocean salt water all afternoon and it stayed stuck and, after five or six hours was easily removed.  BUT.... cut one into strips to use with another outfit the next day and forgot to take them off. when I took them off the following morning it literally ripped off the top layer of skin in two places. That was two weeks ago and I&#x27;m quite sure I will be left with scars.  Be sure not to leave them on for over 6 hours and I recommend taking them off in the shower because I believe it must have been the saltwater that made them so easy to remove the first time. Remove them slowly and carefully!!!</li>
            <li> ***BEWARE*** Be careful when using this product. It really does lift your breasts, but whatever they put in the glue may either be TOXIC or react with someone who has sensitive skin. I have never had a reaction to any other glue type substance, and didn&#x27;t think that I had very sensitive skin. However, I tried to thoroughly remove the remaining glue bits, but the next day I woke up to find I was bleeding!! and that my breasts were covered in sores!! BE VERY CAREFUL!! I&#x27;ve been trying to find out what exactly is in the glue, but everything I find about the product is in Spanish.</li>
            <li> Had to leave a review on this product.  Yes they work...  Brilliantly!!  I wore them under a backless dress to a wedding and didn&#x27;t have to worry the entire time, they didn&#x27;t budge at all!! Fab!  When it came to removing them I wish I&#x27;d heeded the warnings I&#x27;d read on here!  The first one I removed...  TOOK MY SKIN OFF LEAVING ME WITH A PAINFUL WOUND!!!!   The second one came off alot easier after soaking a warm wet flannel on it.  So, they work but if not removed with care very, very SLOWLY you will be left with sores.  One week on and my skin on both breasts still don&#x27;t look like they normally do i&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s still adhesive still on them (despite lots of washing) my wound is healing it&#x27;s an inch long and will defo scar!!!  Its such a shame that they work but are risky to remove with the potential to seriously damage your skin. They should come with a warning about the potential damage they can cause and how to avoid it.  Shame on you Sinbra!</li>
            <li> I tried to use these in vegas with a low cut v neck dress....did not hold up breasts as in picture. I have c cups, so maybe itll work better on a or b cups</li>
            <li> I bought these to wear with a low cut dress and when I tried to take them off at the end of the day, it peeled bits of my skin off and wouldn&#x27;t come off all the way. I tried to gently peel them off using warm water and it did absoultly nothing. It left a sticky residue on my breasts and a bunch of cuts all around where the product was. The directions are in spanish and it smelled horrible, like it came from a farm. This product should be taken off the market.</li>
            <li> I have just received the Sin Bra lift up tape yet the instructions are in Spanish and I really don&#x27;t remember enough from my school days to understand what to do with the tape?  I had a go but it was hopeless and the illustrations are not clear either. I also cannot believe that it will hold up my drooping small tea bags so probably a waste of money.  Help please![</li>
            <li> The tapes really work but i used two on each breast to be sure that they will hold for the entire evening! and they did the job. I gave 3 stars for they hurt my skin and take a little with them  when i removed the tape leaving a scar! However, i think being careful when removing them next time may make the process more satisfying.</li>
            <li> These worked okay-ish. It sounded like a good idea, but I&#x27;m not very impressed. And they hurt to remove.</li>
            <li> Get creative people! That&#x27;s all I have to say about the reviews I&#x27;ve read. Yes, it makes lumps and folds, etc. But I used two on each side. Ahhh, there&#x27;s an idea. First one to get the lift I wanted, second one to smooth down any areas that looked weird because of the first one. I used it under a bandeau bikini top IN THE LAKE, IN A POOL, SWEATING, ON A BOAT, and then out for the entire night....a total of about 15 hours WET AND DRY. And sweaty! And they didn&#x27;t move one millimeter. I will be buying these forever! YAY!!!! God Bless you Sin Bra!</li>
            <li> While I understand the concept, it does not work on all sizes. A little disappointed but i kind of expected it. Might  be ideal for smaller sizes</li>
            <li> I received my order for Sin Bras and tried them.  The directions are in spanish, but I looked at the diagrams and went by that.  It really did work.  I agree with the last customer, you have to be careful when removing them.  No major damage to where I won&#x27;t be using them again.  I can now wear my tank tops since gaining a little weight.  Awesome product....</li>
            <li> These worked great until I tried taking them off and they ripped my skin off leaving large bloody open wounds on my chest!</li>
            <li> It lifted my breasts well and covered the nipple.  Unfortunately, at the end of the night, I removed the tape as well as some of my skin.  It left a rash and took a while to heal.</li>
            <li> They did their job. My boobs stayed where they were supposed to. And then I took the tape off... it literally took a layer or two of skin off with it. Not only did it hurt then, but it hurt again when I had to shower. Never again.</li>
