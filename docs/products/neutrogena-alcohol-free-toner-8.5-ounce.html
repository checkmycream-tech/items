            <li>Love this, has a nice smell and makes your face feel really good</li>
            <li>It also smells nice.  </li>
            <li>it has a nice scent</li>
            <li>And hence need some kind of moisturizing toner, and this works wonders.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s has nice sent to it</li>
            <li>love the product line and this goes excellently with the fresh  foaming cleanser.</li>
            <li>And also, with this I&#x27;m breaking out very easily.</li>
            <li>A mild toner, leaves skin feeling a bit moisturized and dewy for hours, which is good if you need that.</li>
            <li>I am a Mark Kay user, but they discontinued my favorite toner.  </li>
            <li>Neutrogena! :)  </li>
            <li>Gotta have the alcohols free and this feel and smell nice.</li>
            <li>I love it,  </li>
            <li>Love this toner.</li>
            <li>and I love that it&#x27;s alcohol free!</li>
            <li>Feels refreshing.  </li>
            <li>However, you can get it on sale at CVS, Walgreens, and Walmart for a better deal than Amazon.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This toner is just okay.</li>
            <li>Seems to do that ok.  </li>
            <li>OK.  </li>
            <li>Until this day, my favorite toner.</li>
            <li>This is alcohol free and leaves a nice after effect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s inexpensive and works great on sensitive</li>
            <li>GREAT for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>so far my skin is feeling great.</li>
            <li>Its a great product been using it for the past 6 years and it works great</li>
            <li>I love that its alcohol free</li>
            <li>I was using lemon juice before, and my face felt so soft, but then decided to try this, and it does not work as well as the lemon juice did, and lemon juice is cheaper, lol.  </li>
            <li>Good toner that is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use astringents that were getting to be too strong for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is alcohol-free because this makes it a very gentle toner that will not leave your skin feeling like it&#x27;s going to crack like many toners do that include alcohol.</li>
            <li>it was fine</li>
            <li>THIS is a great product, lightly fragranced so is ideal for sensitive skin (mine is very prone to redness) and removes the last of your makeup and refreshes your skin!</li>
            <li>I like that this is alcohol free, and it is even moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>GREAT toner for your facial regimen @ night.  </li>
            <li>excellent all round toner sans alcohol</li>
            <li>Such a great toner.</li>
            <li>Product has been one of my favorites for a while as it is alcohol free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and do it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>a great deal for those oily skin who don&#x27;t have extra money for toner.</li>
            <li>They are cheap but effecicient to keep the skin moistirized.</li>
            <li>I think they worked great when I was younger.  </li>
            <li>Because of that, I decided to try an alcohol free toner instead.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, for such great customer service in a timely matter!!</li>
            <li>Good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Specially since this has no alcohol is good for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are safe, non-irritating, and contain no harmful elements for even the most sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since it&#x27;s affordable and available everywhere, I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>also has a mild fragrant scent</li>
            <li>I love alcohol free toners as I believe their better for the skin, and don&#x27;t dry it out!</li>
            <li>Safe, reasonably priced, and consistently reliable.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend !!!  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re okay with alcohol then just use a low percentage rubbing alcohol as an astringent/toner or just use witch hazel if you want an alochol free one.</li>
            <li>I got 3 things from Neutrogena and they actually smell really nice.</li>
            <li>I have always liked Neutrogena products, so I picked up a bottle last time</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re looking for something nice-smelling and super gentle for every day use, have at it!</li>
            <li>product came with the right packaging.</li>
            <li>Love this toner - makes me feel clean, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, doesn&#x27;t burn</li>
            <li>Its gentle, non-drying, and helps me keep clear, healthy looking skin.</li>
            <li>But especially for me, this is one of the most soothing, non-fragrant toners for application immediately after shaving in the morning and after cleansing the face in the evening.</li>
            <li>but my skin feels better with this product, especially post-shaving.</li>
            <li>(I know it says to wash first</li>
            <li>Applied with a cotton round after cleansing, it leaves my skin feeling smooth and clean allowing moisturizers to glide on easily.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff makes the pores look smaller and skin even.  </li>
            <li>not so sure if i&#x27;ll get the bottle full or empty.</li>
            <li>It helped clean up her complexion as she has sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The single packaged moisture wipes by Neutrogena are fabulous for travel!</li>
            <li>my next go-around since it doesn&#x27;t feel like it really cleans my skin as strongly as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>I suggest using this product daily, once in the morning &amp; once at night and results will come your way quickly!</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>No burn and really cleans my face.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very moisturised and supple.</li>
            <li>it is much cheaper than busying it from Target</li>
            <li>really like it.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>and I really like it so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But, it really depends on the store that you go to.  </li>
            <li>and I have noticed much improvement with my pores.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>for my surprised they are all intact!!!</li>
            <li>For people (men and women) with dry skin - and aging skin is drier than younger skin - this alcohol free toner is fine product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a product to gently cleanse and soften the skin.</li>
            <li>And, it is another product from the pharmacy section of Amazon&#x27;s new direction for promotion via reviews!</li>
            <li>Although it is alcohol free and doesn&#x27;t dry your skin, it leaves sticky glue like residue on your face.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it was alcohol free, but it seems to dry my skin out a bit.  </li>
            <li>It is so gentle on your skin, yet powerful enough to remove all of the make-up, dirt, oil, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using for a while and will never go back to any other kind that has the stinging feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li>- this is a toner I&#x27;ll actually use on a consistent basis!</li>
            <li>I use it once a day at night and it has really helped clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena has long been a gold standard for products that are healthy for the skin.</li>
            <li>Plus, I don&#x27;t really have acne problems (aside from a pimple every now and then), so it really wasn&#x27;t necessary.  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin that is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this toner does not irritate it at all instead</li>
            <li>It does the same job an higher cost toner would do.  </li>
            <li>The first one was $8, the second was $6.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and sets up the skin with closed pores before applying a moisturizer, emollients, etc.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for the product that replaced the old one I had been using for years.  </li>
            <li>And I am 80 years old</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>it completely destroyed my laser printer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
            <li>It was not harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li>This toner aggravates my oily pores and makes my skin more oily and gross, even in the harsh winter months when I used it.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it promises to do for my dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Though the instructions suggest applying it with a cotton swab, it actually works better by splashing a small amount in the palm and then applying directly to the face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena Alcohol-Free Toner for several years now, with a variety of different facial-cleansing products, and it seems that no matter what I use on my dry skin, this toner leaves my face feeling clean but not tight and dry.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it really provides much benefit for my skin though.</li>
            <li>I use frequently Neutrogena for facial cream and hair product.</li>
            <li>this toner doesnt contain alcohol that dries my skin, &#x27;specially great during the cold and dry winter months.</li>
            <li>This stuff is definitely meant for people with dry skin; it&#x27;s very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>This does that, and sometimes after a long day of makeup or using harsh chemicals on your face to clean it, this is what the skin needs.</li>
            <li>it makes my skin feel so refreshed and not dry.  </li>
            <li>After using several toners through the years including American Beauty and Merle Norman, I&#x27;ve finally found a product with near zero fragrance that does not create a burning sensation around my eyes.  </li>

            <li> But if you&#x27;re looking for something nice-smelling and super gentle for every day use, have at it!</li>
            <li> product came with the right packaging.</li>
            <li> Love this toner - makes me feel clean, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, doesn&#x27;t burn</li>
            <li> Its gentle, non-drying, and helps me keep clear, healthy looking skin.</li>
            <li> But especially for me, this is one of the most soothing, non-fragrant toners for application immediately after shaving in the morning and after cleansing the face in the evening.</li>
            <li> but my skin feels better with this product, especially post-shaving.</li>
            <li> (I know it says to wash first</li>
            <li> Applied with a cotton round after cleansing, it leaves my skin feeling smooth and clean allowing moisturizers to glide on easily.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff makes the pores look smaller and skin even.  </li>
            <li> not so sure if i&#x27;ll get the bottle full or empty.</li>
            <li> It helped clean up her complexion as she has sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The single packaged moisture wipes by Neutrogena are fabulous for travel!</li>
            <li> my next go-around since it doesn&#x27;t feel like it really cleans my skin as strongly as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> I suggest using this product daily, once in the morning &amp; once at night and results will come your way quickly!</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> No burn and really cleans my face.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very moisturised and supple.</li>
            <li> it is much cheaper than busying it from Target</li>
            <li> really like it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> and I really like it so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But, it really depends on the store that you go to.  </li>
            <li> and I have noticed much improvement with my pores.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> for my surprised they are all intact!!!</li>
            <li> For people (men and women) with dry skin - and aging skin is drier than younger skin - this alcohol free toner is fine product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a product to gently cleanse and soften the skin.</li>
            <li> And, it is another product from the pharmacy section of Amazon&#x27;s new direction for promotion via reviews!</li>
            <li> Although it is alcohol free and doesn&#x27;t dry your skin, it leaves sticky glue like residue on your face.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was alcohol free, but it seems to dry my skin out a bit.  </li>
            <li> It is so gentle on your skin, yet powerful enough to remove all of the make-up, dirt, oil, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a while and will never go back to any other kind that has the stinging feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> - this is a toner I&#x27;ll actually use on a consistent basis!</li>
            <li> I use it once a day at night and it has really helped clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena has long been a gold standard for products that are healthy for the skin.</li>
            <li> Plus, I don&#x27;t really have acne problems (aside from a pimple every now and then), so it really wasn&#x27;t necessary.  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin that is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this toner does not irritate it at all instead</li>
            <li> It does the same job an higher cost toner would do.  </li>
            <li> The first one was $8, the second was $6.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and sets up the skin with closed pores before applying a moisturizer, emollients, etc.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the product that replaced the old one I had been using for years.  </li>
            <li> And I am 80 years old</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> it completely destroyed my laser printer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
            <li> It was not harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> This toner aggravates my oily pores and makes my skin more oily and gross, even in the harsh winter months when I used it.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it promises to do for my dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Though the instructions suggest applying it with a cotton swab, it actually works better by splashing a small amount in the palm and then applying directly to the face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena Alcohol-Free Toner for several years now, with a variety of different facial-cleansing products, and it seems that no matter what I use on my dry skin, this toner leaves my face feeling clean but not tight and dry.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it really provides much benefit for my skin though.</li>
            <li> I use frequently Neutrogena for facial cream and hair product.</li>
            <li> this toner doesnt contain alcohol that dries my skin, &#x27;specially great during the cold and dry winter months.</li>
            <li> This stuff is definitely meant for people with dry skin; it&#x27;s very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This does that, and sometimes after a long day of makeup or using harsh chemicals on your face to clean it, this is what the skin needs.</li>
            <li> it makes my skin feel so refreshed and not dry.  </li>
            <li> After using several toners through the years including American Beauty and Merle Norman, I&#x27;ve finally found a product with near zero fragrance that does not create a burning sensation around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Bottle or container was empty, it was not tightly closed.</li>
            <li> I tried several others, but they would dry my skin or sting.</li>
            <li> This only comes in one color (Cyan - no Magenta, Yellow, or Black...) and didn&#x27;t include specific instructions for putting the fluid into the cartridge.  </li>
            <li> I am not particular about my facial skin care...</li>
            <li> /&gt;You do need to be careful not to compress it when traveling, or alternatively to transfer it into a smaller travel container.</li>
            <li> But it takes me too long time to wait this product</li>
            <li> I will continue using this product for as long as they make it and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Rating is difficult because I like this product but did not like getting a bottle that was only 3/4 full.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not very &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; so toners usually dry out my skin BIG time!</li>
            <li> Even if a product is meant for dry skin, it should not cause anyone, no matter what their skin type, to break out.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t sting my face or dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> This toner doesn&#x27;t dry or irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.  </li>
            <li> Cleans deeply--cuts down on daily oil and blemishes.  </li>
            <li> My skin has a tight dry feeling even with a moisturizer present.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all!</li>
            <li> I am so thankful for this product because it also moisturizes my very dry skin that I cannot use moisturizers on because my skin will break out in a rash.</li>
            <li> Works as well as any of the more expensive toners--at least Kiehl&#x27;s, which I&#x27;ve also tried.</li>
            <li> Initially it caused a few bumps but after my face got used to it which took three days</li>
            <li> so read the label carefully.</li>
            <li> hopefully I will see a difference in due time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried may other toners that have cause inflammation</li>
            <li> No problems at all... Does not break out my skin like other toners do</li>
            <li> at first i&#x27;m skeptical since they are liquid.</li>
            <li> I use it day and night before using any other moisturinzing product on my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have hardly any wrinkles on my facial skin.  </li>
            <li> The product was watered down, has no smell and feels like you&#x27;re putting water on your face, don&#x27;t buy it from this user.</li>
            <li> It was a little cheaper online</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a little oilier and acne prone.)</li>
            <li> Other products that I&#x27;ve tried always had either oil or alcohol in the ingredients and usually did a number on my skin.</li>
            <li> I used it Dec and Jan, and finally realized the reason my skin was worse is because of this item.</li>
            <li> Keeps moisture in post-shower without being harsh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toner everyday since I was 16.</li>
            <li> Worse yet, once I finally got it into the cartridge</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a few years</li>
            <li> I read a review about Neutrogena products a few years ago, and have been hooked ont this toner ever since.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Toners in the past have always made my skin sting and then dried it out.</li>
            <li> I gave Neutrogena Alcohol-free toner a two STAR because it is JUST an ordinary toner and nothing to write home about.  </li>
            <li> I have flaky, dried out skin as well, it all seemed to be disappearing as i used this product!</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will buy again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After washing face, I usually put this toner on my cotton and wipe out my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Amazed its so hard to find this at the store.</li>
            <li> I have not had any negative reactions since using this product.</li>
            <li> Probably not good for teens.</li>
            <li> This is false advertising.</li>
            <li> Sorry Mary Kay</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> The one I had previously had alcohol in it and that was terrible to breath in.</li>
            <li> Packaging was bad.</li>
            <li> it feel like cold water!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have delt with awful acne, I was in the store with my grandmother, asking her for a skin care tip.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I gave Neutrogena Alcohol-free toner a two STAR because it is JUST an ordinary toner and nothing to write home about.  And, according to some reviewer - IT DOES HAVE ALCOHOL in the ingredience.</li>
            <li> IT works great on Combo. skin!! Love Neutrogena products, I\\&quot;ve been using them for years!! Couldn&#x27;t beat the price either!! Thanks, for such great customer service in a timely matter!!</li>
            <li> Although it is alcohol free and doesn&#x27;t dry your skin, it leaves sticky glue like residue on your face. And also, with this I&#x27;m breaking out very easily. BTW my skin type is combo/dry.</li>
            <li> I have used for years, great product.</li>
            <li> This is the toner we use every day and it works great. It&#x27;s inexpensive and works great on sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do need to be careful not to compress it when traveling, or alternatively to transfer it into a smaller travel container. Neutrogena aren&#x27;t the best for travel!</li>
            <li> Rating is difficult because I like this product but did not like getting a bottle that was only 3/4 full. It did not leak in the package so how do they ship it like that?</li>
            <li> My ultimate fave toner.</li>
            <li> Love this, has a nice smell and makes your face feel really good</li>
            <li> I have used this toner for a couple of years now.  I am a Mark Kay user, but they discontinued my favorite toner.  I don&#x27;t care for the product that replaced the old one I had been using for years.  I went in search of another product.  I tried several others, but they would dry my skin or sting. I like that this is alcohol free, and it is even moisturizing.  It also smells nice.  Sorry Mary Kay ... had to go &#x27;outside&#x27; for this one!  Thanks Neutrogena! :)  Note:  The single packaged moisture wipes by Neutrogena are fabulous for travel!</li>
            <li> This stuff is definitely meant for people with dry skin; it&#x27;s very moisturizing. I have oily skin and when I used it, my skin felt greasy and I broke out. Even if a product is meant for dry skin, it should not cause anyone, no matter what their skin type, to break out. If you look at the list of ingredients for this product, you&#x27;ll notice that you might as well be rubbing parabens on your face. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was having acne problems, and my dermatologist recommended this toner. Toners in the past have always made my skin sting and then dried it out. This toner however, doesn&#x27;t sting at all...it feel like cold water! And it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all! I use it once a day at night and it has really helped clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> Amazed its so hard to find this at the store. Gotta have the alcohols free and this feel and smell nice.</li>
            <li> Initially it caused a few bumps but after my face got used to it which took three days it was fine it has a nice scent but I don&#x27;t notice any difference hopefully I will see a difference in due time.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena has long been a gold standard for products that are healthy for the skin. The onus as to which product to buy is the discretion of the buyer. For people (men and women) with dry skin - and aging skin is drier than younger skin - this alcohol free toner is fine product. The ingredients are safe, non-irritating, and contain no harmful elements for even the most sensitive skin. It is not meant to be a cleanser so read the label carefully. But especially for me, this is one of the most soothing, non-fragrant toners for application immediately after shaving in the morning and after cleansing the face in the evening. It dries quickly and sets up the skin with closed pores before applying a moisturizer, emollients, etc. Though the instructions suggest applying it with a cotton swab, it actually works better by splashing a small amount in the palm and then applying directly to the face. For women, this product is excellent for use after shaving the legs etc. Safe, reasonably priced, and consistently reliable. And, it is another product from the pharmacy section of Amazon&#x27;s new direction for promotion via reviews! Grady Harp, November 11</li>
            <li> I have delt with awful acne, I was in the store with my grandmother, asking her for a skin care tip. She suggested a toner! She told me neutrogena was very good at cleansing. I have flaky, dried out skin as well, it all seemed to be disappearing as i used this product! I used it on my back &amp; all over my face and started noticing results THE NEXT MORNING! I suggest using this product daily, once in the morning &amp; once at night and results will come your way quickly! Definitely satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li> Smells good and feels nice going on.  A mild toner, leaves skin feeling a bit moisturized and dewy for hours, which is good if you need that.</li>
            <li> I can see the difference on the days I dont use this product. Does a great job and this is coming form a person who literally has an oil mine on her face.</li>
            <li> GREAT toner for your facial regimen @ night.  Also use their eye makeup remover.  Highly recommend !!!  GREAT for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love it,  It does the same job an higher cost toner would do.  I have not had any negative reactions since using this product.</li>
            <li> This is false advertising. &amp;#34;Butylene Glycol&amp;#34; is ALCOHOL and in this product. If you&#x27;re okay with alcohol then just use a low percentage rubbing alcohol as an astringent/toner or just use witch hazel if you want an alochol free one. No use to just pay for the brand name.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product!! Been using this for years!!</li>
            <li> A very good toner that doesn&#x27;t overdry skin</li>
            <li> And hence need some kind of moisturizing toner, and this works wonders. Skincare is hit or miss, depends on skin type, but this works wonders for my skin. Part of my daily routine now!</li>
            <li> Good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried many toners for my oily-combination skin and this product is the best. It is moisturizing without being greasy, yet removes excess oils from my skin. I love that it is alcohol-free because this makes it a very gentle toner that will not leave your skin feeling like it&#x27;s going to crack like many toners do that include alcohol.</li>
            <li> Been using for years, awesome toner, no alcohol, no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> The one I received is already opened and smells different from the one I used to buy from stores. Very disappointed. Ended up throwing it away.</li>
            <li> excellent all round toner sans alcohol</li>
            <li> I have used Neutrogena products for over 20 years.  I always use this after I scrub my face... it makes my skin feel so refreshed and not dry.  It is one Neutrogena product that I will NOT be without.  I am not particular about my facial skin care... I don&#x27;t do nightly creams or cleansings or all the things that ads say to do... And I am 80 years old and I don&#x27;t have hardly any wrinkles on my facial skin.  I don&#x27;t cream my skin... but I do wash and I do use this toner... every time I wash my skin.  It works for me!</li>
            <li> I think Neutrogena is good for my face and the quality is good. But it takes me too long time to wait this product and I must to take it in the post office.</li>
            <li> I have combo oily skin. This toner aggravates my oily pores and makes my skin more oily and gross, even in the harsh winter months when I used it. I used it Dec and Jan, and finally realized the reason my skin was worse is because of this item. I&#x27;m returning it to the store I purchased from.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! No burn and really cleans my face.</li>
            <li> Love this toner. Keeps moisture in post-shower without being harsh. I&#x27;ve tried may other toners that have cause inflammation but this one is a keeper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toner everyday since I was 16. I&#x27;m 20 now. It does exactly what it promises to do for my dry sensitive skin. There is a big difference in the feel of my skin if i don&#x27;t use it. My skin has a tight dry feeling even with a moisturizer present. My skin feels very moisturised and supple. I will continue using this product for as long as they make it and it lasts a long time. I go through 3-4 bottles a year.</li>
            <li> This product provides a good cleansing of the face, and removes makeup without alcohol.  I plan to use it on an upcoming trip instead of carrying pre-moistened pads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena Alcohol-Free Toner for several years now, with a variety of different facial-cleansing products, and it seems that no matter what I use on my dry skin, this toner leaves my face feeling clean but not tight and dry.   It&#x27;s virtually fragrance-free, and a bottle lasts several weeks.</li>
            <li> Such a great toner. It&#x27;s has nice sent to it and I love that it&#x27;s alcohol free! I have sensitive skin and it&#x27;s not very &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; so toners usually dry out my skin BIG time! And this product does not. Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> This is part of my makeup routine, works great.  Cleans your skin before applying moisturizer or makeup.  Feels refreshing.  Buy it.</li>
            <li> I got 3 things from Neutrogena and they actually smell really nice. I like that it has no alcohol so it doesn&#x27;t sting my face or dry out my skin. so far my skin is feeling great.</li>
            <li> Does a great job compared to run of the mill alcohol based toners without all the drying effects. I&#x27;ve used witch hazel (alcohol based and otherwise) for years but my skin feels better with this product, especially post-shaving.</li>
            <li> Product has been one of my favorites for a while as it is alcohol free. Never put alcohol on your face! Works well I can actually see the &amp;#34;oil grime&amp;#34; on my cotton pad after using this toner. Works well!</li>
            <li> this toner doesnt contain alcohol that dries my skin, &#x27;specially great during the cold and dry winter months. also has a mild fragrant scent</li>
            <li> I love alcohol free toners as I believe their better for the skin, and don&#x27;t dry it out! THIS is a great product, lightly fragranced so is ideal for sensitive skin (mine is very prone to redness) and removes the last of your makeup and refreshes your skin! I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me because it caused my skin to be irritated. I thought because it was from Neutrogena that it would be good for my skin but I was wrong. I will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Its a great product been using it for the past 6 years and it works great I love that its alcohol free</li>
            <li> Love this toner - makes me feel clean, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, doesn&#x27;t burn - this is a toner I&#x27;ll actually use on a consistent basis!</li>
            <li> This only comes in one color (Cyan - no Magenta, Yellow, or Black...) and didn&#x27;t include specific instructions for putting the fluid into the cartridge.  Worse yet, once I finally got it into the cartridge it completely destroyed my laser printer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANKS A LOT, NEUTROGENA!</li>
            <li> I will be the first to admit I can get lazy with facial care before bed. No way will I go through a 3 step process every night. This product has helped me a ton. With a simple cotton ball, I take off my makeup and jump in bed (I know it says to wash first but I don&#x27;t always do it). Its gentle, non-drying, and helps me keep clear, healthy looking skin.</li>
            <li> She is regular user.  It helped clean up her complexion as she has sensitive skin.  It was a little cheaper online so I bought it online.</li>
            <li> Great toner and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. Perfect product! However, you can get it on sale at CVS, Walgreens, and Walmart for a better deal than Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a product to gently cleanse and soften the skin. This does that, and sometimes after a long day of makeup or using harsh chemicals on your face to clean it, this is what the skin needs.</li>
            <li> After using several toners through the years including American Beauty and Merle Norman, I&#x27;ve finally found a product with near zero fragrance that does not create a burning sensation around my eyes.  Applied with a cotton round after cleansing, it leaves my skin feeling smooth and clean allowing moisturizers to glide on easily. I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years with no issues.</li>
            <li> Using it for quite a while now... No problems at all... Does not break out my skin like other toners do</li>
            <li> The product was watered down, has no smell and feels like you&#x27;re putting water on your face, don&#x27;t buy it from this user.</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t leave your skin stinging and still does the proper work. I&#x27;ve been using for a while and will never go back to any other kind that has the stinging feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> This toner is just okay. I&#x27;m not sure if it really provides much benefit for my skin though. (I have skin that&#x27;s a little oilier and acne prone.) This toner doesn&#x27;t dry or irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> it is much cheaper than busying it from Target or Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;I really like it. It is a good lotion.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was alcohol free, but it seems to dry my skin out a bit.  I was using lemon juice before, and my face felt so soft, but then decided to try this, and it does not work as well as the lemon juice did, and lemon juice is cheaper, lol.  I also wanted it to unclog, any clogged pores.  Seems to do that ok.  Not sure if I will buy again.</li>
            <li> One of my friends recommended to me. Then I ordered three from amazon. It&#x27;s very good. I always use it before using my estee lauder. good!</li>
            <li> Cleans deeply--cuts down on daily oil and blemishes.  Works as well as any of the more expensive toners--at least Kiehl&#x27;s, which I&#x27;ve also tried.</li>
            <li> I used to use this toner when I was a teenager. It&#x27;s cheap and do it&#x27;s job.&lt;br /&gt;After washing face, I usually put this toner on my cotton and wipe out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Since it&#x27;s affordable and available everywhere, I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.  Probably not good for teens. Always use Neurtogena products.</li>
            <li> Great toner.  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> OK.  Nothing special.</li>
            <li> I love this toner! It is so gentle on your skin, yet powerful enough to remove all of the make-up, dirt, oil, etc. from your skin.</li>
            <li> i have used 2 bottles. 3 months/ bottle. a great deal for those oily skin who don&#x27;t have extra money for toner.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a few years and I love it! I have combination skin that is very sensitive. Other products that I&#x27;ve tried always had either oil or alcohol in the ingredients and usually did a number on my skin.</li>
            <li> Probably the best toner I ever used was Shisheido - but I don&#x27;t have $60 to spend monthly - I read a review about Neutrogena products a few years ago, and have been hooked ont this toner ever since.  I find their skin products well priced, scentless, easy to use, well packaged, and excellent on my skin.</li>
            <li> It was not harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> Until this day, my favorite toner. Specially since this has no alcohol is good for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I use frequently Neutrogena for facial cream and hair product. They are cheap but effecicient to keep the skin moistirized.</li>
            <li> While I like this toner, it&#x27;s not the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I may upgrade to something with some stronger ingredients my next go-around since it doesn&#x27;t feel like it really cleans my skin as strongly as I&#x27;d like. But if you&#x27;re looking for something nice-smelling and super gentle for every day use, have at it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff makes the pores look smaller and skin even.  Its crappy I cant find it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks and I really like it so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use astringents that were getting to be too strong for my skin.  I think they worked great when I was younger.  But, now that I am in my 30s, they were too drying. Plus, I don&#x27;t really have acne problems (aside from a pimple every now and then), so it really wasn&#x27;t necessary.  Because of that, I decided to try an alcohol free toner instead.  I have always liked Neutrogena products, so I picked up a bottle last time I was at Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula is great for me.  It manages to make my skin feel refreshed, while also leaving my skin feeling moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, another poster mentioned that this is cheaper at Target.  But, it really depends on the store that you go to.  I bought 2 bottles of this, at different Target stores in different cities.  The first one was $8, the second was $6.</li>
            <li> love the product line and this goes excellently with the fresh  foaming cleanser. its a great brand no matter what age.</li>
            <li> product came with the right packaging. at first i&#x27;m skeptical since they are liquid. not so sure if i&#x27;ll get the bottle full or empty. for my surprised they are all intact!!! thank you!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I have very sensitive skin and this toner does not irritate it at all instead it is rather soothing on my skin and I have noticed much improvement with my pores. I am so thankful for this product because it also moisturizes my very dry skin that I cannot use moisturizers on because my skin will break out in a rash.</li>
            <li> Bottle or container was empty, it was not tightly closed. Box was torn because of the item was leaking I think. Packaging was bad. I paid this item for nothing, I hope I can have a refund or send me another one for replacement. I never try using this item yet so I don&#x27;t know if I can recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> Good toner that is reasonably priced. The one I had previously had alcohol in it and that was terrible to breath in. This is alcohol free and leaves a nice after effect.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Alcohol-Free Toner never feels to drying.  It makes my skin feel firm and yet gently reshreshed.  I use it day and night before using any other moisturinzing product on my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another winner in the Neutrogena family.</li>
            <li> It smells good and it&#x27;s indeed alcohol-free. I really like it.</li>
