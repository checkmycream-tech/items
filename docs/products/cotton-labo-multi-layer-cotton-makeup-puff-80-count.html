            <li>Very glad to find this product.</li>
            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>They separate nicely and don&#x27;t leave you with a bunch of fuzz on your face.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re just as effective but are softer and gentler on your skin.</li>
            <li>Much better than towels (and more hygenic, too!)</li>
            <li>I use them for home made masks and think this is the best brand I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using as part of the &amp;#34;Japanese Skin Care Revolution&amp;#34; and it does a great job of supporting the lotion and helping to hydrate.  </li>
            <li>My top cotton &amp;#34;round&amp;#34; for makeup and nail polish removal.</li>
            <li>but I think the Leed beauty puffs are better.</li>
            <li>I love the texture and strength of these cotton pads.</li>
            <li>Love this cotton u can use as many strips as you want and it doesn&#x27;t scratch your face.  </li>
            <li>Happy with my purchase so far!</li>
            <li>Great for toner (sk -II) application and does not waste product.</li>
            <li>The layers seperate well and the packaging makes it easy to remove a pad without pulling all the others out with it.</li>
            <li>Great pads for applying astringent and general face wash.</li>
            <li>yet it&#x27;s still super strong.</li>
            <li>I like this cotton very much for lotion masks, it separates very cleanly and easily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able to peel the sheets, but they don&#x27;t stretch out, so when I do the lotion facial, I have to use two of these.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very good for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product, will buy again and again</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just like a quick mask.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it is also good to use during traveling, since one single pad can be splited into five.</li>
            <li>I use these with a toner and water or water + light loose lotion of any kind</li>
            <li>Separate layers and soak in toner and gently pull wider or longer, apply to face for a few minutes.&amp;#34; Very good pads for facials</li>
            <li>The thin layers are perfect for applying toner without wasting products.</li>
            <li>i feel like i didnt get my money&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>No fiber comes off of this pad, and the size &amp; thickness is just right.</li>
            <li>Once you use these nice soft pads, you can&#x27;t go back to the regular cheapy kind.</li>
            <li>No cotton residues are left behind, and the absorption is excellent: in other words, in my opinion they are great.</li>
            <li>love the multiple layers</li>
            <li>These are SO much better and nicer than the American brand cotton pads.  </li>
            <li>They are great, and although small even when stretched, I found that I can separate them in more layers than they are supposed to be.</li>
            <li>I liked the 5 layer cotton products but its not worth.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re ideal because they won&#x27;t soak up much product ( SAVES YOU MONEY ON EXPENSIVE SKINCARE)</li>
            <li>i find this much softer on my face.  </li>
            <li>so I end up using 1 1/2 in order to cover my whole face.</li>
            <li>That makes it much easier to separate them to make the mask.  </li>
            <li>These work really well for me.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>I donâ€˜t think it is real.</li>
            <li>I would honestly rather go to costco and buy the round ones unless u go for the high quality layered sheets</li>
            <li>Once the pad is wet, it splits nicely into 5 pieces, and they don&#x27;t tear and don&#x27;t dry out right away.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to wet all 5-layer cotton pad with water and skincare lotion and separate them apart.  </li>
            <li>They are high quality though.</li>
            <li>Oh and they are sooo soft!!</li>
            <li>It stretches very well and is soft.</li>
            <li>I ordered 2 more boxes a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li>These are too thick and they dont glide on the skin very easy.</li>
            <li>These are a bit smaller than the book recommends, so I end up using 2 5-layer pads for one mask for my face, BUT these do exactly what they are supposed to.</li>
            <li>This stuff is so soft!</li>
            <li>these are not the best you can purchase but they aren&#x27;t super terrible either .</li>
            <li>so I bought this product to use as a daily hydrating mask, its easy, just soak one piece of this cotton pad into your typical toner, peel into five pieces and put on your face.</li>
            <li>Each rectangle can be divide in 5 thin layers so they are super economical.</li>
            <li>I separate them first then stack them back together before getting them wet.</li>
            <li>Thin and strong.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> They tend to be a little bit cumbersome because you have to split them, and they are smaller</li>

            <li> I would have bought it again if it was in half price.</li>
            <li> These japanese cosmetic cotton is normally very expensive.</li>
            <li> however, it&#x27;s really expensive in Amazon.  </li>
            <li> this product does not work for vaping do not buy if you are vapor horrible taste horrible taste will not ever buy again</li>

            <li> Love love love! My top cotton &amp;#34;round&amp;#34; for makeup and nail polish removal. Each rectangle can be divide in 5 thin layers so they are super economical. The thin layers are perfect for applying toner without wasting products. Oh and they are sooo soft!!</li>
            <li> This 5-layer Cotton pads are great for Chizu Saeki&#x27;s \\&quot;Lotion Mask\\&quot; skincare.  It was introduced together with her book, \\&quot;Japanese Skincare Revolution\\&quot;.  I ordered 1 box in September.    I love them! It&#x27;s easy to wet all 5-layer cotton pad with water and skincare lotion and separate them apart.  I ordered 2 more boxes a few weeks ago.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m using as part of the &amp;#34;Japanese Skin Care Revolution&amp;#34; and it does a great job of supporting the lotion and helping to hydrate.  I just wish they made a mask size one layer that was easier to use.</li>
            <li> These pads are great. They separate nicely and don&#x27;t leave you with a bunch of fuzz on your face. I use them for home made masks and think this is the best brand I have tried so far.</li>

They&#x27;re a bit smaller than I thought they would be so I end up using 1 1/2 in order to cover my whole face. I separate them first then stack them back together before getting them wet. That makes it much easier to separate them to make the mask.  I used a pack of precut facial masks before I ordered these and I may go back to using them, so I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll reorder.</li>

            <li> Wife purchased, she says: &amp;#34;I bought these for lotion facials. They are very good quality. Separate layers and soak in toner and gently pull wider or longer, apply to face for a few minutes.&amp;#34; Very good pads for facials</li>
            <li> these are not the best you can purchase but they aren&#x27;t super terrible either . I would honestly rather go to costco and buy the round ones unless u go for the high quality layered sheets</li>
            <li> Great quality pads that can be taken apart or stacked for your cosmetic needs. I use them to apply my toner and remove my eye makeup. I love them!</li>
            <li> Good! I buy cotton labo instead of the ones sold at pharmacies!</li>
            <li> It is a great product, which you can use as homemade-mask by just sinking the pad with any toner.&lt;br /&gt;it is also good to use during traveling, since one single pad can be splited into five.</li>
            <li> I have been on the hunt for a 5-layer pad because I had read about it in the \\&quot;Japanese Skin Care Revolution\\&quot; as part of the daily lotion mask routine. These are a bit smaller than the book recommends, so I end up using 2 5-layer pads for one mask for my face, BUT these do exactly what they are supposed to. Once the pad is wet, it splits nicely into 5 pieces, and they don&#x27;t tear and don&#x27;t dry out right away. I use these with a toner and water or water + light loose lotion of any kind (I prefer Clinique&#x27;s). These work really well for me. They tend to be a little bit cumbersome because you have to split them, and they are smaller so you put more work into it, but these are the best out there for this type of mask!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great product, I will buy it again</li>
            <li> I bought it with doubt, but it turned out great. I soak it with hydrating toner and use it when I need to do a facial mask for 10 minutes in the morning and at night.  Works very well.</li>
            <li> I like these but I think the Leed beauty puffs are better. These are too thick and they dont glide on the skin very easy. They are high quality though.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so soft! Once you use these nice soft pads, you can&#x27;t go back to the regular cheapy kind. You can just use 2 layers to apply toner or remove makeup. They&#x27;re ideal because they won&#x27;t soak up much product ( SAVES YOU MONEY ON EXPENSIVE SKINCARE) and they&#x27;re just as effective but are softer and gentler on your skin. You won&#x27;t regret it, get it! :D</li>
            <li> Great product. Thin and strong. Great for toner (sk -II) application and does not waste product.</li>
            <li> I love the texture and strength of these cotton pads. The layers seperate well and the packaging makes it easy to remove a pad without pulling all the others out with it.</li>

            <li> Excellent, wonderful product, no harmful chemicals to worry about, soft, absorbent, durable, disposable, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product, will buy again and again</li>
            <li> I purchased these when I decided to adopt the Japanese protocol of facial care. They are great, and although small even when stretched, I found that I can separate them in more layers than they are supposed to be. Happy with my purchase so far! No cotton residues are left behind, and the absorption is excellent: in other words, in my opinion they are great.</li>
            <li> Great pads for applying astringent and general face wash. Much better than towels (and more hygenic, too!)</li>
            <li> It is different quality comparing to the one I bought at a Japanese supermarket in NYC...I donâ€˜t think it is real.</li>
            <li> Love this cotton u can use as many strips as you want and it doesn&#x27;t scratch your face.  Would buy again!</li>
            <li> the product itself was ok, but ridiculously expensive! it&#x27;s way smaller than i thought it would be for a box of cotton that cost almost 8 dollars. i feel like i didnt get my money&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame these aren&#x27;t a little bigger.  It&#x27;s nice to be able to peel the sheets, but they don&#x27;t stretch out, so when I do the lotion facial, I have to use two of these.</li>
