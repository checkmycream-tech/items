    <ol>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>The price was great also!</li>
            <li>Makes my hair look beautiful!!</li>
            <li>great job</li>
            <li>This shampoo is great for my hair, but did nothing for my scalp.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great stuff</li>
            <li>A great product...</li>
            <li>I have bought this at a Salon and loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you get the right stuff you will have the best dandruff shampoo, better than that leading brand.</li>
            <li>I love it and will be ordering it again for sure!</li>
            <li>Their antidandruff shampoo is top notch.</li>
            <li>I called Matrix and they confirmed they did not change their solution</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost like they filled it up with dishwashing liquid.  </li>
            <li>You will love the real stuff</li>
            <li>This works much better and is gentle on the color in the hair.</li>
            <li>Received it very quickly and it was packaged very well!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years and the product works and smells great.</li>
            <li>Follow this link for some useful info.</li>
            <li>Amazon offered to make it right, to their credit, but I will never order a salon product online again.</li>
            <li>This is not the shampoo I am use to and yes I have the right formula-</li>
            <li>The shampoo in the bottle was not the right shampoo.</li>
            <li>This solution smells more perfumey and is clear with a cheap soft soap feel to it</li>
            <li>However, after ordering it on Amazon, I don&#x27;t know what I got in this bottle, but it certainly wasn&#x27;t Biolage shampoo!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a \\&quot;prime\\&quot; member but don&#x27;t order it here because of the many neg \\&quot;buyer beware\\&quot; reviews in which people say they received a different solution.</li>
            <li>I had the same experience with the latest bottle</li>
            <li>Though the bottle most certainly is for the correct product, the actual liquid therein is a strongly perfumed, watery blue/green gel of unknown detergent.</li>
            <li>but if you receive the cheap stuff I would send it back.</li>
            <li>It is much thinner consistency</li>
            <li>Today I went to a salon and got the real deal, poured both products into medicine cups and compared them.</li>
            <li>If you can get the real McCoy</li>
            <li>Like most of the other reviews this was not the correct shampoo.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is too clear, the other is more concentrated.</li>
            <li>It was watery, almost clear and didn&#x27;t lather up.</li>
            <li>I ordered it hoping it was a mistake they fixed</li>
            <li>I still have some in my old bottle and compared them side by side.</li>
            <li>The correct solution only requires a little and is thick, solid white in color and smells great.</li>
            <li>It deserved zero stars, but I didn&#x27;t want to reflect too negatively on the genuine product.</li>
            <li>the exteriors are the same but the solon version was thick, white and mildly fragrant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered from here before and got a good bottle, but I believe this is the second bad one I&#x27;ve received.</li>

            <li> This is not the white, creamy, opaque shampoo I expected.</li>
            <li> I tried it myself a long time ago and it worked for me as well.</li>
            <li> It seems watered down and smells different.</li>
            <li> This shampoo should be thick, waxy feeling and totally solid white opaque.</li>

            <li> It is watered down and doesn&#x27;t lather at all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a watered down SoftSoap looking mess.</li>
            <li> I even use it on my 4 month old for his minor cradle cap because olive oil wasn&#x27;t cutting it for him.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the same that I&#x27;m used to buy before. This shampoo is too clear, the other is more concentrated.</li>
            <li> Daughter loves this product.</li>
            <li> removed all my dandruff.. great job</li>
            <li> I have bought this at a Salon and loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought this on Amazon.  it was not the same, it is very thin, runny and does not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not the same product, probably a knock off.</li>
            <li> Like most of the other reviews this was not the correct shampoo.  I ordered it hoping it was a mistake they fixed but they had not so I am returning it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years and the product works and smells great. I even use it on my 4 month old for his minor cradle cap because olive oil wasn&#x27;t cutting it for him. I&#x27;ve always ordered from another site and never had a prob. until now. I&#x27;m a \\&quot;prime\\&quot; member but don&#x27;t order it here because of the many neg \\&quot;buyer beware\\&quot; reviews in which people say they received a different solution. Well it just happened to me even with the other site and I noticed it as soon as it dripped out of the bottle. This solution smells more perfumey and is clear with a cheap soft soap feel to it and it hardly suds at all. The correct solution only requires a little and is thick, solid white in color and smells great. I still have some in my old bottle and compared them side by side. Not even close to the same product. I called Matrix and they confirmed they did not change their solution and they do not authorize their products to be sold online so you may not get what you pay for. Follow this link for some useful info. on this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They told me they only sell their products through Salons and salon product stores. I&#x27;m  Sending this back and going to my local salon store. You will love the real stuff but if you receive the cheap stuff I would send it back.</li>
            <li> Our local salon discontinued this product so I purchased it on line. It is much thinner consistency that what I got locally and does not work as well.</li>
            <li> If we are speaking strictly about Biolage shampoo, I would have given it 5 stars. Their antidandruff shampoo is top notch. However, after ordering it on Amazon, I don&#x27;t know what I got in this bottle, but it certainly wasn&#x27;t Biolage shampoo! It was all watery and was the worst product I ever put on my scalp. It deserved zero stars, but I didn&#x27;t want to reflect too negatively on the genuine product. Amazon offered to make it right, to their credit, but I will never order a salon product online again. Today I went to a salon and got the real deal, poured both products into medicine cups and compared them. Completely different color and consinstancy. Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> Never ever buy this shampoo from here. I had used this shampoo from local shop and then ordered from the amazon. The product from amazon was cheat, everything about it was wrong, be it smell, color , thickness or bottle material. will never buy anything in hair care and cosmetics from amazon.&lt;br /&gt;how i will there were negative stars on review</li>
            <li> I had the same experience with the latest bottle I ordered that a lot of people are posting... not the same consistency at all. It seems watered down and smells different. I&#x27;ve ordered from here before and got a good bottle, but I believe this is the second bad one I&#x27;ve received. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great for my hair, but did nothing for my scalp. I can&#x27;t use it because my dandruff comes back</li>
            <li> Great product! Received it very quickly and it was packaged very well! I love it and will be ordering it again for sure! The price was great also! Makes my hair look beautiful!! Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Buyer beware!  I don&#x27;t know what is in this bottle, but it&#x27;s not shampoo!  It&#x27;s almost like they filled it up with dishwashing liquid.  It is watered down and doesn&#x27;t lather at all.  I&#x27;ve never seen this out of a dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> As others have noted the contents are definitely NOT Matrix Biology Scalptherepie Antidandruff shampoo. Though the bottle most certainly is for the correct product, the actual liquid therein is a strongly perfumed, watery blue/green gel of unknown detergent. I compared side by side with my bottle from the salon and the exteriors are the same but the solon version was thick, white and mildly fragrant. If you can get the real McCoy it&#x27;s great stuff and I swear by it but alas, this is a repackaged sham of shampoo.</li>
            <li> Bought this on April 14, opened today. This is not the white, creamy, opaque shampoo I expected. It&#x27;s a watered down SoftSoap looking mess. So disappointed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Antidandruff Shampoo for my husband. He has been using it for last 5 years. This is only one which works for him. I tried it myself a long time ago and it worked for me as well. The only problems with it if you color your hair, it takes color off, so I recommend using it once a week.</li>
            <li> This is not the shampoo I am use to and yes I have the right formula- it has a different smell, thickness, and color!  As if somone put a cheaper brand of shampoo in this bottle!  This is the second time this has happened, but this time I am sending it back!</li>
            <li> Sorry to say we got scammed... and we bought from Amazon, not a 3rd party seller. The shampoo in the bottle was not the right shampoo. It was watery, almost clear and didn&#x27;t lather up. If that&#x27;s what you get, send it back. This shampoo should be thick, waxy feeling and totally solid white opaque. I&#x27;ll go back to buying at a local salon, and it&#x27;s cheaper there too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get the right stuff you will have the best dandruff shampoo, better than that leading brand. This works much better and is gentle on the color in the hair. It helps heal the scalp, not just treat the flakes. A great product... only buyer beware!</li>
