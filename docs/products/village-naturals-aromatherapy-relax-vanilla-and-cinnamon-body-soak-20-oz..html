            <li>/&gt;Usually they smell great; however, this one is a little underwelming.</li>
            <li>My wife and I love bathing in Village Natural&#x27;s products.  </li>

            <li> This is a great relaxer for those days when a nice warm bath is the ticket to feeling better.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this soak and it smells awesome!!! I had to get her to use it only once or twice a week because I didn&#x27;t want to become immune to the scent.Buy some for your wife or girlfriend and enjoy.</li>
            <li> These bath salts are the BEST! They desolve quickliy and the aroma&#x27;a are amazing! I have tried many others and ALWAYS come back to these1</li>
            <li> I love it!  Great relaxing smell!</li>
            <li> The vanilla and cinnamon is perfect for a nice, relaxing evening after a hard days work.  Few things beat a hot bath on a cold evening.  This body soak is pure bliss.</li>
            <li> I love the scents of vanilla and cinnamon, so when I found them together, from one of my favorite manufacturers, I jumped on it! Together, though? Meh. The scent is nothing exciting; I don&#x27;t hate it, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t live up to the &#x27;wow&#x27; factor of other Village Naturals products. And unlike the Village Naturals \\&quot;therapy\\&quot; line of products, this one doesn&#x27;t seem to have any real usefulness... it&#x27;s just scented. It claims it moisturizes skin, but that&#x27;s not really quantifiable.  I&#x27;ll be sticking with the &#x27;therapy&#x27; line from now on, thanks!</li>
            <li> This is great for a lightly fragrant vanilla bath. I really like it. The only reason I am not giving it 4 stars is that I cannot smell the cinnamon at ALL.</li>
            <li> I was not found of the mix of Vanilla and Cinnamon scent, but the Epsom salts worked very well. I liked the small salt pieces vs the ground up.</li>
            <li> If you want to relax and take a load off this is the bath salt for you very relaxing love it.</li>

            <li> These bath salts are great! They have a really nice smell without the mess of bubbles. I can always count on the vanilla cinnamon scent to give me a relaxing bath. Just as good as the big box stores at a much better price.</li>
            <li> If you love Vanilla and cinnamon and a very nice soak in the tub this body soak is wonderful.  The Aroma of the vanilla and cinnamon are fantastic.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and very relaxing.</li>
            <li> I buy this brand of bath soaks for my daughter every Christmas in several mixes.  She loves to soak in nice smelling bath products and she feels pampered and relaxed.</li>
            <li> Great in third trimester of pregnancy too</li>
            <li> This stuff smells awesome! Very relaxing, inexpensive, quick dissolving! I love it and will purchase it again. I seriously take more long relaxing baths just to have an excuse to use this.</li>

            <li> Product did not have a great fragrance and did not dissolve well. I expected a bit more scent for an aromatherapy product.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, the seller did provide on-time delivery of the item that I ordered. My disappointment was twofold. First, the fragrance did not remind me of vanilla or cinnamon. It seemed more of a floral type of aroma. The bigger problem for me was the artificial colors in a product called \\&quot;Village Naturals\\&quot;. For many people this would not be a concern. For people with autoimmune problems, this can (and did) trigger an immune response. My suggestion would be to include an ingredient list, or better still, eliminate the artificial ingredients.</li>
            <li> My mother has recently moved into a house with a big tub where she can climb in and relax. She especially likes to do this after her evenings out at water aerobics. This body soak helps her ease her tired muscles and prepare for bed.</li>
            <li> This is great post massage! I love doing salt baths as post massage therapy, and these are the best. I Like the Rosemary a little better than the cinnamon.</li>
            <li> This soak smells great, even the next morning I still smelled great.  Hated to take a shower.  I jet really enjoyed these bath salts!</li>
            <li> Nice scent, worked well in the bath. I woul definitely purchase this item again.  And plan to do so soon.</li>
            <li> It always soothing to soak in a natural bath.  The key is Aroma.  The Vanilla Cinnamon as a bath is lovely .The aroma is very light, almost too light to fill the senses.</li>
            <li> I love the vanilla and cinnamon body soak.  The smell is wonderful.  I like the way it makes my body feel after my bath.  I think it is going to be discontinued and I am very disappointed. :-(</li>
