            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is performing any great improvements because I haven&#x27;t used it very long.</li>

            <li>I clean my face Good and apply this to my face and neck and when I get up the next day my neck and face are so much firmer and feels so much better.</li>

            <li>I have bought several products that say you will look younger, and that never happens, But this product after 3 days of use has impressed me..</li>
            <li>&gt; The biggest problem I have with wrinkles is on my forehead, and unfortunately most products work mainly for they eye area, but I like that this one says that it helps with your forehead wrinkles as well.  </li>
            <li>almost finished my first bottle, and so far I love this product!</li>

            <li>It has a pump action applicator making for easy dispensing.</li>
            <li>The cream seems to be very gentle and  non greasy.</li>
            <li>There are so many different products that all say that they help reduce wrinkles and moisturize your skin.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>Paloma  has a fabulous product, I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I use this as an under-eye cream, and I really like it!</li>
            <li>First off, I have to talk about the quality of the bottle.</li>
            <li>best of intelligent science and natural, responsibly sourced ingredients, our formulas are produced in small carefully controlled batches to preserve freshness, and bottled only in airless pumps to prevent the ingredient destabilization and contamination that occurs when products are opened and exposed to air or contact with fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very impressed at how quickly this moisturizer has worked compared to other more expensive ones that I have tried.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed at how quickly this moisturizer has worked compared to other more expensive ones that I have tried.</li>
            <li>but I was willing to give this one a shot because the ingredients looked so promising.</li>
            <li>I love it , my skin feels amazingly soft, and it actually looks more smoother after only 3 days of use..</li>
            <li>The skin is super soft, too.</li>
            <li>If you are starting to see those fine lines appear, then this is the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>What I loved about it that after a few days of using it, my face didnâ€™t have that leather dry look to it anymore, it was more of a soft tan look.</li>
            <li>, I had some wrinkling on my neck that was really bothering me.</li>
            <li>really look forward in seeing the end results.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin not only smooth feeling, but my skin started to feel firmer.</li>
            <li>I was all ready to try it out.</li>
            <li>Smooth &amp; silky facial moisturizer!</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about a month and my skin feels so much softer &amp; smoother.  </li>
            <li>I am really liking this face cream.</li>
            <li>the bottle gently on the heel of your hand to settle contents after shipping and to dislodge any air bubbles from the airless pump.</li>
            <li>the bottle gently on the heel of your hand to settle contents after shipping and to dislodge any air bubbles from the airless pump.</li>
            <li>i really like it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really have any kind of smell to it, so no strong perfume smell to deal with just before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but they are two areas that can really reveal your age or make you look older than you really are.</li>
            <li>but they are two areas that can really reveal your age or make you look older than you really are.</li>
            <li>So far I like it very much.</li>
            <li>Before you even open the bottle, you know their claim of Luxury is true.</li>
            <li>her friends all talk about how their skin looked and felt as they were getting older.</li>
            <li>Now as I am getting older, I am noticing the effects as well.</li>
            <li>As I have gotten older, I have noticed that my skin as started to show signs of aging.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY CONCENTRATED FORMULA - Argireline is the hero ingredient at the optimal concentration recommended by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>Our formula has 8%, the high end recommended for optimal results.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Slight tingle to skin when applied but gets absorbed into skin quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried this for about 2 weeks now, but I have to say it seems to be at least somewhat effective!</li>
            <li>I am in my 60&#x27;s and have normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li>Their unique Petide formula has provided just the right amount of moisture that my skin has needed, with no \\&quot;oily\\&quot; residue and no unpleasant nor irritating added fragrance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have very sensitive skin, so finding just the right skin care (and sun protection) products, particularly for my facial skin, is always a challenge for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t doing anything for my newly</li>
            <li>I think I have found my new eye cream.</li>
            <li>I have never really been faithful to put moisturizer on, yet have decided recently that I have to start taking better care of my skin.  </li>
            <li>The fine lines around my eyes and mouth area truly do seem less noticeable.</li>
            <li>My face is firmer, dark spots lightened, and texture is smooth.</li>
            <li>I just received mine in the mail today, and, wow!</li>
            <li>My face feels more firm, I don&#x27;t have to cash my savings out for botox!</li>
            <li>these \\&quot;loves\\&quot; of mine have all begun to take their toll on my nearly 55 year old skin, particularly on my face, arms, and hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am always hesitant to try a new product because my skin is really sensitive</li>
            <li>though I&#x27;ve always been careful to use a daily sun screen since my 30&#x27;s, the effects of all those years enjoying the summer sun have begun to show in the form of fine lines and some wrinkles on my face, and the skin on my hands is less firm and beginning to show my true</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft and dewy.</li>
            <li>She also loves how just putting it on makes her skin so baby soft.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s soft like a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li>This product is the real deal, it has left my skin softer and feeling rejuvenated.</li>
            <li>I am a 43 year young</li>
            <li>I am a 43 year young</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling really soft.</li>
            <li>No artificial fragrance, no parabens, no bpa, no phthlates, no mineral oil, no alcohol, no sodium benzoate, no propylene nor any other toxic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other active ingredients are derived from coconut oil and glycerin, excellent emollients and skin-repairing ingredients due to the medium chain fatty acids that skin can utilize to repair its surface and resist moisture loss; they also have an anti-inflammatory effect that reduces the risk of irritation.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I will definitely reorder and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>bottle itself looks as though you bought it at a high end department store, so that is a big plus when you are thinking about gift</li>
            <li>Most that I have tried are slimy or too thin.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is that it has a slight tingle when you first put it on, but that does go away very quickly.</li>
            <li>You only need a tiny bit, as it really goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I also carefully read the list of ingredients used in their formulation, I was further encouraged to see none of the harmful ingredients to which my skin is always especially sensitive.</li>
            <li>So far the lines seem to be less obvious, am I am very surprised!</li>
            <li>I noticed after about 2 weeks that the lines really were getting smaller and less noticeable.</li>

            <li> &gt; The biggest problem I have with wrinkles is on my forehead, and unfortunately most products work mainly for they eye area, but I like that this one says that it helps with your forehead wrinkles as well.  </li>

            <li> The cream seems to be very gentle and  non greasy.</li>
            <li> There are so many different products that all say that they help reduce wrinkles and moisturize your skin.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Paloma  has a fabulous product, I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I use this as an under-eye cream, and I really like it!</li>
            <li> First off, I have to talk about the quality of the bottle.</li>
            <li> best of intelligent science and natural, responsibly sourced ingredients, our formulas are produced in small carefully controlled batches to preserve freshness, and bottled only in airless pumps to prevent the ingredient destabilization and contamination that occurs when products are opened and exposed to air or contact with fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very impressed at how quickly this moisturizer has worked compared to other more expensive ones that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed at how quickly this moisturizer has worked compared to other more expensive ones that I have tried.</li>
            <li> but I was willing to give this one a shot because the ingredients looked so promising.</li>
            <li> I love it , my skin feels amazingly soft, and it actually looks more smoother after only 3 days of use..</li>
            <li> The skin is super soft, too.</li>
            <li> If you are starting to see those fine lines appear, then this is the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> What I loved about it that after a few days of using it, my face didnâ€™t have that leather dry look to it anymore, it was more of a soft tan look.</li>
            <li> , I had some wrinkling on my neck that was really bothering me.</li>
            <li> really look forward in seeing the end results.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin not only smooth feeling, but my skin started to feel firmer.</li>
            <li> I was all ready to try it out.</li>
            <li> Smooth &amp; silky facial moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a month and my skin feels so much softer &amp; smoother.  </li>
            <li> I am really liking this face cream.</li>
            <li> the bottle gently on the heel of your hand to settle contents after shipping and to dislodge any air bubbles from the airless pump.</li>
            <li> the bottle gently on the heel of your hand to settle contents after shipping and to dislodge any air bubbles from the airless pump.</li>
            <li> i really like it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really have any kind of smell to it, so no strong perfume smell to deal with just before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but they are two areas that can really reveal your age or make you look older than you really are.</li>
            <li> but they are two areas that can really reveal your age or make you look older than you really are.</li>
            <li> So far I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Before you even open the bottle, you know their claim of Luxury is true.</li>
            <li> her friends all talk about how their skin looked and felt as they were getting older.</li>
            <li> Now as I am getting older, I am noticing the effects as well.</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older, I have noticed that my skin as started to show signs of aging.  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY CONCENTRATED FORMULA - Argireline is the hero ingredient at the optimal concentration recommended by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Our formula has 8%, the high end recommended for optimal results.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Slight tingle to skin when applied but gets absorbed into skin quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried this for about 2 weeks now, but I have to say it seems to be at least somewhat effective!</li>
            <li> I am in my 60&#x27;s and have normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li> Their unique Petide formula has provided just the right amount of moisture that my skin has needed, with no \\&quot;oily\\&quot; residue and no unpleasant nor irritating added fragrance.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have very sensitive skin, so finding just the right skin care (and sun protection) products, particularly for my facial skin, is always a challenge for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t doing anything for my newly</li>
            <li> I think I have found my new eye cream.</li>
            <li> I have never really been faithful to put moisturizer on, yet have decided recently that I have to start taking better care of my skin.  </li>
            <li> The fine lines around my eyes and mouth area truly do seem less noticeable.</li>
            <li> My face is firmer, dark spots lightened, and texture is smooth.</li>
            <li> I just received mine in the mail today, and, wow!</li>
            <li> My face feels more firm, I don&#x27;t have to cash my savings out for botox!</li>
            <li> these \\&quot;loves\\&quot; of mine have all begun to take their toll on my nearly 55 year old skin, particularly on my face, arms, and hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am always hesitant to try a new product because my skin is really sensitive</li>
            <li> though I&#x27;ve always been careful to use a daily sun screen since my 30&#x27;s, the effects of all those years enjoying the summer sun have begun to show in the form of fine lines and some wrinkles on my face, and the skin on my hands is less firm and beginning to show my true</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft and dewy.</li>
            <li> She also loves how just putting it on makes her skin so baby soft.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s soft like a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li> This product is the real deal, it has left my skin softer and feeling rejuvenated.</li>

            <li> Leaves skin feeling really soft.</li>

            <li> Other active ingredients are derived from coconut oil and glycerin, excellent emollients and skin-repairing ingredients due to the medium chain fatty acids that skin can utilize to repair its surface and resist moisture loss; they also have an anti-inflammatory effect that reduces the risk of irritation.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I will definitely reorder and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> bottle itself looks as though you bought it at a high end department store, so that is a big plus when you are thinking about gift</li>
            <li> Most that I have tried are slimy or too thin.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that it has a slight tingle when you first put it on, but that does go away very quickly.</li>
            <li> You only need a tiny bit, as it really goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I also carefully read the list of ingredients used in their formulation, I was further encouraged to see none of the harmful ingredients to which my skin is always especially sensitive.</li>
            <li> So far the lines seem to be less obvious, am I am very surprised!</li>
            <li> I noticed after about 2 weeks that the lines really were getting smaller and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> simply wash my face, and let it air dry.  </li>
            <li> I have always had an oily complexion, so most things that I have used in the past, have made it worse.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m looking forward to the long term results of this!</li>
            <li> are a bit dry.</li>
            <li> I simply apply a small amount on my face prior to applying my makeup.  </li>
            <li> Enough so that I&#x27;m encouraged to continue to use this cream year round, along with my sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days</li>
            <li> , our formulas are produced in small carefully controlled batches to preserve freshness, and bottled only in airless pumps to prevent the ingredient destabilization and contamination that occurs when products are opened and exposed to air or contact with fingers.&lt;br</li>

            <li> No parabens, bpa, phthlates, mineral oil, alcohol, sodium benzoate, propylene or any other toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like real oily products of real thick products ...</li>
            <li> Ingredients should ALWAYS be listed from highest to lowest concentration, not by just the active ingredients!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I imagine this bottle will last me for at least a year.</li>
            <li> The only negative for her is after she washes her face the areas around her mouth and nose</li>
            <li> The lines around my eyes and even the bags seem to be calming down.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smoother with less visible lines</li>
            <li> I never noticed a change in the little lines by my eyes.</li>
            <li> With this moisturizer you notice a difference within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer claims to firm our face just like botox.</li>
            <li> A little goes a L-O-N-G way!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 4 days</li>
            <li> Not a potent smell.</li>
            <li> is it is not oily like a lot of moisturizers I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Got rid of a couple small wrinkles after 1 month.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my under eye circles are slowly fading.</li>
            <li> it is not to thick or oily ....</li>

            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this quality product now for several weeks and have not been disappointed by Paloma Skin Therapy.</li>
            <li> DOCUMENTED CLINICAL STUDIES - Studies based on the use of a 5% concentration of Argireline in volunteers showed that wrinkles around the eyes decreased up to 17% after 15 days of treatment and up to 27% after 30 days of treatment.</li>
            <li> The scent is faint</li>

            <li> I work outside a lot and the sun gets to my face really bad. I am always looking for something that will help with wrinkles but that also keeps my face moisturized now. Then I came across this amazing opportunity to try the Anti Aging Moisturizer by Paloma Therapy for an outstanding price for my honest feedback. I was so excited to try this cream on my face. This cream was amazing to put on my face, it was so soft and creamy, I loved it, I wish I could use it on my whole body. The smell was amazing also. What I loved about it that after a few days of using it, my face didnâ€™t have that leather dry look to it anymore, it was more of a soft tan look. I feel like I look amazing, and truthfully thatâ€™s all that matters. I hope that you get to feel as beautiful as I do. Thank you Paloma Skin Therapy for an amazing product!!</li>
            <li> This is the product I&#x27;ve been searching for. With some recent weight loss (over 50 pounds...yay, me!), I had some wrinkling on my neck that was really bothering me. I&#x27;ve been using Dermalogica on my face and neck for years and love it but it wasn&#x27;t doing anything for my newly, shar pei&#x27;ed neck. I am always hesitant to try a new product because my skin is really sensitive but I was willing to give this one a shot because the ingredients looked so promising. I have been so happy with the results and I have had no bad reaction after 3 weeks of use...one pump in the morning and one pump at bedtime. Besides the great results, another sort of &amp;#34;minor&amp;#34; plus, is that there is absolutely no fragrance. I will definitely reorder and I highly recommend this product. For your reference, I&#x27;m a 42 year old female with a fair complexion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 4 days and I love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily which is great and it has a very light scent.&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that my skin feels.smoother, firmer and looks clearer since.using this moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I really look forward in seeing the end results. I highly recommend this effective moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I instantly felt a difference in the way my skin felt. I also liked the fact that it has no perfumey smell.</li>
            <li> Just started using this one day and can feel the difference.  I use it under my skin cream.</li>
            <li> Not a potent smell. Leaves skin not only smooth feeling, but my skin started to feel firmer. You don&#x27;t have to use a ton so the bottle should last a while. The bottle is easy to use. It didn&#x27;t leave a residue or oily skin. Definitely like!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is performing any great improvements because I haven&#x27;t used it very long. I do feel like my skin looks somewhat better, but mostly, it feels so velvety soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has a nice consistency and feels really good on your skin.  I would definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I remember hearing my mother  her friends all talk about how their skin looked and felt as they were getting older. Now as I am getting older, I am noticing the effects as well. There are so many different products that all say that they help reduce wrinkles and moisturize your skin. Most that I have tried are slimy or too thin. I never noticed a change in the little lines by my eyes. I was asked if I would try this product and give my honest and unbiased opinion of it. I was all ready to try it out. I noticed after about 2 weeks that the lines really were getting smaller and less noticeable. I am so very excited to keep trying this out. I think I have found my new eye cream.</li>
            <li> Smooth &amp; silky facial moisturizer! Seems to fill in crows feet... Feels good on skin, Lovin it!</li>
            <li> Loving to work in my outdoor flower gardens, loving to swim, and loving the warmth of the sun ... these \\&quot;loves\\&quot; of mine have all begun to take their toll on my nearly 55 year old skin, particularly on my face, arms, and hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I&#x27;ve always been careful to use a daily sun screen since my 30&#x27;s, the effects of all those years enjoying the summer sun have begun to show in the form of fine lines and some wrinkles on my face, and the skin on my hands is less firm and beginning to show my true age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have very sensitive skin, so finding just the right skin care (and sun protection) products, particularly for my facial skin, is always a challenge for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I noted that Paloma&#x27;s Skin Therapy skin firming cream is 100% fragrance free, is Made In The USA in an FDA certified facility, is a 100% cruelty free product, and has a 100% money-back guarantee ... the company caught my attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I also carefully read the list of ingredients used in their formulation, I was further encouraged to see none of the harmful ingredients to which my skin is always especially sensitive. No artificial fragrance, no parabens, no bpa, no phthlates, no mineral oil, no alcohol, no sodium benzoate, no propylene nor any other toxic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this quality product now for several weeks and have not been disappointed by Paloma Skin Therapy. Their unique Petide formula has provided just the right amount of moisture that my skin has needed, with no \\&quot;oily\\&quot; residue and no unpleasant nor irritating added fragrance. The fine lines around my eyes and mouth area truly do seem less noticeable. Enough so that I&#x27;m encouraged to continue to use this cream year round, along with my sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with the results and am happy to have been given the opportunity to purchase Paloma&#x27;s skin firming cream during a recent company promotion, in exchange for my fair and unbiased review. It&#x27;s a quality, convenient, pleasant and easy to apply and use skin care product that meets all my sensitive skin&#x27;s needs ... and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00MFWKN9E Anti Aging Moisturizer with Peptides-Advanced Luxury Concentrated Argireline Cream for Face, Eyes, and Neck by Paloma Skin Therapy]]lity, convenient, pleasant and easy to apply and use skin care product that meets all my sensitive skin&#x27;s needs ... and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00MFWKN9E Anti Aging Moisturizer with Peptides-Advanced Luxury Concentrated Argireline Cream for Face, Eyes, and Neck by Paloma Skin Therapy]]</li>
            <li> This helped improve the feeling of me aging skin. Within a week my face feels softer...</li>
            <li> I believe this product has helped with my neck but I don&#x27;t think I can justify the cost. Looking for a less expensive alternative.</li>
            <li> Broke me out horribly and dried my skin. Was disappointed</li>
            <li> I just love this Moisturizer!  I have been using it for about a month and my skin feels so much softer &amp; smoother.  The fine lines really are dimished.  It is so worth the price and I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I had read a great deal about the power of Peptides. LOVING this moisturizer, fine lines greatly diminished!!!  Paloma  has a fabulous product, I have sensitive skin. This went on like a dream, results amazing.</li>
            <li> I received this at a special price for an honest review.  I am really liking this face cream. I&#x27;ve been using it for awhile now and it has reduced dryness in my face and brightened the area under my eyes. I really feel when I see my reflection in the mirror that I do look more relaxed and have a better complexion.</li>
            <li> liked this product.  moisturized without being sticky</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried this for about 2 weeks now, but I have to say it seems to be at least somewhat effective! I am in my 60&#x27;s and have normal to oily skin. I mostly use the product (day and night) on my neck which is getting a bit saggy. So far the lines seem to be less obvious, am I am very surprised!</li>
            <li> I use this as an under-eye cream, and I really like it! I have noticed that my under eye circles are slowly fading. The skin is super soft, too. A little goes a L-O-N-G way! I imagine this bottle will last me for at least a year. The only complaint I have is that it has a slight tingle when you first put it on, but that does go away very quickly.</li>
            <li> I love it , my skin feels amazingly soft, and it actually looks more smoother after only 3 days of use.. I am definatly going to continue to buy this product.. I have bought several products that say you will look younger, and that never happens, But this product after 3 days of use has impressed me.. thank you for this product.</li>
            <li> This cream has a nice, mild fresh fragrance. A little of it goes a long way. It makes my skin feel soft and dewy. I&#x27;ve just started using it, so I can&#x27;t speak to the long-term effects, but my skin just drinks it in. So far I like it very much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picky about my skin care and this feels so nice.</li>
            <li> I have always been a picky person as choosing any products for my skin .....I don&#x27;t like real oily products of real thick products ...This product is wonderful ....it is not to thick or oily ....I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days and I am very pleased this far</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.  It is so light and refreshing and I feel like my face is getting a great deep moisturizing every time I use it.</li>
            <li> Slight tingle to skin when applied but gets absorbed into skin quickly. Doesn&#x27;t feel sticky. No fragrance.</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older, I have noticed that my skin as started to show signs of aging.  I have never really been faithful to put moisturizer on, yet have decided recently that I have to start taking better care of my skin.  I have always had an oily complexion, so most things that I have used in the past, have made it worse.  I have to say that this Moisturizer doesn&#x27;t do that.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle itself looks as though you bought it at a high end department store, so that is a big plus when you are thinking about gift giving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I simply wash my face, and let it air dry.  Then I put a very, very small amount in the palm of my hand and start working it into my face with my fingertips. You only need a tiny bit, as it really goes a long way.  It leaves my face nice and soft, without being greasy or oily.  It doesn&#x27;t really have any kind of smell to it, so no strong perfume smell to deal with just before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The biggest problem I have with wrinkles is on my forehead, and unfortunately most products work mainly for they eye area, but I like that this one says that it helps with your forehead wrinkles as well.  I have been using it for several nights now and I&#x27;m looking forward to the long term results of this!</li>
            <li> I give this Anti Aging Moisturizer 5 stars.  My skin feels smoother with less visible lines and I love that there is no fragrance or greasy feel that you can&#x27;t even tell you just put it on.  I simply apply a small amount on my face prior to applying my makeup.  That&#x27;s all there is to it.  If you are starting to see those fine lines appear, then this is the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount to buy this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Absolutely Love my Paloma Moisturizer! My skin drinks in the moisturizer . Face is glowing!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend to try out and she loves it. She&#x27;s noticed that her face is definitely smoother and also has a softer look. She also loves how just putting it on makes her skin so baby soft. The only negative for her is after she washes her face the areas around her mouth and nose are a bit dry.</li>
            <li> almost finished my first bottle, and so far I love this product!</li>
            <li> This product absorbed quickly and didn&#x27;t leave my face greasy. It also has no fragrance to compete with my perfume. This product would be great on skin types that need a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing!  It really works good.. very pleased.. will be buying more when I run out..</li>
            <li> There is nothing better than an excellent moisturizer to help in the fight of aging.  Love that this is fragrance free and cruelty free testing which is something that I look for.  I love the feel of it on my skin, it&#x27;s not oily and absorbs into the skin immediately without any residue.  I think the fight against aging is mostly strict use of a good moisturizer and this one fits the bill.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this moisturizer. First off, I have to talk about the quality of the bottle. Not only is it gorgeous but it&#x27;s soft like a baby&#x27;s butt. Before you even open the bottle, you know their claim of Luxury is true. The pump is quality as well. I&#x27;ve had some that are all over the place. I use one pump for my neck and one for my face. I tend to have oily areas on my face but this seems to be reducing that problem. The scent is faint which I like but I love that it&#x27;s made in America and not tested on animals. Great product!</li>
            <li> I love how softening the cream is. I recommend it to anyone looking for a beautiful refreshed look. It makes you look well rested and radiant.</li>
            <li> This product is the real deal, it has left my skin softer and feeling rejuvenated. It does not have a bad odor and a big plus for me is it is not oily like a lot of moisturizers I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Very nice, makes my skin feel smooth and soft. Nice light smell to it.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer. I love the fact that it covers all the bases the face, neck. and eyes all in one. With the special Peptides-Advanced  Luxury  Formula the moisture is pleasant smelling and creamy. The cream seems to be very gentle and  non greasy. I find that it rubs it ins nicely and quickly. With this cream you don&#x27;t need a multiple of creams for different areas of the face, eyes, or neck  you can use just this one which is so nice. With this moisturizer you notice a difference within a few weeks. You can feel your face tightening and lines disappearing. The lines around my eyes and even the bags seem to be calming down. This is smooth cream moisturizer that has a pleasant smell and I would recommend to all that are looking for a great moisturizer that does what it claims. Thank you...</li>
            <li> I am impressed with this moisturizer. My face feels sliky smooth. The best part is I can tell a difference in my fine lines on my face. I catch myself rubbing my face because it feels so smooth. I love that it is made in the USA and is cruelty free. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
