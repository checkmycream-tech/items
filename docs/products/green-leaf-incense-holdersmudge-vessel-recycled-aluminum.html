            <li>it&#x27;s very beautiful.</li>
            <li>This leaf is the perfect incense holder.</li>
            <li>This is the best stick incense burner I have found.</li>
            <li>It is just Perfect!!!</li>
            <li>This is a great incense burner.</li>
            <li>Nice piece and very attractive decor.</li>
            <li>Great burner.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Ashes fly everywhere.</li>
            <li>Great buy for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very nice looking.  </li>
            <li>It is also really attractive and would look good in a lot of decors.  </li>
            <li>The size (length and width) is perfect for catching all the ash that falls off most length sticks.</li>
            <li>A good purchase.</li>
            <li>But it works well and looks good for summer…</li>
            <li>This is also good for cone incense.</li>
            <li>The size is great for catching all the ashes.  </li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a Incense burner that is a good size to have so as the incense is burning you don&#x27;t have the ashes all over the furniture.  </li>
            <li>so I am not worried about it catching fire either.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Besides being very functional, this incense burner is beautiful.</li>
            <li>I love this incense holder.</li>
            <li>so that is interesting.</li>
            <li>ok maybe the brown would have been better but it serves its purpose</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this vessel.</li>
            <li>Used it immediately and looked lovely on the table.</li>
            <li>Plan to order more as gifts and another in the brown color for me.  </li>
            <li>Love the color.  </li>
            <li>recommend:)</li>
            <li>I prefer it over the more ancient brass and temple type designs.  </li>
            <li>The hole will fit most incenses.</li>
            <li>Other than that, its great!</li>
            <li>We use it in our bathroom, and it&#x27;s perfect at holding incense sticks without leaving a mess.</li>
            <li>Catches virtually all ashes for easy clean up.</li>
            <li>and they aren&#x27;t held securely.  </li>
            <li>You can light sage in this, or use a stick.  </li>
            <li>This one is the brown version which is a mixture of medium mocha browns with maybe some swirls of light beige over it</li>
            <li>Catches all ashe and is easy clean up.</li>
            <li>This is well made and true to the color as you see it on the webpage.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>A very nice green leaf holder.  </li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>Super bright green</li>
            <li>I was a little suspicious of this when I bought it, as it states it is made from recycled aluminum, but found that it was still very sturdy and very nice looking.</li>
            <li>The thing I love about this incense holder is that no ash will be outside of the holder as the incense burns.</li>
            <li>Oh and the hole where you slide the incense sticks through is the perfect size as well, not too small and not too big....</li>
            <li>It holds incense sticks exactly as you&#x27;d expect.  </li>
            <li>The ashes all fall into the holder and very easy to empty.</li>
            <li>Or the hole is too large for slender sticks</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe they don&#x27;t make incense burners this width normally!</li>
            <li>Even when I used the wooden, closed, so-called coffin boxes to burning incense, ashes would still fly everywhere, especially when emptying it.</li>
            <li>The design is classic.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The incense holder was a little bright in color than what I had expected.</li>
            <li>It is a good hefty weight but not so heavy that you don&#x27;t want to pick it up and empty it.</li>
            <li>no little wood plank to pick up and have to steady all the way to the trash can.</li>
            <li>The hole is large enough for every stick, but because it&#x27;s inserted at an angle the smaller sticks are held as securely as the larger.</li>
            <li>Overall, even though it might seem a little pricey for an incense holder, it&#x27;s an nice piece of room decor, and will last forever.</li>
            <li>I love the color and texture of this incense holder, and indeed it stood out from others in beauty, at least to me.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too wide though, it is just right.</li>
            <li>This is wide enough to catch all the ashes and keeps the table clean.  </li>
            <li>No mess, no ash falling out.  </li>
            <li>This incense holder is the size of a huge leaf, long and wide.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a lot of stick incense burners, and most have serious issues.  </li>
            <li>The holes are too small for larger-than-average sticks and you have to jam the stick into the hole to make it secure, which means sometimes the sticks break off in the hole.  </li>
            <li>It catches ashes well, a simple rinse with water cleans it, and it&#x27;s easy to dump cold incense ashes into the trash because it won&#x27;t spill them easily as you walk over.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The color&#x27;s a little brighter than the picture, but over time we&#x27;re expecting it to fade a bit.</li>
            <li> I have had a problem with this in the past with other incense burners, but not with this one.</li>
            <li> It looks like a creamy green.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your time or money with anything else.</li>

            <li> The base is cupped, so the ash stays inside until you dump it.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great incense burner. We use it to lay the sage on and to burn it. Nice piece and very attractive decor.</li>
            <li> Works so well! Catches virtually all ashes for easy clean up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of stick incense burners, and most have serious issues.  The holes are too small for larger-than-average sticks and you have to jam the stick into the hole to make it secure, which means sometimes the sticks break off in the hole.  Or the hole is too large for slender sticks and they aren&#x27;t held securely.  The ones that hold the stick upright always leave a mess as the stick burns and drops all around the burner.  The ones that hold the stick sideways let the ash drop onto a long flat piece, and when you carry it to the sink to rinse, some ash always waft off.  This one solves every problem.  The hole is large enough for every stick, but because it&#x27;s inserted at an angle the smaller sticks are held as securely as the larger. The base is cupped, so the ash stays inside until you dump it.  And it&#x27;s made of metal, so no worries about starting a fire.  Great burner.</li>
            <li> This item is, to be succinct, boss like a hoss. It catches ashes well, a simple rinse with water cleans it, and it&#x27;s easy to dump cold incense ashes into the trash because it won&#x27;t spill them easily as you walk over. A++++ would buy again, although it seems indestructible, so I doubt I will ever have to.</li>
            <li> I love this incense holder. We use it in our bathroom, and it&#x27;s perfect at holding incense sticks without leaving a mess. All of the ash drops into the holder. The color&#x27;s a little brighter than the picture, but over time we&#x27;re expecting it to fade a bit. Overall, even though it might seem a little pricey for an incense holder, it&#x27;s an nice piece of room decor, and will last forever. A good purchase.</li>
            <li> I was a little suspicious of this when I bought it, as it states it is made from recycled aluminum, but found that it was still very sturdy and very nice looking.</li>
            <li> You can light sage in this, or use a stick.  No mess, no ash falling out.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Catches all of the ash as others do not. Super bright green haha so that is interesting. I was sort of dumb and didn&#x27;t realize that my screen was not turned up all of the way. But it works well and looks good for summer…ok maybe the brown would have been better but it serves its purpose and I have no complaints!</li>
            <li> I had one of those long wooden incense holders and the ashes always seemed to fall off the edges or my hand shook when I tried to empty it. This incense holder is the size of a huge leaf, long and wide. The ashes all fall into the holder and very easy to empty. The hole that holds the sticks is very small so you can burn the entire stick. This is also good for cone incense. Love, love, love this vessel.</li>
            <li> The size is great for catching all the ashes.  Good quality.</li>
            <li> Great product. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to. Strange color though. It looks like a creamy green. Not much of a fan but hey that&#x27;s not why I bought it.</li>
            <li> Used it immediately and looked lovely on the table. Plan to order more as gifts and another in the brown color for me.  Love the color.  Looks like a leaf in springtime.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a Incense burner that is a good size to have so as the incense is burning you don&#x27;t have the ashes all over the furniture.  This is well made and true to the color as you see it on the webpage.  It&#x27;s very nice looking.  The length is  9 3/4 long from end to end, the inside is 8&amp;#34; long, the width from the middle is 3 1/2&amp;#34; wide and it is lightweight not heavy.  A very nice green leaf holder.  I am very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> This incense burner tackles the biggest problem I&#x27;ve always had when I burn incense. Ashes fly everywhere. Even when I used the wooden, closed, so-called coffin boxes to burning incense, ashes would still fly everywhere, especially when emptying it. But not with this model. The size (length and width) is perfect for catching all the ash that falls off most length sticks. It will hold a lot of ash before needing to be emptied. It is metal so I am not worried about it catching fire either. I actually had one of the wooden, coffin style incense burners catch fire before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides being very functional, this incense burner is beautiful. It is a good hefty weight but not so heavy that you don&#x27;t want to pick it up and empty it. This one is the brown version which is a mixture of medium mocha browns with maybe some swirls of light beige over it it&#x27;s very beautiful. I also bought the green one, which is a vibrant green with some darker green swirled in.</li>
            <li> This leaf is the perfect incense holder. Catches all ashe and is easy clean up. no little wood plank to pick up and have to steady all the way to the trash can. I bet you wouldn&#x27;t have to empty this leaf until about your 100th incense burn. Dont waste your time or money with anything else.</li>
            <li> This is the best stick incense burner I have found. All the others are narrower and the ashes get all over. This is wide enough to catch all the ashes and keeps the table clean.  It is also really attractive and would look good in a lot of decors.  I can&#x27;t believe they don&#x27;t make incense burners this width normally! I looked and couldn&#x27;t find any others this wide. It isn&#x27;t too wide though, it is just right.</li>
            <li> The incense holder was a little bright in color than what I had expected. Other than that, its great! Does what its suppposed to do!</li>
            <li> The thing I love about this incense holder is that no ash will be outside of the holder as the incense burns. The hole will fit most incenses. The design is classic. It&#x27;s made of metal so you don&#x27;t have to worry about cleaning or breaking it. Great buy for the price. It will go with everything in your house.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several different incense burners and I have not owned any like this. It is just Perfect!!! There is no fall out, the leaf incense has enough depth, length and width to catch all the ashes so that it does not get all over the place. Oh and the hole where you slide the incense sticks through is the perfect size as well, not too small and not too big....just right. I have had a problem with this in the past with other incense burners, but not with this one. I would def. recommend:)</li>
            <li> I love the color and texture of this incense holder, and indeed it stood out from others in beauty, at least to me.  I prefer it over the more ancient brass and temple type designs.  It holds incense sticks exactly as you&#x27;d expect.  I really like it.  It reminds me of spring.</li>
