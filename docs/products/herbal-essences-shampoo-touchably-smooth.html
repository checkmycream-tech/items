            <li>Like all HE products, the fragrance is so nice.</li>
            <li>This has a really nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>This shampoo and the accompanying creme have done a nice job of taking care of flyaways.</li>

            <li>great product - fast shipping - thank you!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the only brand that has worked perfectly for me</li>
            <li>but some are better than others and this one did not meet my expectations.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It does smell lovely, though.</li>
            <li>and i love it too..</li>
            <li>am able to go two days without having to use this again.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this Herbal Essences Shampoo.</li>
            <li>herbal essences has always been my favorite hair go to.  </li>
            <li>Very good shampoo for a low price</li>
            <li>It has a distinct smell and it gives off a nice scent when you apply it on your hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling fresh and clean as well as leaves it smelling fresh and pleasant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried almost every Herbal Essence conditioner in existence since I&#x27;m a huge fan</li>
            <li>This stuff is absolutely amazing for keeping my hair straight throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Combine with the Touchably Smooth Anti-Frizz Crème for maximum effect.</li>
            <li>Not as smooth as it mentions.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I got this because I like having smooth and shiny hair</li>
            <li>This controls the flip and keeps my hair smooth at the ends.</li>
            <li>, overall a good shampoo/conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I love it because it is gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and my hair is so soft after wash!</li>
            <li>I also enjoy the scent, very soothing.</li>
            <li>I love how soft and shiny this makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>It provides a nice light fluffy feel.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is the first shampoo I could see a difference in the way my hair behaved after using.</li>
            <li>Love this...just wish there were bigger size for both shampoo and the conditioner</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve always liked there other products.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair smelling fabulous, but feeling dull and dried out in a way my best conditioner can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li>We have loved using Herbal Essences in the past and will continue to use their products.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and looks straight but has an unruly flip at the ends when my hair is short.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend getting this!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used both liberally and can tell you without hesitation that is is where your hard-earned dollars are better spent.</li>
            <li>I have naturally straight hair</li>
            <li>I was a bit concerned because my hair didn&#x27;t feel very clean while it was wet, it felt sticky and</li>
            <li>other formulas do better for her hair.</li>
            <li>only need to use a small amount of this to get a nice even clean threw out your hair and I have shoulder length</li>
            <li>My hair is not super curly, more wavy.  </li>
            <li>but leaves my daughter&#x27;s hair flat and looking greasy quickly.  </li>
            <li>Target didn&#x27;t have the normal size) and just tried it this morning.</li>
            <li>Fragrance is outstanding without being overpowering and it absolutely performs as well as, if not better than, its salon counterpart.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very soft.</li>
            <li>Fine hair deserves better then all the build-up left behind.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li>However, my hair doesn&#x27;t have as much body as it did with Hydralicious, it seems kinda flat, but it&#x27;s definitely soft and shiny, so I will continue to use it, but I think I will end up falling back on Hydralicious after a while.</li>
            <li>We have some professional (and much more expensive) shampoos and conditioners in the master bedroom, but, if you ask me, this stuff works just as well.  </li>

            <li> she has long hair of average thickness.  </li>

            <li> This cuts down a lot leaving my hair with less body.</li>
            <li> I just got off my Herbal Essences Hydralicious (orange/yellow swirls) and unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t find the same shampoo anywhere, I guess the replacements are purple on purple swirls and pink on pink swirls, which both smell like berries..</li>
            <li> The shower gel is pink in colour and not as thick as some other brands.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling greasy or stiff.</li>
            <li> However, the conditioner that goes with it is not very good.</li>
            <li> I have thick and lots of body in my hair and use a straightener on my hair.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when my grocery store stopped carrying this flavor of shampoo and immediately went to my backup store, Amazon.</li>

            <li> Had to give this 2 stars as it doesn&#x27;t do anything for straightening, or anything of the sort.  No idea how they can get away with calling his straightening, but that&#x27;s marketing for you. My hair is not super curly, more wavy.  Did nothing to straighten it.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is great, overall a good shampoo/conditioner.  Cleans the hair, that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and my hair is so soft after wash!</li>

I was a bit concerned because my hair didn&#x27;t feel very clean while it was wet, it felt sticky and almost like I just finished swimming (chlorine city), but after I finished blow-drying my hair, it got amazingly shiny and it&#x27;s very soft. However, my hair doesn&#x27;t have as much body as it did with Hydralicious, it seems kinda flat, but it&#x27;s definitely soft and shiny, so I will continue to use it, but I think I will end up falling back on Hydralicious after a while.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to straighten at all, and actually feels like it might be drying my hair out. It does smell lovely, though.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed that it makes my hair any easier to straighten, but it does provide good moisture. Like all HE products, the fragrance is so nice.</li>

            <li> Herbal Essences quality! Love the smell!</li>
            <li> It Works!!&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it just doesn&#x27;t have enough of the Herbal Essence Scent to it.</li>
            <li> great product - fast shipping - thank you!</li>

            <li> I have thick and lots of body in my hair and use a straightener on my hair. This cuts down a lot leaving my hair with less body. I recently had my hair highlighted using their salon shampoo and cond. went back to this. OH WHAT A DIFFERENCE! I will be returning the salon stuff. Herbal Essences smells so much better!</li>
            <li> Love this...just wish there were bigger size for both shampoo and the conditioner</li>
            <li> Interesting smell, a mix of rose and citrus. The shower gel is pink in colour and not as thick as some other brands.  I love it because it is gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have naturally straight hair but it sometimes gets frizzy. This shampoo and the accompanying creme have done a nice job of taking care of flyaways. I also enjoy the scent, very soothing.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling sticky. I am surprized as this is Herbal Essence and I&#x27;ve always liked there other products.</li>
