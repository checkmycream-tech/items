            <li>To give a frame of reference on colognes I like, I also like John Varvatos, Issey Miyake, Happy, Yves St Lauren, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, etc.</li>

            <li>Ladies love the smell!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Ok so it&#x27;s a good kind of fruity smell in a way the smell doesn&#x27;t project as strong unless ur hugging me and get close and sniff my shirt.</li>
            <li>Want your smell is pleasant to man but fades quickly.</li>
            <li>love the smell would buy it again</li>
            <li>Many have said it smells like bubble gum.</li>
            <li>In all fairness, it&#x27;s not a TERRIBLE scent, but this is NOT a fragrance you can wear more than once or twice a month.</li>
            <li>I love this cologne.</li>
            <li>This one is one of my favorites though, if not my favorite.</li>
            <li>but after he tried many scents he found this one</li>
            <li>THE LADIES WILL LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>Now let&#x27;s see if it works magic on the ladies :-)</li>
            <li>Great scent...would recommend highly.</li>
            <li>Good aroma, very intense and stays skin</li>
            <li>at first i didnt think that it was that good...</li>
            <li>One Million becomes nauseating very quickly.</li>
            <li>It starts off a bit sweet, but as the hours go by it really develops into an amazing comprehensive delight of scents.</li>
            <li>By the end of the night, 9 or 10 hours later, it still smells amazing!  </li>
            <li>The first time I smelled this, I thought it was OK..</li>
            <li>(its kinda sweet</li>
            <li>It has a fresh, unique smell.</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it!!</li>
            <li>its worth the money.....</li>
            <li>Its fresh like grapefruit with mint and mandarin.</li>
            <li>It all comes together to smell manly, seductive and powerful.</li>
            <li>WORTH GETTING IT</li>
            <li>It has quickly become one of my new favorites and it has great lasting time,  last all day for me.</li>
            <li>Arrived timely and was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Very manly smell!</li>
            <li>I bought this just to give  the scent a try and instantly fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I recommend others of the same brand and its fragrance is better.</li>
            <li>I decided to ask a few ladies what they thought and all of them loved it.  </li>
            <li>It follows with a combination of rose, cinnamon, leather and other spicy notes.</li>
            <li>He&#x60;s very picky</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overpowering by any means and it really lasts.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this seller and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I read the hundreds of reviews and while I was still skeptical (because I&#x27;ve tried many sweeter smelling colognes and hadn&#x27;t found one I liked)</li>
            <li>I like this cologne on my man more than any other he has ever used!</li>
            <li>A NEW FAV OF MINE!</li>
            <li>wow my girlfriend loves it</li>
            <li>Wow what a fragrance.........</li>
            <li>I personally prefer earthy/spicy/mossy/aquatic scents.. and this is VERY floral.</li>
            <li>The more expensive and luxurious \\&quot;niche\\&quot; fragrances in Eau de Parfums tend to be more complex, and tailored to each unique wearer (and obviously longer lasting).</li>
            <li>One Million to me is just kind of cheesy.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Ladies will DREAD your arrival if you overdo this extremely floral/sweet, party/club type scent.</li>
            <li> One million lacks dynamic, and it has very weak longevity.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very common place, and if you go to the club wearing this.. just know that you and 1,000 other men will also be wearing \\&quot;One</li>
            <li> This cologne is so complex!  </li>
            <li> I cant imagine this smelling bad on any dude.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Again I was waiting to smell the fragrance that every man swore by!  I had no idea what it smell like. Ok so it&#x27;s a good kind of fruity smell in a way the smell doesn&#x27;t project as strong unless ur hugging me and get close and sniff my shirt. It&#x27;s an ok cologne but not the greatest according to the best smelling colognes out there it&#x27;s fair.</li>
            <li> smells amazing! the scent stays with you all day long! at first i didnt think that it was that good...but OMG and dont let me get started with the compliments on the ladies! wow my girlfriend loves it and so do i...shipped on time! guys buy the BIG one! this one is gonna be one of your top 10!</li>
            <li> Wow what a fragrance.........the opening of the fragrance is like a gem wonderfully made which lasts for about 30 min followed by sweet vanilla kinda smell which lasts forever..............its worth the money.....(its kinda sweet so everyone may not like it)</li>
            <li> love the smell would buy it again</li>
            <li> The first time I smelled this, I thought it was OK.. but after that, eh. One Million becomes nauseating very quickly. The fragrance is very common place, and if you go to the club wearing this.. just know that you and 1,000 other men will also be wearing \\&quot;One Million\\&quot;, lol. I personally prefer earthy/spicy/mossy/aquatic scents.. and this is VERY floral. Too floral. Many have said it smells like bubble gum. One million lacks dynamic, and it has very weak longevity. It smells the same through every note. I guess some of the cheaper fragrances are made so that they smell similar on everyone that wears it... like the Mcdonalds effect. The more expensive and luxurious \\&quot;niche\\&quot; fragrances in Eau de Parfums tend to be more complex, and tailored to each unique wearer (and obviously longer lasting). One Million to me is just kind of cheesy. It smells almost like Paco tried to replicate Clive Christians No. 1 (which is $865 for a 1.6 bottle). In all fairness, it&#x27;s not a TERRIBLE scent, but this is NOT a fragrance you can wear more than once or twice a month. Ladies will DREAD your arrival if you overdo this extremely floral/sweet, party/club type scent.</li>
            <li> Arrived timely and was exactly as described.  Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I like this cologne on my man more than any other he has ever used!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my step father. He absolutely loves it!!</li>
            <li> I love this cologne. It&#x27;s one of my favorites. To give a frame of reference on colognes I like, I also like John Varvatos, Issey Miyake, Happy, Yves St Lauren, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, etc. This one is one of my favorites though, if not my favorite. It has a fresh, unique smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this aftershave for my Husband for Christmas. He has worn the same scent for years and i wanted him to try something different. He&#x60;s very picky but after he tried many scents he found this one and he loves it! It&#x60;s not too overpowering and he has had compliments on it. I also think it smells GREAT!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  I read the hundreds of reviews and while I was still skeptical (because I&#x27;ve tried many sweeter smelling colognes and hadn&#x27;t found one I liked) I decided to buy this one.  This cologne is so complex!  It starts off a bit sweet, but as the hours go by it really develops into an amazing comprehensive delight of scents. It&#x27;s not overpowering by any means and it really lasts.  By the end of the night, 9 or 10 hours later, it still smells amazing!  I decided to ask a few ladies what they thought and all of them loved it.  It&#x27;s definitely my go to now!</li>
            <li> Very good product, I recommend it. Excellent quality, as it says the publication. presentation is very good, the price adjusted.</li>
            <li> Very manly smell! A NEW FAV OF MINE! I couldnt wait to add this to my collection of colonges. I cant imagine this smelling bad on any dude. Wasn&#x27;t expecting to like this as much as i do, totally took me by surprise. This fragrance creates a signature smell of masculinity.  Its fresh like grapefruit with mint and mandarin. It follows with a combination of rose, cinnamon, leather and other spicy notes. It all comes together to smell manly, seductive and powerful. It has quickly become one of my new favorites and it has great lasting time,  last all day for me. Love this!</li>
            <li> I never intended to buy this scent at any point in time until a perfume seller sent a sample to me. The moment i perceived it i knew i had to get it immediately. Great scent...would recommend highly.</li>
            <li> THIS COLOGNE IS ONE OF THE BEST OUT THERE,  YOUR MAN WILL LOVE IT OR FOR YOU MEN THE LADIES WILL LOVE IT.  IT STAYS ON FOREVER  WORTH GETTING IT</li>
            <li> Perfume com &amp;oacute;tima fixação, deixa o ambiente at&amp;eacute; mais agrad&amp;aacute;vel. Comprei este e o 212 MEN. Não me arrependo de nenhum dos dois. Os perfumes Paco Rabanne são excelentes. Assim que esse terminar comprarei outro. Podem comprar sem erro!</li>
            <li> Good aroma, very intense and stays skin</li>
            <li> I bought this just to give  the scent a try and instantly fell in love with it.Now I am going to go ahead and buy the bigger bottle!!!</li>
            <li> Perfume simple and you can give. I recommend others of the same brand and its fragrance is better. I recommend this seller and shipping was fast. Want your smell is pleasant to man but fades quickly. Received the photos as shown.</li>
            <li> All men should wear One Million, is perfect.</li>
            <li> Ladies love the smell!</li>
            <li> Damn! This s*** smells good!  Now let&#x27;s see if it works magic on the ladies :-)</li>
            <li> I can see myself use this one those nights I am looking to set an impression. I don&#x27;t think I can use this at work. But I will try it out though.</li>
