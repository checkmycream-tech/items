            <li>and I was so impressed the minute I opened the package.</li>
            <li>This is a great set for the price.</li>
            <li>Packaging was good, came as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>Not so good quality, comes out.</li>
            <li>I love these extensions!</li>
            <li>and I think I could have gotten away with claiming them as my own.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this set and would recommend this set over most sets I have seen.</li>
            <li>I still gave 5 stars because these are by far the best extensions you can get for the price.</li>
            <li>and im satisfied with them</li>
            <li>clips are very nice material and attached very well.</li>
            <li>Easy to put on and take off.</li>
            <li>I received a cheap $1 book instead.</li>
            <li>I was trying to get off cheap and bought a set of &amp;#34;synthetic&amp;#34; extensions and</li>
            <li>They are on the &#x27;light&#x27; side though</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are thick and perfect.</li>
            <li>I found them easiest to blend in after straightening my hair, and then quickly running my flatiron through the extensions before putting them in.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still soft and strong!</li>
            <li>Once you color it to match your hair it fits right in with your look.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t quite choose the right color</li>
            <li>It seems really durable and the clips don&#x27;t tug on your hair!</li>
            <li>I literally shoved them in the drawer the first day and never used them again.  </li>
            <li>I am considering buying a darker set to see if I can pass off another foot of hair as mine ;)</li>
            <li>this is my first time buying extensions</li>
            <li>they are true to color and very soft.</li>
            <li>If they were the right color it would have looked very natural</li>
            <li>The extensions clip in differently than other extensions so the hair really looks like your own!</li>
            <li>This hair looks and feels real.</li>
            <li>They blend in very well with my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The clips on the pieces are VERY sturdy.</li>
            <li>and this feels just like horse tail, dose not curl and is coarse and very multicolor, feels exactly like horse</li>
            <li>If you are looking for non-stringy extensions at a low price these are the right ones to buy.</li>
            <li>These extensions are soft like my hair!</li>
            <li>It doest really feel like human hair</li>
            <li>hair is long, and nowhere near as heavy/thick at the ends as it is on the upper part, so the weight of these extensions was just right.</li>
            <li>These extension shed soooo much &amp; are not soft.</li>
            <li>The only issue I&#x27;ve encountered so far is that they do shed a bit.</li>

            <li> I was nervous to purchase after seeing reviews on other sellers that said the extensions were thin and stringy.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Terrible quality and not delivered on time</li>
            <li> Awful product.  Hair looked like a dried out horse tail. Tried washing and conditioning but it&#x27;s still awful.  Won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> i grew up around horses... and this feels just like horse tail, dose not curl and is coarse and very multicolor, feels exactly like horse</li>
            <li> Packaging was good, came as advertised.  Good product</li>
            <li> This hair looks and feels real. It seems really durable and the clips don&#x27;t tug on your hair! The extensions clip in differently than other extensions so the hair really looks like your own! I&#x27;ve been practicing braiding with it, I curled it and then straightened it. It&#x27;s taken a lot of abuse but it&#x27;s still soft and strong! Once you color it to match your hair it fits right in with your look. I love these extensions!</li>
            <li> Poor quality product! Feels like horse hair.</li>
            <li> These extension shed soooo much &amp; are not soft. Not all of it seems like human hair either.</li>
            <li> I was nervous to purchase after seeing reviews on other sellers that said the extensions were thin and stringy. These extensions a not stringy!!!&lt;br /&gt;They are thick and perfect. If you are looking for non-stringy extensions at a low price these are the right ones to buy. The only issue I&#x27;ve encountered so far is that they do shed a bit. I still gave 5 stars because these are by far the best extensions you can get for the price.</li>
            <li> Not so good quality, comes out.</li>
            <li> I received a cheap $1 book instead. Never received my extensions.</li>
            <li> I was trying to get off cheap and bought a set of &amp;#34;synthetic&amp;#34; extensions and when I got them in they were unusable. I literally shoved them in the drawer the first day and never used them again.  The extensions felt NOTHING Like hair they felt like baby doll hair. We all know how hard baby doll hair is to manage right?!&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to try these and I was so impressed the minute I opened the package. These extensions are soft like my hair! They can be brushed like my hair! They blend in very well with my hair. Easy to put on and take off. There are lots of pieces included and just from playing with them I don&#x27;t know if I will need them all. But I would rather have a few spare pieces than have to buy another set to have enough.&lt;br /&gt;The clips are very nice material and attached very well. I won&#x27;t have to worry about them falling off. I am very pleased with this set and would recommend this set over most sets I have seen. This is a great set for the price.</li>
            <li> This hair is synthetic and feels like wire . And returning this sh** is a pain . Don&#x27;t waste your time or money .</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect a lot for this item because it wasn&#x27;t expensive but I at least expected the hair to be real hair. Biggest waste of money. Synthetic hair or a blend of human and synthetic. False advertisement!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried extensions before----so I didn&#x27;t know anything about the weight of the hair, the number of pieces, etc.  If you go to Abhair&#x27;s web site, you can find a lot of videos from other users who show you how to make them blend in, how to clip them in, etc.  I had to watch a few to figure it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clips on the pieces are VERY sturdy. I took the advice of one of the Abhair users and slightly twisted my hair before clipping on the extensions and I think I could have gone through a tornado without losing the extensions! They are also horizontal so they lay flat against your scalp and they don&#x27;t push the extensions out. A lot of thought seems to have gone into the construction of these extensions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is long, and nowhere near as heavy/thick at the ends as it is on the upper part, so the weight of these extensions was just right. They are on the &#x27;light&#x27; side though so if you have thicker hair than I do, you will want heavier/thicker extensions.  I found them easiest to blend in after straightening my hair, and then quickly running my flatiron through the extensions before putting them in. They have some body and wave to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t quite choose the right color (they are lighter and redder than they look on amazon) so I haven&#x27;t posted a picture of them in my hair. If they were the right color it would have looked very natural and I think I could have gotten away with claiming them as my own. I am considering buying a darker set to see if I can pass off another foot of hair as mine ;)</li>
            <li> It doest really feel like human hair</li>
            <li> this is my first time buying extensions and im satisfied with them they are true to color and very soft. they are human hair. when i opened the package i straightened them to see if the would burn and nope not one bit. but one complaint is they do shed but i still give 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I just received the hair in the mail today. I opened it and the first thing I noticed was this awful chemical smell, the second thing I noticed is the texture the hair is very dry and rough. It&#x27;s not silky at all and that&#x27;s a hide disappointment. It feels like horse hair. I tried deep conditioning and soaking it in morracan oil for hours and I&#x27;m still not happy at all, this hair does not feel like human hair and I feel like I was robbed and lied to.  Save your money.</li>
