            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice citrus smell.</li>

            <li>I used to by this in drug stores but haven&#x27;t been able to find it any longer, so I am happy to be able to order from amazon, one for me and one for my sis (who lives in Hawaii and also likes this lotion a lot).</li>
            <li>I have really fair skin and tend to burn easily.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is very nice in that it absorbs quickly and is non-greasy.</li>

            <li>It goes on very smooth.  </li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees cream does not leave the sticky film that aloe does and it lets your skin breathe much better as well.</li>
            <li>But after a really sunny day this stuff feels great on my skin, and it absorbs quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This works wonders when you get a sunburn, even better than aloe.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I use as a face moisturizer as it iight and non-greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t find it in the stores, so grateful that it is still available at Amazon!</li>
            <li>I have shared this product with several friends and relatives and all have been very impressed!  </li>
            <li>should do a survey to see if there are more people that used these 2 products.</li>
            <li>Saved me from so many sun burns.</li>
            <li>Nice and light.</li>
            <li>this stuff will always keep this in stock around my house :)</li>
            <li>The Burt&#x27;s Bees after sun soother is my favorite &amp;#34;after sun&amp;#34; product.  </li>
            <li>Quickly alleviated the peeling and the soreness..</li>
            <li>i love this product.</li>
            <li>BEST THING IS I DO NOT BREAK OUT THE NEXT DAY</li>
            <li>I am sold on this product and make sure I always have it on hand.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Usually love Burt&#x27;s Bees products</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unlike many lotions this does not have a strong smell.</li>
            <li>Great for people with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>This is great for those of you responsible enough not to burn that just want a great, soothing moisturizer after a day in the sun.</li>
            <li>Loved it so much I brought two bottles.</li>
            <li>Absolutely recommend it for anyone with fair skin.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about this product!  </li>
            <li>I am the type of person who will buy 1 of every product to see what works best and this one always wins at the local pharmacy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>easily sunburn people out there like me.</li>
            <li>Nothing feels better than this amazing formula after getting too much sun.  </li>
            <li>The smell is way too strong.</li>
            <li>It is fine on the face and doesn&#x27;t seem to cause any breakouts.</li>
            <li>It is light and smooth and not oily.</li>
            <li>Does it smell fantastic?</li>
            <li>Although it is primarily meant for after sun (or sunburn) care.</li>
            <li>I have red hair and fair skin, I have tried many products.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong, but kinda herbal floral, not perfumey or overly sweet.</li>
            <li>The scent is flowery and not bad, but it is strong.</li>
            <li>It works but the smell is VERY strong and VERY flowery.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned, red haired and burn easily.</li>
            <li>While I still wear sunscreen (most of the time) and do not unreasonably exopose my skin to sun damage, Burt&#x27;s Bees After Sun Soother has never failed to nourish and sooth my skin and allow me to have</li>
            <li>Not only did it smell great, leave my skin feeling very soft and smooth, it also took away all the sting of my sunburn for about 4 hours!</li>
            <li>The smell is sweet and earthy smelling, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>As someone who burns pretty easily, even with sunscreen on, I have to say that this product is a Godsend.</li>
            <li>It is a light, non-greasy after sun lotion without a strong scent (important if you are sensitive to scents in cosmetics and hair products like I am).  </li>
            <li>This stuff is all i use now and recommend it to anyone out there that gets burnt quickly.</li>
            <li>This lotion absorbs quickly and immediately refreshes you while providing a bit of flexability to the skin and pain</li>
            <li>This helps relive pain and redness from sunburn really quickly.</li>
            <li>The pain relief is really quick, and the sunburn starts to brown within hours of using this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cooling, refreshing, not thick at all but not too runny either.</li>
            <li>It literally relieves instantly, has a pleasant, cool and fresh scent and works super fast to return your sunburned skin back to a more comfortable state!</li>
            <li>However, if they can tone down the smell by 30%, I would be happy.</li>
            <li>Works great for diaper rash and any other place you need to heal damaged skin!</li>
            <li>you can get the clear aloe gel thats pure w/o alcohol at Harris Teeter) and in my experience, this is even better!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>Most other after sun lotions have a lot of additives like parabens which are controversial.</li>
            <li>Its worth the premium price.</li>
            <li>This lotion takes the sting out, keeps me from peeling, and actually helps turn the burn into some nice summer color</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this for anyone who is apt to burn.</li>
            <li>yes, it is true some of Burts Bees products do have some unusual scents!</li>
            <li>I also like that it&#x27;s 99.5% natural, so I feel better about using it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found Burt&#x27;s Bees products to be hits and misses these days, fortunately this particular product is a hit.  </li>
            <li>Does the job in cooling off sun burns without that sticky residue that aloe typically leaves, and smells really pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I got burned on my back and the backs of my legs and was sitting in the car for several hours but didn&#x27;t feel any discomfort because of this great stuff.</li>
            <li>It is super hydrating but not greasy at all, and I really feel that it makes a difference in whether or not I get a sunburn.  </li>
            <li>It seems to have helped (unexpectedly) fade some age spots and keep my skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li>If i get pink, from yard work or swiming, put this own right after shower.</li>
            <li>It stopped the skin from peeling and healed very fast.</li>
            <li>While it may be good for your skin, the scent if very unusual and a little offensive.</li>
            <li>My husband likes it so much, he hides it from me!</li>
            <li>By the next morning the burn was mostly gone and my skin didn&#x27;t even peel.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff - this is my second bottle.  </li>
            <li>Within a week, the sunburn was gone and I was left with fresh, smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely swear by this product and have recommended it to many of my friends who come away with the same reaction as I do.</li>
            <li>And as an added bonus, afterwards our skin feels super soft and hydrated!  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon, the price is right, shipping is fast and included.  </li>
            <li>but it pretty much got rid of all pain and discomfort.</li>
            <li>I burn easily, and I know all too well when I&#x27;ve been burned enough that it will blister.</li>
            <li>Usually, depending on the burn, it will turn from bright red to a nice brown by the next evening.</li>
            <li>We all loved it but find it hard to find on the store shelves.</li>
            <li>Either way it is very soothing.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This lotion really works well to sooth burned skin.</li>
            <li>However, I had no scaring or blotchiness afterwards, which my skin is very prone to.</li>
            <li>Really does help take the pain out of your sunburn.</li>
            <li>Long story short - expect this to be a nice moisturizer, but not a cure all.</li>
            <li>Being of Irish decent and living in NC I have tried a significant number of products to help sooth sun burn.</li>
            <li>It is a little watery, not too thick and smells wonderful!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This does not mean one should get sunburned just for the relief of this product.  </li>
            <li>I honestly thought that maybe it was a fluke the first couple times I used it, that maybe my burn just wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought, and that&#x27;s why it healed so quickly and didn&#x27;t peel, but after using it over and over and getting the same fantastic results, I can say that it is truly a miracle</li>
            <li>it soaks right in, and for me, gives instant relief.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it this year over the entire surface of my arms and legs after a long day in the sun at an amusement park and water park, and I couldn&#x27;t stop touching my arm, it was so soft.</li>
            <li>I also live in south Texas.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida and this stuff is a necessity.</li>
            <li>I live in the sunny southwest U.S., so</li>
            <li>Apply often and liberally within the first twelve hours and then as needed over the next twenty-four.</li>
            <li>I applied natural aloe vera juice (not the gel, which has carcinogenic ingredients!)</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s plenty of other products out there that accomplish the same thing while being more subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It \\&quot;absorbs\\&quot; pretty quickly and doesnt remain wet very long - much faster than aloe gel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of hard to find, even in places that usually carry Burt&#x27;s Bees products, so it&#x27;s easy to just get it here.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s made of natural ingrediants.</li>
            <li>added bonus of this product is how suuuper soft it makes your skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit old school.</li>
            <li>Made my sunburn hurt less and heal quickly.</li>
            <li>It is not for those of you, like me, who rely on a seven year old to apply sunscreen to your back only to live with regrets for a full week after.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It made me experience bearable and any time I ran out or switched to old school sticky Aloe I was back in major pain.</li>
            <li>So those of you who have actual sensitive skin, use this...</li>
            <li>This product offers instant relief from sun burns, and actually moisturizes the skin (instead of drying it out, like aloe vera gel).</li>
            <li>I have darker skin and rarely burn (once every few years when I&#x27;m extremely careless) but will make sure I never run out of this just in case.</li>
            <li>Obviously if you cook yourself, this product isn&#x27;t going to change that, but if you slightly overdo it, it can really save your skin.  </li>

            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike many lotions this does not have a strong smell.</li>
            <li> Great for people with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> This is great for those of you responsible enough not to burn that just want a great, soothing moisturizer after a day in the sun.</li>
            <li> Loved it so much I brought two bottles.</li>
            <li> Absolutely recommend it for anyone with fair skin.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product!  </li>
            <li> I am the type of person who will buy 1 of every product to see what works best and this one always wins at the local pharmacy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> easily sunburn people out there like me.</li>
            <li> Nothing feels better than this amazing formula after getting too much sun.  </li>
            <li> The smell is way too strong.</li>
            <li> It is fine on the face and doesn&#x27;t seem to cause any breakouts.</li>
            <li> It is light and smooth and not oily.</li>
            <li> Does it smell fantastic?</li>
            <li> Although it is primarily meant for after sun (or sunburn) care.</li>
            <li> I have red hair and fair skin, I have tried many products.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong, but kinda herbal floral, not perfumey or overly sweet.</li>
            <li> The scent is flowery and not bad, but it is strong.</li>
            <li> It works but the smell is VERY strong and VERY flowery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned, red haired and burn easily.</li>
            <li> While I still wear sunscreen (most of the time) and do not unreasonably exopose my skin to sun damage, Burt&#x27;s Bees After Sun Soother has never failed to nourish and sooth my skin and allow me to have</li>
            <li> Not only did it smell great, leave my skin feeling very soft and smooth, it also took away all the sting of my sunburn for about 4 hours!</li>
            <li> The smell is sweet and earthy smelling, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> As someone who burns pretty easily, even with sunscreen on, I have to say that this product is a Godsend.</li>
            <li> It is a light, non-greasy after sun lotion without a strong scent (important if you are sensitive to scents in cosmetics and hair products like I am).  </li>
            <li> This stuff is all i use now and recommend it to anyone out there that gets burnt quickly.</li>
            <li> This lotion absorbs quickly and immediately refreshes you while providing a bit of flexability to the skin and pain</li>
            <li> This helps relive pain and redness from sunburn really quickly.</li>
            <li> The pain relief is really quick, and the sunburn starts to brown within hours of using this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cooling, refreshing, not thick at all but not too runny either.</li>
            <li> It literally relieves instantly, has a pleasant, cool and fresh scent and works super fast to return your sunburned skin back to a more comfortable state!</li>
            <li> However, if they can tone down the smell by 30%, I would be happy.</li>
            <li> Works great for diaper rash and any other place you need to heal damaged skin!</li>
            <li> you can get the clear aloe gel thats pure w/o alcohol at Harris Teeter) and in my experience, this is even better!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Most other after sun lotions have a lot of additives like parabens which are controversial.</li>
            <li> Its worth the premium price.</li>
            <li> This lotion takes the sting out, keeps me from peeling, and actually helps turn the burn into some nice summer color</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this for anyone who is apt to burn.</li>
            <li> yes, it is true some of Burts Bees products do have some unusual scents!</li>
            <li> I also like that it&#x27;s 99.5% natural, so I feel better about using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found Burt&#x27;s Bees products to be hits and misses these days, fortunately this particular product is a hit.  </li>
            <li> Does the job in cooling off sun burns without that sticky residue that aloe typically leaves, and smells really pleasant.  </li>
            <li> I got burned on my back and the backs of my legs and was sitting in the car for several hours but didn&#x27;t feel any discomfort because of this great stuff.</li>
            <li> It is super hydrating but not greasy at all, and I really feel that it makes a difference in whether or not I get a sunburn.  </li>
            <li> It seems to have helped (unexpectedly) fade some age spots and keep my skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li> If i get pink, from yard work or swiming, put this own right after shower.</li>
            <li> It stopped the skin from peeling and healed very fast.</li>
            <li> While it may be good for your skin, the scent if very unusual and a little offensive.</li>
            <li> My husband likes it so much, he hides it from me!</li>
            <li> By the next morning the burn was mostly gone and my skin didn&#x27;t even peel.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff - this is my second bottle.  </li>
            <li> Within a week, the sunburn was gone and I was left with fresh, smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely swear by this product and have recommended it to many of my friends who come away with the same reaction as I do.</li>
            <li> And as an added bonus, afterwards our skin feels super soft and hydrated!  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon, the price is right, shipping is fast and included.  </li>
            <li> but it pretty much got rid of all pain and discomfort.</li>
            <li> I burn easily, and I know all too well when I&#x27;ve been burned enough that it will blister.</li>
            <li> Usually, depending on the burn, it will turn from bright red to a nice brown by the next evening.</li>
            <li> We all loved it but find it hard to find on the store shelves.</li>
            <li> Either way it is very soothing.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This lotion really works well to sooth burned skin.</li>
            <li> However, I had no scaring or blotchiness afterwards, which my skin is very prone to.</li>
            <li> Really does help take the pain out of your sunburn.</li>
            <li> Long story short - expect this to be a nice moisturizer, but not a cure all.</li>
            <li> Being of Irish decent and living in NC I have tried a significant number of products to help sooth sun burn.</li>
            <li> It is a little watery, not too thick and smells wonderful!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This does not mean one should get sunburned just for the relief of this product.  </li>
            <li> I honestly thought that maybe it was a fluke the first couple times I used it, that maybe my burn just wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought, and that&#x27;s why it healed so quickly and didn&#x27;t peel, but after using it over and over and getting the same fantastic results, I can say that it is truly a miracle</li>
            <li> it soaks right in, and for me, gives instant relief.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it this year over the entire surface of my arms and legs after a long day in the sun at an amusement park and water park, and I couldn&#x27;t stop touching my arm, it was so soft.</li>
            <li> I also live in south Texas.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and this stuff is a necessity.</li>
            <li> I live in the sunny southwest U.S., so</li>
            <li> Apply often and liberally within the first twelve hours and then as needed over the next twenty-four.</li>
            <li> I applied natural aloe vera juice (not the gel, which has carcinogenic ingredients!)</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s plenty of other products out there that accomplish the same thing while being more subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It \\&quot;absorbs\\&quot; pretty quickly and doesnt remain wet very long - much faster than aloe gel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of hard to find, even in places that usually carry Burt&#x27;s Bees products, so it&#x27;s easy to just get it here.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s made of natural ingrediants.</li>
            <li> added bonus of this product is how suuuper soft it makes your skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit old school.</li>
            <li> Made my sunburn hurt less and heal quickly.</li>
            <li> It is not for those of you, like me, who rely on a seven year old to apply sunscreen to your back only to live with regrets for a full week after.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It made me experience bearable and any time I ran out or switched to old school sticky Aloe I was back in major pain.</li>
            <li> So those of you who have actual sensitive skin, use this...</li>
            <li> This product offers instant relief from sun burns, and actually moisturizes the skin (instead of drying it out, like aloe vera gel).</li>
            <li> I have darker skin and rarely burn (once every few years when I&#x27;m extremely careless) but will make sure I never run out of this just in case.</li>
            <li> Obviously if you cook yourself, this product isn&#x27;t going to change that, but if you slightly overdo it, it can really save your skin.  </li>
            <li> It has worked very well, cools my skin in matter of seconds and no more  rash.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin moisturized after a day in the sun, and my tan stays deep and for a long time.</li>
            <li> if you get sunburned my son and I got burned at the pool yesterday some spots got really burned pretty bad like the back of my neck put this on instantly felt</li>
            <li> (normally my oopsie burns just peel off and leave my skin pink and raw).  </li>
            <li> We got it during the summer when we were sunburned, but now in the winter we use it because it is so dry!  </li>
            <li> However pure aloe is tough to find (in a pinch</li>
            <li> Could not really reccomend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy, and I work outside year round.</li>
            <li> Unlike sticky aloe vera gels and sprays that only soothe for a few minutes, After Sun Soother is a gift that keeps on giving.  </li>
            <li> so I had to forgo this and grab the standard green aloe.</li>
            <li> I apply this a few times throughout the rest of the day and it takes away the redness quite a bit by the next day, and also the soreness from burns.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Absorbs extremely well - no shortfalls that I can find.  </li>
            <li> Even a few miles away from where its made it is difficult to find in stores, i promise its worth stocking up on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Has a lot fewer odd chemicals in it than some of the other moisturizers in the BB line.  </li>
            <li> If I apply it immediately after the shower, or at least the same day as getting sun, I will wake up with softer, tanner skin.</li>
            <li> That keeps the heat and irritation down a bit.</li>
            <li> and hopefully, that will tone down the smell.</li>
            <li> I know a little about the sun.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t try to keep it in the fridge so the lotion is chilled, the hole it comes out is tiny and it&#x27;s very hard to dispense that way.</li>
            <li> I swear by this now and use it for everyday moisturizing, including my face.</li>
            <li> I do not reguarly use lotion (except coconut oil) because of the harsh and unnatural ingredients, but this is an exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a horrible sunburn and it immediately relieved my pain and alleviated the tight feeling of my burned skin, and I didn&#x27;t peel one bit once my skin healed!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use lotions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I was just about done peeling when this arrived, or if it helped heal my skin</li>
            <li> Always bought it locally, before, but have had difficultly locating in brick &amp; mortar stores lately.  </li>
            <li> Put on thick and let sit.</li>
            <li> No more need to deal with the sticky aloe!  </li>
            <li> Nothing is going to instantly relieve a bad burn besides a cold bath.. but using this after and as much as possible will reduce the time to heal and reduce irritation.</li>
            <li> but the smell is a little weird</li>
            <li> Seriously thinking about writing to Burts bees to let them know the off label possibilities!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer was the only thing that could save my skin after getting a terrible sunburn over spring break.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried all sorts of things in the past, Solarcaine was what i grew up with and hated it.</li>
            <li> Sorry if it&#x27;s tmi, however if you suffer from this embarrassing condition you will want to try it!</li>
            <li> and it was unbearably painful.</li>
            <li> I HATE thick, nasty lotion that leaves a residue on your hands</li>
            <li> the lotion has a very bad odor</li>
            <li> I have the worst luck with going tanning, or if I miss a spot and don&#x27;t put sunblock, I PEEL HORRIBLY, but this lotion works like a miracle for me and helps me stop peeling AND soothes my skin!  </li>
            <li> I used to peel with even the slightest burn, and now even my worst burns just turn to a tan!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is really great lotion.  It goes on very smooth.  We got it during the summer when we were sunburned, but now in the winter we use it because it is so dry!  My husband likes it so much, he hides it from me!</li>
            <li> Being of Irish decent and living in NC I have tried a significant number of products to help sooth sun burn. It is known that aloe vera is one of the best options. However pure aloe is tough to find (in a pinch you can get the clear aloe gel thats pure w/o alcohol at Harris Teeter) and in my experience, this is even better! Even a few miles away from where its made it is difficult to find in stores, i promise its worth stocking up on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Burt&#x27;s Bees cream does not leave the sticky film that aloe does and it lets your skin breathe much better as well. That keeps the heat and irritation down a bit. It is fine on the face and doesn&#x27;t seem to cause any breakouts. It is light and smooth and not oily. It \\&quot;absorbs\\&quot; pretty quickly and doesnt remain wet very long - much faster than aloe gel. It does help prevent peeling too if you keep up with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried all sorts of things in the past, Solarcaine was what i grew up with and hated it. This stuff is all i use now and recommend it to anyone out there that gets burnt quickly. Nothing is going to instantly relieve a bad burn besides a cold bath.. but using this after and as much as possible will reduce the time to heal and reduce irritation. Does it smell fantastic? no. But when you&#x27;re in pain who cares.</li>
            <li> Very Happy with this product have been using it works great.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best!!</li>
            <li> Stops the pain of sunburn overnight and heals it within a day or two. We always have this on hand.</li>
            <li> Seeing wear the fair skinned family, on occasion someone gets a sunburn. No more need to deal with the sticky aloe!  This stuff is great, clean, great smell and without your skin getting all sticky!</li>
            <li> Feels great on skin. Nice citrus smell.</li>
            <li> Could not really reccomend this product to anyone. While it may be good for your skin, the scent if very unusual and a little offensive.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use lotions. I&#x27;m a guy, and I work outside year round. But after a really sunny day this stuff feels great on my skin, and it absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike many lotions this does not have a strong smell. Its pleasant, but very light.</li>
            <li> Excellent for sunburn skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using using it since last summer. It has worked very well, cools my skin in matter of seconds and no more  rash. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I had 2nd degree burns on the backs of my legs/calfs and it was unbearably painful. This lotion absorbs quickly and immediately refreshes you while providing a bit of flexability to the skin and pain relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It made me experience bearable and any time I ran out or switched to old school sticky Aloe I was back in major pain. I am the type of person who will buy 1 of every product to see what works best and this one always wins at the local pharmacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A+ product</li>
            <li> Worked great to keep my sunburn moisturized and from hurting. Not sticky like gel aloe and smells very good.</li>
            <li> Really awesome stuff. Works great. Smells great. Made my sunburn hurt less and heal quickly. Its worth the premium price.</li>
            <li> Works great for soothing sun burnt skin. I&#x27;m not sure if I was just about done peeling when this arrived, or if it helped heal my skin so I stopped peeling. Either way it is very soothing. Just don&#x27;t try to keep it in the fridge so the lotion is chilled, the hole it comes out is tiny and it&#x27;s very hard to dispense that way. The smell is strong, but kinda herbal floral, not perfumey or overly sweet.</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned, and this is by far the best product I have ever used for my skin after I&#x27;ve been in the sun all day!! Totally worth the price!!!!!</li>
            <li> This works wonders when you get a sunburn, even better than aloe. It&#x27;s both cooling and soothing and decreases healing time from days to practically overnight. Apply often and liberally within the first twelve hours and then as needed over the next twenty-four. I&#x27;m fair skinned, red haired and burn easily. I also live in south Texas. This has been a life-saver and my go-to after sun care lotion. Usually, depending on the burn, it will turn from bright red to a nice brown by the next evening. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> We discovered Burts Bees After sun lotion a couple of years ago when my son had gotten a sunburn. We all loved it but find it hard to find on the store shelves. It soothes the burn without being greasy or gooey. We ordered three--one for camp and one for both my son and daughter to keep with them.</li>
            <li> AWESOME.  Not only does it prevent peeling but it pretty much got rid of all pain and discomfort.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and this stuff is a necessity. Starts healing a sunburn immediately upon application without any stickiness.</li>
            <li> The best sunburn relief lotion my family has found! It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Love this better than Aloe and works better, too!  I&#x27;ve found Burt&#x27;s Bees products to be hits and misses these days, fortunately this particular product is a hit.  Does the job in cooling off sun burns without that sticky residue that aloe typically leaves, and smells really pleasant.  And as an added bonus, afterwards our skin feels super soft and hydrated!  Loved it so much I brought two bottles.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It keeps my skin moisturized after a day in the sun, and my tan stays deep and for a long time. It&#x27;s cooling, refreshing, not thick at all but not too runny either. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Amazing!! I was recommended to use this product when my We got sun burnt. It stopped the skin from peeling and healed very fast.</li>
            <li> Has a lot fewer odd chemicals in it than some of the other moisturizers in the BB line.  I use as a face moisturizer as it iight and non-greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t find it in the stores, so grateful that it is still available at Amazon!</li>
            <li> Once we found this product, we&#x27;ve used nothing else for after sun moisturizing.</li>
            <li> My husband and I swear by this stuff for sunburns in our family of four boys!! It&#x27;s kind of hard to find, even in places that usually carry Burt&#x27;s Bees products, so it&#x27;s easy to just get it here. It literally relieves instantly, has a pleasant, cool and fresh scent and works super fast to return your sunburned skin back to a more comfortable state! So much better than those goopy, sticky aloe gels! Do not hesitate on this!!</li>
            <li> Unlike sticky aloe vera gels and sprays that only soothe for a few minutes, After Sun Soother is a gift that keeps on giving.  I have really fair skin and tend to burn easily.  This lotion takes the sting out, keeps me from peeling, and actually helps turn the burn into some nice summer color (normally my oopsie burns just peel off and leave my skin pink and raw).  I don&#x27;t think they claim it, but I feel like this lotion facilitates faster healing.  It&#x27;s marvelous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course I always try to keep myself covered and out of the sun, but sometimes accident burns occur and this lotion helps alleviate the pain (and embarrassment).</li>
            <li> very big one but the smell is a little weird</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product!  I used it on a sunburn earlier this summer and was blown away. Not only did it smell great, leave my skin feeling very soft and smooth, it also took away all the sting of my sunburn for about 4 hours! I got burned on my back and the backs of my legs and was sitting in the car for several hours but didn&#x27;t feel any discomfort because of this great stuff. My bra didn&#x27;t chafe where the burn was on my back either. I have shared this product with several friends and relatives and all have been very impressed!  I definitely recommend this for anyone who is apt to burn. I have darker skin and rarely burn (once every few years when I&#x27;m extremely careless) but will make sure I never run out of this just in case.</li>
            <li> Here is another one of their good products that you can&#x27;t find anymore! Are these people trying the products they make?&lt;br /&gt;They should do a survey to see if there are more people that used these 2 products.</li>
            <li> The best I have found for healing sunburns. I have red hair and fair skin, I have tried many products. It feels good going on and has prevented the effects of sun burns.</li>
            <li> This helps relive pain and redness from sunburn really quickly. The pain relief is really quick, and the sunburn starts to brown within hours of using this.</li>
            <li> The smell it great, it works well. Great for people with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> This lotion really works well to sooth burned skin. I was sunburned on my legs and shoulders and used this. By the next morning the burn was mostly gone and my skin didn&#x27;t even peel. The smell is sweet and earthy smelling, but not overpowering. Most other after sun lotions have a lot of additives like parabens which are controversial. It&#x27;s nice to know this is full of things that are good for your skin.</li>
            <li> Saved me from so many sun burns. Plus, it smells very pleasant.</li>
            <li> I tried this product since it was recommended on multiple sites as a miracle if you peel after you are in the sun.  It works!  I have the worst luck with going tanning, or if I miss a spot and don&#x27;t put sunblock, I PEEL HORRIBLY, but this lotion works like a miracle for me and helps me stop peeling AND soothes my skin!  It is a little watery, not too thick and smells wonderful!  I HATE thick, nasty lotion that leaves a residue on your hands but this product does not!  Definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff - this is my second bottle.  It smells terrific, doesn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; feeling, and moisturizes well.  Absorbs extremely well - no shortfalls that I can find.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It began with a lobster-like burn on my back and shoulders. I applied this twice a day and the burn faded to a tan with NO PEELING! I swear by this now and use it for everyday moisturizing, including my face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever written a review for a product, but this is truly a wonderful lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up I had very fair skin. It would burn, peel, repeat. This product offers instant relief from sun burns, and actually moisturizes the skin (instead of drying it out, like aloe vera gel). It alleviates the pain, and visibly reduces (or illiminates) the redness associated. If I apply it immediately after the shower, or at least the same day as getting sun, I will wake up with softer, tanner skin. I do not peel when I use this product and it enables me to build a tan. While I still wear sunscreen (most of the time) and do not unreasonably exopose my skin to sun damage, Burt&#x27;s Bees After Sun Soother has never failed to nourish and sooth my skin and allow me to have a beautiful tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is barely noticeable, and somewhat pleasant. And it&#x27;s made of natural ingrediants. I do not reguarly use lotion (except coconut oil) because of the harsh and unnatural ingredients, but this is an exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an exceptional product.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer was the only thing that could save my skin after getting a terrible sunburn over spring break. I applied natural aloe vera juice (not the gel, which has carcinogenic ingredients!) with a cotton ball and then put this all over my face, shoulders, and neck about 4 times a day.  Within a week, the sunburn was gone and I was left with fresh, smooth skin.  I did peel a bit from using this, but only in the shower while washing/drying my face.  However, I had no scaring or blotchiness afterwards, which my skin is very prone to. Awesome lotion. Smells divine. Nice and light.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t bother to put reviews often but this is a must if you get sunburned my son and I got burned at the pool yesterday some spots got really burned pretty bad like the back of my neck put this on instantly felt instant relief and today just looks like we got a good tan love this stuff will always keep this in stock around my house :)</li>
            <li> This lotion is very nice in that it absorbs quickly and is non-greasy. It helps to moisturizer the skin and seems to help the skin retain moisture. However, if they can tone down the smell by 30%, I would be happy. The smell is way too strong. The scent is flowery and not bad, but it is strong. I&#x27;m going to mix another lotion with it and hopefully, that will tone down the smell.</li>
            <li> Best stuff around for after sun sunburns. Put on thick and let sit. No pain. Excellent for our 5 year olds!!! N</li>
            <li> Happy to find this product at Amazon.  It is a light, non-greasy after sun lotion without a strong scent (important if you are sensitive to scents in cosmetics and hair products like I am).  I use it for a daily moisturizer - not just for after sun.  Always bought it locally, before, but have had difficultly locating in brick &amp; mortar stores lately.  Thanks Amazon, the price is right, shipping is fast and included.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The Burt&#x27;s Bees after sun soother is my favorite &amp;#34;after sun&amp;#34; product.  It is super hydrating but not greasy at all, and I really feel that it makes a difference in whether or not I get a sunburn.  Obviously if you cook yourself, this product isn&#x27;t going to change that, but if you slightly overdo it, it can really save your skin.  I used it in Hawaii so I feel that it was put to the test.  I used to by this in drug stores but haven&#x27;t been able to find it any longer, so I am happy to be able to order from amazon, one for me and one for my sis (who lives in Hawaii and also likes this lotion a lot).</li>
            <li> Really does help take the pain out of your sunburn. Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> This product worked great when we were in Granada and got some sun burn. Quickly alleviated the peeling and the soreness.. Excellent value.</li>
            <li> Love this product! This lotion has amazing healing properties! We did not purchase it to use after sun, but for the ingredients. Works great for diaper rash and any other place you need to heal damaged skin! Seriously thinking about writing to Burts bees to let them know the off label possibilities! Even healed external hemorrhoids! Sorry if it&#x27;s tmi, however if you suffer from this embarrassing condition you will want to try it!</li>
            <li> i love this product. yes, it is true some of Burts Bees products do have some unusual scents! what they don&#x27;t have is perfume for those of us that are ALLERGIC to everything! If i get pink, from yard work or swiming, put this own right after shower. it soaks right in, and for me, gives instant relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BEST THING IS I DO NOT BREAK OUT THE NEXT DAY IF I AM OUTSIDE FROM  perfumes, waxes, preservatives, etc. So those of you who have actual sensitive skin, use this...you&#x27;ll be impressed.</li>
            <li> This is great for those of you responsible enough not to burn that just want a great, soothing moisturizer after a day in the sun. It is not for those of you, like me, who rely on a seven year old to apply sunscreen to your back only to live with regrets for a full week after. My back was screaming red and peeling like a lizard so I had to forgo this and grab the standard green aloe. It didn&#x27;t do anything for the pain, redness or inflammation. Long story short - expect this to be a nice moisturizer, but not a cure all.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely incredible. I purchased it a couple years ago from the grocery store on a whim, just because Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm is my lip product of choice and I am drawn to the brand. I had a horrible sunburn and it immediately relieved my pain and alleviated the tight feeling of my burned skin, and I didn&#x27;t peel one bit once my skin healed! I have used it on every sunburn I&#x27;ve gotten since, and haven&#x27;t peeled once. I used to peel with even the slightest burn, and now even my worst burns just turn to a tan! I honestly thought that maybe it was a fluke the first couple times I used it, that maybe my burn just wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought, and that&#x27;s why it healed so quickly and didn&#x27;t peel, but after using it over and over and getting the same fantastic results, I can say that it is truly a miracle product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An added bonus of this product is how suuuper soft it makes your skin. I used it this year over the entire surface of my arms and legs after a long day in the sun at an amusement park and water park, and I couldn&#x27;t stop touching my arm, it was so soft. I will now use this year-round mixed 50/50 with my regular lotion after showering just because it works so well. I also like that it&#x27;s 99.5% natural, so I feel better about using it. If only they could eliminate that last 0.5% of whatever the unnatural ingredient is...</li>
            <li> the lotion has a very bad odor</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I burn easily, and I know all too well when I&#x27;ve been burned enough that it will blister. (I know, I know, sunscreen. I missed a spot, like a dummy.) I not only didn&#x27;t blister, I didn&#x27;t peel at all, and within a day my lobster skin wasn&#x27;t red anymore, and in fact was... *gasp*... tan! I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it. Absolutely recommend it for anyone with fair skin.</li>
            <li> As someone who burns pretty easily, even with sunscreen on, I have to say that this product is a Godsend. Whenever I feel like my skin got a lot of sun I apply this a few times throughout the rest of the day and it takes away the redness quite a bit by the next day, and also the soreness from burns. I absolutely swear by this product and have recommended it to many of my friends who come away with the same reaction as I do. This is definitely a must buy for all you fair skinned/easily sunburn people out there like me.</li>
            <li> Nothing feels better than this amazing formula after getting too much sun.  I am impressed how this seems to eliminate the effects so quickly and make it feel so much better.  This does not mean one should get sunburned just for the relief of this product.  Please avoid harmful sun exposure but if by chance you happen to make a mistake, have this on hand.  It works so good it is incredible.  I am sold on this product and make sure I always have it on hand.  I even take it backpacking and a tube is always on hand in my cabinet.  I live in the sunny southwest U.S., so I know a little about the sun.</li>
            <li> It works but the smell is VERY strong and VERY flowery. I actually started sneezing from the smell. There&#x27;s plenty of other products out there that accomplish the same thing while being more subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually love Burt&#x27;s Bees products but this one isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Although it is primarily meant for after sun (or sunburn) care. I use this on a regular basis as a moisturizer. It seems to have helped (unexpectedly) fade some age spots and keep my skin nice and soft. The only downside of this lotion is the smell... It&#x27;s a bit old school. Otherwise Burt&#x27;s Bees After Sun Soother is an awesome product. Love it.</li>
