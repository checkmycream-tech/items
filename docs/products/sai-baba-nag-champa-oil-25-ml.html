            <li>Will purchase more when this runs out</li>
            <li>&amp; I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the Nag Champ incense and this smells just like it.</li>
            <li>Specifications should be more pronounced</li>
            <li>Many places claim to sell &amp;</li>
            <li>People shouldn&#x27;t be able to smell you coming.</li>
            <li>The scent is great, its that real deal Nag Champa scent we know and love.  </li>
            <li>I love nag champa and this stuff smelled more like Patchouli oil.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>I love wearing nag champa</li>
            <li>Nice smell and not a bad price.</li>
            <li>This oil smells delicious but the scent does not linger very long...</li>
            <li>I was really excited to see Sai Baba Nag Champa Oil because I LOVE the incense.  </li>
            <li>Very quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for a medium to strong aroma.</li>
            <li>Not as strong as I would like to have had it,</li>
            <li>they are just too strong.</li>
            <li>it is still pretty nice.</li>
            <li>Make sure to peel away just the *top* from first ring.</li>
            <li>The oil that was in my bottle is somewhat cloudy and has a light color.  </li>
            <li>Also an important note-</li>
            <li>I use a drop or two floating on water in the bowl of an aroma lamp/tea light oil lamp.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy it for my meditation practice without smoke fumes.  </li>
            <li>Great household fragrance as well as personal scent.</li>
            <li>I could not twist the top off of the bottle, and ended up having to break the whole top off with some of the underlying metal just to get to the oil.  </li>
            <li>I am captivated by the unique way she smells.</li>
            <li>This is rich but not overpowering</li>
            <li>I think it was originally mis-labeled.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive this product</li>
            <li>This is the original scent you get with the incense sticks.</li>
            <li>As a body oil, the scent wears-off quicker than body spray or high fashion cologne, but it isn&#x27;t overpowering, which I feel is more important.</li>
            <li>and I am very well pleased.</li>
            <li>Or old lady, depends on your own nose and body chemistry i guess.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad and</li>
            <li>I was able to screw the top back on after reinstalling the metal plug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Delivered quick.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very dissatisfied with Nutricity&#x27;s lack of comprehension to my original question &amp; the the lack of response to the 2 rewordings of the original question.  </li>
            <li>It has pretty good staying power too, also around the same as the wood sticks.</li>
            <li>The oil is very nice, but not very strong.  </li>
            <li>Does not really smell like Nag Champa, but smells good.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite scent right now.</li>
            <li>,The top doesn&#x27;t twist open-is there a special way to open the container so that I may use the product?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The champa scent is right on target.</li>
            <li>It smells very exotic without being too heavy or sweet.</li>
            <li>While I love this blue nag champa opening it was</li>
            <li>a hot mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine anyone intentionally covering themselves or anyone else with enough of this stuff for a massage as the scent would be too overwhelming, so</li>
            <li>Seller shipped fast!</li>
            <li>Thank you ;)  </li>
            <li>Was the first time I had tried it</li>
            <li>oil is almost exactly like their incense.  </li>
            <li>Separate the two white rings and then unscrew the top.  </li>
            <li>It is calming and makes me feel peaceful and very Zen with just a sniff of my wrist (where I use it) during the day.</li>
            <li>Very perfume like.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells like the real deal, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is the real deal.</li>
            <li>but it really does not...</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t quite smell as much like the incense as I would like.</li>
            <li>, I repeat ... DO NOT have to put a whole lot on.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a really stron scent, but I&#x27;m guessing over time it will get stronger.  </li>
            <li>i use it in my water air purifier and it makes the whole room smell</li>
            <li>She (and I) has (have) especially enjoyed Nag Champa perfume as was offered by khalldesigns.com, but, unfortunately, khall no longer offers it.</li>
            <li>Opening it requires a sharp tool and you have to re-package this to make it safe for travel as it can&#x27;t be relied upon to be leak-proof.</li>
            <li>Fragrance stays with me and is rich; not unlike the incense by the same name.</li>
            <li>For me, this Nag Champa oil is so sweet that it affects me in a visceral way that is the opposite of what I&#x27;m looking for.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Would not reorder this version of the oil and will reorder the black top one.</li>
            <li>Nag Champa is the only incense I burn and love to wear this same scent all day.  </li>
            <li>Smell is absolutely WONDERFUL, but unfortunately, has no staying power at all, which is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>SAI BABA Nag Champa Oil comes in at second place, and well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I did though have that pesky top trouble that everyone else is speaking of.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However there is another version available of this same product with a regular black plastic top  sold by another vendor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was easy enough to open.  </li>
            <li>The diffusion of the scent at room temperature is gradual, so be careful because this scent can build in a room beyond your originally intended effect.</li>
            <li>While I believe this is authentic, I have become accustomed to other scents that bring me to olfactory satisfaction, particularly patchouli essential oil.  </li>
            <li>After that, it simply screws on and off like most every other bottle cap.</li>
            <li>As far as the bottle goes, I did have the same problem opening the bottle as other reviewers of this product and I transferred the contents to a dropper bottle which was a pretty neat and clean operation.  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t enjoy the scent without smelling it, so into the trash with this mess.  </li>
            <li>this isn&#x27;t a a pure essential oil...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite potent, so only a little is needed.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised to learn they use a fragrance oil for their incense.</li>
            <li>Buy it, find someone who is capable of informing you according to your personal likes and dislikes or find someone who already has some.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing oils all my life &amp; there are some Muslim oil shops here in DC that I frequent, but the Nag Champa scent is quite like this one.</li>
            <li>Maybe I received an old one.</li>
            <li>The packaging choice is a complete mystery.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely buy this again, but they really should change the horrid packaging.  </li>
            <li>As far as the date goes, oils should last, but then again I&#x27;m not an expert on this particular oil.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>The price is low enough to try it without thinking too much about it.  </li>
            <li>It smells dirty and nag champa should smell clean and sweet.</li>
            <li>This smells a little different than the incense sticks at first.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing oils all my life &amp; there are some Muslim oil shops here in DC that I frequent, but the Nag Champa scent is quite like this one.</li>
            <li> Maybe I received an old one.</li>
            <li> The packaging choice is a complete mystery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely buy this again, but they really should change the horrid packaging.  </li>
            <li> As far as the date goes, oils should last, but then again I&#x27;m not an expert on this particular oil.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> The price is low enough to try it without thinking too much about it.  </li>
            <li> It smells dirty and nag champa should smell clean and sweet.</li>
            <li> This smells a little different than the incense sticks at first.</li>
            <li> While patchouli is a strong and possibly extreme scent that you&#x27;ll either love or hate, it is not very sweet.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients say natural oil and olive oil: this may benefit from a little Vit E as an antioxidant to protect the oils from going rancid or starting to have off smells.</li>
            <li> Selling old outdated products is just not right and makes me lose faith in ordering online where I can&#x27;t smell first before buying.</li>
            <li> It smelt like cooking oil and bad kind at that.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;FINALLY - if your bottle doesn&#x27;t open (yes, it&#x27;s supposed to twist), get a VERY sharp knife &amp; cut between the 2 white rims located at the bottom of the lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Has a plastic seal around the bottom of the cap (like milk jugs) that&#x27;s easily broken when first opened.</li>
            <li> Only drawback is that this is a small bottle of Nag Champa scented MASSAGE OIL, it is not 100% essential oil, so it does not fully burn off.  </li>
            <li> My meditation area is small, and traditional incense feels like I am meditating next to a smoking barbeque.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell particularly bad, but it doesn&#x27;t smell at all like the nag champa most US citizens would recognize from the incense.</li>
            <li> That said, there are only a few ways you can find out:  </li>
            <li> The cap is the only challenge but it is made securely so no product is spilled and the freshness stays in.</li>
            <li> cut the two caps in the right place with an xacto knife and twisted it off with a nut cracker,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perhaps some other nag champa, but it&#x27;s really not anything like the one I know.</li>
            <li> I have tried to purchase Nag Champa perfume oil from other companies but this one is the one I was looking for.</li>
            <li> A few dabs will do &amp; goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Like other reviews have said &amp; I ignored, the container leaves alot to be desired.</li>
            <li> I agree with others that the container is clunky, hard to open, and drips.  </li>
            <li> Hard to open and then leaks.</li>
            <li> This is a let down.</li>
            <li> I wanted to transfer the label to the dropper bottle and peeled it off and found a second label underneath that indicated Massage Oil and that it was manufactured May-12, which I interpret to mean May of 2012.  </li>
            <li> I had gone from store to store trying to get this and would always get a bad copy of the original Nag Champa.</li>
            <li> little</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re dead set on nag champa scent, go for it.</li>
            <li> I got it cuz my store was out of just plain label nag champa.</li>
            <li> Take out the little plastic &amp;#34;cork&amp;#34;, and voila!  </li>
            <li> was not satisfied because I thought that I was ordering a fragrance oil burning oil and not a massage oil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but if you&#x27;re looking for SAI BABA Nag Champa, and can&#x27;t find it locally, this is it.</li>
            <li> I usually end up diluting the oils I get bc alone</li>
            <li> It has a plastic stopper underneath the lid that was hard to remove.</li>
            <li> It is not very strong and I believe it to be mixed with another base oil, maybe even a cooking oil.  </li>
            <li> Also, as others have mentioned, the cap is diabolically hard to get off!</li>
            <li> There is this a really weird smell note that reminds me of gas station urinal cakes, its not overwhelming, but it is there</li>
            <li> The fragrance was weak and it did not smell like the incense.</li>
            <li> but once I opened it I was disappointed with the lack of fragrance and the amount of time the little fragrance lasted.</li>
            <li> However, the metal has black residue, and prying off the cork each time I want to use the product is annoying.  </li>
            <li> but it was very weak.  </li>
            <li> but you won&#x27;t feel bad about having tried.</li>
            <li> Maybe a bad bottle?  </li>
            <li> One star removed for bad packaging.</li>
            <li> Highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> The container is very inconvenient to use.</li>

            <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell particularly bad, but it doesn&#x27;t smell at all like the nag champa most US citizens would recognize from the incense. Perhaps some other nag champa, but it&#x27;s really not anything like the one I know.</li>
            <li> It smells like sandalwood, but not necessarily like the Nag Champa incense.  It is not very strong and I believe it to be mixed with another base oil, maybe even a cooking oil.  I agree with others that the container is clunky, hard to open, and drips.  I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Nag Champa is my wife&#x27;s distinctive trademark scent. I am captivated by the unique way she smells. She (and I) has (have) especially enjoyed Nag Champa perfume as was offered by khalldesigns.com, but, unfortunately, khall no longer offers it. SAI BABA Nag Champa Oil comes in at second place, and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to learn they use a fragrance oil for their incense.</li>
            <li> This oil smells delicious but the scent does not linger very long... In fact, after applying it to my wrists, I couldn&#x27;t smell it at all after about an hour. Also, as others have mentioned, the cap is diabolically hard to get off!</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll love the oil that is inside but I can&#x27;t get the container open. How do I open this????</li>
            <li> Very perfume like. Scentsationoils has the best champa oil</li>
            <li> While I love this blue nag champa opening it was a hot mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut the two caps in the right place with an xacto knife and twisted it off with a nut cracker,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little hinky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT I was able to screw the top back on after reinstalling the metal plug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells like the real deal, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However there is another version available of this same product with a regular black plastic top  sold by another vendor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have that one also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not reorder this version of the oil and will reorder the black top one.</li>
            <li> This is rich but not overpowering and I am really enjoying it.  Only drawback is that this is a small bottle of Nag Champa scented MASSAGE OIL, it is not 100% essential oil, so it does not fully burn off.  The champa scent is right on target.</li>
            <li> Could be great for you.  I purchased based on my memory of Nag Champa incense burning at a friend&#x27;s house many years ago.  While I believe this is authentic, I have become accustomed to other scents that bring me to olfactory satisfaction, particularly patchouli essential oil.  While patchouli is a strong and possibly extreme scent that you&#x27;ll either love or hate, it is not very sweet.  For me, this Nag Champa oil is so sweet that it affects me in a visceral way that is the opposite of what I&#x27;m looking for.  It&#x27;s not bad and the way I experience this oil may be different than your experience.  As far as the bottle goes, I did have the same problem opening the bottle as other reviewers of this product and I transferred the contents to a dropper bottle which was a pretty neat and clean operation.  The oil that was in my bottle is somewhat cloudy and has a light color.  The diffusion of the scent at room temperature is gradual, so be careful because this scent can build in a room beyond your originally intended effect.I wanted to transfer the label to the dropper bottle and peeled it off and found a second label underneath that indicated Massage Oil and that it was manufactured May-12, which I interpret to mean May of 2012.  It is currently January of 2014.  I can&#x27;t imagine anyone intentionally covering themselves or anyone else with enough of this stuff for a massage as the scent would be too overwhelming, so I think it was originally mis-labeled.  As far as the date goes, oils should last, but then again I&#x27;m not an expert on this particular oil.  I believe this is an olive oil based product.  I will hang onto it for a while to see whether my opinion changes, but if someone says they like it a lot I will give it to them.  I may decide to keep 2ml, possibly diluting it and dispose of the rest.  I don&#x27;t think I would use almost an entire ounce of this in my lifetime.  Another reviewer said this reduced his appetite.  It has had the same effect on me. This fragrance doesnot reflect who I am and I have rated it according to my personal experience.  It may be perfect for you.  That said, there are only a few ways you can find out:  Buy it, find someone who is capable of informing you according to your personal likes and dislikes or find someone who already has some.  The price is low enough to try it without thinking too much about it.  If you like it, you&#x27;ve found a treasure.  If you don&#x27;t like it, it will be a risk you took that didn&#x27;t pan out but you won&#x27;t feel bad about having tried.</li>
            <li> If you love the smell of Nag Champa like my wife and I do---this is it.  We have been fans of this oil for years now and have never found anything that matches.  Therefore, if you are having doubts about the quality of this product, don&#x27;t.  It is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I have tried to purchase Nag Champa perfume oil from other companies but this one is the one I was looking for. Nag Champa is the only incense I burn and love to wear this same scent all day.  Peace.</li>
            <li> I bought this item thinking it was essential oil to wear as a perfume, but when it arrived it said on the bottle massage oil. It does not say this anywhere on the description or title. Highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> This smells nothing like the incense sticks, that&#x27;s what I was hoping for.  There is this a really weird smell note that reminds me of gas station urinal cakes, its not overwhelming, but it is there and I can&#x27;t enjoy the scent without smelling it, so into the trash with this mess.  Maybe a bad bottle?  The ingredients say natural oil and olive oil: this may benefit from a little Vit E as an antioxidant to protect the oils from going rancid or starting to have off smells.</li>
            <li> Seller shipped fast! Thank you ;)  Sai Baba is the best Nag Champa smell for its freshness and sweetness. The cap is the only challenge but it is made securely so no product is spilled and the freshness stays in. Make sure to peel away just the *top* from first ring. Once that is removed, you will see the plug securing the contents inside. I use my handy Gerber or a needle nose pliers to remove the 1st plastic ring.</li>
            <li> Very quick delivery. Nice smell and not a bad price. Was hoping for it to smell more like the Nag Champa incense but it really does not...that is why I only gave it 4 stars...it is still pretty nice.</li>
            <li> Very nice ,smells great.Was the first time I had tried it and I am very well pleased.Will purchase more when this runs out</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t quite smell as much like the incense as I would like.</li>
            <li> I have quite a bit left still from when I ordered about 2 months ago.  It&#x27;s very similar to the scent of the incense &amp; I love it.  I not only put it on my skin but I rub a bit in my locs as well.  You DO NOT, I repeat ... DO NOT have to put a whole lot on.  A few dabs will do &amp; goes a long way.  I&#x27;m about to see if Amazon has it in even a larger size.  I&#x27;ve been wearing oils all my life &amp; there are some Muslim oil shops here in DC that I frequent, but the Nag Champa scent is quite like this one.</li>
            <li> I love the Nag Champ incense and this smells just like it. It smells very exotic without being too heavy or sweet. I also notice that this smell curbs my appetite. WooHoo</li>
            <li> I wish this was a solid balm..... for some reason I thought it was ... but I love nag champa in any form!!!</li>
            <li> was not satisfied because I thought that I was ordering a fragrance oil burning oil and not a massage oil. Specifications should be more pronounced</li>
            <li> This has become my signature scent. I have it in a roll-on dispenser and use it daily. It is calming and makes me feel peaceful and very Zen with just a sniff of my wrist (where I use it) during the day.</li>
            <li> I had bought it, because I always loved the incense. Maybe I received an old one. The fragrance was weak and it did not smell like the incense. The container is very inconvenient to use. It has a plastic stopper underneath the lid that was hard to remove.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to see Sai Baba Nag Champa Oil because I LOVE the incense.  I received the product yesterday but, couldn&#x27;t figure out how to open it so, I emailed Nutricity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me:  \\&quot;Hi,I just received my Sai Baba Nag Champa Oil.  Please tell me how to open it so that I may use it. Thanx,\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lauren @ Nutricity:  \\&quot;Thank you for your email, I do apologize but I do not quite understand what you are requesting? Lauren\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me:  \\&quot;Hi Lauren,I just received the oil today.  How do you open the container so that the oil can come out?  Thanx,\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me (again this morning):  \\&quot;Hi,The top doesn&#x27;t twist open-is there a special way to open the container so that I may use the product?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waiting for a response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very dissatisfied with Nutricity&#x27;s lack of comprehension to my original question &amp; the the lack of response to the 2 rewordings of the original question.  It isn&#x27;t as though they&#x27;re not aware that the container is difficult to open - I&#x27;m aware of at least 1 other person who experienced the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dissatisfaction is with Nutricity not with the product itself nor with Amazon.  Amazon&#x27;s awesome, I&#x27;ve no idea how the product is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FINALLY - if your bottle doesn&#x27;t open (yes, it&#x27;s supposed to twist), get a VERY sharp knife &amp; cut between the 2 white rims located at the bottom of the lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil is almost exactly like their incense.  I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again - even from the same company - I&#x27;d just be hesitant to contact their customer service dept.</li>
            <li> This oil smells great, just like the sai baba incense. My only issue was that when I put it in my oil diffuser, when the diffuser was done running, there was still oil left at the bottom. I am used to using essential oils and so perhaps that was the issue, it just isn&#x27;t like that. They make no claims that it&#x27;s food grade or anything else, so maybe it just doesn&#x27;t diffuse as well as I&#x27;m used to. If you&#x27;re dead set on nag champa scent, go for it. But I prefer essential oils.</li>
            <li> This oil smells great. I use it with this  ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00J9RUJGA/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1 ) and great outstanding results in my huge studio space.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this product but once I opened it I was disappointed with the lack of fragrance and the amount of time the little fragrance lasted. I would not recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for a medium to strong aroma.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite scent right now. Many places claim to sell &amp;#34;Nag Champa&amp;#34; perfume/oils/colognes etc.. But they don&#x27;t smell like SAI BABA. So this is what I was looking for. You can use it as a body oil (I think it&#x27;s olive-oil based) or in an oil diffuser. As a body oil, the scent wears-off quicker than body spray or high fashion cologne, but it isn&#x27;t overpowering, which I feel is more important. People shouldn&#x27;t be able to smell you coming. It&#x27;s expensive, but if you&#x27;re looking for SAI BABA Nag Champa, and can&#x27;t find it locally, this is it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this for years! I had gone from store to store trying to get this and would always get a bad copy of the original Nag Champa. This is the original scent you get with the incense sticks. I use a couple of drops mixed with water in my oil burner and smells like a Hindu temple. I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> This smells a little different than the incense sticks at first. But after letting it set, the smell was identical to me. It has pretty good staying power too, also around the same as the wood sticks. The only problem I have is the bottle uses a cork to seal.</li>
            <li> This is a great scent from one of the best companies. The packaging choice is a complete mystery. Opening it requires a sharp tool and you have to re-package this to make it safe for travel as it can&#x27;t be relied upon to be leak-proof.</li>
            <li> Does not really smell like Nag Champa, but smells good.</li>
            <li> This item met my expectation.  Thank You,  Karen</li>
            <li> Smells kinda like nag champa. My gf thinks it smells like diapers tho.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Delivered quick.</li>
            <li> The scent is great, its that real deal Nag Champa scent we know and love.  The packaging, well that isn&#x27;t great- it leaks.  Would give it 5 stars if they improved packaging.  Also an important note- this isn&#x27;t a a pure essential oil... this product is blend of oils for massages.  Can be worn as fragrance.</li>
            <li> Fragrance stays with me and is rich; not unlike the incense by the same name.</li>
            <li> It does not smell like the Nag Champa Incense Sticks</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. Very good. Pricey for the Oil. Not as strong as I would like to have had it,</li>
            <li> I could not twist the top off of the bottle, and ended up having to break the whole top off with some of the underlying metal just to get to the oil.  There were no instructions to open the bottle.  The oil is very nice, but not very strong.  I do not know if I will ever purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love nag champa and this stuff smelled more like Patchouli oil. I won&#x27;t be buying this again. It smells dirty and nag champa should smell clean and sweet.</li>
            <li> Cannot for the LIFE of me understand the reviews that report issues with opening this tiny bottle of oil. Has a plastic seal around the bottom of the cap (like milk jugs) that&#x27;s easily broken when first opened. After that, it simply screws on and off like most every other bottle cap. Smell is absolutely WONDERFUL, but unfortunately, has no staying power at all, which is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a really stron scent, but I&#x27;m guessing over time it will get stronger.  Smells just like the incense.</li>
            <li> This has the great sag champa smell I love but it was very weak.  I usually end up diluting the oils I get bc alone they are just too strong. That is almost always the case. I wondered why this bottle wasn&#x27;t the same then I noticed.&lt;br /&gt;Stated clearly on the bottle that it was best used within 2 years. I looked for an expiration date and it was 3/11. Selling old outdated products is just not right and makes me lose faith in ordering online where I can&#x27;t smell first before buying. What a shame. This is a let down.</li>
            <li> I love wearing nag champa and I feel like this one is good. I did though have that pesky top trouble that everyone else is speaking of.</li>
            <li> Yes, this was a royal pain in the a$$ to open. It sorta smells like the incense, but like others said, definitely has a baby powder scent. Or old lady, depends on your own nose and body chemistry i guess. I got it cuz my store was out of just plain label nag champa. Lets just say i wont let myself run out of that again...</li>
            <li> Like other reviews have said &amp; I ignored, the container leaves alot to be desired. Hard to open and then leaks. The product is great and you do need to shake it. I will try the brand with a regular lid as suggested by another reviewer.</li>
            <li> Sai Baba Nag Champa Oil smells wonderful.  It&#x27;s quite potent, so only a little is needed.  I use a drop or two floating on water in the bowl of an aroma lamp/tea light oil lamp.  I enjoy it for my meditation practice without smoke fumes.  My meditation area is small, and traditional incense feels like I am meditating next to a smoking barbeque.  The one downfall of this product is the packaging.  It was easy enough to open.  Separate the two white rings and then unscrew the top.  Take out the little plastic &amp;#34;cork&amp;#34;, and voila!  However, the metal has black residue, and prying off the cork each time I want to use the product is annoying.  I just had a cobalt dropper bottle around the house, so I poured the oil into that and solved the problem.  I&#x27;d definitely buy this again, but they really should change the horrid packaging.  One star removed for bad packaging.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because the product smelled nothing like Nag Champa.  It smelt like cooking oil and bad kind at that.  I was very disappointed with this product. I would not be recommending buying from this seller again.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing fragrance for anyone, no matter the gender. It&#x27;s great for aromatherapy or just to make you feel good and blessed as you go about your day at home. Great household fragrance as well as personal scent. I will buy again and again!</li>
            <li> smells great. i use it in my water air purifier and it makes the whole room smell awesome. get the smell of incense without the smoke!</li>
