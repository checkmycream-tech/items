            <li>Wroks great on my hair.</li>
            <li>Smells great and works great, but it does not hold all day...</li>
            <li>great for kinky hair, I&#x27;d recommend for both genders</li>
            <li>but my kids are Caucasian with curly hair and this works great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sticky and is also great for edges.</li>
            <li>Great gel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying I&#x27;m done with Eco because I like a good hold sometimes</li>
            <li>and it hold amazing without any flaking unlike this one.</li>
            <li>I had used this gel before and liked it but liked Ecostyler better</li>
            <li>I was looking for more of like a styling gel</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff for my daughters hair.</li>
            <li>I love this gel and so does my hair.</li>
            <li>Works ok on my daughters hair.</li>
            <li>Makes my son&#x27;s hair very soft and smells great.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not always easy finding a good product, but this gel worked really well.</li>
            <li>Easy of use packaging.</li>
            <li>That was fantastic.</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t really help my curls form well and leaves my hair kind of poofy.  </li>
            <li>Definitely the best gel I have used so far.</li>
            <li>Ready to order more</li>
            <li>Threw it away and bought palmers olive oil the super gel.</li>
            <li>My girls love this-makes their hair super soft and curly.</li>
            <li>We use it everyday and it smells nice too!</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I find it works better after I let my hair air dry and diffuse it.</li>
            <li>My daughter has wavy hair and it gets very frizzy.</li>
            <li>Still really frizzy looking.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that defines her curls and leaves it frizz free.</li>
            <li>Loved it added moisture back to my mixed girls hair preventing frizz and the look of being dry</li>
            <li>I always have a hard time doing her hair, but this gel helped a lot it made her hair very soft and there wasn&#x27;t that many hairs sticking up anymore.</li>
            <li>My daughter is African American and has super curly hair.</li>
            <li>However, after awhile the Ecostyler started causing me buildup and dryness problems because it&#x27;s really heavy and my hair is fine.</li>
            <li>This stuff gives a light coat with a little shine but washes out way easier than Eco.</li>
            <li>I use it for my one year old daughter</li>
            <li>I bought this for myself, I have soft 3B hair.</li>
            <li>It is not a firm hold, but a soft hold.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an adult.</li>
            <li>It holds her hair all day while she is in school without leaving white flakes like some other cheap gels.</li>
            <li>You can buy this stuff elsewhere for $4-$5 bucks at places like General Dollar or Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li>Left my hair, non-sticky, non-hard, soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I have to wash my hair at least twice a week whether I use it or not to keep my hair hydrated and my scalp clean.</li>
            <li>My daughter  is mixed and has soft, dry kinky curly hair.  </li>

            <li> I then apply a little of CurlyKids to my semidry hair and it helps to control the flyaways.</li>
            <li> Harsh chemicals for little kids</li>

            <li> Smells great and works great, but it does not hold all day...I use it for my one year old daughter so it works for our needs...a little goes a long way...</li>
            <li> Eeek worked for Maybe an hr then her edges would look like I never added any product. Threw it away and bought palmers olive oil the super gel. That was fantastic. Just a tiny bit and it hold amazing without any flaking unlike this one.</li>
            <li> My daughter is biracial and has really curly thick hair and it&#x27;s not always easy finding a good product, but this gel worked really well. It holds her hair all day while she is in school without leaving white flakes like some other cheap gels. Now I just need to order a bigger container!</li>
            <li> great for kinky hair, I&#x27;d recommend for both genders</li>
            <li> My daughter has wavy hair and it gets very frizzy. I always have a hard time doing her hair, but this gel helped a lot it made her hair very soft and there wasn&#x27;t that many hairs sticking up anymore. Leaves no residue and doesn&#x27;t leave your hands sticky. Definitely the best gel I have used so far. Ready to order more</li>
            <li> this does nothing to curly or even wavy hair. Still really frizzy looking. Too bad it didnt work.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised. Left my hair, non-sticky, non-hard, soft and moisturized. No build-up after using for several days on dry hair. No smell which I also like. Only requires use of a little, should last a long time. Easy of use packaging.</li>
            <li> I like this hair care line for kids.</li>
            <li> My girls love this-makes their hair super soft and curly.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  We use it everyday and it smells nice too!</li>
            <li> Makes my son&#x27;s hair very soft and smells great. I was looking for more of like a styling gel and this didn&#x27;t work for that, but I would still buy it again for a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself, I have soft 3B hair. It&#x27;s okay, it doesn&#x27;t really help my curls form well and leaves my hair kind of poofy.  I find it works better after I let my hair air dry and diffuse it. I then apply a little of CurlyKids to my semidry hair and it helps to control the flyaways.</li>
            <li> Forget Kinky Curly Knot Today or even Shea Moisture&#x27;s Curling Souffle, this stuff does the same (if not better) than its pricier competitor&#x27;s AND without stickiness like it says. Use on any hair that needs curl definition and even the type of hair that is in the 4C range like a friend of mine where it worked great! You can buy this stuff elsewhere for $4-$5 bucks at places like General Dollar or Wal-Mart. Buy this stuff! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This is a clear goopy gel - a little goes a long way.  Not sure of the marketing here with it being for mixed kids but my kids are Caucasian with curly hair and this works great.  It is not a firm hold, but a soft hold.  Does not make hair crunchy, which I like.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff for my daughters hair. My daughter is African American and has super curly hair. This is the only product that defines her curls and leaves it frizz free. It&#x27;s not sticky and is also great for edges. The only thing is that Sally&#x27;s beauty supply sells it for $5 less than amazon.</li>
            <li> I have 3b/3c hair. I love this gel and so does my hair. It leaves my hair moisture with a shine without the flakiness, crunchiness and heavines of other gels. I keep trying other gels and butters but always return to Curlkids gel..</li>
            <li> Great gel. Not too sticky and leaves no reside. I use it to define curls in my type 3c/4ab black girl hair.</li>
            <li> Holds hair with no hardness or dry flakes. Holds curls without making them heavy and hard. We use the entire line of products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an adult. Black. With curly 4a/3c hair. I had used this gel before and liked it but liked Ecostyler better so I didn&#x27;t repurchase for awhile. However, after awhile the Ecostyler started causing me buildup and dryness problems because it&#x27;s really heavy and my hair is fine. I have to wash my hair at least twice a week whether I use it or not to keep my hair hydrated and my scalp clean.This stuff gives a light coat with a little shine but washes out way easier than Eco. I&#x27;m not saying I&#x27;m done with Eco because I like a good hold sometimes but I will definitely rotate with this.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair stayed so soft...not crunchy</li>
            <li> Works ok on my daughters hair. Didn&#x27;t really tame the frizz as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> My daughter  is mixed and has soft, dry kinky curly hair.  I was looking for a product that would keep her hair moist through out the day and not leave a build up.  I notice some build up on her hair and her hair looks like no product is on it after 2-3 hours.</li>
