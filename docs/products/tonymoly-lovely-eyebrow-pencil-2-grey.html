            <li>/&gt;This is a great pencil that is versatile for many hair colors.</li>
            <li>I ordered this and love it!</li>
            <li>This is a great color and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>The color is nice, but the formula can become crumbly while applying sometimes</li>
            <li>Purchased them for her for Christmas, she was thrilled.</li>
            <li>These pencils are a bit soft but the color is perfect!</li>
            <li>this seems to blend in more nicely.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a nice grey and this is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Brush helps to soften it out and make it look more</li>
            <li>Love this pencil.</li>
            <li>and just fell in love with the results.</li>
            <li>Love this pencil.</li>
            <li>Want to buy more.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Ordered 3 more.</li>
            <li>interesting fact is that it was shipped from hong kong</li>
            <li>i think the shipping must cost more than the pencil itself.</li>
            <li>, since leaving this review, I have tried many products that are more readily available in the US with no satisfaction.</li>
            <li>I still maintain that this is the single best eyebrow pencil I have ever used</li>
            <li>It blends nicely and the fine tip makes it easy to make a precise line.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply, lasts well</li>
            <li>The color is perfect for my black eyebrow hair.  </li>
            <li>This is just fine.  </li>
            <li>It looks fantastic and I always seem to get lots of compliments when I have used it.</li>
            <li>After reading convincing and relatable reviews about TonyMoly, I thought that $9 (for TWO) and two weeks was worth</li>
            <li>The color is attractive with her snow white hair!</li>
            <li>It really worked well with my brows and brushed it out perfectly to where I want</li>
            <li>I bought two of these and found that the greyish brown one suits my needs better right now.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I ordered two more after I received the first one.  </li>
            <li>.. worth the wait!</li>
            <li>I suppose I was expecting something a little bit darker and more towards the charcoal side, but I&#x27;ve been able to make this work and honestly; I don&#x27;t regret my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Been hunting for a grey eyebrow pencil since hair changed and delighted with&lt;br /&gt;the product.  </li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>She said it goes on very smoothly and looks natural.</li>
            <li>I ordered four pencils and they were worth the wait.</li>
            <li>It takes a couple of weeks to arrive but it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very fine line, universal color.</li>
            <li>This dark grey brow pencil is THE BEST EVER.  </li>
            <li>This dark grey color is wonderful for my eye brows.  </li>
            <li>Very soft so have to use light feather strokes</li>
            <li>Use a very gentle touch.  </li>
            <li>Light brown didn&#x27;t look natural.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and looks totally natural.</li>
            <li>As I said before, smooth and natural looking.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I have, in fact, ordered 3 more just in case they also become scarce in the future.</li>
            <li>This pencil looks more natural and I love the brush on the other end.</li>
            <li>I got this one because of all the positive comments.</li>
            <li>This was absolutely perfect for my 91 year old mother who has white hair and few eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Considering it comes from Korea it arrived pretty fast</li>
            <li>/&gt;I haven&#x27;t been able to find ANY grey pencil since (besides astronomically priced Anastasia and brand of the like for over $20)..</li>
            <li>and it is now becoming more white than grey!  </li>
            <li>I searched everywhere for a color w/o warm tones and all I could find was black.</li>
            <li>This turned out to be a great choice for me as my brows have black hairs with white and are getting sparse.  </li>
            <li>It is a good color but a little soft</li>
            <li>Not a complaint, since I got EXACTLY what the product described.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to color your eye brows.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The other end with the brush is FABULOUS too!</li>
            <li>My only complaint though, is that the caps don&#x27;t seem to secure and are kind of slippy, cause its a slip on cap not a twist or a lock, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;d slip if you carry it around in your bag or something.</li>
            <li>and I use a light brush of loose translucent powered to soften the color a bit</li>
            <li>The color is good, but after just about six weeks of a small amount of daily use, it&#x27;s almost gone!</li>
            <li>I live in the US and the gray eyebrow pencil was sold in another country and shipped by air to the US and brought to my mailbox by USPS.</li>
            <li>it was nothing like my old brow brush, I didn&#x27;t even know something like that existed!</li>
            <li>My 80 yr old mom loves this pencil!  </li>
            <li>I have grey hair, and the brown pencils just are not in the right tonal range (I am a retired hairstylist).</li>
            <li>I cannot find a grey colored eyebrow pencil anywhere and was so excited to finally find one!</li>
            <li>However, she said it was just as dark as the other eye pencils she has had to use since the one she really liked stopped being sold.</li>
            <li>They go on smoothly and have the little spooley brush at the end to groom the eyebrow and evenly distribute the color.</li>
            <li>The tip has a lid to cover the product and keep your makeup bag from getting marked up.</li>
            <li>I naturally have an &#x27;ashy-dirty-blonde&#x27; hair color, so not any eyebrow pencil works for me.</li>
            <li>, I was so surprised</li>
            <li>It does take awhile to get them, because they ship directly from South Korea.</li>
            <li>Great quality, sealed up in cellophane, has a brush on one end and the automatic thin lead pencil on the other.  </li>
            <li>The low price makes up for the high shipping cost.</li>
            <li>A couple years ago, I was given a grey eyebrow pencil from some ambiguous Korean brand that is no longer legible on the pencil itself.</li>
            <li>This product came in A WEEK, TWO weeks earlier than expected arrival date, and I was so excited to open it.</li>
            <li>As I got older, it began to turn grey</li>
            <li>i bought this pencil for my mom 92 year old mom who has white hair.  </li>
            <li>Love the little extra brush on the other end.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching high and low for a grey eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li>Had really hoped this grey pencil would be an equivalent to Maybelline&#x27;s charcoal grey pencil.  </li>
            <li>Goes on quite dark, more black than grey.  </li>
            <li>I did have to wait longer than usual for delivery because they come from Korea, but they are worth it.</li>
            <li>Oh, yes, it really works for my dark brown/gray eyebrows!  </li>

            <li> She said all her new eye pencils were too dark.</li>
            <li> Wish the lead was smaller and the grey, greyer.  </li>
            <li> Neutral gray color works well for cool complexions -- I have very pale skin and black hair, and brown eyebrow pencils just do not work for me.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is that this is a TRJE grey!</li>
            <li> Had so much trouble finding a brow pencil that was a soft enough black that would look natural.</li>
            <li> This is NOT a grey pencil, it&#x27;s charcooal or black and if you have white hair don&#x27;t get this.</li>
            <li> I have let my hair go grey</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom as she has grey hair and using a brown pencil.</li>
            <li> I go over the grey filler wil a taupe powder</li>
            <li> Grey is the hardest color to find.  </li>
            <li> I had used the Maybelline Charcoal Grey for years.</li>
            <li> After years of coloring, I decided to cut it all off and let the grey grow out.</li>
            <li> Also this pencil stays put so it actually anchors the other color and brand</li>
            <li> My mother has been looking for grey pencil for years!</li>
            <li> Was down to my last card of 2 pencils when I saw this item.</li>
            <li> Very few manufacturers make grey eyebrow pencils and most are way too dark or horribly expensive</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grandmother because she complained about her old gray eye pencil going out of business.</li>
            <li> These type of pencils are getting harder to locate.  </li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t what I&#x27;ve expected...</li>
            <li> You just have to be very careful when you apply it.  </li>
            <li> I am letting my hair go gray after 40+ years and was surprised to find that gray eyebrow pencil is very hard to find.</li>
            <li> The color is a little darker than grey but it is not as dark as the brown I was using, the powder that looked heavy and made up.</li>
            <li> Just wish it was not so dark.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use any typical brown, and blonde just looks ridiculous.</li>
            <li> You can control the darkness by using less.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a soft color, not too dark like black is, and not the wrong color like taupe or some other wimpy color.  </li>
            <li> I used to have very dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> so took quite a few weeks to arrive.  </li>
            <li> It is very hard to find a grey eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li> Will continue to experiment, maybe apply over a powder base make-up first.  </li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve used Mabelline, but they discontinued the grey pencil (stupid since baby boomers are aging).</li>
            <li> She is very hard to please so that is why I gave this a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> Brown and blond eyebrow pencils look ridiculous!  </li>
            <li> she was using a black pencil which looked bad with her hair.  </li>
            <li> Sadly it does not.  </li>
            <li> If you order this you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed that it was a mechanical type pencil that could not be sharpened.</li>

            <li> I bought two of these and found that the greyish brown one suits my needs better right now.  Great quality, sealed up in cellophane, has a brush on one end and the automatic thin lead pencil on the other.  I recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Oh, yes, it really works for my dark brown/gray eyebrows!  It&#x27;s a soft color, not too dark like black is, and not the wrong color like taupe or some other wimpy color.  It&#x27;s perfect and lasts all day - love it!</li>
            <li> Wish the lead was smaller and the grey, greyer.  Will use and buy again.  These type of pencils are getting harder to locate.  The money was excellent and the product is fine.  Just wish it was not so dark.</li>
            <li> These pencils are a bit soft but the color is perfect! The low price makes up for the high shipping cost. I ordered four pencils and they were worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I cannot find a grey colored eyebrow pencil anywhere and was so excited to finally find one! The color is nice, but the formula can become crumbly while applying sometimes</li>
            <li> Been hunting for a grey eyebrow pencil since hair changed and delighted with&lt;br /&gt;the product.  Brush helps to soften it out and make it look more natural.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be in a hurry to get it but I think you will be happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Very fine line, universal color. I have ash blonde hair, blond eyebrow pencils look reddish to me. Light brown didn&#x27;t look natural. I blend this color with light brown by using the wonderful blending brush on the end of the pencil. The colors blend perfectly. Also this pencil stays put so it actually anchors the other color and brand I use.</li>
            <li> This was absolutely perfect for my 91 year old mother who has white hair and few eyebrows. She said it goes on very smoothly and looks natural. She is very hard to please so that is why I gave this a 5 star rating. Thank you for your product. Very few manufacturers make grey eyebrow pencils and most are way too dark or horribly expensive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a nice grey and this is wonderful. Goes on smooth and looks totally natural. I will buy again. It takes a couple of weeks to arrive but it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, since leaving this review, I have tried many products that are more readily available in the US with no satisfaction. I still maintain that this is the single best eyebrow pencil I have ever used and I have been using them for about 40 years. It looks fantastic and I always seem to get lots of compliments when I have used it. It is also great for eye shadow. As I said before, smooth and natural looking. It is like a magic wand that makes my not so great eyebrows look marvelous.</li>
            <li> I have let my hair go grey and it is now becoming more white than grey!  Brown and blond eyebrow pencils look ridiculous!  Was so happy to find this pencil!</li>
            <li> A good dupe for Brow Wiz at a fraction of the cost! :-)</li>
            <li> This dark grey brow pencil is THE BEST EVER.  The company is excellent with packaging and price.  In fact, I ordered two more after I received the first one.  Definitely didn&#x27;t want to run out.</li>
            <li> The gray eyebrow pencil is just what I was looking for. The tip has a lid to cover the product and keep your makeup bag from getting marked up. The opposite end has the spoolie brush to comb your eyebrows into shape or soften and smudge the product to your liking. The only problem was the waiting until I received it. I live in the US and the gray eyebrow pencil was sold in another country and shipped by air to the US and brought to my mailbox by USPS. After I ordered it, I received it 3 weeks later. If you need this item immediately, you probably won&#x27;t find it anywhere. If you order this you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The color is perfect for my black eyebrow hair.  It blends nicely and the fine tip makes it easy to make a precise line.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find a grey eyebrow pencil. I bought this for my mom as she has grey hair and using a brown pencil. Looked all over and finally found this one. She Loves it! Looks good. Good quality.</li>
            <li> Had to go overseas to find gray eyebrow pencils!  good color and texture.  Will continue to buy Tonymoly eye brow pencils.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and love it! Considering it comes from Korea it arrived pretty fast.. worth the wait! Good color... exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> I naturally have an &#x27;ashy-dirty-blonde&#x27; hair color, so not any eyebrow pencil works for me. I can&#x27;t use any typical brown, and blonde just looks ridiculous. A couple years ago, I was given a grey eyebrow pencil from some ambiguous Korean brand that is no longer legible on the pencil itself. I go over the grey filler wil a taupe powder and it gives me the perfect matte and sort of washed out look that I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been able to find ANY grey pencil since (besides astronomically priced Anastasia and brand of the like for over $20).. After reading convincing and relatable reviews about TonyMoly, I thought that $9 (for TWO) and two weeks was worth the wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product applies beautifully and isn&#x27;t waxy. The blending tool at the end of the retractable pencil is wonderful and helpful. The only thing is that this is a TRJE grey! Almost a periwinkle color! Not a complaint, since I got EXACTLY what the product described. I suppose I was expecting something a little bit darker and more towards the charcoal side, but I&#x27;ve been able to make this work and honestly; I don&#x27;t regret my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great pencil that is versatile for many hair colors. If especially reccommend for women who are salt &amp; pepper/greying or platinum blondes and the girls going for the lavender look</li>
            <li> Love this pencil. Color is great.  Love the little extra brush on the other end.</li>
            <li> This product came in A WEEK, TWO weeks earlier than expected arrival date, and I was so excited to open it. I tried it on immediately even though it was night and I&#x27;m not leaving any where and just fell in love with the results. Best eyebrow pencil I&#x27;ve used! And cheaper! The other end with the brush is FABULOUS too! It really worked well with my brows and brushed it out perfectly to where I want, I was so surprised cause it was nothing like my old brow brush, I didn&#x27;t even know something like that existed! Amazing! Daebak! My only complaint though, is that the caps don&#x27;t seem to secure and are kind of slippy, cause its a slip on cap not a twist or a lock, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;d slip if you carry it around in your bag or something.</li>
            <li> 2 stars for the look designs of pencil but not for formula and color it wasn&#x27;t what I&#x27;ve expected...</li>
            <li> Very disappointed that it was a mechanical type pencil that could not be sharpened. The color is good, but after just about six weeks of a small amount of daily use, it&#x27;s almost gone! I like that it&#x27;s from Korea, and I want to support companies from there (rather than China) but I will definitely not buy this again.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyebrow pencil I have found for thinning lashes. I have grey hair, and the brown pencils just are not in the right tonal range (I am a retired hairstylist). They go on smoothly and have the little spooley brush at the end to groom the eyebrow and evenly distribute the color. It does take awhile to get them, because they ship directly from South Korea.</li>
            <li> Had really hoped this grey pencil would be an equivalent to Maybelline&#x27;s charcoal grey pencil.  Sadly it does not.  Goes on quite dark, more black than grey.  Will continue to experiment, maybe apply over a powder base make-up first.  Wish Maybelline didn&#x27;t discontinue their charcoal pencil...it was perfect for my greying eyebrows.  Oh, well.</li>
            <li> My mother has been looking for grey pencil for years! Purchased them for her for Christmas, she was thrilled. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love this pencil. Had so much trouble finding a brow pencil that was a soft enough black that would look natural. This one is perfect. Delivered quicker than promised.</li>
            <li> My 80 yr old mom loves this pencil!  The color is attractive with her snow white hair!</li>
            <li> Neutral gray color works well for cool complexions -- I have very pale skin and black hair, and brown eyebrow pencils just do not work for me.  This is a great color and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> This is NOT a grey pencil, it&#x27;s charcooal or black and if you have white hair don&#x27;t get this.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grandmother because she complained about her old gray eye pencil going out of business. She said all her new eye pencils were too dark. I got this one because of all the positive comments. However, she said it was just as dark as the other eye pencils she has had to use since the one she really liked stopped being sold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a senior with salt and pepper hair.  This dark grey color is wonderful for my eye brows.  You just have to be very careful when you apply it.  Use a very gentle touch.  It doesn&#x27;t take much to color your eye brows.  It took some time to arrive but it&#x27;s was shipped from overseas.</li>
            <li> I use to put color on my eyebrows.  The best I have ever used.  Want to buy more.  Color is perfect to match my hair.</li>
            <li> I searched everywhere for a color w/o warm tones and all I could find was black. This turned out to be a great choice for me as my brows have black hairs with white and are getting sparse.  You can control the darkness by using less.  It is easy to apply, lasts well and I am about to order again.</li>
            <li> Grey is the hardest color to find.  This is just fine.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I had used the Maybelline Charcoal Grey for years. Bought all I could find once they discontinued that color. Was down to my last card of 2 pencils when I saw this item. Love it. Very soft so have to use light feather strokes and I use a light brush of loose translucent powered to soften the color a bit and it is perfect. Ordered 3 more. Only problem, have to pay shipping for each one.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect but this product arrived in about a week from Korea and is a very good eye brow pencil The color is a little darker than grey but it is not as dark as the brown I was using, the powder that looked heavy and made up. This pencil looks more natural and I love the brush on the other end. Very convenient. Will order again.</li>
            <li> i bought this pencil for my mom 92 year old mom who has white hair.  she was using a black pencil which looked bad with her hair.  this seems to blend in more nicely.  interesting fact is that it was shipped from hong kong so took quite a few weeks to arrive.  i think the shipping must cost more than the pencil itself.</li>
            <li> I am letting my hair go gray after 40+ years and was surprised to find that gray eyebrow pencil is very hard to find. I found this one on Amazon.com and bought one to try it. It is a good color but a little soft and I have to be  carefull not to be too heavy-handed when applying it but I do like it. I have, in fact, ordered 3 more just in case they also become scarce in the future. I did have to wait longer than usual for delivery because they come from Korea, but they are worth it. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I used to have very dark brown hair. As I got older, it began to turn grey so I colored it.  After years of coloring, I decided to cut it all off and let the grey grow out. I&#x27;ve been searching high and low for a grey eyebrow pencil. The best Nordstrom&#x27;s could offer was a greyish brown that looked aweful. In the past I&#x27;ve used Mabelline, but they discontinued the grey pencil (stupid since baby boomers are aging). I took a chance on ordering the TONYMOLY pencil and it works great. Next time, I&#x27;ll order 2 at a time.</li>
