            <li> I bought this kit after the facial and was told to give it at least 2-3 weeks and see how I like it, with the warning that I would initially breakout as my skin adjusts.    </li>
            <li> I have had other Murad products that don&#x27;t irritate my skin like this did.</li>
            <li> product line does not cause breakouts or irritate my very sensitive pale complexion!!!</li>
            <li> Big price for such a small amount!!!</li>
            <li> I am having less and less breakouts and even my husband</li>
            <li> One tip I was given was to add a little sugar to the cleanser 2-3 times a week to use as a scrub.    </li>
            <li> The moistrizer is a little bit on the greasy side...</li>
            <li> My skin broke out, not sure why.  </li>
            <li> Saw it at Ulta but was so expensive.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference. I don&#x27;t think that I would order it again!!!  Big price for such a small amount!!!</li>
            <li> I really liked the set...was hoping it had the night cream in there though as well because I sampled it before as well and loved it. or if it replaced one of the serums for the night cream that would be nice too. but I really like the smell of these products and I use the cleanser with my clarisonic. I want to get the full size line but its so expensive I may have to wait a while...or find something a little more pocket friendly. My skin is pretty good but I didn&#x27;t use all the products as regularly as I intended so not really sure if it helped with my dark acne marks much or not.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Saw it at Ulta but was so expensive.  This makes my face so much cleaner and has helped to fade a couple of dark sunspots.</li>
            <li> I have had other Murad products that don&#x27;t irritate my skin like this did. If you have sensitive skin, beware.</li>
            <li> MURAD IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST FACIAL PRODUCT I&#x27;VE USED.. MY SKIN IS ALMOST FLAWLESS!!! THE NIGHTTIME REGIME IS GOOD AS WELLL!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin, and this inflamed my skin. The only product that I really liked and that worked for my skin type was the dark spot remover. I actually bought another bottle by itself.</li>
            <li> I went for a Murad facial about a month ago and although I wanted the acne facial, this was suggested to me.  I am mid-30s and have had acne since I had my son 6 years ago.  I bought this kit after the facial and was told to give it at least 2-3 weeks and see how I like it, with the warning that I would initially breakout as my skin adjusts.    Well I did breakout slightly, but I continued using the kit exactly as written.  Well wow, what an improvement!  The texture and brightness of my skin is great and my acne scarring is fading.  I am having less and less breakouts and even my husband commented on how great my skin looks.  One tip I was given was to add a little sugar to the cleanser 2-3 times a week to use as a scrub.    I went back for my second facial 3 weeks after I first starting using this and have now invested in full-size versions of these products.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!! I has definitely helped to lighten my dark areas, and helps to keep my skin looking bright and smooth, I have a glow. It keeps your skin nice and moisturized as well. I have been using it about 3 years now.</li>
            <li> I love the product it&#x27;s lasted me almost one month but best of all my skin looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> YES!!!! Finally...a skin care line that really makes a visable difference....reduces pigmentation spots, minimizes pores, fine lines wrinkles &amp; evens out skin tone. My skin looks &amp; feels, younger, fresher. The SPF moisterizer does not make me feel &amp;#34;smothered&amp;#34;. My skin feels moisterized &amp;  protected....product line does not cause breakouts or irritate my very sensitive pale complexion!!!</li>
            <li> It did what it saed it would works great on dark spots , leaves the skin French and clowning and younger looking</li>
            <li> My skin broke out, not sure why.  My skin doesn&#x27;t care for too much foofoo, so all of the applications were a bit much.  Keeping things to minimum.  Seller experience was great.</li>
            <li> Ir was ok no major change. Need more time to see anything happening. If not oh well.</li>
            <li> The face wash works pretty well... The moistrizer is a little bit on the greasy side... the serum was my favorite product in the kit. I will consider buying the full size. The lightening serum the texture felt a bit filmy.</li>
            <li> These products are sold at the local facial places - at double the price.  They are good proven skin care products.</li>
            <li> I notice a difference! It did not make my spots totally disappear but I am pleased that it improved by lightening. I believe that this product will need to be continually used to keep them light and I am slightly concerned of the ingredient safety since I try to go organic as much as possible!</li>
            <li> The vitamin c serum did not do much. I gave up and used it on my hands and chest to finish up the product. The face wash is great for oily skin but too much for dry. And the lotion burned. May work well for some but was too harsh for my 40 year old skin.</li>
            <li> Like this product however it is geared for a younger skin than mine.  I have more wrinkles so it works great as long as I use another product&lt;br /&gt;on the most heavily wrinkled skin.  Love the fragrance of this product but for me I need more moisture and a product that will give some lift to&lt;br /&gt;my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Good stuff - in just one day I really noticed a difference.  Skin was clearer, brighter and the tone noticeably improved</li>
            <li> I love this products. once you try it, you won&#x27;t go back to anything else! Murad  Sun does work wonders</li>
