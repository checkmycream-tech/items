            <li>Very strong.</li>
            <li>I bought this exact product at a health store and I loved it!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is the real deal, it has all the good stuff in it at a really good price.</li>
            <li>I smells nice and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It is one of the best moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried - works amazing for my hands, feet, elbows &amp; knees, which easily get ashy/flakey in low</li>
            <li>I love nubian heritage and the coconut and papaya.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I just love This Lotion its really more Of a thicker Cream..</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the smell.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, I will buy it again.</li>
            <li>It was like MAGIC.</li>
            <li>I also wanted something that smelled better.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>We keep using it all up and ordering more.</li>
            <li>, I love fruity smells.</li>
            <li>love.</li>
            <li>Love this company since trying here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>As others have mentioned, it is more papaya than coconut, but both coconut &amp; shea are there as undertones.</li>
            <li>Okay so I looked up the Nubian Heritage products and decided to try the Coconut and Papaya shea butter and bar soap.</li>
            <li>This smells more like a papaya then a coconut.</li>
            <li>love how this smells and goes on.</li>
            <li>This butter is simply the best.</li>
            <li>Smooth, creamy, and smells heavenly!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve discovered this product and I love it on my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different salves, including Burt&#x27;s Bees Cuticle rub and Egyptian Magic (both excellent products in their own right)</li>
            <li>Makes skin very soft and great fragrance</li>
            <li>but wow what a great aroma and soothing feel for someone who&#x27;s on there feet all day.</li>
            <li>To liquify just rub it between your hands for a bit and it&#x27;ll spread easily.</li>
            <li>The strong isn&#x27;t strong as people who review it say it is..</li>
            <li>It gets absorbed in the skin very easily and leaves no shine.</li>
            <li>it gives my skin such a beautiful glow</li>
            <li>any case, I would recommend this product to anyone, whether you have dry skin or whether you just love the smell and want your skin to look and feel great.</li>
            <li>My legs felt really smooth and moisturized all day.</li>
            <li>Great product especially during the winter.</li>
            <li>Use it primarily on my face every morning and night time.</li>
            <li>I first came across this in Whole Food, it smelled really good</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells just like the soap (my favorite), it glides over the skin easily once in your hands, it is absorbed through the pores easily, and it leaves your skin feeling soft, sexy, and silky.</li>
            <li>It is a bit greasy but the results are so worth it!</li>
            <li>first tried this shea butter at a health food store, however they were out of stock of the heavenly smelling Coconut &amp; Papaya, so I ordered it off Amazon (better price here too).</li>
            <li>Unless you are a man, in which case it leaves your skin feeling clean and manly.</li>
            <li>This one is as great as the stuff at Whole Foods in DC, but since I&#x27;ve moved, Amazon is a far easier place to get it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for dry feet-- keeps them beautifully moisturized!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for very dry skin.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>in fact, it smells good enough to eat.  </li>
            <li>The scent is sweet and stronger on the papaya side.  </li>
            <li>Since I am using this as a body moisturizer, potentially losing those benefits does not bother me, but if you are concerned about it, heating the product may not be a good solution.</li>
            <li>I love the smell so much</li>
            <li>A lot of people wrote that the scent is mild.</li>
            <li>and i mix the two to put on my belly because i&#x27;m pregnant and</li>
            <li>My new favorite.</li>
            <li>My previous shea butter smelled great and the texture was just like that of 100% shea butter.  </li>
            <li>My skin is soft silky and chemical free!</li>
            <li>This stuff smells and feels nice, but the smell doesn&#x27;t last!  </li>
            <li>Love this product, it keeps my skin soft and recommend it to people of color.  </li>
            <li>I love knowing that it&#x27;s organic and all natural.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin soft and lovely.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, it&#x27;s just right, not over powering like most other scented butters/creams/</li>
            <li>I got raw shea butt and tried it, it was great.</li>
            <li>I gave 4 stars because the actually product i thought was going to be more of a cream</li>
            <li>It arrived on the exact day</li>
            <li>The coconut &amp; papaya scent is very sweet (makes me want to taste it, actually!)</li>
            <li>I have bought this shea butter for years, first at Whole Foods in DC and then on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure at first because I expected a softer cream.  </li>
            <li>For someone with extremely dry skin, this is relief and more.</li>
            <li>Love the scent and coverage it has on my dry ashy hands.</li>
            <li>Will buy this again in future, not only because it is mostly organic/natural, but because I love the coconut papaya scent and that it lasts me nearly all day on my face and leaves it silky soft.</li>
            <li>Since using this, I have not used nearly as much hand moisturizer during the day.</li>
            <li>I would describe it as a paste consistency, but it infuses into my skin without any greasy residue and really seems to seal moisture into my nails and cuticles and helps them heal.  </li>
            <li>My skin is much smother and softer it has also helped with discoloration of The skin</li>
            <li>It also works really well.</li>
            <li>Very softening.</li>
            <li>I can use the product with much rubbing, but I will not order it again unless I can get assurance from the company that it won&#x27;t be defective.</li>
            <li>and it was very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I love this product but the past two orders the lotion has been full of grits and is not usable.</li>
            <li>i do make sure i keep up with the other processes as well.  </li>
            <li>Previously I bought the frankincense and myrrh scent and it is just lovely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s solid, but once you get some on your hands, it quickly melts.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this brand shea butter with frankincense and myrrh as well.</li>
            <li>OxKom, the seller of the product when I purchased it, had brand new, high quality Nubian Heritage shea butter.  </li>
            <li>The stuff is a bit gritty but melts instantly in your hands so it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I primarily use these lotions for my feet due to the shea butter making all products a bit greasy</li>
            <li>and they were like new again.  </li>
            <li>and they were like new again.  </li>
            <li>The product feels dry, but melts quickly in the palm of your hand.  </li>
            <li>My feet and heels are very soft now.m for months now</li>
            <li>My feet and heels are very soft now.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who needs a natural skin product.</li>
            <li>The strong scent wears off after a little while though.  </li>
            <li>I live in Colorado where the air is SUPER dry, especially in the winter, and my hands really pay the price.  </li>
            <li>but I guess because of the high shea butter and/or coconut oil in this, this product really helps put moisture back into my hands.  </li>
            <li>The top layer was mostly solid white, as expected, but as soon as I dipped a finger into the jar, it disintegrated and revealed white chunks of either shea or coconut suspended in a yellow oil, with more of the gritty chunks at the bottom.</li>
            <li>I order This To moisturizer my skin after using the Dudu-Osun  African black soap which i also Love...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use this one up then go back to the previous one I love.</li>
            <li>Overnight, my skin has healed and it feels so soft and plump.</li>
            <li>so I have been looking for all natural and organic products.  </li>
            <li>My skin is soft now.</li>
            <li>I have used this brand shea butter in the past, and it had a completely smooth texture.</li>
            <li>I waited a few hours for it to cool and then placed it in the fridge overnight.</li>
            <li>it quickly turns from a firm butter to an oil.  </li>
            <li>i found that in one week, if applied nightly, this cream did more to soften my heels and rid myself of that tough skin, than anything else i have found.  </li>
            <li>fixed this by wrapping the jar in aluminum foil &amp; placing it in a bowl of hot water until the product liquefied, stirring a few times.</li>
            <li>The product absorbs quickly and leaves very little residue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready to try this in other scents, and thinking of giving them out as gifts.  </li>
            <li>It keeps it moisturized and soft for a long time.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s crazy the difference in my feet, they are so soft! will definatly buy more every time i&#x27;m close to running out.</li>
            <li>Tried jojoba oil, pure coconut oil, aquaphor, eucerin redness relief, to name a few.</li>
            <li>I purchased this and two other scents at Whole Foods, and I use it for my extremely dry cuticles and skin around my fingers.  </li>

            <li> For someone with extremely dry skin, this is relief and more.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and coverage it has on my dry ashy hands.</li>
            <li> Will buy this again in future, not only because it is mostly organic/natural, but because I love the coconut papaya scent and that it lasts me nearly all day on my face and leaves it silky soft.</li>
            <li> Since using this, I have not used nearly as much hand moisturizer during the day.</li>
            <li> I would describe it as a paste consistency, but it infuses into my skin without any greasy residue and really seems to seal moisture into my nails and cuticles and helps them heal.  </li>
            <li> My skin is much smother and softer it has also helped with discoloration of The skin</li>
            <li> It also works really well.</li>
            <li> Very softening.</li>
            <li> I can use the product with much rubbing, but I will not order it again unless I can get assurance from the company that it won&#x27;t be defective.</li>
            <li> and it was very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I love this product but the past two orders the lotion has been full of grits and is not usable.</li>
            <li> i do make sure i keep up with the other processes as well.  </li>
            <li> Previously I bought the frankincense and myrrh scent and it is just lovely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s solid, but once you get some on your hands, it quickly melts.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this brand shea butter with frankincense and myrrh as well.</li>
            <li> OxKom, the seller of the product when I purchased it, had brand new, high quality Nubian Heritage shea butter.  </li>
            <li> The stuff is a bit gritty but melts instantly in your hands so it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I primarily use these lotions for my feet due to the shea butter making all products a bit greasy</li>
            <li> and they were like new again.  </li>
            <li> and they were like new again.  </li>
            <li> The product feels dry, but melts quickly in the palm of your hand.  </li>
            <li> My feet and heels are very soft now.m for months now</li>
            <li> My feet and heels are very soft now.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who needs a natural skin product.</li>
            <li> The strong scent wears off after a little while though.  </li>
            <li> I live in Colorado where the air is SUPER dry, especially in the winter, and my hands really pay the price.  </li>
            <li> but I guess because of the high shea butter and/or coconut oil in this, this product really helps put moisture back into my hands.  </li>
            <li> The top layer was mostly solid white, as expected, but as soon as I dipped a finger into the jar, it disintegrated and revealed white chunks of either shea or coconut suspended in a yellow oil, with more of the gritty chunks at the bottom.</li>
            <li> I order This To moisturizer my skin after using the Dudu-Osun  African black soap which i also Love...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use this one up then go back to the previous one I love.</li>
            <li> Overnight, my skin has healed and it feels so soft and plump.</li>
            <li> so I have been looking for all natural and organic products.  </li>
            <li> My skin is soft now.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand shea butter in the past, and it had a completely smooth texture.</li>
            <li> I waited a few hours for it to cool and then placed it in the fridge overnight.</li>
            <li> it quickly turns from a firm butter to an oil.  </li>
            <li> i found that in one week, if applied nightly, this cream did more to soften my heels and rid myself of that tough skin, than anything else i have found.  </li>
            <li> fixed this by wrapping the jar in aluminum foil &amp; placing it in a bowl of hot water until the product liquefied, stirring a few times.</li>
            <li> The product absorbs quickly and leaves very little residue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ready to try this in other scents, and thinking of giving them out as gifts.  </li>
            <li> It keeps it moisturized and soft for a long time.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s crazy the difference in my feet, they are so soft! will definatly buy more every time i&#x27;m close to running out.</li>
            <li> Tried jojoba oil, pure coconut oil, aquaphor, eucerin redness relief, to name a few.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and two other scents at Whole Foods, and I use it for my extremely dry cuticles and skin around my fingers.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s rich enough and that l I don&#x27;t get tired of.  </li>
            <li> After several recurring cases of red dry patches on my face, the doctor prescribed steroid cream to be used sparingly.</li>
            <li> i am not a fan of coconut in any way shape or form, but found this to be a minor part of the overall scent.  </li>
            <li> Also, despite only being 4 oz, it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, the only complaint is that you have to really dig your fingers into the butter to get in out of the container to put it onto your skin.</li>
            <li> Literally, I&#x27;ve been putting lotion on my feet after every shower, with socks over, and softly sanding them for months now (I also do ballet &amp; pointe, so sometimes they are a little chafed and sore), but three days of this Nubian Heritage stuff</li>
            <li> In this jar, however, the shea butter was full of lots and lots of small granules, so that without very vigorous rubbing, it would have been completely unsatisfactory and impossible to have on one&#x27;s hands.</li>
            <li> mixed a very small amount of this with another regular, unscented body lotion; a little goes a long way and this makes the scent much more subtle.  </li>
            <li> Obviously put your socks on after applying for optimal effect and so as to not stain your other garments (wardrobe or bed sheets).&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I needed an emolliant cream that would help with dry feet and legs in the winter.  </li>
            <li> I no longer have cracked feet or dry legs.  </li>
            <li> I decided to save it for winter because my skin gets extremely dry during winter.</li>
            <li> So after using this for a couple weeks, I&#x27;ve also discovered that it does wonders on dry, cracked heels!  </li>
            <li> I still had some of my previous product left when this one arrived.  </li>
            <li> Anytime I do anything outdoors like bike riding or gardening, my hands, nails, and cuticles become extremely ripped, cracked, and dry.  </li>
            <li> Just a few days later, I had a breakout on my face and idk whether it&#x27;s from the shea butter or the soap bar</li>
            <li> A little will go a long way.</li>
            <li> I get really dry hands in the winter, and have had trouble finding moisturizer</li>
            <li> , i t is a pain getting the product out of the jar because it is hard so you have to spend some extra time warming up the product so you can apply the desired amount.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been disappointed in the past by the shea butter on Amazon - it seemed the seller I purchased from the first time had very old or some other compromised stock, resulting in a grainy shea butter that ended up being somewhat of an exfoliator</li>
            <li> It does not leave the skin feeling oily, but there can be a slight sort of powdery feel, which is the slightest bit sticky after applying if I use a lot.</li>
            <li> (I also do ballet &amp; pointe, so sometimes they are a little chafed and sore), but three days of this Nubian Heritage stuff</li>
            <li> A little pricey</li>
            <li> I used a little once it arrived</li>
            <li> I have been trying to repair my dry heels since summer 2011, having gone through at least three different other foot lotions (one from Avon, one from J.R. Watkins, and another random brand)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also done what a few others have suggested--</li>
            <li> but I was missing the scent.</li>
            <li> My face, especially around the mouth and nose were breaking out bad and turning red and itchy.</li>
            <li> I have used shea butter in the past but wanted something that was creamier an easier to apply.  </li>
            <li> This was VERY firm.</li>
            <li> In the store the product had a hard, refrigerated butter-like consistency, but melted to the touch.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and whipped like a souffle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick...</li>
            <li> The butter is a very thick consistency so it will take awhile to scoop it out the container.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong--</li>
            <li> And don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> but I felt bad every time I had to reach for it.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it was a bad batch.</li>
            <li> Softens the worst hands, knees &amp; elbows!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Best shea butter on the planet!</li>
            <li> I love nubian heritage and the coconut and papaya. it gives my skin such a beautiful glow and i feel like  the elasticity in my skin has improven! I gave 4 stars because the actually product i thought was going to be more of a cream then an ointment, i t is a pain getting the product out of the jar because it is hard so you have to spend some extra time warming up the product so you can apply the desired amount. It is a bit greasy but the results are so worth it! next time i will definatly go with the lotion bottle.</li>
            <li> I needed an emolliant cream that would help with dry feet and legs in the winter.  This has totally done the trick.  I wasn&#x27;t sure at first because I expected a softer cream.  This was VERY firm. What I know now is that coconut oil, once it is warmed by your hands (or legs in my case) it quickly turns from a firm butter to an oil.  I no longer have cracked feet or dry legs.  Yay!! Plus it smells and feels great.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Keeps my skin nice and soft.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  Thank you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 71 and people always said that I look much younger.</li>
            <li> I use this at night with cotton gloves.  The product feels dry, but melts quickly in the palm of your hand.  Since using this, I have not used nearly as much hand moisturizer during the day.</li>
            <li> Smells heavenly and works great.</li>
            <li> this is like body nectar.  heavenly.  silky, not greasy and the aroma is so luscious. i will definitely keep using this!</li>
            <li> I just got this and I love it! Just in time for the winter.  It&#x27;s thick and whipped like a souffle.  It&#x27;s great for very dry skin. It keeps it moisturized and soft for a long time.  I&#x27;m ready to try this in other scents, and thinking of giving them out as gifts.  I&#x27;m definitely pleased!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for dry feet-- keeps them beautifully moisturized!</li>
            <li> I purchased this and two other scents at Whole Foods, and I use it for my extremely dry cuticles and skin around my fingers.  I live in Colorado where the air is SUPER dry, especially in the winter, and my hands really pay the price.  Anytime I do anything outdoors like bike riding or gardening, my hands, nails, and cuticles become extremely ripped, cracked, and dry.  I&#x27;ve tried many different salves, including Burt&#x27;s Bees Cuticle rub and Egyptian Magic (both excellent products in their own right) but I guess because of the high shea butter and/or coconut oil in this, this product really helps put moisture back into my hands.  It&#x27;s very thick...I would describe it as a paste consistency, but it infuses into my skin without any greasy residue and really seems to seal moisture into my nails and cuticles and helps them heal.  I can put this on and then type on my computer or use my phone without oily stains getting everywhere.  When I put it on before going to sleep I always notice a difference the very next morning (after applying I sleep with a pair of cotton gloves on to help the product work all night.)  The coconut &amp; papaya scent is very sweet (makes me want to taste it, actually!) but I usually only use it on my hands and maybe elbows so it isn&#x27;t too overpowering for me.  I&#x27;ve also done what a few others have suggested--mixed a very small amount of this with another regular, unscented body lotion; a little goes a long way and this makes the scent much more subtle.  An excellent product for my uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE - March 30, 2012* So after using this for a couple weeks, I&#x27;ve also discovered that it does wonders on dry, cracked heels!  I have been trying to repair my dry heels since summer 2011, having gone through at least three different other foot lotions (one from Avon, one from J.R. Watkins, and another random brand) but the progress was slow-going.  Literally, I&#x27;ve been putting lotion on my feet after every shower, with socks over, and softly sanding them for months now (I also do ballet &amp; pointe, so sometimes they are a little chafed and sore), but three days of this Nubian Heritage stuff and they were like new again.

Totally amazing.  My feet and heels are very soft now.</li>
            <li> I just love This Lotion its really more Of a thicker Cream.. I order This To moisturizer my skin after using the Dudu-Osun  African black soap which i also Love... My skin is much smother and softer it has also helped with discoloration of The skin it also smells really good and You don&#x27;t need a Lot.. However I do wish they made It in a bigger size then the 4oz (I&#x27;m just being Greedy)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell. It smells like candy. It also works really well. It&#x27;s solid, but once you get some on your hands, it quickly melts. Love this stuff, I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> After several recurring cases of red dry patches on my face, the doctor prescribed steroid cream to be used sparingly. It worked but I felt bad every time I had to reach for it. My face, especially around the mouth and nose were breaking out bad and turning red and itchy. Tried jojoba oil, pure coconut oil, aquaphor, eucerin redness relief, to name a few. None provided repite from the redness. I got raw shea butt and tried it, it was great. Since I didn&#x27;t whip it, I also tried this one, Nubian shea with the coconut and papaya. It was like MAGIC. Overnight, my skin has healed and it feels so soft and plump. All the redness and dryness is gone. The stuff is a bit gritty but melts instantly in your hands so it is easy to apply. A little will go a long way. For someone with extremely dry skin, this is relief and more. The fragrance is noticeable but not overpowering. It gets absorbed in the skin very easily and leaves no shine.</li>
            <li> The best body cream I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;m a swimmer and in the chlorine 5 days a week training.  During the day I use the lotion and at night the body cream and it&#x27;s great stuff!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the real deal, it has all the good stuff in it at a really good price. Zap</li>
            <li> i found that in one week, if applied nightly, this cream did more to soften my heels and rid myself of that tough skin, than anything else i have found.  i do make sure i keep up with the other processes as well.  i  put a stopper in the shower several times a week so that my feet get thoroughly saturated as i shower, which helps to soften that skin for abrasion. i am not a fan of coconut in any way shape or form, but found this to be a minor part of the overall scent.  in fact, it smells good enough to eat.  you do not need a lot of this product so it should last for a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been reading a lot about lotions with all sorts of chemicals and harmful products so I have been looking for all natural and organic products.  I have used shea butter in the past but wanted something that was creamier an easier to apply.  I also wanted something that smelled better.  This product is just what I looked for.  The scent is sweet and stronger on the papaya side.  The strong scent wears off after a little while though.  My skin is soft silky and chemical free!</li>
            <li> Delicious. I smells nice and is easy to apply. I decided to save it for winter because my skin gets extremely dry during winter.</li>
            <li> I first came across this in Whole Food, it smelled really good but they only had the taster. I decided to buy it from amazon, when I got the shea butter it had no coconut &amp; papaya smell. It works well on my skin but I was missing the scent.</li>
            <li> THIS IS AN HONEST REVIEW!!!! This stuff smells and feels nice, but the smell doesn&#x27;t last!  I can buy shea butter anywhere, but i bought this because it was infused with coconut and papaya, my two favorites, AND THE SMELL DOES NOT LAST!!!</li>
            <li> A lot of people wrote that the scent is mild. It is NOT. I put the shea butter on my legs after shaving in the morning and all day my boyfriend joked that I was the human air freshener. Don&#x27;t get me wrong-- the scent is absolutely beautiful, but it&#x27;s strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are okay with a strong scent, then this product is awesome. My legs felt really smooth and moisturized all day. I think next time I will go with a milder scent.</li>
            <li> Great product especially during the winter.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Softens the worst hands, knees &amp; elbows!  Smells good too!</li>
            <li> I like the Shea butter with coconut and papaya/mango. Makes skin very soft and great fragrance</li>
            <li> The best organic body butter ever! The smell, organic ingredients and moisturizing benefits are excellent!! We keep using it all up and ordering more. A little pricey but then again, it works.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Smells and feels wonderful!  Use it primarily on my face every morning and night time. Highly recommend this brand shea butter with frankincense and myrrh as well.</li>
            <li> Love all Nubian products! I have to say that the smell of the coconut papaya, puts me off. Very strong. And don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love fruity smells. Previously I bought the frankincense and myrrh scent and it is just lovely. I&#x27;ll use this one up then go back to the previous one I love. The formula is great! Very softening. Even for use in the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this shea butter product after trying the soap, and I have to say, I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells just like the soap (my favorite), it glides over the skin easily once in your hands, it is absorbed through the pores easily, and it leaves your skin feeling soft, sexy, and silky. Unless you are a man, in which case it leaves your skin feeling clean and manly. (:D) Anyway, the only complaint is that you have to really dig your fingers into the butter to get in out of the container to put it onto your skin. To me, it&#x27;s not enough of an inconvenience to dock a star, but I do wish it was easier to get out of the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, I would recommend this product to anyone, whether you have dry skin or whether you just love the smell and want your skin to look and feel great.</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible!  It smells heavenly and isn&#x27;t at all runny or greasy.  Also, despite only being 4 oz, it lasts a long time.  I get really dry hands in the winter, and have had trouble finding moisturizer that&#x27;s rich enough and that l I don&#x27;t get tired of.  Looks like I&#x27;ve found it!</li>
            <li> love. it. The smell is delicious and it perfectly nourishes my dry skin. I use it all over my body. To liquify just rub it between your hands for a bit and it&#x27;ll spread easily. My new favorite.</li>
            <li> Love this company since trying here on Amazon. They make great soaps too. I primarily use these lotions for my feet due to the shea butter making all products a bit greasy but wow what a great aroma and soothing feel for someone who&#x27;s on there feet all day. Obviously put your socks on after applying for optimal effect and so as to not stain your other garments (wardrobe or bed sheets).&lt;br /&gt;But nothing that won&#x27;t come out with a wash if so.</li>
            <li> The scent is wonderful, like a vacation in a jar! As others have mentioned, it is more papaya than coconut, but both coconut &amp; shea are there as undertones. The product absorbs quickly and leaves very little residue. It does not leave the skin feeling oily, but there can be a slight sort of powdery feel, which is the slightest bit sticky after applying if I use a lot. It is one of the best moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried - works amazing for my hands, feet, elbows &amp; knees, which easily get ashy/flakey in low humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture issues &amp; how I solved them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first tried this shea butter at a health food store, however they were out of stock of the heavenly smelling Coconut &amp; Papaya, so I ordered it off Amazon (better price here too). In the store the product had a hard, refrigerated butter-like consistency, but melted to the touch. The product I received was opposite in texture. The top layer was mostly solid white, as expected, but as soon as I dipped a finger into the jar, it disintegrated and revealed white chunks of either shea or coconut suspended in a yellow oil, with more of the gritty chunks at the bottom. My product resembled a body scrub compared to what I had tried in store. Based on the ingredients list I&#x27;m guessing what happened is the coconut or shea separated from the essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fixed this by wrapping the jar in aluminum foil &amp; placing it in a bowl of hot water until the product liquefied, stirring a few times. I waited a few hours for it to cool and then placed it in the fridge overnight. I pulled it out in the morning, and by the evening I found it had the most wonderful whipped-like texture. Keep in mind that this fix may alter/breakdown some of the anti-aging/skin brightening benefits listed on the jar. Since I am using this as a body moisturizer, potentially losing those benefits does not bother me, but if you are concerned about it, heating the product may not be a good solution.</li>
            <li> I love this product but the past two orders the lotion has been full of grits and is not usable. I&#x27;ll try another fragrance or vendor. Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> Okay so I looked up the Nubian Heritage products and decided to try the Coconut and Papaya shea butter and bar soap. I&#x27;ve been using this shea butter for a week or so now. My skin is soft now. I would recommend to apply this lotion before you go to sleep because when you wake up and take a shower you feel the softness in your skin. This smells more like a papaya then a coconut. I applied this lotion on my face and along with the soap bar. Just a few days later, I had a breakout on my face and idk whether it&#x27;s from the shea butter or the soap bar so I decided not to apply it on my face anymore. The strong isn&#x27;t strong as people who review it say it is..The butter is a very thick consistency so it will take awhile to scoop it out the container. I just wish it was in a bigger container because I&#x27;ve had it for a week now and it&#x27;s almost gone sigh.. I will be purchasing the body lotion next time..</li>
            <li> Love this product, it keeps my skin soft and recommend it to people of color.  It smells amazing and I don&#x27;t have to use a lot. A container keeps me going for about a month and I use it daily.</li>
            <li> Smells great, non allergenic for my wife.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand shea butter in the past, and it had a completely smooth texture. In this jar, however, the shea butter was full of lots and lots of small granules, so that without very vigorous rubbing, it would have been completely unsatisfactory and impossible to have on one&#x27;s hands. I can use the product with much rubbing, but I will not order it again unless I can get assurance from the company that it won&#x27;t be defective. Perhaps it was a bad batch. It smells great, however.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get over how good this lotion smells. It makes me hungry. I bought this for my mom for her birthday, and she loves it.  I used a little once it arrived and it was very moisturizing. I love knowing that it&#x27;s organic and all natural. It arrived on the exact day it said it would so I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this exact product at a health store and I loved it!  I decided to buy it again online because it was cheaper.  I still had some of my previous product left when this one arrived.  It was totally different!  There was no scent what so ever!  It was even a different color.  My previous shea butter smelled great and the texture was just like that of 100% shea butter.  This one however was not even the same texture.  I think I received a defective product.</li>
            <li> I bought this item along with the lotion and i mix the two to put on my belly because i&#x27;m pregnant and it&#x27;s amazing! I love the smell so much i don&#x27;t just use it for my belly i use it for all over every day and get tons of Complements on the smell.  It also works really good for my feet, i put it on at night and put socks over it and it&#x27;s crazy the difference in my feet, they are so soft! will definatly buy more every time i&#x27;m close to running out.</li>
            <li> Would buy this again. It is silky and yet a solid shea butter. Not whip cream consistency that I would scoop too much up and waste. Will buy this again in future, not only because it is mostly organic/natural, but because I love the coconut papaya scent and that it lasts me nearly all day on my face and leaves it silky soft.</li>
            <li> love how this smells and goes on. Makes your skin soft and lovely. I highly recommend this product to anyone who needs a natural skin product.</li>
            <li> OxKom, the seller of the product when I purchased it, had brand new, high quality Nubian Heritage shea butter.  I have bought this shea butter for years, first at Whole Foods in DC and then on Amazon.  I&#x27;ve been disappointed in the past by the shea butter on Amazon - it seemed the seller I purchased from the first time had very old or some other compromised stock, resulting in a grainy shea butter that ended up being somewhat of an exfoliator (not what I was looking for).  This one is as great as the stuff at Whole Foods in DC, but since I&#x27;ve moved, Amazon is a far easier place to get it.</li>
            <li> This butter is simply the best. I love the smell, it&#x27;s just right, not over powering like most other scented butters/creams/lotions.&lt;br /&gt;You must try this out, you won&#x27;t want to use anything else.</li>
            <li> Smooth, creamy, and smells heavenly!</li>
            <li> Love the scent and coverage it has on my dry ashy hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve discovered this product and I love it on my skin.</li>
