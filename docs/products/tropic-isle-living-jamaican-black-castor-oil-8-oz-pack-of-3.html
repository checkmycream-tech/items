            <li>But apparently it&#x27;s also good for the skin and nails.</li>
            <li>Took longer to receive than anticipated, but worth the wait!</li>
            <li>Specially for damaged hair,it gives volume to the hair and restore the damage.</li>
            <li>and  the top is sprouting  after being baby bottom bald  for 13  years thanks to&lt;br /</li>
            <li>so I always try to find good deals such as this one.  </li>
            <li>Love this oil because it has multiple uses and can be mixed with think creams and therapeutic essential oils to easily absorb into the skin to make it supple, excellent hot oil</li>
            <li>the best hair growth product for black hair that I&#x27;ve ever purchase, look forward to purchasing every month thus far</li>
            <li>I use this product to make my own hair productsI especially like it for oiling my scalp!</li>
            <li>so peach fuzz is a step in the right direction.</li>

            <li>I absolutely love this Jamaican Black Castor Oil.</li>
            <li>And IMO this brand is far superior to the other that is found frequently on the net and amazon.  </li>
            <li>It is thick and very oily, so not for fine hair or someone with an oily scalp.</li>
            <li>Im going to continue to order this product, because it works on my hair as far as locking in moisture, I jump on buying this product 3 8 ounce bottles for the prices of one, cant beat that prices.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend for hair, skin infections and a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I use this for our natural 4C hair.  </li>
            <li>Works wonders and softens my hair when I put it in my cholesterol, I just heat it a little in a sink of hot water.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the real deal..I&#x27;ve been using JBCO for about 2 years now and my hair is longer and thicker than ever!</li>
            <li> I like the three pack so I can go longer in-between buys. Delivery was fast without issue. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s making my hair longer, but I definitely notice thicker strands which makes my hair fuller. It hydrates my natural hair (I&#x27;m black) and I only need to use it once or twice a week. Works wonders and softens my hair when I put it in my cholesterol, I just heat it a little in a sink of hot water. I&#x27;m going to start putting it in my conditioner as a leave-in as well. The smell isn&#x27;t great, but I offset it using vitamin E, grapeseed or sesame oil. Even a simple moisturizer. It is thick and very oily, so not for fine hair or someone with an oily scalp. But apparently it&#x27;s also good for the skin and nails.</li>
            <li> I left another feedback on this product. It is great for hair and body and not sold in store. Received and an excellent price and fast shipment. Great customer service and great feedback to my small problem. I will definitely order again from sender as I use this product quite often.</li>
            <li> Filled in my mom&#x27;s edges and thickened my sister&#x27;s hair. I use on my hair before putting in braids. No breakage when i take &#x27;em off.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing stuff!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful had it for about a month and my hair has already grew a couple of inches I love it</li>
            <li> Excellent arrived early and individually wrapped love the product.</li>
            <li> Im going to continue to order this product, because it works on my hair as far as locking in moisture, I jump on buying this product 3 8 ounce bottles for the prices of one, cant beat that prices.  I love it im stocked up until next year.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for women with alopecia my client came to me after 13 years of wearing glued in weaves or scarfs after suffering from medicinally provoked alopecia I suggested this product to her and laid off the glue after daily use of three 8 Oz jars her sides are fully in about 3-4in. Long and  the top is sprouting  after being baby bottom bald  for 13  years thanks to&lt;br /&gt; JBCO from this seller Her self confidence is back and she gets to go out with out hi&lt;br /&gt;ding</li>
            <li> Love this oil because it has multiple uses and can be mixed with think creams and therapeutic essential oils to easily absorb into the skin to make it supple, excellent hot oil and/or use with a conditioning treatment, can be taken internally, tiny amount mixed and applied to hair and hairline with essential oils and a leave-in condition before blow drying hair and/or detangling, great braid oil, helps hair growth, etc. The key is being frugal if you plan to leave it in the hair.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t been that long since I have purchased this oil, but both me and my husband started using it and we both noticed that our hair has become a little stronger. We both like it. We use it about two to three times a week. Good price for the bundle.</li>
            <li> thank you&lt;br /&gt;It was formerly bottle of glass&lt;br /&gt;Now Plastic&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s a much better</li>
            <li> It stinks so bad that I don&#x27;t use it so I  couldn&#x27;t tell u if it work or not</li>
            <li> It is a great product.Specially for damaged hair,it gives volume to the hair and restore the damage.Love it.I recommend to anyone who have hair loss.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with this purchase.  Took longer to receive than anticipated, but worth the wait!</li>
            <li> Great value and product</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product! I just repurchased this item last night! JBCO has been a staple product for me during my 3.5 year journey!</li>
            <li> The bottle was glass.. and one of them was broke :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using JBCO for two years now so I always try to find good deals such as this one.  I ordered it on a Saturday I believe and it was at my house by Wednesday.  It was securely wrapped.  For naturals looking to lock moisture in this is the perfect product.  My hair has grown so much since I implemented this into my routine.</li>
            <li> I would recommend for hair, skin infections and a natural deodorant. I drop 3 or 4 drops of essential oil in a dime size amount of JBCO and rub together in my palm with my finger then apply in my armpits. Then i rub the little remaining in my inner thigh to prevent chaffing of my inner thighs.</li>
            <li> It will positively grow your hair. I placed this on my bald spots and like magic, I got fuzz. then i noticed over time that the hair filled in whereas it was completely ball. Love this product.</li>
            <li> Very good product and very good price. I use this product to make my own hair productsI especially like it for oiling my scalp!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I use this for our natural 4C hair.  Her hair is bra strap length.  Love this product</li>
            <li> the best hair growth product for black hair that I&#x27;ve ever purchase, look forward to purchasing every month thus far</li>
            <li> I love this product. The smell is not the best thing of it. I massage my scalp with it about 2 days prior to my wash days.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Jamaican Black Castor Oil. It works great for helping my hair grow faster. I have seen such an improvement in the hydration of my skin and less dryness for my face and hair.</li>
            <li> I love the combination.  I have made black Castor Oil a part of my home DIY hair regimes.  And I am using it for other purposes as well.  This 3 pack is the best deal that I could find anywhere on the internet.  And IMO this brand is far superior to the other that is found frequently on the net and amazon.  If you don&#x27;t want to risk running out this is the best deal by far.  Oh and  if you are trying to grow out your hair.  This really works.  It&#x27;s been 5 months since I started using this as part of my home DIY regime and my edges are back and thicker than ever.  I had several balding spots on the top and sides of my head and they all are covered in peach fuzz.  It&#x27;s not as thick as I would like.  But these areas have been bald for years so peach fuzz is a step in the right direction.</li>
