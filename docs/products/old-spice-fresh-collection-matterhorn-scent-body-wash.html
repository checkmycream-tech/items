            <li>Smells great.  </li>
            <li>Great deal wonderful smell, easy to use!</li>
            <li>This stuff is very nice.  </li>
            <li>probably the best smelling and refreshing body wash there is out there.  </li>
            <li>Nice product!  </li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>It is good for me as I shower morning and evening; for those that shower once a day; I suggest Denali.  </li>
            <li>I smell good, but still haven&#x27;t gotten used to the horse that appears in my bathroom every morning while I&#x27;m showering.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as ordered, on time with a great price!  </li>
            <li>It is a nice scent and my wife likes it a lot.</li>
            <li>This rinses well, smells good, what more do you want.</li>
            <li>The best Old Spice has to offer!</li>
            <li>great product, smells great, all the ladies love it, and keeps you feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great scent, keeps your skin hydrated and fresh, and I use it for washing my hair.</li>
            <li>good smell, gets you clean.  </li>
            <li>but the deal on these is much better than what&#x27;s available, so I figured a change would be good.  </li>
            <li>This product leave your body feeling fresh and with a pleasant after scent.</li>
            <li>Elicits more, &amp;#34;you smell great&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Of all the body washes I&#x27;ve tried, this one does the best job of both washing AND giving an overall deodorant protection.</li>
            <li>I expect to be able to get a hint of the scent an hour or so after use, but I never smell it.  </li>
            <li>Many have mentioned a aroma</li>
            <li>While this 3-pack was about $1 more a bottle, I cannot find the Matterhorn scented body wash in the store, so I turned to Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Nice unique smell</li>
            <li>It rinses nice and clean without drying you out.  </li>
            <li>Old Spice Fresh Collection Matterhorn Scent is an excellent product.</li>
            <li>I like the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; scent, as compared to Denali &amp; Fugi scents; which I find too strong for me.  </li>
            <li>The smell is not too strong and lasts on the skin for about 6-8 hours.  </li>
            <li>I purchased a three pack for bit over eleven dollars, a great buy, as at the local drugstore</li>
            <li>Love the mild clean scent, it cleans all this stuff cleans.  </li>
            <li>The price on this pack of three is pretty good and with prime it&#x27;s a reasonable purchase.</li>
            <li>It works good, has a nice, distinct smell to it, but not as good as Game Day.  </li>
            <li>There are just too many competing for the coveted first place.</li>
            <li>I was so depressed when they stopped selling it in stores near us , but I&#x27;m glad to see it here!</li>
            <li>Definitely the best smelling variety of the Old Spice Fresh Collection.</li>
            <li>He uses the Old Spice deodorant and I thought this would be a nice additive to that smell.  </li>
            <li>There are other great scents in this line, but this is not one of them.</li>
            <li>Just makes me feel clean and fresh</li>
            <li>What I am looking for in particular, is the amount of lather I will be able to generate</li>
            <li>These containers can be emptied rather quickly, and I prefer maximum lather which this Fresh Collection does not seem to provide.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s why I love Old Spice products!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li>With free (and fast) shipping and no sales tax to accompany the purchase</li>
            <li>In the Fresh collection, I like the Zanzibar, and nothing else.  </li>
            <li>I always love old spice deoderant and body wash.</li>
            <li>I give it a 3.5 Star rating, for whatever it is worth.</li>
            <li>If this is your favorite Old Spice scent too, get it.</li>
            <li>I use the OS Fresh Matterhorn AP deodorant as well, but this gets the whole thing going the right direction for a lot of hours!</li>
            <li>it lathers up thick and rinses off well leaving you feeling super clean and smelling good.</li>
            <li>My wife loves the smell too and it is not the kind that lingers long after you leave the room.  </li>
            <li>Product quality and the most timeless vintage image&lt;br /&gt;for real men, shame about the Old Spice product is not sold in France.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Three bottles of body wash at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad they&#x27;ve revamped their style to appeal to younger crowds!</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, if you are looking for a body was that works pretty well and want to buy everything off Amazon like I do, try this product in Denali, Fiji, or Zanzibar.  </li>
            <li>The scent is similar, really, but slightly more minty/cologne-y, I guess.  </li>
            <li>By far my favorite scent from Old Spice.</li>
            <li>this a pretty good deal since usually one bottle sells for about $5.00 plus tax almost 6</li>
            <li>As Matterhorn is my favorite Old Spice scent, it was well worth the extra.</li>
            <li>I used to use their \\&quot;pure sport\\&quot; flavor</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for carrying this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I have had the good fortune to try several Body Washes, from different brands to different sizes.</li>
            <li>I got a better price here than at the local big box stores.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly care for the Matterhorn scent.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I find that when the Body Wash soap plays along I am able to wash almost completely with one serving, even though it might be a generous one, and with the help of Salux seems to be mostly enough to wash entirely.</li>
            <li>I purchased this as an alternative to the Bath and Body Works products I normally buy my husband.</li>
            <li>so I can get the maximum use of my very appreciated japanese wash towel, which is called Salux.</li>
            <li>My Dad used Old Spice after-shave for years, but this isn&#x27;t my dad&#x27;s aftershave!</li>
            <li>It definitely has a more masculine scent than some of the other new ones, like Fiji for instance.</li>
            <li>Smells like me, crazy cheap, have to hide it so other people don&#x27;t use it lol</li>
            <li>These scents are much better and last slightly longer.</li>
            <li>soap leaves you feeling clean, is of average performance, and the price was borderline acceptable.</li>
            <li>The price of this is a little better, but when you factor in BBW sales and promotions this is something I will be passing on next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Old Spice Matterhorn Scent Body Wash, is another member in the Old Spice line of Body Washes.  </li>
            <li>It has a definite manly cologne scent to it, much richer in fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I get a lot of compliments about the way I smell when I wear it, even from complete strangers.</li>
            <li>Completely unnacceptable.</li>
            <li>Here in the war zone, oftentimes BAR soap just gets old.</li>
            <li>Old Spice has really come a long way with these body wash products.</li>
            <li>At this stage I have yet to zero in on a particular brand, so I keep trying different ones.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It smells refreshing and manly instead of some weird cross between perfume and death like so many other male body washes.</li>
            <li>I feel totally ripped off and am done with Old Spice as well.</li>
            <li>This is another totally different scent breaking from the line of Old Spice traditional scent.</li>

            <li> It still foams up quite well and the scent is in long lasting.</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long either.</li>
            <li> Besides that critical issue, this brand is like a lot of other body washes.</li>
            <li> A little too simple.</li>
            <li> but I do not fine such.  </li>
            <li> Two of the three bottles exploded everywhere, ruining other items in my order and getting into my carpet at home where the box was laying all day.</li>
            <li> Leaked a little but in the bag.</li>
            <li> Denali is not very good either.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I&#x27;ve found it very hard to find Game day at any local stores anymore.  </li>
            <li> I hate that stores only seem to carry the Fiji stuff.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace the old-spice bodywash that I used to use regularly: Game day.  </li>
            <li> Game day just lasted longer, and kept me smelling clean/fresh longer.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s scarce, and ridiculously expensive when I&#x27;ve found it.  </li>
            <li> Too bad I bought three of these.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Old Spice has really come a long way with these body wash products. All fragrances are awesome. this matterhorn sent smells great it lathers up thick and rinses off well leaving you feeling super clean and smelling good. will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Smells good. I hate that stores only seem to carry the Fiji stuff. Will keep buying it.</li>
            <li> good smell, gets you clean.  I used to use their \\&quot;pure sport\\&quot; flavor but the deal on these is much better than what&#x27;s available, so I figured a change would be good.  The scent is similar, really, but slightly more minty/cologne-y, I guess.  The price on this pack of three is pretty good and with prime it&#x27;s a reasonable purchase.</li>
            <li> Not a big fan of Matterhorn.  Smells a bit like a mint toothpaste.  Too bad I bought three of these.  In the Fresh collection, I like the Zanzibar, and nothing else.  Denali is not very good either.</li>
            <li> It was in a bag, in a box. A little too simple. Leaked a little but in the bag.</li>
            <li> Old Spice Matterhorn Scent Body Wash, is another member in the Old Spice line of Body Washes.  I like the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; scent, as compared to Denali &amp; Fugi scents; which I find too strong for me.  Yet as reviewed by others, the scent is short lived, lasting three to four hours.  It is good for me as I shower morning and evening; for those that shower once a day; I suggest Denali.  I purchased a three pack for bit over eleven dollars, a great buy, as at the local drugstore I would only get two bottles.</li>
            <li> This is another totally different scent breaking from the line of Old Spice traditional scent. I like this one. It definitely has a more masculine scent than some of the other new ones, like Fiji for instance. It has a definite manly cologne scent to it, much richer in fragrance.  It still foams up quite well and the scent is in long lasting. It did leave me feeling refreshed and invigorated enough to write about it!</li>
            <li> Definitely the best smelling variety of the Old Spice Fresh Collection. I get a lot of compliments about the way I smell when I wear it, even from complete strangers.</li>
            <li> Have been using this body wash for years.  I smell good, but still haven&#x27;t gotten used to the horse that appears in my bathroom every morning while I&#x27;m showering.  He&#x27;s standing on a surfboard and wearing a tiny hat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my roommate thought I had a brick delivered when this box arrived.</li>
            <li> i couldn&#x27;t find in any store for some reason. only one i like.  i now hear target may have them.</li>
            <li> Great! Bought this for my boyfriend as a Christmas present be cause its discontinued in stores. He was happy so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t have this scent in all of the stores.  I like it a lot so I have to order it on Amazon.  It is a nice scent and my wife likes it a lot.</li>
            <li> I always love old spice deoderant and body wash. great smell at an awesome price from a really good brand.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great! The smell is not too strong and lasts on the skin for about 6-8 hours.  My wife loves the smell too and it is not the kind that lingers long after you leave the room.  I got a better price here than at the local big box stores.</li>
            <li> Smells like me, crazy cheap, have to hide it so other people don&#x27;t use it lol</li>
            <li> A great deal. Three bottles of body wash at a very reasonable price. I usually only get about two bottles like this at retail stores for the same price. I&#x27;m going to buy from here from now on.</li>
            <li> Exactly as ordered, on time with a great price!  Elicits more, &amp;#34;you smell great&amp;#34; comments than any wash I&#x27;ve used.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Two of the three bottles exploded everywhere, ruining other items in my order and getting into my carpet at home where the box was laying all day. There was no way I could return the item and so I had to eat the cost. Completely unnacceptable.</li>
            <li> Great deal wonderful smell, easy to use!</li>
            <li> By far my favorite scent from Old Spice. I&#x27;m so glad they&#x27;ve revamped their style to appeal to younger crowds!</li>
            <li> There are just too many competing for the coveted first place. I have had the good fortune to try several Body Washes, from different brands to different sizes. What I am looking for in particular, is the amount of lather I will be able to generate so I can get the maximum use of my very appreciated japanese wash towel, which is called Salux. I find that when the Body Wash soap plays along I am able to wash almost completely with one serving, even though it might be a generous one, and with the help of Salux seems to be mostly enough to wash entirely. These containers can be emptied rather quickly, and I prefer maximum lather which this Fresh Collection does not seem to provide. Besides that critical issue, this brand is like a lot of other body washes. At this stage I have yet to zero in on a particular brand, so I keep trying different ones.&lt;br /&gt;This soap leaves you feeling clean, is of average performance, and the price was borderline acceptable. I give it a 3.5 Star rating, for whatever it is worth.</li>
            <li> Product quality and the most timeless vintage image&lt;br /&gt;for real men, shame about the Old Spice product is not sold in France.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cordially&lt;br /&gt;Michel</li>
            <li> My Dad used Old Spice after-shave for years, but this isn&#x27;t my dad&#x27;s aftershave! Of all the body washes I&#x27;ve tried, this one does the best job of both washing AND giving an overall deodorant protection. I use the OS Fresh Matterhorn AP deodorant as well, but this gets the whole thing going the right direction for a lot of hours!</li>
            <li> Nice unique smell, that&#x27;s why I love Old Spice products!</li>
            <li> This stuff is very nice.  It smells great, and like a man. It rinses nice and clean without drying you out.  I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> If you want to smell awesome get this. I subscribe to a 3 pack every two months and it works out well. My taint and pits are sparkling bro!</li>
            <li> great product, smells great, all the ladies love it, and keeps you feeling clean and fresh. and the price is comparable to walmart</li>
            <li> Belief in your smelf!</li>
            <li> The best Old Spice has to offer!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace the old-spice bodywash that I used to use regularly: Game day.  Unfortunately I&#x27;ve found it very hard to find Game day at any local stores anymore.  Even online it&#x27;s scarce, and ridiculously expensive when I&#x27;ve found it.  So I read some reviews and decided to try Matterhorn.  It works good, has a nice, distinct smell to it, but not as good as Game Day.  Game day just lasted longer, and kept me smelling clean/fresh longer.</li>
            <li> Not the best scent out there, but that&#x27;s just my opinion. Product itself is excellent.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as an alternative to the Bath and Body Works products I normally buy my husband. He uses the Old Spice deodorant and I thought this would be a nice additive to that smell.  I don&#x27;t particularly care for the Matterhorn scent. There are other great scents in this line, but this is not one of them. The scent doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long either. I expect to be able to get a hint of the scent an hour or so after use, but I never smell it.  He also goes through this faster than the BBW products. The price of this is a little better, but when you factor in BBW sales and promotions this is something I will be passing on next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you are looking for a body was that works pretty well and want to buy everything off Amazon like I do, try this product in Denali, Fiji, or Zanzibar.  These scents are much better and last slightly longer.</li>
            <li> Many have mentioned a aroma but I do not fine such.  Just makes me feel clean and fresh</li>
            <li> probably the best smelling and refreshing body wash there is out there.  this a pretty good deal since usually one bottle sells for about $5.00 plus tax almost 6</li>
            <li> While this 3-pack was about $1 more a bottle, I cannot find the Matterhorn scented body wash in the store, so I turned to Amazon. As Matterhorn is my favorite Old Spice scent, it was well worth the extra. And with Amazon Prime I didn&#x27;t have to wait but a day (yes, technically it&#x27;s 2-day shipping, but I got mine the next day). Thanks Amazon for carrying this product. It&#x27;s a great scent, keeps your skin hydrated and fresh, and I use it for washing my hair. If this is your favorite Old Spice scent too, get it. And get the deodorant too. (My local store still carries the Matterhorn deodorant so I buy it there, but if yours doesn&#x27;t get it on Amazon.)</li>
            <li> Old Spice Fresh Collection Matterhorn Scent is an excellent product. Here in the war zone, oftentimes BAR soap just gets old. This product leave your body feeling fresh and with a pleasant after scent. I love it.</li>
            <li> Love the mild clean scent, it cleans all this stuff cleans.  This rinses well, smells good, what more do you want.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my husband. Smells awesome and at a good price. With free (and fast) shipping and no sales tax to accompany the purchase it&#x27;s an excellent value. Highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> Nice product!  Smells great.  My wife loves the smell of it as well.  I will keep buying it off of amazon if they keep selling it</li>
            <li> I feel ripped off.. They changed the product on me.  I feel totally ripped off and am done with Old Spice as well.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; body wash and it smells awesome! I was so depressed when they stopped selling it in stores near us , but I&#x27;m glad to see it here! It smells refreshing and manly instead of some weird cross between perfume and death like so many other male body washes. Highly recommend!</li>
