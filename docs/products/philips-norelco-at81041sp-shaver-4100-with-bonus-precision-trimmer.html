    <ol>
            <li> Lasted only 3 months and then the accu gave up :-(  I had bought phillips shavers before and lasted for many years without problems. DON&#x27;T BUY THIS SHAVER!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had an electric razor before. Because everyone says that they don&#x27;t compare when it comes to getting the closest shave. But I&#x27;ve never been able to get my chin this smooth before... But that might just be I&#x27;m not as skilled as those other guys.&lt;br /&gt;I love the product, the water proof feature makes life easier in the morning. Overall very happy</li>
            <li> Been working well for a couple months now. Very surprised by how good the battery life is</li>
            <li> Great razor! bu I am biased because I have been using Norelco razors for years. My only complaint would be that you can not use the razor with the cord attached like you use to be able to.</li>
            <li> I have used electric razors my entire life. This is the only one that I have constant, daily razor burn. DAILY.</li>
            <li> Wish it could charge while using it for those morning I forget to charge the night before, but few minutes charging is enough to get through a shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric razors for many years now, and have occasionally tried Braun and Remington models, but I keep coming back to Norelco. This one replaces a six year old unit which is no longer holding a charge well. Which is my one ongoing complaint about almost all rechargeable razors: They should make the battery pack replaceable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did compare this razor back to back with a model 3x more expensive from Remington, and the Norelco is still the better choice even at that big price gap.</li>
            <li> Works great, recharges in an hour as advertised -- what&#x27;s not to like? And I say that as a life-long razor guy.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my dad and talk to him often.  He loves this thing and purchased a second one for him to take on the road.  Would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> There is option with free trimmer for the same price, be sure to choose it... :) Everyone likes free stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers in the past and they lasted so long and shaved so smooth I just bought this one to replace my old stolen one.&lt;br /&gt;Big difference. This is the Aqua model which creased my neck and cheeks with long red creases that matched the angle of shaving. The razor burn was very painful and all over my face and neck. The burn was so bad hand lotion on the burn did not sooth but caused my skin to feel inflamed. Tried twice with the same results. The red marks and pain lasted several days.&lt;br /&gt;I returned this and Amazon prompley refunded my money. I was so sure this would be a pleasant experiance I threw away the box as soon as I got it, to my regret.&lt;br /&gt;I filled a claim with Phillips Norelco and the operator said someone would get back to me in 3-5 business days. They never called.</li>
            <li> Great razor so far, I just don&#x27;t like that you can&#x27;t use the power cord while shaving.  Since it is a wet/dry shaver, I understand the safety feature, but don&#x27;t like it!  I don&#x27;t use it with water.  Recommend a different model if this may be an issue for you as well.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.. was worried while ordering but its really good to use. Package came on-time and was packed well.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a gift. The shipping and everything went as expected. The receiver of gift loves it. I gives a soft shave without irritation and the bonus grooming clipper was great, too!</li>
            <li> The dry and wet use makes it great</li>
            <li> The shaver works smooth and silently. Its grip fits well in the hand. Not much impressed with the working of nasal hair accessory.</li>
            <li> I like Norelco, it is my third Wet/Dry Norelco. Battery of older one became too weak so I bought new one. but not very happy with new one.&lt;br /&gt;It works fine, when it was fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;my older models could be used with power connection, when battery was low.&lt;br /&gt;This new model is not working with power connection, I have to wait about 30 min and it will be charged to workable level.&lt;br /&gt;but in the morning, I do not have 30 min to wait for shaving,</li>
            <li> Works well except if my husband goes too long without shaving, then it pulls hairs. But he really likes it.</li>
            <li> I use this to shave my head every other day. Gives a nice clean shave and has a long lasting battery.</li>
            <li> works better than my old one i paid twice as much for. especially under the chin and side of neck areas, where old one had trouble.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Norelco \\&quot;rotary\\&quot; razors/shavers for decades. This is by far the best one I&#x27;ve owned. I won&#x27;t go all the way back, but when my first [[ASIN:B0009ZGK5K Philips Norelco 6844XL Reflex Plus Electric Rechargeable Shaver]] at the \\&quot;cabin\\&quot; gave out back in 2011, just after six years, I bought a [[ASIN:B001AJ6YS2 Philips Norelco 7310 Men&#x27;s Shaving System]] (certainly an upgrade) for home &amp; moved the other 6844XL to the cabin. I did not even look into another model. And when that Norelco went \\&quot;belly up,\\&quot; I bought one of these 4100&#x27;s and moved the 7310 to the cabin. No complaints! They consistently seem to get better, although I&#x27;ve always been satisfied. Each model upgrade seems to have provided the closest shave of the Norelco&#x27;s that I&#x27;ve owned. Like the others, this one is cordless and rechargeable. It is quiet. It is very light. It is washable. It charges internationally. It holds a charge usually for about a month with daily use. It has a nice price tag! This one had the Bonus Precision Trimmer, which is very nice in-between barber visits. The package has all the ++++&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Good product. Cuts close but I have to shave daily to keep clean. Charge is great!!! 1 hour charge and I still have not recharged it.</li>
            <li> Good quality very happy</li>
    </ol>
