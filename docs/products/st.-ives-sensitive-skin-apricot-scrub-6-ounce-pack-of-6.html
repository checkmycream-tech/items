            <li>I&#x27;m so happy that I&#x27;ve found it on amazon :</li>
            <li>It works great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good item, but I&#x27;m used to the EXFOLIATING or the RENEW scrub.  </li>
            <li>Good product for the price,</li>
            <li>I love this product and was so happy to find it being sold in bulk</li>
            <li>I love the smell of it and it works great.</li>

            <li>This scrub is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several face scrub, but St. Ives Apricot Scrub is the best.</li>
            <li>Works even better than the costly product</li>
            <li>St Ives produts suit most people</li>
            <li>This worked better than the scrub item that I had for my feet.</li>
            <li>Love this scrub don&#x27;t know why st ives discontinued it</li>
            <li>Okay, so I&#x27;m a guy...</li>
            <li>This latest batch is runnier that what I&#x27;ve always had.  </li>
            <li>Ths reason for the 4 stars is because the latest shipment of product is runnier than before.  </li>
            <li>I use it every morning in the shower and my makeup goes on a lot more evenly once I&#x27;ve exfoliated with it.  </li>
            <li>Excellent facial cleanser</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Love St. Ives products.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to wash in a circular motion and rise your face thoroughly after.</li>
            <li>I also use their cream on my face and love it :-)</li>
            <li>so does not have too many of the scrubbing material inside.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the new scent, but this brand name item is the best out there.  </li>
            <li>size of these scrubbing particles in this formula is perfect for those with dry skin in the winter.</li>
            <li>I use this as a cheaper, and TBH a BETTER, alternative to Bliss&#x27;s Fabulous Foaming Face-wash.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product works great for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>They have some very wonderful products and I recommend them highly for people, but the sensitive version is the one I prefer.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my face smooth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great basic scrub that is inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so smooth after I use this.</li>
            <li>I agree with someone else saying this is not as good as the one not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars only because I really loved the original product when my skin was in better shape.  </li>
            <li>It makes your face smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>This is a great scrub and I&#x27;m going to keep buying it as long as St. Ives is making it.  </li>
            <li>I am loving this inexpensive new regimen.</li>
            <li>I use this scrub to clean my face, neck, body and my feet.</li>
            <li>I went to the supermarket to buy the other one, huge difference, original one does exfoliate your skin very nicely.    </li>
            <li>It was very well packed and allowed me to take this item safely by flight without risk of spilling on the clothes.</li>
            <li>Was so lucky to find it</li>
            <li>And the scent is not as nice as the regular non-sensitive skin scrub.</li>
            <li>so I switched to the gentle sensitive kind.  </li>
            <li>Received quickly and exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I used to use the original scrub where you could really feel the ground apricot pits.</li>
            <li>the subscribe and save option is awesome and the gentle scrub is just rough enough to exfoliate but not feel like my skin is tearing apart.  </li>
            <li>I used this Gentle product everyday and have great results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not looking to break my skin, just to slough off enough dry skin and get rid of dirt, which this formula does beautifully, leaving my skin supple and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m older and my skin is much more sensitive</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Use it more than they say you should -- daily.  </li>
            <li>My skin was incredibly smooth and soft after using.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much better than their regular apricot scrub.  </li>
            <li>but yet it really is good on sensitive and dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this product has been my favorite thus far</li>
            <li>This Sensitive version of St Ives apricot scrub is so beautifully fine and gentle on the skin and is not perfumed.  </li>
            <li>Had been using another,far more expensive, exfoliant with pretty good results.</li>
            <li>I have been using this scrub (sensitive skin, original, and the acne varieties) for over 10 years now.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you can&#x27;t use the other one first before trying this one out.</li>
            <li>Only thing is when I received the box, one of the bottles was cracked open on the seem and all over the place, should think about packing them better!</li>
            <li>It is really gentile with your skin.</li>
            <li>Thought I would try the St.Ives Gentle Apricot Scrub,mainly because of the lower price.</li>
            <li>My skin is much smoother and my face glows.</li>
            <li>It smells like baby powder, which I really don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>It really is gentle.</li>
            <li>and this really helps to exfoliate but is gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>I should have read the product label more carefully but now I cannot return it.  </li>
            <li>St Ives has many products for skin, but their apricot scrubs really work for little money.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, which is why I always choose the gentle version, but I guess that&#x27;s gone now forever</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than drug store but for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>but I prefer more beads to take off that dead layer of skin.</li>
            <li>and I can use it more often because it&#x27;s not as harsh.  </li>
            <li>Gives a finer texture to the skin because the granules are smaller in diameter than the fresh skin version of St. Ives.  </li>
            <li>You can still feel the ground pits (if that&#x27;s what they still use,) has no overpowering perfume, and removes dead skin while refreshing your face.  </li>
            <li>or I have little breakouts, but overall it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Why couldn&#x27;t they have just added a new product?</li>
            <li>My guess is that the new version is cheaper to manufacture in some way(s).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy this unless you have VERY, VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Use it very frequently.  </li>
            <li>My skin is clear and soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 45 years old while writing this review...</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>because Target had discontinued stocking this particular formula and only had the regular.</li>
            <li>Instead they should have used the Sensitive to replace the regular.</li>
            <li>have extremely sensitive skin and the regular version</li>
            <li>It is gentle enough for daily use unlike the regular Apricot Scrub.  </li>
            <li>It seems to do the job of the regular apricot scrub without the general harshness of it!</li>
            <li>the size is a lil small than what i thought or what i am using right now     would buy again</li>

            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this unless you have VERY, VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Use it very frequently.  </li>
            <li> My skin is clear and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 45 years old while writing this review...</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> because Target had discontinued stocking this particular formula and only had the regular.</li>
            <li> Instead they should have used the Sensitive to replace the regular.</li>
            <li> have extremely sensitive skin and the regular version</li>
            <li> It is gentle enough for daily use unlike the regular Apricot Scrub.  </li>
            <li> It seems to do the job of the regular apricot scrub without the general harshness of it!</li>
            <li> the size is a lil small than what i thought or what i am using right now     would buy again</li>
            <li> Initially I used this scrub every day but, over several months, my skin began to feel a bit too dry</li>
            <li> The scent is very strong, very pungent now...very bad!</li>
            <li> This GENTLE scrub has much less beads in the solution so it exfoliates less.  </li>
            <li> I used the regular apricot scrub but turned to the gentle one after wondering if the product was to harsh on my skin on an everyday basis.</li>
            <li> I was starting to develop a few milia (you know those tiny bumps on your face</li>
            <li> Usually use the one for acne, but this one is sensitive and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> understand other reviewers complaining that the beads are way too small to make a difference, but they are probably looking for the regular formula, which I find a bit harsher and the beads are much bigger and abrasive.</li>
            <li> Just as expected.  </li>
            <li> There is a lot of rough scrub in it</li>
            <li> It scrubs off just enough dead skin cells without drying or being too abrasive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used the sensitive skin apricot scrub for a number of years and, alas, cannot find it locally.  </li>
            <li> so I now use it every other day.</li>
            <li> I use this scrub every other night.</li>
            <li> Forget the other wannabes and stick with this brand.</li>
            <li> but I look at least 10 years younger.  </li>
            <li> I even have got compliments on my skin in less than a week....</li>
            <li> Has been discontinued by the American manufacturer so very hard to find.  </li>
            <li> My body looks so refreshed with all the dead skin gone.</li>
            <li> I like the St. Ives face scrubs - use them everyday</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use it everyday</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday.  </li>
            <li> The little beads they use instead of ground-up apricot pits in this one hardly does a thing for me.</li>
            <li> Afraid in these economic times companies are cutting back.  </li>
            <li> but this isn&#x27;t a bad deal.</li>
            <li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>

            <li> I have tried several face scrub, but St. Ives Apricot Scrub is the best. Awesome scrub featuring a nice fragrance. It is really gentile with your skin.</li>

            <li> I agree with someone else saying this is not as good as the one not for sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve been giving away the tubes I got on this 6 pack. I went to the supermarket to buy the other one, huge difference, original one does exfoliate your skin very nicely.    Make sure you can&#x27;t use the other one first before trying this one out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good item, but I&#x27;m used to the EXFOLIATING or the RENEW scrub.  This GENTLE scrub has much less beads in the solution so it exfoliates less.  Good product for the price, but I prefer more beads to take off that dead layer of skin.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent cleanser that leaves your skin feeling refreshed.  it can be used every day.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product.  the subscribe and save option is awesome and the gentle scrub is just rough enough to exfoliate but not feel like my skin is tearing apart.  Would highly recommend</li>
            <li> NOTHING LIKE WHAT IT USED TO BE. They changed the scent and they increased the coarseness. The scent is very strong, very pungent now...very bad! I have very sensitive skin, which is why I always choose the gentle version, but I guess that&#x27;s gone now forever and I&#x27;m stuck with SIX tubes of sticky, \\&quot;less-than-gentle\\&quot; facial scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spoke to St. Ives and they said, \\&quot;It&#x27;s what the FOCUS GROUP liked.\\&quot; Good for them! They can keep it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why couldn&#x27;t they have just added a new product? Calling it the same thing is deliberate misrepresentation. You cannot change a product people have been enjoying for years! My guess is that the new version is cheaper to manufacture in some way(s).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry... I cannot pussy-foot around the truth.</li>
            <li> I was starting to develop a few milia (you know those tiny bumps on your face and if you scratch them there&#x27;s like a tiny grain of sand inside?). Had been using another,far more expensive, exfoliant with pretty good results. Thought I would try the St.Ives Gentle Apricot Scrub,mainly because of the lower price. Works even better than the costly product and I can use it more often because it&#x27;s not as harsh.  Initially I used this scrub every day but, over several months, my skin began to feel a bit too dry so I now use it every other day. Great product! My skin is much smoother and my face glows.</li>
            <li> I use this scrub every other night. It makes your face smooth and clean. I have been using it about two years.</li>
            <li> I personally use this product from the stores. I was going back to India and decided to buy several multipacks for my family and friends. It was very well packed and allowed me to take this item safely by flight without risk of spilling on the clothes. St Ives produts suit most people i know and they all were very happy using it . There were no side effects on skin to anyone i know. Its a very good gift item for someone who has not tried it yet.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this unless you have VERY, VERY sensitive skin. The little beads they use instead of ground-up apricot pits in this one hardly does a thing for me. And the scent is not as nice as the regular non-sensitive skin scrub. It smells like baby powder, which I really don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> I use to use this products some years ago and it worked great. Don&#x27;t know why I stop using it. I went to another product that was more expensive. However I went back to this product a week ago. I purchased it from Walmart for 3.00 a tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It has worked great I use this scrub to clean my face, neck, body and my feet. This worked better than the scrub item that I had for my feet. I am telling you soak your feet and use this with a pumice stone and you will be amazed. I use Cetaphil lotion as the moisturizer  for my face, body and feet.  I am loving this inexpensive new regimen. I am telling you it works. My body looks so refreshed with all the dead skin gone. I even have got compliments on my skin in less than a week....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to buy the six tubes on Amazon because it will save me a couple of dollars from Walmart price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am purchasing this not because it is inexpensive but I am purchasing it because it works......</li>
            <li> Received promptly.  Just as expected.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  There is a lot of rough scrub in it but yet it really is good on sensitive and dry skin.  Which I have both of.  I don&#x27;t see myself changing from this product anytime soon.  Probably a lifer on this one.</li>
            <li> Love this scrub don&#x27;t know why st ives discontinued it</li>
            <li> Okay, so I&#x27;m a guy... but yes, once a week I scrub my face with St Ives Swiss Formula Apricot Scrub.  I have gone through this ritual for about 20 years now.  I&#x27;m not crazy about the new scent, but this brand name item is the best out there.  (I&#x27;ve used the generic).  I&#x27;m 45 years old while writing this review... but I look at least 10 years younger.  Is it because of St Ives or is it genetic?  I&#x27;ll never know... but I&#x27;m going to continue to use this product until I die.  Keeps my face smooth (makes it easier to shave with an electric) and keeps my pores open.  That&#x27;s about all I ever wanted to use this for and I believe it serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> I have always like this scrub and still do.  Use it very frequently.  Use it more than they say you should -- daily.  Gives a finer texture to the skin because the granules are smaller in diameter than the fresh skin version of St. Ives.  I use 3 St Ives products.  I couldn&#x27;t find this in any store and my fear is that they change the formula when they change the tube packaging.  This latest batch is runnier that what I&#x27;ve always had.  When I open the tube it runs out on my hand.  Before I had to squeeze it.  Afraid in these economic times companies are cutting back.  Hope St Ives continues to make this one.  Some people complain that it doesn&#x27;t scrub enough.  I use the coarser scrub twice a week and this one almost every day.  Have for years.  People ask about my skin.  This is it!  Ths reason for the 4 stars is because the latest shipment of product is runnier than before.  But I&#x27;ll use every spec of it up.</li>
            <li> I have been using this scrub (sensitive skin, original, and the acne varieties) for over 10 years now.  It&#x27;s a great basic scrub that is inexpensive.  I use it every morning in the shower and my makeup goes on a lot more evenly once I&#x27;ve exfoliated with it.  My best friend tried it out when she stayed over my place and has been using it ever since as well.  Even my boyfriend loves it and says that it prevents ingrown hairs on his face and neck from shaving.  This is a great scrub and I&#x27;m going to keep buying it as long as St. Ives is making it.  Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> was shipped promptly and was packed properly    the size is a lil small than what i thought or what i am using right now     would buy again</li>
            <li> Excellent facial cleanser; I would not want to be without this.</li>
            <li> I like the St. Ives face scrubs - use them everyday</li>
            <li> I like this product, I exfoliate twice a week. I can&#x27;t use it everyday or I have little breakouts, but overall it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Has been discontinued by the American manufacturer so very hard to find.  Was so lucky to find it here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Ocean Discount.</li>
            <li> St Ives has many products for skin, but their apricot scrubs really work for little money.  I used to use the original scrub where you could really feel the ground apricot pits. My skin was incredibly smooth and soft after using.  I&#x27;m older and my skin is much more sensitive so I switched to the gentle sensitive kind.  It really is gentle. You can still feel the ground pits (if that&#x27;s what they still use,) has no overpowering perfume, and removes dead skin while refreshing your face.  I gave it 4 stars only because I really loved the original product when my skin was in better shape.  I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I have sensitive skin and this really helps to exfoliate but is gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> Love St. Ives products.  Usually use the one for acne, but this one is sensitive and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  Only thing is when I received the box, one of the bottles was cracked open on the seem and all over the place, should think about packing them better!</li>
            <li> this is the only facial product that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin irritated. I have very sensitive skin and this product has been my favorite thus far</li>
            <li> This Sensitive version of St Ives apricot scrub is so beautifully fine and gentle on the skin and is not perfumed.  It&#x27;s so much better than their regular apricot scrub.  Now I hear they&#x27;ve cancelled it, stopped making it.  Instead they should have used the Sensitive to replace the regular.</li>
            <li> I love this product and was so happy to find it being sold in bulk because Target had discontinued stocking this particular formula and only had the regular. I use this as a cheaper, and TBH a BETTER, alternative to Bliss&#x27;s Fabulous Foaming Face-wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size of these scrubbing particles in this formula is perfect for those with dry skin in the winter. It scrubs off just enough dead skin cells without drying or being too abrasive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand other reviewers complaining that the beads are way too small to make a difference, but they are probably looking for the regular formula, which I find a bit harsher and the beads are much bigger and abrasive. I&#x27;m not looking to break my skin, just to slough off enough dry skin and get rid of dirt, which this formula does beautifully, leaving my skin supple and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is inoffensive and the formula does not leave a residue on the skin. Be sure to wash in a circular motion and rise your face thoroughly after. Follow up with toner and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Stores in my town stopped carrying this and I was so happy they had it on here. This product works great for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have used the sensitive skin apricot scrub for a number of years and, alas, cannot find it locally.  I&#x27;m so happy that I&#x27;ve found it on amazon :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely sensitive skin and the regular version makes me break out.  They have some very wonderful products and I recommend them highly for people, but the sensitive version is the one I prefer.  I also use their cream on my face and love it :-)</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday.  It was recommended by a plastic surgeon because I was getting bumps under my skin on my forehead.  It works great</li>
            <li> Received quickly and exactly as described. Great!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of it and it works great. I&#x27;ve found it cheaper in stores (plus no shipping and handling) but this isn&#x27;t a bad deal. I also use a lotion after using this, but I would suggest it to anyone who asked.</li>
            <li> I should have read the product label more carefully but now I cannot return it.  Much cheaper than drug store but for sensitive skin so does not have too many of the scrubbing material inside.</li>
            <li> This scrub is amazing.  Forget the other wannabes and stick with this brand. My skin is so smooth after I use this. I keep it in my shower and exfoliate twice per week.</li>
            <li> We use this facial scrub daily.  It is gentle enough for daily use unlike the regular Apricot Scrub.  You only need a dab about the size of a nickel for your face.</li>
