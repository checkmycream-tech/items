            <li>Nevertheless, they fulfill my weekly pill storage needs perfectly.  </li>
            <li>These are perfect.</li>
            <li>Awesome!  </li>
            <li>The concept is perfect but struggling with the stacks makes this product not work for me.</li>
            <li>After I broke my arm and was having difficulty opening and closing safety-capped bottles, I was looking for a stacking pill tower like my grandmother used to have, and this one is perfect.</li>
            <li>Best pill travel container I have found.</li>
            <li>Great deal and works great.</li>
            <li>good at a fair price!</li>
            <li>These are very nice to put your vitamins in to keep the moisture out of your vitamins.</li>
            <li>Not the best quality, pieces aren&#x27;t smooth and well-fitting, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Good news though</li>
            <li>these are great if you make your own DIY lipstick ....</li>
            <li>but i am required to type more in order to submit a review... that is it!</li>
            <li>Bright, cheerful colors and practical to boot!</li>
            <li>Although this is the perfect size I struggle screwing these together straight.  </li>
            <li>Perfect to hold my medications; arrived very well packaged.</li>
            <li>I had another kind that would let in the moisture and the vitamins would either be soggy or stuck together.</li>
            <li>I set a timer after taking the contents of each compartment and this item makes it very easy to space out my supplements at 7 even intervals.</li>
            <li>These are the best pill holders, but what made this one SO much better is the fact that they come with all the extra lids!  </li>
            <li>I am enjoying these cases.</li>
            <li>My wife likes this product better than anything she has used before.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li>Very good buy especially for price.</li>
            <li>The pill reminder is pretty nice.</li>
            <li>The extra lids are a great help.</li>
            <li>I travel with them filled</li>
            <li>They need to go back to the drawing board, great concept just faulty plastic.</li>
            <li>Cheap material cannot handle the stress of them screwing together.</li>
            <li>The lids seal nicely and hold enough pills for 2 weeeks of travel.</li>
            <li>They do look like they would fall right</li>
            <li>These clear, colorful compartments hold more capsules/tablets than those of most other pill organizers, making it easy for me to do so.  </li>
            <li>This item was very overpriced!  </li>
            <li>yes, this is not the kind of container you can expect to withstand impact or rough handling.</li>
            <li>I love these with all of the extra lids!  </li>
            <li>These are perfect if you don&#x27;t want to use those pesky week long pill boxes, especially if you only need for a couple days.</li>
            <li>The extra lids also makes it easy to take 1 or 2 compartments with me when I have to be away from home for several hours.</li>
            <li>and I like to space them out 7 times a day during my waking hours, instead of taking large doses or everything at once, especially vitamin C.</li>
            <li>I really like these stackable cases and this was an additional purchase for keeping daily vitamins in.</li>
            <li>The only thing about these cases is they need gentle treatment as the threads to screw them together can sometimes be stubborn.</li>
            <li>The extra lids makes this set a real winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;And since the set comes with an extra lids, I&#x27;d really recommend you go ahead and buy 2 sets while you can.  </li>
            <li>and I am familiar with the occasional difficulty in screwing these individual containers together and the relative delicacy of the plastic.  </li>
            <li>Certainly long enough to get your money&#x27;s worth outta</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m going out for the night, I can use one of the extra lids to take a single day&#x27;s worth in my pocket or my purse.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are still that easily cracked plastic, but with a little care they can last several years.  </li>
            <li>day&#x27;s container fits my regular nighttime collection of meds, including 4 large oblong tablets, 2 medium round pills, and 2 large fish oil gels.</li>
            <li>containers are the larger size so can hold several of the larger horse-choker type pills or a combination of large and small.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got addicted to collecting this type, to the point that I have too many and have now decided I want to collect them in cases instead</li>
            <li>The only real issue is that the plastic breaks down after awhile and becomes brittle causing breakage around the threads where the pieces screw together.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I have used a similar item before and I am familiar with the occasional difficulty in screwing these individual containers together and the relative delicacy of the plastic.  Nevertheless, they fulfill my weekly pill storage needs perfectly.  Then, why not five stars?  I specifically ordered this product because it advertised six extra lids.  That was the specific attraction, but when the item arrived, NO EXTRA LIDS.  Disappointing and very annoying.  I am forced to give this vender a poor rating for compliance with their advertising.</li>
            <li> I wanted something to take my vitamins in each day to have with my lunch. These are perfect. I can fill each one at the beg of the week, each has a lid and throw one in my lunch bag or purse each day. I wanted the extra lids for just this reason. It does come with day of the week labels; I didn&#x27;t put them on.</li>
            <li> Not the best quality, pieces aren&#x27;t smooth and well-fitting, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Awesome!  Great deal and works great.</li>
            <li> I take a lot of supplements and I like to space them out 7 times a day during my waking hours, instead of taking large doses or everything at once, especially vitamin C. These clear, colorful compartments hold more capsules/tablets than those of most other pill organizers, making it easy for me to do so.  I set a timer after taking the contents of each compartment and this item makes it very easy to space out my supplements at 7 even intervals. The extra lids also makes it easy to take 1 or 2 compartments with me when I have to be away from home for several hours.</li>
            <li> I got addicted to collecting this type, to the point that I have too many and have now decided I want to collect them in cases instead lol.&lt;br /&gt;These have served we well throughout the years. The only problem I have is when I accidently step on the cover.. I get so danged mad at myself. Good news though, it has a few extra lids with the set.</li>
            <li> The pill reminder is pretty nice. This is the second one I have had. It holds all of the pills I need to take. The only real issue is that the plastic breaks down after awhile and becomes brittle causing breakage around the threads where the pieces screw together. But, my last one did last me close to 7years.</li>
            <li> I had this type of container already.  I like it because the lids don&#x27;t come off unless you want them to.  No pills spilling out.  The extra lids are a great help.</li>
            <li> I really like these stackable cases and this was an additional purchase for keeping daily vitamins in. I wanted the extra lids to accommodate separating a few cases for traveling. The only thing about these cases is they need gentle treatment as the threads to screw them together can sometimes be stubborn.</li>
            <li> The extra lids makes this set a real winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The containers are the larger size so can hold several of the larger horse-choker type pills or a combination of large and small.&lt;br /&gt;They are still that easily cracked plastic, but with a little care they can last several years.  Certainly long enough to get your money&#x27;s worth outta them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I travel with them filled, I seal them in a plastic snack bag so if they pop open all the pills will be contained in the bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And since the set comes with an extra lids, I&#x27;d really recommend you go ahead and buy 2 sets while you can.  I&#x27;m always after a &amp;#34;good buy&amp;#34; and this is definitely one for me.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of getting the one without the extra lids, so I order this.  I ended up using them both!</li>
            <li> these are great if you make your own DIY lipstick .... but they sell them at the dollar tree too ....</li>
            <li> These are the best pill holders, but what made this one SO much better is the fact that they come with all the extra lids!  This extends the usability of the holders quite a bit.</li>
            <li> a little too small for our purposes.... will order the larger set</li>
            <li> not much more to say but i am required to type more in order to submit a review... that is it!</li>
            <li> For what it is, it does the job well.  For daily use, they will wear out (the threads on the lids will eventually break down).</li>
            <li> I had these only 1 week when they started cracking.  The plastic was breaking off in pieces inside where my meds were.  They need to go back to the drawing board, great concept just faulty plastic.</li>
            <li> Holds pills,easy to see and use</li>
            <li> Although this is the perfect size I struggle screwing these together straight.  It seems a bit hard and unforgiving.  The concept is perfect but struggling with the stacks makes this product not work for me.</li>
            <li> This item was very overpriced!  I found it without the extra lids at the Dollar Tree.  Otherwise, it is a convenient and helpful item.</li>
            <li> After I broke my arm and was having difficulty opening and closing safety-capped bottles, I was looking for a stacking pill tower like my grandmother used to have, and this one is perfect. Bright, cheerful colors and practical to boot! I lay out my pills for the week which saves me a lot of time and energy after a long day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each day&#x27;s container fits my regular nighttime collection of meds, including 4 large oblong tablets, 2 medium round pills, and 2 large fish oil gels. That is about the max it can hold, however, so morning pills are done separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not use the day stickers following other tips left here. They do look like they would fall right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding negative reviews on cracking -- yes, this is not the kind of container you can expect to withstand impact or rough handling. The plastic threads will strip if you turn it too tightly, and it could crack if you drop it, just like every other pill container of a similar make. I keep mine in a drawer. Take it out to take my pills, and then put it back in the drawer. If I&#x27;m going out for the night, I can use one of the extra lids to take a single day&#x27;s worth in my pocket or my purse. I&#x27;ve used it this way for a few months without issue.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying these cases. I am very forgetful so they help me know what I took and what I did not take. I use them individually. On Sunday I set up for the week so I just have to grab an go. Very good buy especially for price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually review either way but I&#x27;m VERY unhappy with the pill containers. The threading cracked within days of purchase. I bought one extra in case something happened to one of the ocontainers but they both broke. Cheap material cannot handle the stress of them screwing together. So now they don&#x27;t stay together an are useless. I would return them if I could...but I threw away the packaging.</li>
            <li> I love these with all of the extra lids!  Had some already from Walgreens and these are interchangeable with those, but only had 2 lids.  These are perfect if you don&#x27;t want to use those pesky week long pill boxes, especially if you only need for a couple days.</li>
            <li> very small , thought that they were bigger. Extra lids do not fit all of the containers very hard to keep together</li>
            <li> Best pill travel container I have found. It has  never opened and spilled into my toilet kit. The lids seal nicely and hold enough pills for 2 weeeks of travel. (I take 5 medications a day). It can easily be broken down into seven separate little containers with the extra supplied lids.</li>
            <li> Perfect to hold my medications; arrived very well packaged.</li>
            <li> These are very nice to put your vitamins in to keep the moisture out of your vitamins. I had another kind that would let in the moisture and the vitamins would either be soggy or stuck together. The stackable pill holder is sealed where moisture can&#x27;t get in.</li>
            <li> good at a fair price!</li>
            <li> My wife likes this product better than anything she has used before.&lt;br /&gt;She also likes the extra lid, so she can take one days stackable with her if need be.</li>
            <li> I used it before. Like it.</li>
