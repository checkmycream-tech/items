    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Smelled awesome though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Batiste seems to work the best and is inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Smells awesome too.</li>
            <li>I have been very impressed and have continued to use it.</li>
            <li>Best thing to do is to try it (maybe with friends w/ oily hair) and decide for yourselves.</li>
            <li>I figured this would be the perfect solution</li>
            <li>LOVE!!!  </li>
            <li>it smells just like their hairspray, which in my opinion isn&#x27;t too great to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>Great price too.</li>
            <li>but I have had no problem with the minis or the product and it has been a great solution for not over washing my hair.</li>
            <li>I have gotten tons of compliments on my hair while using this product as well and people commenting on how great I smell,</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re nervous about it you can even put it on before bed and let it soak up oils overnight which is great too.</li>
            <li>Works way better!!</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>Suave is much better and Batiste is the best.</li>
            <li>and my hair looks good all</li>
            <li>so i thought this would be good.  </li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t even smell good -</li>
            <li>I have been using baby powder for years and the Tresemme citrus smells so great, what a nice \\&quot;extra-extra\\&quot; bonus.  </li>
            <li>made my hair smell good  2.  </li>
            <li>If you want to try it, I suggest you do it when you have time to follow up with a good washing of your hair.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>It does have a better smell than others, like Pssssssssst!  </li>
            <li>I got to try the product a couple of times and now this one is not working any more either!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>It works amazing.  </li>
            <li>I did use up the bottle I bought, but would never buy this kind again.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be nice to re-fresh my hair on the days when I don&#x27;t wash it, but</li>
            <li>It kind of felt like I had rubbed clay through my hair.</li>
            <li>my hair appeared healthier in the mirror  (nice shine to it)  3.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I kind of let my hair do its own thing</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>The smell is quite strong but it&#x27;s probably good if your hair smells.  </li>
            <li>I thought Fresh Start would be great for those mornings when I have to rush out the door and don&#x27;t have time to wash my hair.</li>
            <li>Love love love this stuff!</li>
            <li>My hair smelled fine to begin with!</li>
            <li>You can find a more in depth review that I&#x27;ve done of these on their amazon product</li>
            <li>I should have known better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than nothing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>I think with this product the more you use, the ickier your hair will feel.</li>
            <li>Even powder would be better, in my opinion.     </li>
            <li>Save your money, or go spend more on a quality product.</li>
            <li>I did try it, but I still like the Bastiste brand better  </li>
            <li>I have used this product many times.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>but I have tried others that work much better.</li>
            <li>Baby powder works way better than this product.</li>
            <li>, I think it&#x27;s more of an issue with my scalp&#x27;s tendency to have dandruff and not the clays.    </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>The cheap price caught my eye!  </li>
            <li>I read the directions on the bottle and followed them and the results were just okay.</li>
            <li>but it was better than before.</li>
            <li>You would be better off rubbing butter and baby powder in your hair.</li>
            <li>I saw the ads for this and thought it would be a nice alternative, more readily available and cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I</li>
            <li>did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is SO much better than I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Oh boy, am I glad I did.</li>
            <li>but mostly it just dries out your hair.</li>
            <li>You will smell like a gallon of chemicals all day, and no matter how awesome someone&#x27;s hair looks I won&#x27;t notice if I&#x27;m getting a headache standing ten feet away from them.  </li>
            <li>I had good success with the Got2b Rock Encore one and also the Salon Grafix brand Walgreens carries.  </li>
            <li>Batiste has a much much better product.</li>
            <li>all it did everytime was make my hair more greasy.</li>
            <li>It looks like zits - which is lovely, but it&#x27;s a rash.  </li>
            <li>gives you a lovely gray-headed look</li>
            <li>I love the idea, but it doesn&#x27;t deliver...</li>
            <li>I. Love.</li>
            <li>It is just a bottle of more oil and grease in a bottle.</li>
            <li>Maybe that one will work better.</li>
            <li>love this stuff and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>Also be sure you&#x27;re holding the can almost an as length away.</li>
            <li>I follow the directions it makes my hair MORE oily.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Update:  The Batiste line works much better</li>
            <li>Way better than this stuff ever did.</li>
            <li>I had to dump baby powder on top just to salvage it before I went out.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried using more.</li>
            <li>My hair looks relatively okay (</li>
            <li>It does work okay on my hair...making it appear fresher and giving it a nice clean scent.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m one of those who keeps a very clean brush...</li>
            <li>I have very oily hair, and I look good with bangs</li>
            <li>The best way to go about it is to use a little at a time and apply more if needed.  </li>
            <li>When I want to put up my freshly clean hair it holds better.</li>
            <li>easy to use  CONS:  </li>
            <li>This product is really great if you use it properly and trust me once you get used to it you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>it would be an easy 4.</li>
            <li>That being said, I have fine hair that gets greasy very quickly.</li>
            <li>They should say that this product is not for fine hair, and that you should test it on your skin before trying.    </li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t have to have the hassle of drying and my hair is just fine.</li>
            <li>I quickly found that even though I showered and washed my hair every night, by morning my hair was somewhat oily and needed refreshing.</li>
            <li>Huge mistake.</li>
            <li>Plus, this one smells fantastic.     </li>
            <li>I have no problems with this product that sound as nightmarish as everyone else&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>My hair has a ton of volume and it smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately for me, I am thrilled this much cheaper product works well with my hair.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to see that Tresemme was making one that they sold in stores.  </li>
            <li>This stuff makes your hair LOOK clean, but it feels even greasier.</li>
            <li>It looked clean</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t leave my feeling entirely clean like after a wash</li>
            <li>I found that my hair&#x27;s greasy spots looked clean, and made me feel cleaner because it looked fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair appeared clean and almost bouncy.</li>
            <li>I clean the hair out of it every time I use it and wash it thoroughly often.  </li>
            <li>I can tell you that this one is certainly &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; but there are better products out there.  </li>
            <li>It would look good right after styling, but after a few hours of wear, my hair looked oily again and needed refreshing once more.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if the Refreshing Mist is completely necessary, but it&#x27;s a nice touch to add the fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be a great solution, but it&#x27;s the exact opposite!</li>
            <li>, it comes out full blast</li>
            <li>, I brush it forward, I brush it to the side, just so it will get evenly coated throughout the whole top of my head.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really cool</li>
            <li>And I never do that with full product.</li>
            <li>And it didn&#x27;t even make my hair look clean &amp; fresh.</li>
            <li>My hair literally looks clean and fresh, as if I was on day 1 rather than day 2.</li>
            <li>I figured anything is worth a shot once, but I love this product so much that I&#x27;m looking for a site that will sell it by the case.</li>
            <li>It still doesn&#x27;t look like freshly showered hair, but there is a good enough difference.</li>
            <li>When sprayed lightly, it dries up oils and refreshes the hair at first.</li>
            <li>I was expecting something that would absorb oil, and remove any odor, and generally make my hair feel nice.</li>
            <li>Perfect, due to a busy schedule, plus it was cheaper than the price(s) at a brick and mortar store which has worldwide stores.</li>
            <li>was on the hunt for another good dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>I thought hey, tresemme is supposed to have a good dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>and they both worked 10x better and didn&#x27;t have such a strong scent.</li>
            <li>It gives an odd dry kind of feeling but if it allows me to not wash my hair every day, then I&#x27;m good with that!  </li>
            <li>My hair is brown, mostly straight and quite fine</li>
            <li>No product is worth that.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ever going back.  </li>
            <li>and I think that might be worth trying.</li>
            <li>I saw the Tresemme one on sale, and thought it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>A lot of times I&#x27;ll use it before putting my hair up, and it looks like I have 3x the hair and looks perfectly fresh.  </li>
            <li>my hair felt heavier - so more flat because it&#x27;s fine - and dirtier.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, cannot say enough about this wonderful product from Tresemme.</li>
            <li>One other reviewer gave it a good score after blow drying</li>
            <li>That is what I look like right now.</li>
            <li>that was right</li>
            <li>I am at work right now.  </li>
            <li>I paired it with the Fresh Start Refreshing Mist, and it really does help to remove the smell of day old</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has been 8 hours and my hair still looks pretty fresh (as if I washed it 8 hours ago).</li>
            <li>I waited about 2 minutes for it to dry, brushed it out, and now it&#x27;s full of volume and looks great.</li>
            <li>At first, right after spraying it, I was amazed.</li>
            <li>Dove makes a dry shampoo that&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>I quickly learned to rub in the stuff and not spray too much to avoid dandruff.  </li>
            <li>I have fine light blonde hair, and it tends to get oily/flat after the first day.  </li>
            <li>Your Mother&#x27;s Clean Freak Refreshing Dry Shampoo&amp;#34; (http://www.amazon.com/Not-Your-Mothers-Refreshing-Shampoo/dp/B0057NE7NQ/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1409773515&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;not+your+mothers+dry+shampoo).</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t believe that this is sold as a dry shampoo - I swear that no matter how closely (or not closely)</li>
            <li>The slightly greasy hair look clean again, and I also noticed a nice shine.</li>
            <li>I bought this kind of tresemme dry shampoo because it&#x27;s specified as volumizing.</li>
            <li>I am an 18 year old college student that has thin-normal, fine hair.</li>
            <li>It also smells funny.  </li>
            <li>And eventually, within a very short amount of time, the oily weighed feeling returns and I want to wash it even more than before.</li>
            <li>I only spray it on the roots in the areas that I feel get most oily.  </li>
            <li>I tried it the first time, and like another reviewer, I looked like the bride of Frankenstein with gray all over.</li>
            <li>I tried this product for the first time yesterday and had a severe allergic reaction to it.</li>
            <li>3) White flecks: This product may ultimately be better for fair-haired people.  </li>
            <li>I used this for the first time tonight.  </li>
            <li>and I only spray it about 5 times around the top of my head.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not entirely persuaded that this product worked any better than water.</li>
            <li>I found I only had to reapply at most once depending on level of activity, weather.</li>
            <li>(This is my second attempt, believing that I surely misread the directions the first time...</li>
            <li>This is my first review ever, and I am doing this</li>
            <li>Hint, you can get this at the big box stores for a substantially better price.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was the smell - it smells like hair spray, which I don&#x27;t use hair spray</li>
            <li>Big Sexy is were</li>
            <li>Try spraying it in your hair first thing in the morning before washing your face,brushing your teeth or putting on make up.</li>
            <li>And I didn&#x27;t think I used that much!  </li>
            <li>This is the first review i&#x27;ve ever written about any product.</li>
            <li>And secondly, I try not to wash my hair more often</li>
            <li>It makes your hair look very dull, so it recommends you follow up with something for shine - but honestly, what&#x27;s the point if you&#x27;re just going to add more junk to your already greasy, covered up hair?    </li>
            <li>All in all, not an overwhelmingly positive first experience.    </li>
            <li>I do agree with the other reviews that less product gives the best result.  </li>
            <li>I was super excited to finally see an affordable hair powder on the market by a brand name.</li>
            <li>My friends recommend Dove dry shampoo as the best low budget option, and my previous beloved dry shampoo was Klorane (you can find it at Ulta)</li>
            <li>I could only see using it for some elaborate up-do when you really want your hair to have texture and stickiness.</li>
            <li>I think many don&#x27;t understand exactly how to use dry shampoos.  </li>
            <li>so my hair is super dry shampoo friendly, as it is light and the shampoo usually blends very easily.</li>
            <li>Cleans pretty reasonably provided that no water is involved.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have time to use dry shampoo more than once a day.</li>
            <li>I only did a light spray even though my hair gets pretty oily.</li>
            <li>My favorite dry shampoo is Naturia by Rene Furterer</li>
            <li>but I think Suave has a better dry shampoo product.</li>
            <li>I used to love using the TIGI dry shampoo</li>
            <li>I like the dry shampoo to just give me one more day between stylings in the bang and crown areas, but this one is getting thrown away.  </li>
            <li>I have straight oily hair, and have happily used Batiste&#x27;s dry shampoo products since I discovered dry shampoo about 2 years ago.  </li>
            <li>but I can honestly say it&#x27;s worth speculating a few pounds to give it a try because if it works for you, it brings semi-freedom from the shower head!</li>
            <li>It certainly was not this one.</li>
            <li>I might try this product again just to see if perhaps I used too much the first time, or to see if there is a knack on how to use it that I need to figure out, but I&#x27;d definitely be doing it on a weekend day where I didn&#x27;t have anything important to do, just in case.  </li>
            <li>Even after 2 long days in a really warm office in the middle of summer, my hair still looked reasonably fresh.  </li>
            <li>I have straight, healthy hair that tends to get greasy at the roots and dry at the ends.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how many negative reviews are out there regarding this fabulous product.  </li>
            <li>, however, my bangs get very streaky towards the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>I have to think that maybe everyone is using WAY too much of this spray.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a bother when I don&#x27;t have time.</li>
            <li>Not that they really look at that in the ER.</li>
            <li>shake very well, hold 8-10 inches from your head, etc., and even used it sparingly.</li>
            <li>This is a smell, that once you smell it, when you smell it again, you&#x27;ll know you are near someone who didn&#x27;t wash their hair but used Tresemme Fresh Start(really?)instead.</li>
            <li>I spray it in bursts and aim straight at my roots</li>
            <li>I followed the directions closely - spraying at the roots, not spraying too much, keeping the can</li>
            <li>When I kept seeing advertisements for this product, I was really hoping that it would work for me.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to try it</li>
            <li>I did shake it very well and held it 8\\&quot; from the hair.  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions, lifting my hair at the roots and spraying it on, then rubbing it in gently and leaving it on for 3-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>This one almost sprays wet and if you have oily hair at all makes it feel and look more oily.</li>
            <li>It was very sticky and matted my hair together and did not brush out.</li>
            <li>But then throw your hair up in a poney or bun and finish getting ready.</li>
            <li>too much</li>
            <li>I REALLY wanted this to work.  </li>
            <li>Like the sprays, it makes my hair a bit duller, without much shine, but it absorbs the oils.  </li>
            <li>I was hopeful that maybe it was user error, but three tries was too many.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to use much.</li>
            <li>I have always had way too much hair.</li>
            <li>It really does feel dirtier.  </li>
            <li>If your looking for an affordable dry shampoo that can be found at most pharmacies, I highly recommend Bed Head.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sprayed the dry shampoo on very lightly over my roots, and concentrated a little more on the areas that I know get the greasiest.</li>
            <li>I think due to the length of my hair I did have to use a bit more to get optimal results.</li>
            <li>AND my hair actually feels clean</li>
            <li>but if I do then it also gets dry easily.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length, straight, fine, color treated blonde hair and I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was pretty surprised at how well this inexpensive product works.</li>
            <li>I was at a casino for about 4 hours, and honestly my hair does not smell like smoke like it usually does.  </li>
            <li>after moving to LA I noticed that my hair condition deteriorated very rapidly, drying out, losing all it&#x27;s color, and splitting at the ends a lot faster than it normally would.  </li>
            <li>If you just spray it on, the clays will sit on top of your hair and weigh it down.    </li>
            <li>It goes on more like a very weak hairspray, it doesn&#x27;t work very well initially, and by the end of the day my hair was more greasy than it would have been if I hadn&#x27;t used it!</li>
            <li>I got a free sample of this dry shampoo and have always wanted to try something like this for camping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice, following the directions, and I&#x27;ve had the same results, my hair looks and feels even more oily than before.</li>
            <li>So I bought this when I saw the commercials figuring Tressame is a decent brand</li>
            <li>I honestly think that the people giving this negative reviews are using too much of this product.  </li>
            <li>I have very naturally oily hair and for years I&#x27;ve been bound to the shower/Hairdryer/Straighteners every morning which is so time consuming!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s high price.</li>
            <li>Not only did it make my hair more greasy than it was to begin with, it made it so dry and tangled that even after I washed it and combed it out, so much hair came out that I thought I had some sort of disease.</li>
            <li>I found that Big Sexy Hair&#x27;s dry shampoo left my hair feeling stiff, straw-like and filmy, and it did not smell good (my husband also pointed that out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m going back to that, or trying the new Victoria Secret Sexy Dry Shampoo because the whole line of hair products has been receiving good reviews.</li>
            <li>&quot; When I looked, the part of my ears that touched my hair (Um, most of them?) were bright red, hot, and painful to the touch.</li>
            <li>Normally on my day after washing, I wear my hair up</li>
            <li>I use the bottle now for when I&#x27;ve freshly washed my hair to give it texture like Jonathan&#x27;s Dirt (occasionally).</li>
            <li>Normally I&#x27;m a &#x27;wash my hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth only $5.</li>
            <li>I concentrated mostly on my roots but also gave a few sprays throughout the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li>Someone told me the water was a lot more drying here, so I thought perhaps I could use dry shampoo to allow me to go an extra day without washing my hair.    </li>
            <li>I use this product every single week now and absolutely love the extra volume this product gives, what a bonus I was not expecting.  </li>
            <li>It made my hair more greasy and stiff.  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast when used the right way.</li>
            <li>As the ONE positive reviewer stated, I&#x27;m also unsure as to why this product has so many negative reviews.  </li>
            <li>My hair is rather dark and the baby powder blends in easily.  </li>
            <li>In the past, I was loyal to the Oscar Blandi version, but once I saw that a similar product was available at a MUCH lower price, I thought I would give it a shot.</li>
            <li>After about 10-15 mins the product has soaked up any oils and has given your hair new life.</li>
            <li>I have medium length blonde hair with light blonde hightlights</li>
            <li>I found that all of them were hard to get the white out of my hair, but this product \\&quot;brushed out\\&quot; much more easily.  </li>
            <li>There are other brands of dry shampoo that are reasonably priced that work just as good as the TIGI one did like Beyond the Zone Dry Shampoo which takes the grease away</li>
            <li>which is at times a little awkward though welcome :)  </li>
            <li>This product is very similar to the OB version and works pretty much exactly the same.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok temporarily, but feels like you have excessive product and filth on one&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty gross, ladies.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the other users were doing wrong, but it works great for me!</li>
            <li>I have fine, blonde hair that tends to get oily after a long day of work.</li>
            <li>For what little good this product does, it is DEFINITELY not worth it.</li>
            <li>One, I live in the country and frequently lose power during storms, meaning I can&#x27;t shower.</li>
            <li>I do get the sense that the \\&quot;less is more\\&quot; idea is important to remember.</li>
            <li>I bought Tresemme&#x27;s Fresh Start dry shampoo on a whim.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only 20 years old and it&#x27;s absolutely humiliating having to walk around like this!</li>
            <li>It made my hair feel so gross and really thick as though there was even more grease in it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how it would do against a full few days of non-washed hair, because my hair tends to be on the oily side, especially my bangs, but for a quick touch-up before going to class in the morning, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>however many were left on the shelf, only to find them all sold out at every single store.  </li>
            <li>But the ads were certainly enticing enough to give it a whirl.</li>
            <li>This product works better than any other dry shampoo I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Using the dry shampoo gives me so much more time for other things now.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used dry shampoo in the past (Big Sexy Hair&#x27;s Volumizing Dry Shampoo) and it was just okay.</li>
            <li>There is nothing I can do to make this bad-hair-day better other than throwing the 2 cans of this dry shampoo garbage away the minute I get home.  </li>
            <li>I have heard of dry shampoos that work really well, but this is particular brand</li>
            <li>It also left an unusual scent.</li>
            <li>White, if you use too much you get dandruff like whiteness...............  </li>
            <li>I suggest Tresemme reformulate this or take it off the market completely.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I have a 7 month old, and sometimes I just don&#x27;t have the me-time in the morning to shower and do my hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if people are using too much or if the larger bottles have functional issues</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised by all the one star reviews here.</li>
            <li>This product was overall very displeasing to me.</li>
            <li>is not even worth the $4.00 I spent.</li>
            <li>Like the other reviewer who rated this product top notch, I have also been looking to buy this dry shampoo by the case!  </li>
            <li>The spray was able to take away my greasiness but in its place it left a thick gunkiness which left my fine straight hair weighed down and clumpy.</li>
            <li>I know the first time, I didn&#x27;t wait for it to dry completely</li>
            <li>My hair tangles pretty easily, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s gotten worse with this</li>
            <li>gave this dry shampoo a chance on three different occasions and then dumped the full can into the TRASH.</li>
            <li>First, I have been using dry shampoo for years.  </li>
            <li>This being my first attempt at dry shampoo</li>
            <li>for those who feel like their hair is full of product after using, try using less.</li>
            <li>I am not meticulous about keeping it perfect- impossible!  </li>
            <li>If you do use it, make sure to use only HALF the recommended amount and only apply it to the roots.   </li>
            <li>My hair is VERY dry and coarse, and I honestly can not wash it everyday.  </li>
            <li>But I can&#x27;t find Batiste locally, have to order it through Amazon, so I was excited to find this Tresemme FreshStart Dry Shampoo for Oily/Straight Hair at my local CVS.    </li>
            <li>Wanting to conserve water by not having to shower every single morning, I bought some of this dry shampoo spray since it claims to clean hair and remove oil.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, dark hair and used the black one.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try the product but disappointed with the outcome; it smelled nice though.</li>
            <li>Normally I don&#x27;t care enough to write one</li>
            <li>this is a fantastic product just remember to use only a little.</li>
            <li>agree with what other users have said about less being more.</li>
            <li>I bought this item from a retail store for two reasons: I&#x27;m a new mom who doesn&#x27;t see a daily shower anymore</li>
            <li>My hair just feels stiff, and full of residue.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product right after a shower to give my hair some additional volume (especially before a long day), or second day I will spray around my crown, and WOW.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several different application techniques for this product because I really wanted it to work.</li>
            <li>my hair to try and give it some body as any body that this product gave it would quickly drop making my hair look limp and greasy.  </li>
            <li>I bought this a little while ago because my hair gets oily fast, and I can really only skip washing my hair one day, and even then it looks pretty greasy.</li>
            <li>I love that product except that if it rains, forget about it -- the dark color will spread down your face.  </li>
            <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you&#x27;re interested, here are the other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I have tried several dry shampoos and  I am well aware you have to shake it vigorously before each spray.  </li>
            <li>My hair is extremely fine &amp; has to washed at least once a day or it looks like an oil spill on my head.</li>
            <li>so I was looking to save a little money when I purchased Fresh Start.  </li>
            <li>I use it: I usually pull up most of my hair with a clasp, spray the roots, use flat iron, let down a little more of my hair, spray the roots, use flat iron, and keep repeating until I&#x27;ve sprayed and styled all my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I could barely wash it out when I washed my hair.</li>
            <li>After a little experimentation, I discovered that less is definitely more here.</li>
            <li>I also then give my hair a quick shot with a blow dryer and round brush to give it an extra boost.</li>
            <li>I have long, straight, normal, untreated hair and wash it every other day.</li>
            <li>- just a little did nothing and a little more</li>
            <li>and my hair gets greasy if I don&#x27;t wash it every day but dries quickly from excessive washing.</li>
            <li>This product really helps to make my bangs appear normal again, and i also use it all over my head for a little extra umph.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised to see so little powder come out of it and so much sticky residue.  </li>
            <li>I think the main problem with this product is that people might not really know how to use it.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is not dry shampoo its hair spray.  </li>
            <li>I think that depending on your scalp - the product works for me if it&#x27;s the first day \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; but further down the line</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this dry shampoo since the only brand of hair spray I use is Tresemme.</li>
            <li>My hair feels powdery on top, dirty/greasy from the middle down, and extra heavy and limp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Of course I followed the directions the first few times, but it still makes my hair look greasier than it did before application.</li>
            <li>This summer I decided it would be easier to wash my hair less often when I have it blown out so that I don&#x27;t have to work with it as much.</li>
            <li>I had actually read a few positive reviews about this product</li>
            <li>I now have to cut most of my hair off after working hard to grow it long and have been having severe panic attacks due to my hair loss.</li>
            <li>Also, if you have sensitive skin like me, it caused my forehead to break out a little near the hairline.</li>
            <li>I have fine, long, lightened hair, so splitting and loss of color is to be expected, but surely not just one month since it last got cut.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After weighing the good and the bad,  I give it 2 stars.</li>
            <li>The smell: this can be a good or bad thing depending on the person.  </li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Smelled awesome though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Batiste seems to work the best and is inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome too.</li>
            <li> I have been very impressed and have continued to use it.</li>
            <li> Best thing to do is to try it (maybe with friends w/ oily hair) and decide for yourselves.</li>
            <li> I figured this would be the perfect solution</li>
            <li> LOVE!!!  </li>
            <li> it smells just like their hairspray, which in my opinion isn&#x27;t too great to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> lol</li>
            <li> Great price too.</li>
            <li> but I have had no problem with the minis or the product and it has been a great solution for not over washing my hair.</li>
            <li> I have gotten tons of compliments on my hair while using this product as well and people commenting on how great I smell,</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re nervous about it you can even put it on before bed and let it soak up oils overnight which is great too.</li>
            <li> Works way better!!</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> Suave is much better and Batiste is the best.</li>
            <li> and my hair looks good all</li>
            <li> so i thought this would be good.  </li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t even smell good -</li>
            <li> I have been using baby powder for years and the Tresemme citrus smells so great, what a nice \\&quot;extra-extra\\&quot; bonus.  </li>
            <li> made my hair smell good  2.  </li>
            <li> If you want to try it, I suggest you do it when you have time to follow up with a good washing of your hair.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> It does have a better smell than others, like Pssssssssst!  </li>
            <li> I got to try the product a couple of times and now this one is not working any more either!  </li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> It works amazing.  </li>
            <li> I did use up the bottle I bought, but would never buy this kind again.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be nice to re-fresh my hair on the days when I don&#x27;t wash it, but</li>
            <li> It kind of felt like I had rubbed clay through my hair.</li>
            <li> my hair appeared healthier in the mirror  (nice shine to it)  3.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I kind of let my hair do its own thing</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> The smell is quite strong but it&#x27;s probably good if your hair smells.  </li>
            <li> I thought Fresh Start would be great for those mornings when I have to rush out the door and don&#x27;t have time to wash my hair.</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff!</li>
            <li> My hair smelled fine to begin with!</li>
            <li> You can find a more in depth review that I&#x27;ve done of these on their amazon product</li>
            <li> I should have known better.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than nothing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> I think with this product the more you use, the ickier your hair will feel.</li>
            <li> Even powder would be better, in my opinion.     </li>
            <li> Save your money, or go spend more on a quality product.</li>
            <li> I did try it, but I still like the Bastiste brand better  </li>
            <li> I have used this product many times.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> but I have tried others that work much better.</li>
            <li> Baby powder works way better than this product.</li>
            <li> , I think it&#x27;s more of an issue with my scalp&#x27;s tendency to have dandruff and not the clays.    </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> The cheap price caught my eye!  </li>
            <li> I read the directions on the bottle and followed them and the results were just okay.</li>
            <li> but it was better than before.</li>
            <li> You would be better off rubbing butter and baby powder in your hair.</li>
            <li> I saw the ads for this and thought it would be a nice alternative, more readily available and cheaper.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I</li>
            <li> did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is SO much better than I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Oh boy, am I glad I did.</li>
            <li> but mostly it just dries out your hair.</li>
            <li> You will smell like a gallon of chemicals all day, and no matter how awesome someone&#x27;s hair looks I won&#x27;t notice if I&#x27;m getting a headache standing ten feet away from them.  </li>
            <li> I had good success with the Got2b Rock Encore one and also the Salon Grafix brand Walgreens carries.  </li>
            <li> Batiste has a much much better product.</li>
            <li> all it did everytime was make my hair more greasy.</li>
            <li> It looks like zits - which is lovely, but it&#x27;s a rash.  </li>
            <li> gives you a lovely gray-headed look</li>
            <li> I love the idea, but it doesn&#x27;t deliver...</li>
            <li> I. Love.</li>
            <li> It is just a bottle of more oil and grease in a bottle.</li>
            <li> Maybe that one will work better.</li>
            <li> love this stuff and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Also be sure you&#x27;re holding the can almost an as length away.</li>
            <li> I follow the directions it makes my hair MORE oily.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Update:  The Batiste line works much better</li>
            <li> Way better than this stuff ever did.</li>
            <li> I had to dump baby powder on top just to salvage it before I went out.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried using more.</li>
            <li> My hair looks relatively okay (</li>
            <li> It does work okay on my hair...making it appear fresher and giving it a nice clean scent.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m one of those who keeps a very clean brush...</li>
            <li> I have very oily hair, and I look good with bangs</li>
            <li> The best way to go about it is to use a little at a time and apply more if needed.  </li>
            <li> When I want to put up my freshly clean hair it holds better.</li>
            <li> easy to use  CONS:  </li>
            <li> This product is really great if you use it properly and trust me once you get used to it you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> it would be an easy 4.</li>
            <li> That being said, I have fine hair that gets greasy very quickly.</li>
            <li> They should say that this product is not for fine hair, and that you should test it on your skin before trying.    </li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t have to have the hassle of drying and my hair is just fine.</li>
            <li> I quickly found that even though I showered and washed my hair every night, by morning my hair was somewhat oily and needed refreshing.</li>
            <li> Huge mistake.</li>
            <li> Plus, this one smells fantastic.     </li>
            <li> I have no problems with this product that sound as nightmarish as everyone else&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> My hair has a ton of volume and it smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately for me, I am thrilled this much cheaper product works well with my hair.</li>
            <li> so I was excited to see that Tresemme was making one that they sold in stores.  </li>
            <li> This stuff makes your hair LOOK clean, but it feels even greasier.</li>
            <li> It looked clean</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave my feeling entirely clean like after a wash</li>
            <li> I found that my hair&#x27;s greasy spots looked clean, and made me feel cleaner because it looked fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair appeared clean and almost bouncy.</li>
            <li> I clean the hair out of it every time I use it and wash it thoroughly often.  </li>
            <li> I can tell you that this one is certainly &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; but there are better products out there.  </li>
            <li> It would look good right after styling, but after a few hours of wear, my hair looked oily again and needed refreshing once more.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if the Refreshing Mist is completely necessary, but it&#x27;s a nice touch to add the fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a great solution, but it&#x27;s the exact opposite!</li>
            <li> , it comes out full blast</li>
            <li> , I brush it forward, I brush it to the side, just so it will get evenly coated throughout the whole top of my head.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cool</li>
            <li> And I never do that with full product.</li>
            <li> And it didn&#x27;t even make my hair look clean &amp; fresh.</li>
            <li> My hair literally looks clean and fresh, as if I was on day 1 rather than day 2.</li>
            <li> I figured anything is worth a shot once, but I love this product so much that I&#x27;m looking for a site that will sell it by the case.</li>
            <li> It still doesn&#x27;t look like freshly showered hair, but there is a good enough difference.</li>
            <li> When sprayed lightly, it dries up oils and refreshes the hair at first.</li>
            <li> I was expecting something that would absorb oil, and remove any odor, and generally make my hair feel nice.</li>
            <li> Perfect, due to a busy schedule, plus it was cheaper than the price(s) at a brick and mortar store which has worldwide stores.</li>
            <li> was on the hunt for another good dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I thought hey, tresemme is supposed to have a good dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> and they both worked 10x better and didn&#x27;t have such a strong scent.</li>
            <li> It gives an odd dry kind of feeling but if it allows me to not wash my hair every day, then I&#x27;m good with that!  </li>
            <li> My hair is brown, mostly straight and quite fine</li>
            <li> No product is worth that.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ever going back.  </li>
            <li> and I think that might be worth trying.</li>
            <li> I saw the Tresemme one on sale, and thought it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li> A lot of times I&#x27;ll use it before putting my hair up, and it looks like I have 3x the hair and looks perfectly fresh.  </li>
            <li> my hair felt heavier - so more flat because it&#x27;s fine - and dirtier.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, cannot say enough about this wonderful product from Tresemme.</li>
            <li> One other reviewer gave it a good score after blow drying</li>
            <li> That is what I look like right now.</li>
            <li> that was right</li>
            <li> I am at work right now.  </li>
            <li> I paired it with the Fresh Start Refreshing Mist, and it really does help to remove the smell of day old</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has been 8 hours and my hair still looks pretty fresh (as if I washed it 8 hours ago).</li>
            <li> I waited about 2 minutes for it to dry, brushed it out, and now it&#x27;s full of volume and looks great.</li>
            <li> At first, right after spraying it, I was amazed.</li>
            <li> Dove makes a dry shampoo that&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I quickly learned to rub in the stuff and not spray too much to avoid dandruff.  </li>
            <li> I have fine light blonde hair, and it tends to get oily/flat after the first day.  </li>
            <li> Your Mother&#x27;s Clean Freak Refreshing Dry Shampoo&amp;#34; (http://www.amazon.com/Not-Your-Mothers-Refreshing-Shampoo/dp/B0057NE7NQ/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1409773515&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;not+your+mothers+dry+shampoo).</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t believe that this is sold as a dry shampoo - I swear that no matter how closely (or not closely)</li>
            <li> The slightly greasy hair look clean again, and I also noticed a nice shine.</li>
            <li> I bought this kind of tresemme dry shampoo because it&#x27;s specified as volumizing.</li>
            <li> I am an 18 year old college student that has thin-normal, fine hair.</li>
            <li> It also smells funny.  </li>
            <li> And eventually, within a very short amount of time, the oily weighed feeling returns and I want to wash it even more than before.</li>
            <li> I only spray it on the roots in the areas that I feel get most oily.  </li>
            <li> I tried it the first time, and like another reviewer, I looked like the bride of Frankenstein with gray all over.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for the first time yesterday and had a severe allergic reaction to it.</li>
            <li> 3) White flecks: This product may ultimately be better for fair-haired people.  </li>
            <li> I used this for the first time tonight.  </li>
            <li> and I only spray it about 5 times around the top of my head.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not entirely persuaded that this product worked any better than water.</li>
            <li> I found I only had to reapply at most once depending on level of activity, weather.</li>
            <li> (This is my second attempt, believing that I surely misread the directions the first time...</li>
            <li> This is my first review ever, and I am doing this</li>
            <li> Hint, you can get this at the big box stores for a substantially better price.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was the smell - it smells like hair spray, which I don&#x27;t use hair spray</li>
            <li> Big Sexy is were</li>
            <li> Try spraying it in your hair first thing in the morning before washing your face,brushing your teeth or putting on make up.</li>
            <li> And I didn&#x27;t think I used that much!  </li>
            <li> This is the first review i&#x27;ve ever written about any product.</li>
            <li> And secondly, I try not to wash my hair more often</li>
            <li> It makes your hair look very dull, so it recommends you follow up with something for shine - but honestly, what&#x27;s the point if you&#x27;re just going to add more junk to your already greasy, covered up hair?    </li>
            <li> All in all, not an overwhelmingly positive first experience.    </li>
            <li> I do agree with the other reviews that less product gives the best result.  </li>
            <li> I was super excited to finally see an affordable hair powder on the market by a brand name.</li>
            <li> My friends recommend Dove dry shampoo as the best low budget option, and my previous beloved dry shampoo was Klorane (you can find it at Ulta)</li>
            <li> I could only see using it for some elaborate up-do when you really want your hair to have texture and stickiness.</li>
            <li> I think many don&#x27;t understand exactly how to use dry shampoos.  </li>
            <li> so my hair is super dry shampoo friendly, as it is light and the shampoo usually blends very easily.</li>
            <li> Cleans pretty reasonably provided that no water is involved.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have time to use dry shampoo more than once a day.</li>
            <li> I only did a light spray even though my hair gets pretty oily.</li>
            <li> My favorite dry shampoo is Naturia by Rene Furterer</li>
            <li> but I think Suave has a better dry shampoo product.</li>
            <li> I used to love using the TIGI dry shampoo</li>
            <li> I like the dry shampoo to just give me one more day between stylings in the bang and crown areas, but this one is getting thrown away.  </li>
            <li> I have straight oily hair, and have happily used Batiste&#x27;s dry shampoo products since I discovered dry shampoo about 2 years ago.  </li>
            <li> but I can honestly say it&#x27;s worth speculating a few pounds to give it a try because if it works for you, it brings semi-freedom from the shower head!</li>
            <li> It certainly was not this one.</li>
            <li> I might try this product again just to see if perhaps I used too much the first time, or to see if there is a knack on how to use it that I need to figure out, but I&#x27;d definitely be doing it on a weekend day where I didn&#x27;t have anything important to do, just in case.  </li>
            <li> Even after 2 long days in a really warm office in the middle of summer, my hair still looked reasonably fresh.  </li>
            <li> I have straight, healthy hair that tends to get greasy at the roots and dry at the ends.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how many negative reviews are out there regarding this fabulous product.  </li>
            <li> , however, my bangs get very streaky towards the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> I have to think that maybe everyone is using WAY too much of this spray.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a bother when I don&#x27;t have time.</li>
            <li> Not that they really look at that in the ER.</li>
            <li> shake very well, hold 8-10 inches from your head, etc., and even used it sparingly.</li>
            <li> This is a smell, that once you smell it, when you smell it again, you&#x27;ll know you are near someone who didn&#x27;t wash their hair but used Tresemme Fresh Start(really?)instead.</li>
            <li> I spray it in bursts and aim straight at my roots</li>
            <li> I followed the directions closely - spraying at the roots, not spraying too much, keeping the can</li>
            <li> When I kept seeing advertisements for this product, I was really hoping that it would work for me.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to try it</li>
            <li> I did shake it very well and held it 8\\&quot; from the hair.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions, lifting my hair at the roots and spraying it on, then rubbing it in gently and leaving it on for 3-5 minutes.</li>
            <li> This one almost sprays wet and if you have oily hair at all makes it feel and look more oily.</li>
            <li> It was very sticky and matted my hair together and did not brush out.</li>
            <li> But then throw your hair up in a poney or bun and finish getting ready.</li>
            <li> too much</li>
            <li> I REALLY wanted this to work.  </li>
            <li> Like the sprays, it makes my hair a bit duller, without much shine, but it absorbs the oils.  </li>
            <li> I was hopeful that maybe it was user error, but three tries was too many.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to use much.</li>
            <li> I have always had way too much hair.</li>
            <li> It really does feel dirtier.  </li>
            <li> If your looking for an affordable dry shampoo that can be found at most pharmacies, I highly recommend Bed Head.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sprayed the dry shampoo on very lightly over my roots, and concentrated a little more on the areas that I know get the greasiest.</li>
            <li> I think due to the length of my hair I did have to use a bit more to get optimal results.</li>
            <li> AND my hair actually feels clean</li>
            <li> but if I do then it also gets dry easily.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, straight, fine, color treated blonde hair and I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was pretty surprised at how well this inexpensive product works.</li>
            <li> I was at a casino for about 4 hours, and honestly my hair does not smell like smoke like it usually does.  </li>
            <li> after moving to LA I noticed that my hair condition deteriorated very rapidly, drying out, losing all it&#x27;s color, and splitting at the ends a lot faster than it normally would.  </li>
            <li> If you just spray it on, the clays will sit on top of your hair and weigh it down.    </li>
            <li> It goes on more like a very weak hairspray, it doesn&#x27;t work very well initially, and by the end of the day my hair was more greasy than it would have been if I hadn&#x27;t used it!</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this dry shampoo and have always wanted to try something like this for camping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice, following the directions, and I&#x27;ve had the same results, my hair looks and feels even more oily than before.</li>
            <li> So I bought this when I saw the commercials figuring Tressame is a decent brand</li>
            <li> I honestly think that the people giving this negative reviews are using too much of this product.  </li>
            <li> I have very naturally oily hair and for years I&#x27;ve been bound to the shower/Hairdryer/Straighteners every morning which is so time consuming!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s high price.</li>
            <li> Not only did it make my hair more greasy than it was to begin with, it made it so dry and tangled that even after I washed it and combed it out, so much hair came out that I thought I had some sort of disease.</li>
            <li> I found that Big Sexy Hair&#x27;s dry shampoo left my hair feeling stiff, straw-like and filmy, and it did not smell good (my husband also pointed that out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m going back to that, or trying the new Victoria Secret Sexy Dry Shampoo because the whole line of hair products has been receiving good reviews.</li>
            <li> &quot; When I looked, the part of my ears that touched my hair (Um, most of them?) were bright red, hot, and painful to the touch.</li>
            <li> Normally on my day after washing, I wear my hair up</li>
            <li> I use the bottle now for when I&#x27;ve freshly washed my hair to give it texture like Jonathan&#x27;s Dirt (occasionally).</li>
            <li> Normally I&#x27;m a &#x27;wash my hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth only $5.</li>
            <li> I concentrated mostly on my roots but also gave a few sprays throughout the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li> Someone told me the water was a lot more drying here, so I thought perhaps I could use dry shampoo to allow me to go an extra day without washing my hair.    </li>
            <li> I use this product every single week now and absolutely love the extra volume this product gives, what a bonus I was not expecting.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair more greasy and stiff.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast when used the right way.</li>
            <li> As the ONE positive reviewer stated, I&#x27;m also unsure as to why this product has so many negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> My hair is rather dark and the baby powder blends in easily.  </li>
            <li> In the past, I was loyal to the Oscar Blandi version, but once I saw that a similar product was available at a MUCH lower price, I thought I would give it a shot.</li>
            <li> After about 10-15 mins the product has soaked up any oils and has given your hair new life.</li>
            <li> I have medium length blonde hair with light blonde hightlights</li>
            <li> I found that all of them were hard to get the white out of my hair, but this product \\&quot;brushed out\\&quot; much more easily.  </li>
            <li> There are other brands of dry shampoo that are reasonably priced that work just as good as the TIGI one did like Beyond the Zone Dry Shampoo which takes the grease away</li>
            <li> which is at times a little awkward though welcome :)  </li>
            <li> This product is very similar to the OB version and works pretty much exactly the same.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok temporarily, but feels like you have excessive product and filth on one&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty gross, ladies.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the other users were doing wrong, but it works great for me!</li>
            <li> I have fine, blonde hair that tends to get oily after a long day of work.</li>
            <li> For what little good this product does, it is DEFINITELY not worth it.</li>
            <li> One, I live in the country and frequently lose power during storms, meaning I can&#x27;t shower.</li>
            <li> I do get the sense that the \\&quot;less is more\\&quot; idea is important to remember.</li>
            <li> I bought Tresemme&#x27;s Fresh Start dry shampoo on a whim.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 20 years old and it&#x27;s absolutely humiliating having to walk around like this!</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel so gross and really thick as though there was even more grease in it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it would do against a full few days of non-washed hair, because my hair tends to be on the oily side, especially my bangs, but for a quick touch-up before going to class in the morning, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> however many were left on the shelf, only to find them all sold out at every single store.  </li>
            <li> But the ads were certainly enticing enough to give it a whirl.</li>
            <li> This product works better than any other dry shampoo I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Using the dry shampoo gives me so much more time for other things now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used dry shampoo in the past (Big Sexy Hair&#x27;s Volumizing Dry Shampoo) and it was just okay.</li>
            <li> There is nothing I can do to make this bad-hair-day better other than throwing the 2 cans of this dry shampoo garbage away the minute I get home.  </li>
            <li> I have heard of dry shampoos that work really well, but this is particular brand</li>
            <li> It also left an unusual scent.</li>
            <li> White, if you use too much you get dandruff like whiteness...............  </li>
            <li> I suggest Tresemme reformulate this or take it off the market completely.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have a 7 month old, and sometimes I just don&#x27;t have the me-time in the morning to shower and do my hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if people are using too much or if the larger bottles have functional issues</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised by all the one star reviews here.</li>
            <li> This product was overall very displeasing to me.</li>
            <li> is not even worth the $4.00 I spent.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewer who rated this product top notch, I have also been looking to buy this dry shampoo by the case!  </li>
            <li> The spray was able to take away my greasiness but in its place it left a thick gunkiness which left my fine straight hair weighed down and clumpy.</li>
            <li> I know the first time, I didn&#x27;t wait for it to dry completely</li>
            <li> My hair tangles pretty easily, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s gotten worse with this</li>
            <li> gave this dry shampoo a chance on three different occasions and then dumped the full can into the TRASH.</li>
            <li> First, I have been using dry shampoo for years.  </li>
            <li> This being my first attempt at dry shampoo</li>
            <li> for those who feel like their hair is full of product after using, try using less.</li>
            <li> I am not meticulous about keeping it perfect- impossible!  </li>
            <li> If you do use it, make sure to use only HALF the recommended amount and only apply it to the roots.   </li>
            <li> My hair is VERY dry and coarse, and I honestly can not wash it everyday.  </li>
            <li> But I can&#x27;t find Batiste locally, have to order it through Amazon, so I was excited to find this Tresemme FreshStart Dry Shampoo for Oily/Straight Hair at my local CVS.    </li>
            <li> Wanting to conserve water by not having to shower every single morning, I bought some of this dry shampoo spray since it claims to clean hair and remove oil.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, dark hair and used the black one.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to try the product but disappointed with the outcome; it smelled nice though.</li>
            <li> Normally I don&#x27;t care enough to write one</li>
            <li> this is a fantastic product just remember to use only a little.</li>
            <li> agree with what other users have said about less being more.</li>
            <li> I bought this item from a retail store for two reasons: I&#x27;m a new mom who doesn&#x27;t see a daily shower anymore</li>
            <li> My hair just feels stiff, and full of residue.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product right after a shower to give my hair some additional volume (especially before a long day), or second day I will spray around my crown, and WOW.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several different application techniques for this product because I really wanted it to work.</li>
            <li> my hair to try and give it some body as any body that this product gave it would quickly drop making my hair look limp and greasy.  </li>
            <li> I bought this a little while ago because my hair gets oily fast, and I can really only skip washing my hair one day, and even then it looks pretty greasy.</li>
            <li> I love that product except that if it rains, forget about it -- the dark color will spread down your face.  </li>
            <li> day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you&#x27;re interested, here are the other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have tried several dry shampoos and  I am well aware you have to shake it vigorously before each spray.  </li>
            <li> My hair is extremely fine &amp; has to washed at least once a day or it looks like an oil spill on my head.</li>
            <li> so I was looking to save a little money when I purchased Fresh Start.  </li>
            <li> I use it: I usually pull up most of my hair with a clasp, spray the roots, use flat iron, let down a little more of my hair, spray the roots, use flat iron, and keep repeating until I&#x27;ve sprayed and styled all my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could barely wash it out when I washed my hair.</li>
            <li> After a little experimentation, I discovered that less is definitely more here.</li>
            <li> I also then give my hair a quick shot with a blow dryer and round brush to give it an extra boost.</li>
            <li> I have long, straight, normal, untreated hair and wash it every other day.</li>
            <li> - just a little did nothing and a little more</li>
            <li> and my hair gets greasy if I don&#x27;t wash it every day but dries quickly from excessive washing.</li>
            <li> This product really helps to make my bangs appear normal again, and i also use it all over my head for a little extra umph.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised to see so little powder come out of it and so much sticky residue.  </li>
            <li> I think the main problem with this product is that people might not really know how to use it.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is not dry shampoo its hair spray.  </li>
            <li> I think that depending on your scalp - the product works for me if it&#x27;s the first day \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; but further down the line</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this dry shampoo since the only brand of hair spray I use is Tresemme.</li>
            <li> My hair feels powdery on top, dirty/greasy from the middle down, and extra heavy and limp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Of course I followed the directions the first few times, but it still makes my hair look greasier than it did before application.</li>
            <li> This summer I decided it would be easier to wash my hair less often when I have it blown out so that I don&#x27;t have to work with it as much.</li>
            <li> I had actually read a few positive reviews about this product</li>
            <li> I now have to cut most of my hair off after working hard to grow it long and have been having severe panic attacks due to my hair loss.</li>
            <li> Also, if you have sensitive skin like me, it caused my forehead to break out a little near the hairline.</li>
            <li> I have fine, long, lightened hair, so splitting and loss of color is to be expected, but surely not just one month since it last got cut.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After weighing the good and the bad,  I give it 2 stars.</li>
            <li> The smell: this can be a good or bad thing depending on the person.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually amazed that I&#x27;m one of the positive reviewers because usually when a product has overwhelmingly negative reviews, I&#x27;m right along with them.</li>
            <li> Over the past year, I have been trying different dry shampoos and decided to share my experience in hopes that it will help others find the right one for their hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Upon using said brush and this dry shampoo today, there was so much buildup that it shed on my black shirt as if I have dandruff.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possible my expectations were low, as I hadn&#x27;t used a dry shampoo in some 20 years prior to this, and it was definitely an improvement from way back when.</li>
            <li> I have fine thin hair that likes to get oily if I forgo washing it for too long.</li>
            <li> Suddenly my hair was a greasy, flat, rat&#x27;s nest and felt like I&#x27;d run Elmer&#x27;s glue through it.</li>
            <li> The 5.7 can should last everyone a while even if you have long hair, such as I do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other dry shampoos in the past and all they did was leave a residue and weigh my hair down even more</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo goes for about $10 a bottle at my local grocery store (Harris Teeter), but I only have to use it once in the morning</li>
            <li> A few days later I tried again thinking the first time maybe I overapplied, but, I still had the same result even with less product on my hair.</li>
            <li> When I brushed my hair, it became this oily, clumpy mess that looked far dirtier than my unwashed hair.</li>
            <li> it would just be flat...  </li>
            <li> I have to wash my hair normally every day in order for it not to look oily because I have really straight, less than thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I no longer use this dry shampoo because it didn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
            <li> This is the dry shampoo I currently use.</li>
            <li> I only spray this product at the roots, allow to dry and then rub/brush through the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t believe I used B&amp;B dry shampoo for all those years, paying $28-$30 for a smaller bottle.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product due to having fine hair that I must wash at least every other day.  </li>
            <li> I gave this dry shampoo a try because it&#x27;s only $5.</li>
            <li> It is the opposite of dry \\&quot;shampoo\\</li>
            <li> Maybe I used too much, or maybe my hair is just too thick or my scalp too oily for this stuff to work properly.</li>
            <li> Naturally I have somewhat oily hair, so I have to wash it at least every other day to look decent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to hear that other people have had so many problems.</li>
            <li> When I complained to two other friends, they each said they had the exact same experience.</li>
            <li> I too have been a long time user of Oscar Blandi</li>
            <li> I used VERY little on my super thick hair - only where the oil tends to collect and nowhere else.</li>
            <li> I decided that just going without the dry shampoo would be the better option, because this made my hair feel twice as dirty than if I hadn&#x27;t used it.</li>
            <li> Maybe if I&#x27;d filled it with hairspray after using the dry shampoo in the morning then it would have held it&#x27;s &#x27;rock star&#x27; grungy bed head look, but as it was I just felt uncomfortable all day at work.    </li>
            <li> In fact I have to go several days without washing it due to</li>
            <li> I wait about 30 seconds to a minute (1-2 minutes as it instructs on the can is too long!)</li>
            <li> I totally agree with the other reviewers who state their hair felt even dirtier.</li>
            <li> try to only wash my hair every other day</li>
            <li> This product is definitely not on par with Tresemme&#x27;s other lines.</li>
            <li> recommend dry shampoo, just not this brand.</li>
            <li> Here began my quest to find a dry shampoo that worked for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Suave dry shampoo:</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve never tried dry shampoo before.</li>
            <li> I have been using dry shampoo for almost a year but could not find it in stores</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is like putting spray pomade into your hair.</li>
            <li> * Treseme Dry Shampoo Did not work for me, unfortuneately.  </li>
            <li> These dry shampoos make my hair look cleaner</li>
            <li> I would recommend Tresemme dry shampoo</li>
            <li> it being so dry.  </li>
            <li> Before finding Tresemme dry shampoo, I was a longtime user of Bumble and Bumble dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> so I decided to try Tresemme&#x27;s dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I have used Oscar Blandi dry shampoos for about 3 years.</li>
            <li> My friend whose hair is dry, curly, and color-processed finds this product turns \\&quot;pasty\\&quot; in her hair.</li>
            <li> I got it because I needed a travel size dry shampoo  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a dry shampoo do NOT buy this one.</li>
            <li> Left it for 5 minutes or so until the product dried to a white powdery finish, and them attempted to brush/blend through with a bristle brush.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because I have really oily hair, but if I wash it everyday, it gets really dried out</li>
            <li> So not only do I want my money back for this shit product</li>
            <li> I left it on for about 1 minute and then brushed and combed thoroughly, then styled as usual with my flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have had color-treated and high-lighted hair for years and my hair is so oily it requires me to wash it every single day.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, medium length hair that is not oily, but normal.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair and my scalp is naturally oily.</li>
            <li> so I tried it, and it actually did make my hair look both less oily and thicker.  </li>
            <li> None, yet  Cons:  Sits heavy in your hair, not good for fine hair as can make it look limp and greasy</li>
            <li> and it was such a mess to use.....easier to get a friend to drive me to beauty salon</li>
            <li> I saw the commercial and bought the product, hoping, like others, that between washes it would give my hair a little pick up.</li>
            <li> It does leave your hair a little white but worked through out the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 2 other dry shampoo brands after this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised at all of the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> That day I brushed it all out, had icky white residue all over my brush and hands, and tried to style</li>
            <li> I had used it a few times, following the directions, before I decided to give up on it.</li>
            <li> It worked just how I expected.</li>
            <li> It is getting harder and harder to purchase, seeming it is flying off the shelves.  </li>
            <li> the shelves are all empty?  </li>
            <li> I had noticed the hair spray/burnt hair smell when I started spraying it, but I expected it to go away like hairspray does.</li>
            <li> A total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Throughout the day I had to go into the bathroom and &#x27;fluff&#x27;</li>
            <li> and I followed the directions carefully.</li>
            <li> , my hair never feels greasy, I have no white residue (my hair is very dark brown and long), and it doesn&#x27;t weigh me down or smell too overpowering once I have worked it through my hair.</li>
            <li> It weighs your hair down alot and the sprayer is strange, it concentrates in one spot, so you can&#x27;t just \\&quot;mist\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It feels stiff, greasy, powdery and waxy all at the same time.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand to even touch it and no attempts to volumize it help now that the dry shampoo has gunked it up and weighed it down.</li>
            <li> Else I have to condition it heavily and that obviously can weigh it down.</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick red hair - color-treated since the gray has decided to rear</li>
            <li> /&gt;Regardless of my experience, I&#x27;ll try other brands to see if there is one I WILL like.</li>
            <li> I usually try not to wash my hair on the weekends if I am going to the beach, working outside, etc.</li>
            <li> I should just stick with the baby powder or try the other products everyone is talking about.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how some of the other reviewers are using this product, but I&#x27;m not having ANY issues with it.</li>
            <li> I use this every other day because I have class Monday, Wednesday, Friday</li>
            <li> I used a little at a time, letting it completely dry and brushing afterward.  </li>
            <li> I used a blow dryer and it dried out a little bit, but felt just gross all day.  </li>
            <li> Oh Bee Hive dry shampoo for a few weeks but kept putting it off due to</li>
            <li> I had used a few drug store brand dry shampoos before.  </li>
            <li> After spraying the amount I usually use in hair, turning my head upside down to finger through, and turning upright again, my fingers were covered in what looked like white powder.  </li>
            <li> no white residue, a little less oily), even though it&#x27;s dark, but it feels like I haven&#x27;t washed it in a week!</li>
            <li> Product was awful - made my fine shiny hair lifelessly dull &amp; coarse - could barely pull a brush through it.&lt;br /&gt;Tried it a couple times, same results each time.&lt;br /&gt;Threw it away.</li>
            <li> I am also surprised at all the negative reviews!</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and it takes a long time to dry and style my hair.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers complained the product left their hair gunky</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never liked Tresemme products - they always make my hair feel gross.  </li>
            <li> So, surprisingly enough the negative reviews, but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame that because of all of the negative reviews I think this product will be short lived.</li>
            <li> It left a very thick, white residue and made my hair feel stiff.</li>
            <li> (I have thin, medium length hair that I usually blow dry and flat iron), so I was curious to try another brand of dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> but this is honestly the worst dry shampoo I have ever used.</li>
            <li> my hair wasnt that oily, i could have gone another day without washing and still kept it down albeit</li>
            <li> I followed the directions to the letter the times I tried it (others tinkering just slightly to see if there was a difference with application).</li>
            <li> I got about half of a spray</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using less</li>
            <li> Tresemme and Bed Head are the only brands that I have tried, and I really hate myself for deciding to try something else right now.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s just not worth the trouble because there is aboslutely no benefit.  </li>
            <li> All day long I just wanted to wash my hair and get rid of the icky feeling on my head.</li>
            <li> What a mess.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, long hair.  </li>
            <li> Yet, the promise of a dry shampoo was too hard to resist - so I gave</li>
            <li> It did not clean my hair whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I use a little at a time, rub it in, and brush my hair.  </li>
            <li> My skin broke out with every use, whether it was a little or a lot.  </li>
            <li> it feels really dirty, and I certainly don&#x27;t want that smell on my pillow.</li>
            <li> I have very dark brown hair</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long, dark hair and my roots get oily like my face.</li>
            <li> my whole head of hair is sticky and dirty feeling, and I can&#x27;t wait to get home and shower.  </li>
            <li> You might as well spend the extra money and get a real dry shampoo, not this fake stuff.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair feel gross and ten times as dirty as before.</li>
            <li> It was really heavy and my hair felt gunky.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to describe it but a thick, wet powder.</li>
            <li> Not great, but it only costs about 5 dollars.</li>
            <li> It actually makes my hair look worse than before I spray it on.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t get oily, but, on a caregiver&#x27;s schedule, I do not have time to wash it everyday, so I thought this might be a time-saving alternative.</li>
            <li> Well, I picked it up when I ran by the store today and just tried it a few minutes ago.</li>
            <li> All around, I&#x27;d say I wasted a few bucks, but learned a lesson.</li>
            <li> everyday&#x27; person, but</li>
            <li> and it gets oily if I don&#x27;t wash it everyday</li>
            <li> it looks all greasy and limp.  </li>
            <li> I had been dead set on trying Bed Head&#x27;s</li>
            <li> The product really only works for a short period of time before it feels greasy, dull, weighed down, and dirty.</li>
            <li> it was extremely stiff and just plain sticky.</li>
            <li> I find that this one is difficult to get all out once it dries and it leaves MAJOR buildup on my brush</li>
            <li> and it was pretty bad.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s naturally very curly and thick and my whole life I&#x27;ve just had the worst time controlling it.</li>
            <li> Plus the oscar blandi one did not last very long and was very expensive.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;They were out of my usual produce (Suave) at the store, so I grabbed this instead.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it would work after two days of camping, but I&#x27;m anxious to find out.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> And as far as the scent, well, it smells like you didn&#x27;t wash your hair, so you used a can of spray to mask the smell of dirty hair.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what it is supposed to feel like, but my hair felt like it was even dirtier than before.  </li>
            <li> I have brunette, very thick wavy-curly hair, and it can seriously take an hour or two to wash, dry, and style it.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to try this product because I usually spend $12 for dry shampoo at Sephora and it was getting too expensive.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon, but I felt strongly enough about what an awful product it is to warn other potential buyers and write a review.    </li>
            <li> I know how to use it properly (a common critique of negative reviews I&#x27;ve seen).  </li>
            <li> , I can at least extend my styled look one...</li>
            <li> I would give this product a negative amount of stars if I could</li>
            <li> I mean a pimple-like rash on my neck and face that took weeks to go away.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the worst dry shampoo I have every tried.</li>
            <li> I have used Rockaholic&#x27;s Dirty Secret for a long time for those \\&quot;in between\\&quot; or \\&quot;I&#x27;m just too darn lazy to get up\\&quot; days.  </li>
            <li> and I was looking for something less expensive.</li>
            <li> seriously.</li>
            <li> Do NOT wait until your hair is ridiculously oily to use it or it will feel gunky.  </li>
            <li> This dry shampoo stinks and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using both more and less of the product and each time I was shocked at how awful it was.  </li>
            <li> but I found it too expensive for too little product.  </li>
            <li> it felt gross all day in my hair, about as bad as if I had just gone to work with greasy hair.    </li>
            <li> It will make you want to wash your hair immediately, it smells bad and it leaves a white film on your hair.</li>
            <li> Overall, I was disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li> I bought it and tried it out only to be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I have tried it several times now, and am thoroughly disappointed, and will never buy it again.    </li>
            <li> Some advice- buy baby powder (way cheaper) put some in you hand and rub it on your dirty hair, flip you hair upside down and shake it to rid the excess powder.</li>
            <li> i have very thick hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very thick</li>
            <li> I continued brushing but it just kept getting worse.</li>
            <li> I have fine/ thin hair</li>
            <li> I am an idiot for doing this a second time).  </li>
            <li> so it seems pointless to me to shower before just to get dirty again.</li>
            <li> and i hardly used any!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the bad reviews, but from my experience, A++  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was quite disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it is expensive</li>
            <li> The unfortunate part is, now I must wash my hair tonight since after using this stuff</li>
            <li> I am a bit of a snob when it comes to my hair products and was skeptical about trying a drug store brand.</li>
            <li> oh well.. then my mom (who was visiting at the time) looked at me like my head was falling off and said \\&quot;what&#x27;s wrong with your ears?\\</li>
            <li> It was heavy with product, and felt rank.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical but decided to buy it.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps I am doing it wrong</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look too awful if you have blonde hair, however i can say that I will not be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> so this in itself just explain just how angry I am.</li>
            <li> I had no idea what was wrong with me.</li>
            <li> I thought that maybe people were using it wrong</li>
            <li> It also smells like the nasty generic floral smell they use on scratch and sniff flowers or something.</li>
            <li> dry shampoo - Worst one I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Seriously, it&#x27;s insulting that that this is even marketed as a dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> It had a nasty wet feeling.</li>
            <li> If I was desperate, I&#x27;d use it, but to use in order to eliminate some washings during the week (which is what I was hoping to do), it didn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> If you want your hair to feel sticky and dirty use this product</li>
            <li> my hair looks just as dirty as before.</li>
            <li> I was wanting to hop in the shower to wash it, but with it being cold weather now and the heater going, my hair is drying out a bit.</li>
            <li> My bangs keep sticking in weird positions, and my ponytail (that I had to do!)</li>
            <li> I was wrong!  </li>
            <li> but at least with the baby powder, your hair won&#x27;t feel disgusting afterwards.  </li>
            <li> The serious hair loss started when I started using this piece of crap!</li>
            <li> but none were even close to this bad.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t that bad</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t work for everyone (hence the bad reviews)</li>
            <li> I have used Pssst before which isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> and I get bad split ends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reviewing this item and giving three stars because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as bad as one star...</li>
            <li> I tried it out, and it wasn&#x27;t bad.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ugly head.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> So disappointed by this product.</li>

            <li> I hate it.</li>
            <li> hate it.</li>
            <li> I use it EVERY morning because I walk my kids to school &amp; hated having to throw a hat over my nasty-looking hair to do it (even if I had just washed my hair the night before).</li>
            <li> Boy, was I disappointed!</li>
            <li> It worked well, but the smell was AWFUL.</li>
            <li> but it felt so disgusting.  </li>
            <li> and it still looked horrible.</li>
            <li> This product was the worst I have ever tried!  </li>
            <li> but I ended up having to shower to get the product out of my hair because it felt awful.</li>
            <li> but this product is horrible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible.</li>
            <li> Got home and sprayed it in my hair and HATED IT!</li>

            <li> This product is horrible!</li>
            <li> It was DISGUSTING.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is nasty to your hair, nasty to your respiratory system, nasty to your skin, and just downright offensive in odor.</li>
            <li> I figured the worst that could happen would be that it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s not the worst of it.  </li>
            <li> It is HORRIBLE!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> First, I have been using dry shampoo for years.  I know how to use it properly (a common critique of negative reviews I&#x27;ve seen).  I use a little at a time, rub it in, and brush my hair.  I also apply it only to the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were out of my usual produce (Suave) at the store, so I grabbed this instead.  BIG mistake.  My hair is STICKY and gross feeling.  It also smells funny.  The weirdest part is that the stickiness doesn&#x27;t just stick to the roots...my whole head of hair is sticky and dirty feeling, and I can&#x27;t wait to get home and shower.  My bangs keep sticking in weird positions, and my ponytail (that I had to do!) looks greasy and dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend dry shampoo, just not this brand.</li>
            <li> Over the past year, I have been trying different dry shampoos and decided to share my experience in hopes that it will help others find the right one for their hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Relevant about me: I have twin babies and don&#x27;t have time to shower and wash my hair in the mornings like I used to. I quickly found that even though I showered and washed my hair every night, by morning my hair was somewhat oily and needed refreshing. Here began my quest to find a dry shampoo that worked for me. I have shoulder length, straight, fine, color treated blonde hair and I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use it: I usually pull up most of my hair with a clasp, spray the roots, use flat iron, let down a little more of my hair, spray the roots, use flat iron, and keep repeating until I&#x27;ve sprayed and styled all my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like: It has a pleasant smell and goes on smoothly. When sprayed lightly, it dries up oils and refreshes the hair at first. It blends in well with my blonde hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like: I no longer use this dry shampoo because it didn&#x27;t last all day. It would look good right after styling, but after a few hours of wear, my hair looked oily again and needed refreshing once more. I had high hopes for this dry shampoo since the only brand of hair spray I use is Tresemme. Needless to say, I was quite disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After weighing the good and the bad,  I give it 2 stars. I did use up the bottle I bought, but would never buy this kind again. I don&#x27;t have time to use dry shampoo more than once a day. I am currently using Salon Grafix - Play it Big. (You can see my review of this one on its product page). This dry shampoo goes for about $10 a bottle at my local grocery store (Harris Teeter), but I only have to use it once in the morning and my hair looks good all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you&#x27;re interested, here are the other brands I&#x27;ve tried. You can find a more in depth review that I&#x27;ve done of these on their amazon product pages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pantene dry shampoo - Worst one I&#x27;ve tried. Didn&#x27;t refresh hair. Smelled awesome though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Salon Grafix Play It Big - This is the dry shampoo I currently use. I like that it has color tinted options, refreshes hair well, and smells fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suave dry shampoo: This was the one I used before finding Salon Grafix. It worked well, but the smell was AWFUL.</li>
            <li> This product works better than any other dry shampoo I have tried.  I have tried Jonathan, Batiste, Oscar Blandi, and Sammy.  I found that all of them were hard to get the white out of my hair, but this product \\&quot;brushed out\\&quot; much more easily.  Plus the oscar blandi one did not last very long and was very expensive.    I have very oily hair, and I look good with bangs, however, my bangs get very streaky towards the end of the day.  This product really helps to make my bangs appear normal again, and i also use it all over my head for a little extra umph.  I also like the smell.</li>
            <li> i have very thick hair so i thought this would be good.  my hair wasnt that oily, i could have gone another day without washing and still kept it down albeit it would just be flat...  it LOOKED cleaner but it felt so disgusting.  no matter how much i brushed it just wouldnt make that feeling go away.  i ended up putting my hair in a pony tail after all!  it felt like i had rubbed clay on my head and i hardly used any!!</li>
            <li> I should have known better.  I&#x27;ve never liked Tresemme products - they always make my hair feel gross.  Yet, the promise of a dry shampoo was too hard to resist - so I gave in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, it doesn&#x27;t DO anything.  You can get the same effect by dumping baby powder on your head...... but at least with the baby powder, your hair won&#x27;t feel disgusting afterwards.  My hair feels powdery on top, dirty/greasy from the middle down, and extra heavy and limp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just not worth the trouble because there is aboslutely no benefit.  I thought it would be nice to re-fresh my hair on the days when I don&#x27;t wash it, but no.  And it doesn&#x27;t even smell good - it smells just like their hairspray, which in my opinion isn&#x27;t too great to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and skip this product...... or do like I do and skip Tresemme products all together.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me, but even their shampoo makes my hair feel disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could give this product 0 stars.... and I wish I could get my $6 back.</li>
            <li> I am an 18 year old college student that has thin-normal, fine hair. I bought this a little while ago because my hair gets oily fast, and I can really only skip washing my hair one day, and even then it looks pretty greasy. I was expecting something that would absorb oil, and remove any odor, and generally make my hair feel nice. What I got was anything but  pleasurable results. I had used it a few times, following the directions, before I decided to give up on it. It left a very thick, white residue and made my hair feel stiff. It also left an unusual scent. I decided that just going without the dry shampoo would be the better option, because this made my hair feel twice as dirty than if I hadn&#x27;t used it. it does NOT do what it says it does. Would NEVER reccomend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised at all of the negative reviews. I have to think that maybe everyone is using WAY too much of this spray. In the past, I was loyal to the Oscar Blandi version, but once I saw that a similar product was available at a MUCH lower price, I thought I would give it a shot. This product is very similar to the OB version and works pretty much exactly the same. I have fine, blonde hair that tends to get oily after a long day of work. I use this to revive my hair before a night out and also one in a while in the morning to skip a washing. After a little experimentation, I discovered that less is definitely more here. I only spray this product at the roots, allow to dry and then rub/brush through the rest of my hair. I also then give my hair a quick shot with a blow dryer and round brush to give it an extra boost. I was pretty surprised at how well this inexpensive product works. Give it another shot and maybe it&#x27;ll work for you too.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this dry shampoo and have always wanted to try something like this for camping. I used VERY little on my super thick hair - only where the oil tends to collect and nowhere else. I only did a light spray even though my hair gets pretty oily. It worked just how I expected. I don&#x27;t know how it would work after two days of camping, but I&#x27;m anxious to find out. I just like that instead of either not washing, or washing and losing all of my style, I can at least extend my styled look one...maybe two extra days. It&#x27;s better than nothing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for those who feel like their hair is full of product after using, try using less. I think with this product the more you use, the ickier your hair will feel.</li>
            <li> I have fine thin hair that likes to get oily if I forgo washing it for too long. I don&#x27;t color my hair (naturally red). However, I know it&#x27;s healthier if I can manage not to wash my hair every day. Else I have to condition it heavily and that obviously can weigh it down. Normally on my day after washing, I wear my hair up so I don&#x27;t have to deal with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never tried dry shampoo before. But the ads were certainly enticing enough to give it a whirl. This product did not impress. I followed the directions to the letter the times I tried it (others tinkering just slightly to see if there was a difference with application). It&#x27;s ok temporarily, but feels like you have excessive product and filth on one&#x27;s head. And eventually, within a very short amount of time, the oily weighed feeling returns and I want to wash it even more than before. Also, if you have sensitive skin like me, it caused my forehead to break out a little near the hairline. Overall, I was disappointed with the product. I use the bottle now for when I&#x27;ve freshly washed my hair to give it texture like Jonathan&#x27;s Dirt (occasionally). When I want to put up my freshly clean hair it holds better. Obviously, not what the product was intended for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of my experience, I&#x27;ll try other brands to see if there is one I WILL like.</li>
            <li> I bought this item from a retail store for two reasons: I&#x27;m a new mom who doesn&#x27;t see a daily shower anymore and my hair gets greasy if I don&#x27;t wash it every day but dries quickly from excessive washing. I&#x27;ve used it twice, following the directions, and I&#x27;ve had the same results, my hair looks and feels even more oily than before. The second time I used this product I brushed my hair a lot to try to disperse the product and it still looked horrible. This product even left a residue on my hair dress. I have heard of dry shampoos that work really well, but this is particular brand is not even worth the $4.00 I spent.</li>
            <li> My favorite dry shampoo is Naturia by Rene Furterer but it is expensive so I was looking to save a little money when I purchased Fresh Start.  I have tried several dry shampoos and  I am well aware you have to shake it vigorously before each spray.  This product was the worst I have ever tried!  I was surprised to see so little powder come out of it and so much sticky residue.  It made my hair feel dirtier.  It is going in the trash.</li>
            <li> I have been using dry shampoo for almost a year but could not find it in stores so I was excited to see that Tresemme was making one that they sold in stores.  I bought it and tried it out only to be disappointed.  It was really heavy and my hair felt gunky.  I used a towel to take off some of the excess stuff.  I would not recommend this product, I think I will stick to Batiste in the future.  Batiste seems to work the best and is inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Naturally I have somewhat oily hair, so I have to wash it at least every other day to look decent. It&#x27;s really a bother when I don&#x27;t have time. I used to use something like that years ago, don&#x27;t even remember the brand, and it worked wonders, but was leaving white flour type residue that was taking ages to brush out. I like this product as it doesn&#x27;t do any of that. Cleans pretty reasonably provided that no water is involved. Smells awesome too.</li>
            <li> I am also surprised at all the negative reviews! I tried this when I was at the beach for a week and didn&#x27;t want to have to wash my color treated hair every day. I have been very impressed and have continued to use it. I do get the sense that the \\&quot;less is more\\&quot; idea is important to remember. I only spray it on the roots in the areas that I feel get most oily.  The 5.7 can should last everyone a while even if you have long hair, such as I do.</li>
            <li> I suppose if it was between nothing and this stuff, I&#x27;d use this stuff. But its no miracle and it felt gross all day in my hair, about as bad as if I had just gone to work with greasy hair.    Its very...thick. Imagine spraying some sort of....I don&#x27;t know how to describe it but a thick, wet powder. Even powder would be better, in my opinion.     It weighs your hair down alot and the sprayer is strange, it concentrates in one spot, so you can&#x27;t just \\&quot;mist\\&quot; your hairline, it comes out full blast and you have white hair until you brush it through.    It makes your hair look very dull, so it recommends you follow up with something for shine - but honestly, what&#x27;s the point if you&#x27;re just going to add more junk to your already greasy, covered up hair?    If I was desperate, I&#x27;d use it, but to use in order to eliminate some washings during the week (which is what I was hoping to do), it didn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes your hair LOOK clean, but it feels even greasier. If you do use it, make sure to use only HALF the recommended amount and only apply it to the roots.   Not great, but it only costs about 5 dollars.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to finally see an affordable hair powder on the market by a brand name. I had just ran out of my Bumble and Bumble and decided to give this one a whirl. Boy, was I disappointed! The spray was able to take away my greasiness but in its place it left a thick gunkiness which left my fine straight hair weighed down and clumpy. All day long I just wanted to wash my hair and get rid of the icky feeling on my head. It kind of felt like I had rubbed clay through my hair. I threw this product away, thankful that it didn&#x27;t waste too much money on a gross product.</li>
            <li> I saw the commercial and bought the product, hoping, like others, that between washes it would give my hair a little pick up. I have thick, medium length hair that is not oily, but normal. I am disappointed in this product. I tried it the first time, and like another reviewer, I looked like the bride of Frankenstein with gray all over. That day I brushed it all out, had icky white residue all over my brush and hands, and tried to style but I ended up having to shower to get the product out of my hair because it felt awful. A few days later I tried again thinking the first time maybe I overapplied, but, I still had the same result even with less product on my hair. Again, had the white/gray streaking, and upon brushing, had the white flaky stuff, sticky residue and in the end, my hair ended up looking greasy and flaky, and where it wasn&#x27;t greasy it was extremely stiff and just plain sticky. The models in the commercial with the bouncy flowing hair must have had a shower or used another product. It certainly was not this one. Save your money, or go spend more on a quality product.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is like putting spray pomade into your hair. It feels so gunky!! I hate it. Used it twice, and am throwing it away!!</li>
            <li> So disappointed by this product. It will make you want to wash your hair immediately, it smells bad and it leaves a white film on your hair. Oh, and there is also the problem with the can clogging.  Waste of money!</li>
            <li> * Treseme Dry Shampoo Did not work for me, unfortuneately.  * I did try it, but I still like the Bastiste brand better  * I&#x27;ve seen where this worked well for a girl on YouTube, oh well  * I have normal/dry, wavy med hair</li>
            <li> I have used this product many times. I would say that it works okay but I have tried others that work much better. It does have a better smell than others, like Pssssssssst!  These dry shampoos make my hair look cleaner but they don&#x27;t feel cleaner. It gives an odd dry kind of feeling but if it allows me to not wash my hair every day, then I&#x27;m good with that!  I would recommend Tresemme dry shampoo but I think Suave has a better dry shampoo product.</li>
            <li> I like Tresemme products but this product is horrible. It does not work. It actually makes my hair look worse than before I spray it on. I watched the video on their website to see how to use properly and read the directions on the bottle and can not tell that this product works. Baby powder works way better than this product. Save your money and buy a bottle of baby powder before you purchase this.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for the first time yesterday and had a severe allergic reaction to it. And I&#x27;ve never had a allergic reaction to ANYTHING before. The ER bill will probably cost me a bundle. No product is worth that. And it didn&#x27;t even make my hair look clean &amp; fresh. Not that they really look at that in the ER. Wish I could rate this product lower than one star.</li>
            <li> I think the main problem with this product is that people might not really know how to use it.  I know the first time, I didn&#x27;t wait for it to dry completely and it was pretty bad.  Afterwards I tried it again and my issues with it are as follows:  1) The smell: this can be a good or bad thing depending on the person.  The smell is quite strong but it&#x27;s probably good if your hair smells.  Despite this, the smell does go away and you should use the product in a well ventilated area.  2) Volume building: it only works if you distribute the product evenly and comb it through layer by layer.  If you just spray it on, the clays will sit on top of your hair and weigh it down.    3) White flecks: This product may ultimately be better for fair-haired people.  I think that depending on your scalp - the product works for me if it&#x27;s the first day \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; but further down the line, I think it&#x27;s more of an issue with my scalp&#x27;s tendency to have dandruff and not the clays.    Ultimately, I do think this product could work for you but there is a method to it.  I&#x27;ve seen sample size cans of this product but I don&#x27;t know where to get it.  Best thing to do is to try it (maybe with friends w/ oily hair) and decide for yourselves.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how many negative reviews are out there regarding this fabulous product.  Finally, at last, a product that will extend my in-between washings like never before.  Like the other reviewer who rated this product top notch, I have also been looking to buy this dry shampoo by the case!  I have gone to 5 different stores just yesterday alone to buy however many were left on the shelf, only to find them all sold out at every single store.  It is getting harder and harder to purchase, seeming it is flying off the shelves.  So, surprisingly enough the negative reviews, but the shelves are all empty?  I use this product every single week now and absolutely love the extra volume this product gives, what a bonus I was not expecting.  I have been using baby powder for years and the Tresemme citrus smells so great, what a nice \\&quot;extra-extra\\&quot; bonus.  I do agree with the other reviews that less product gives the best result.  I have had color-treated and high-lighted hair for years and my hair is so oily it requires me to wash it every single day.  Using the dry shampoo gives me so much more time for other things now.  I would recommend this product to anyone and everyone.  Just wish it was easier to purchase locally, may now have to resort to purchasing it online.  Other than that, cannot say enough about this wonderful product from Tresemme.</li>
            <li> After seeing the TV commercials and checking out the Tresemme website, I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. I have very long, thick red hair - color-treated since the gray has decided to rear it&#x27;s ugly head. My hair doesn&#x27;t get oily, but, on a caregiver&#x27;s schedule, I do not have time to wash it everyday, so I thought this might be a time-saving alternative. Well, I picked it up when I ran by the store today and just tried it a few minutes ago. HELP! It&#x27;s terrible. I may as well have poured baby powder on my head. I followed the directions explicitely: shake very well, hold 8-10 inches from your head, etc., and even used it sparingly. I let it sit for the instructed 1-2 minutes, then looked in the mirror. LOLOLOLOL - I looked like the bride of Frankenstein! Talk about gray! Even after brushing and brushing to get it out of my hair, it still looks gray along the hairline. And as far as the scent, well, it smells like you didn&#x27;t wash your hair, so you used a can of spray to mask the smell of dirty hair. My hair smelled fine to begin with! This is a smell, that once you smell it, when you smell it again, you&#x27;ll know you are near someone who didn&#x27;t wash their hair but used Tresemme Fresh Start(really?)instead. All around, I&#x27;d say I wasted a few bucks, but learned a lesson. The unfortunate part is, now I must wash my hair tonight since after using this stuff it feels really dirty, and I certainly don&#x27;t want that smell on my pillow.</li>
            <li> My hair is VERY dry and coarse, and I honestly can not wash it everyday.  In fact I have to go several days without washing it due to it being so dry.  I used this for the first time tonight.  PROS:  1.  made my hair smell good  2.  my hair appeared healthier in the mirror  (nice shine to it)  3.  easy to use  CONS:  1.  White, if you use too much you get dandruff like whiteness...............  I quickly learned to rub in the stuff and not spray too much to avoid dandruff.  I was at a casino for about 4 hours, and honestly my hair does not smell like smoke like it usually does.  I am going to be using this product a lot.  :)</li>
            <li> I used to love using the TIGI dry shampoo but their bottle is defected so was on the hunt for another good dry shampoo. Saw a commercial for this product and bought it asap! Got home and sprayed it in my hair and HATED IT! It made my hair feel so gross and really thick as though there was even more grease in it! It looked clean but I couldn&#x27;t stand how nasty my hair felt. There are other brands of dry shampoo that are reasonably priced that work just as good as the TIGI one did like Beyond the Zone Dry Shampoo which takes the grease away AND my hair actually feels clean lol</li>
            <li> As the ONE positive reviewer stated, I&#x27;m also unsure as to why this product has so many negative reviews.  Before finding Tresemme dry shampoo, I was a longtime user of Bumble and Bumble dry shampoo.  I have very fine, dark hair and used the black one.  I love that product except that if it rains, forget about it -- the dark color will spread down your face.  It&#x27;s also very thick so I decided to try Tresemme&#x27;s dry shampoo.  The cheap price caught my eye!  I spray it in bursts and aim straight at my roots and I only spray it about 5 times around the top of my head.  I wait about 30 seconds to a minute (1-2 minutes as it instructs on the can is too long!) and I use a fine-toothed comb to brush out my hair.  And brush I do!  I brush my hair back, I brush it forward, I brush it to the side, just so it will get evenly coated throughout the whole top of my head.  And voila, I instantly have thicker, bouncier, DRIER locks.  It&#x27;s really cool and I can&#x27;t believe I used B&amp;B dry shampoo for all those years, paying $28-$30 for a smaller bottle.  I honestly don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ever going back.  Plus, this one smells fantastic.     I&#x27;m actually amazed that I&#x27;m one of the positive reviewers because usually when a product has overwhelmingly negative reviews, I&#x27;m right along with them.</li>
            <li> If you want your hair to feel sticky and dirty use this product it will make your hair look dirtier and sticky w/a weirrd residue.Skip this and try another brand! This product is horrible!</li>
            <li> I read the directions on the bottle and followed them and the results were just okay. It didn&#x27;t leave my feeling entirely clean like after a wash but it was better than before. I&#x27;m not entirely persuaded that this product worked any better than water. I have very thick, long, dark hair and my roots get oily like my face. Other reviewers complained the product left their hair gunky but I didn&#x27;t experience this. I think due to the length of my hair I did have to use a bit more to get optimal results. One other reviewer gave it a good score after blow drying and I think that might be worth trying.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try the product but disappointed with the outcome; it smelled nice though. I will not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I too have been a long time user of Oscar Blandi and I was looking for something less expensive. I had actually read a few positive reviews about this product so I decided to give it a try. I have medium length blonde hair with light blonde hightlights so my hair is super dry shampoo friendly, as it is light and the shampoo usually blends very easily. I have tried several kinds and none worked as well as the Blandi product but none were even close to this bad. This stuff is an abomination. I have given it several shots. I am tossing it. You would be better off rubbing butter and baby powder in your hair. I totally agree with the other reviewers who state their hair felt even dirtier. I usually try not to wash my hair on the weekends if I am going to the beach, working outside, etc. This stuff wasn&#x27;t even acceptable for the beach, that is how gross it is. It feels stiff, greasy, powdery and waxy all at the same time. The smell isn&#x27;t that bad but it makes you look as if you are doing the walk of shame after a night in a sweaty club. Stay away.</li>
            <li> I have long, straight, normal, untreated hair and wash it every other day. I thought Fresh Start would be great for those mornings when I have to rush out the door and don&#x27;t have time to wash my hair. I followed the directions closely - spraying at the roots, not spraying too much, keeping the can 12\\&quot; away - and then waited several minutes. When I brushed my hair, it became this oily, clumpy mess that looked far dirtier than my unwashed hair. I continued brushing but it just kept getting worse. Imagine putting PAM cooking spray or mineral oil on your hair. That is what I look like right now. I have tried the product twice with the same results each time. If you want to try it, I suggest you do it when you have time to follow up with a good washing of your hair. I suggest Tresemme reformulate this or take it off the market completely.</li>
            <li> I have to wash my hair normally every day in order for it not to look oily because I have really straight, less than thick hair.  If I would skip a day, I would use some baby powder on the roots and then style it up.  When I kept seeing advertisements for this product, I was really hoping that it would work for me.  I bought this product only to bring it home for it not to even spray.  I got about half of a spray and then it just stopped working.  I really wanted to try it so I went and bought another one.  I got to try the product a couple of times and now this one is not working any more either!  Anyway, my hair looked just as gross as before I sprayed it except for flatter.  I should just stick with the baby powder or try the other products everyone is talking about.</li>
            <li> I have used Rockaholic&#x27;s Dirty Secret for a long time for those \\&quot;in between\\&quot; or \\&quot;I&#x27;m just too darn lazy to get up\\&quot; days.  It works amazing.  I saw the ads for this and thought it would be a nice alternative, more readily available and cheaper.  It was DISGUSTING.  It looked like I had poured oil into my hair.  I used a blow dryer and it dried out a little bit, but felt just gross all day.  every time I touched my head I grossed out again.  All I can say is, THROW IT OUT AND BUY ROCKAHOLIC INSTEAD!!</li>
            <li> I bought Tresemme&#x27;s Fresh Start dry shampoo on a whim. I noticed it at the grocery store, and thought I would try it out. I&#x27;ve used dry shampoo in the past (Big Sexy Hair&#x27;s Volumizing Dry Shampoo) and it was just okay. I found that Big Sexy Hair&#x27;s dry shampoo left my hair feeling stiff, straw-like and filmy, and it did not smell good (my husband also pointed that out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try to only wash my hair every other day (I have thin, medium length hair that I usually blow dry and flat iron), so I was curious to try another brand of dry shampoo. Tresemme&#x27;s price tag is so tempting, that I had to try it out. I&#x27;m glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is SO much better than I was expecting. I paired it with the Fresh Start Refreshing Mist, and it really does help to remove the smell of day old hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sprayed the dry shampoo on very lightly over my roots, and concentrated a little more on the areas that I know get the greasiest. I left it on for about 1 minute and then brushed and combed thoroughly, then styled as usual with my flat iron. I found that my hair&#x27;s greasy spots looked clean, and made me feel cleaner because it looked fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been 8 hours and my hair still looks pretty fresh (as if I washed it 8 hours ago). My hair tangles pretty easily, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s gotten worse with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with what other users have said about less being more. I think that is the key with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if the Refreshing Mist is completely necessary, but it&#x27;s a nice touch to add the fresh scent. And Tresemme is so inexpensive!!&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review helps you.&lt;br /&gt;-MV</li>
            <li> I have used Oscar Blandi dry shampoos for about 3 years. I would find myself constantly having to reapply throughout the day because the greasiness would come back and limpness would occur. I am a bit of a snob when it comes to my hair products and was skeptical about trying a drug store brand. Oh boy, am I glad I did. My hair literally looks clean and fresh, as if I was on day 1 rather than day 2. Amazing! I found I only had to reapply at most once depending on level of activity, weather. I will warn you, however, that this product will not work for everyone. I have straight, healthy hair that tends to get greasy at the roots and dry at the ends. My friend whose hair is dry, curly, and color-processed finds this product turns \\&quot;pasty\\&quot; in her hair. Fortunately for me, I am thrilled this much cheaper product works well with my hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is nasty to your hair, nasty to your respiratory system, nasty to your skin, and just downright offensive in odor. I bought this product because I have a 7 month old, and sometimes I just don&#x27;t have the me-time in the morning to shower and do my hair. I figured the worst that could happen would be that it didn&#x27;t work. I was wrong!  I followed the directions. At first, right after spraying it, I was amazed. My hair appeared clean and almost bouncy. I waited the 1-2 minutes and then began brushing, as directed. Suddenly my hair was a greasy, flat, rat&#x27;s nest and felt like I&#x27;d run Elmer&#x27;s glue through it. I had noticed the hair spray/burnt hair smell when I started spraying it, but I expected it to go away like hairspray does. That was almost three hours ago, and I&#x27;ve had my paddle fan going and my window open the entire time and my apartment still reeks! I feel like I&#x27;m breathing in chemicals and my bathroom is essentially a gas chamber. But that&#x27;s not the worst of it.  I figured it smelled, but oh well.. then my mom (who was visiting at the time) looked at me like my head was falling off and said \\&quot;what&#x27;s wrong with your ears?\\&quot; When I looked, the part of my ears that touched my hair (Um, most of them?) were bright red, hot, and painful to the touch. You know, like a chemical burn. So I started reading the list of ingredients... do you know what&#x27;s IN this stuff? Like a thousand kinds of alcohol, for one. Yeah it dries up the oil (sort of?) but mostly it just dries out your hair. Permanently.  For what little good this product does, it is DEFINITELY not worth it. You will smell like a gallon of chemicals all day, and no matter how awesome someone&#x27;s hair looks I won&#x27;t notice if I&#x27;m getting a headache standing ten feet away from them.  This product is definitely not on par with Tresemme&#x27;s other lines. I trusted the brand, but I should have done my research!!! Avoid at ALL costs! Take that money and buy a hat!</li>
            <li> I had used a few drug store brand dry shampoos before.  I had good success with the Got2b Rock Encore one and also the Salon Grafix brand Walgreens carries.  I saw the Tresemme one on sale, and thought it was worth a try.  I will never use it again.  I left a white residue in my hair and I ended up having to wash and restyle my hair anyway, which is what I was trying to avoid.  I did shake it very well and held it 8\\&quot; from the hair.  I have brunette, very thick wavy-curly hair, and it can seriously take an hour or two to wash, dry, and style it.  I like the dry shampoo to just give me one more day between stylings in the bang and crown areas, but this one is getting thrown away.  Sticking to the Got2b and Salon Grafix since they are all about the same price anyway.</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst dry shampoo I have every tried. I got it because I needed a travel size dry shampoo  and this was the only one I could find. It goes on more like a very weak hairspray, it doesn&#x27;t work very well initially, and by the end of the day my hair was more greasy than it would have been if I hadn&#x27;t used it! A total waste of money. Batiste has a much much better product. I use their Tropical and it works a treat.</li>
            <li> Normally I&#x27;m a &#x27;wash my hair everyday&#x27; person, but after moving to LA I noticed that my hair condition deteriorated very rapidly, drying out, losing all it&#x27;s color, and splitting at the ends a lot faster than it normally would.  I have fine, long, lightened hair, so splitting and loss of color is to be expected, but surely not just one month since it last got cut.  Someone told me the water was a lot more drying here, so I thought perhaps I could use dry shampoo to allow me to go an extra day without washing my hair.    I shook the can and sprayed the product at my roots around the front of my face and parting as directed.  I also sprayed some on the underneath layers at the roots.  Left it for 5 minutes or so until the product dried to a white powdery finish, and them attempted to brush/blend through with a bristle brush.  This being my first attempt at dry shampoo I am not sure what it is supposed to feel like, but my hair felt like it was even dirtier than before.  It was heavy with product, and felt rank.  Throughout the day I had to go into the bathroom and &#x27;fluff&#x27; my hair to try and give it some body as any body that this product gave it would quickly drop making my hair look limp and greasy.  Maybe if I&#x27;d filled it with hairspray after using the dry shampoo in the morning then it would have held it&#x27;s &#x27;rock star&#x27; grungy bed head look, but as it was I just felt uncomfortable all day at work.    I might try this product again just to see if perhaps I used too much the first time, or to see if there is a knack on how to use it that I need to figure out, but I&#x27;d definitely be doing it on a weekend day where I didn&#x27;t have anything important to do, just in case.  All in all, not an overwhelmingly positive first experience.    Pros:  None, yet  Cons:  Sits heavy in your hair, not good for fine hair as can make it look limp and greasy</li>
            <li> I have straight oily hair, and have happily used Batiste&#x27;s dry shampoo products since I discovered dry shampoo about 2 years ago.  But I can&#x27;t find Batiste locally, have to order it through Amazon, so I was excited to find this Tresemme FreshStart Dry Shampoo for Oily/Straight Hair at my local CVS.    It is HORRIBLE!  It&#x27;s sticky and nasty - I actually double-checked the can after I sprayed it on, thinking I had somehow accidentally picked up hair spray!  I didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon, but I felt strongly enough about what an awful product it is to warn other potential buyers and write a review.    STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> This product is terrible... what the foam? seriously. all it did everytime was make my hair more greasy. hate it.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I have very naturally oily hair and for years I&#x27;ve been bound to the shower/Hairdryer/Straighteners every morning which is so time consuming!  No such thing as get up and go for me... until now.  I&#x27;ve tried other dry shampoos in the past and all they did was leave a residue and weigh my hair down even more but this is a winner.  Even after 2 long days in a really warm office in the middle of summer, my hair still looked reasonably fresh.  It won&#x27;t work for everyone (hence the bad reviews) but I can honestly say it&#x27;s worth speculating a few pounds to give it a try because if it works for you, it brings semi-freedom from the shower head!</li>
            <li> I bought this product due to having fine hair that I must wash at least every other day.  I was skeptical but decided to buy it.  I have tried it several times now, and am thoroughly disappointed, and will never buy it again.    My skin broke out with every use, whether it was a little or a lot.  I mean a pimple-like rash on my neck and face that took weeks to go away.  It looks like zits - which is lovely, but it&#x27;s a rash.  I don&#x27;t think there was an amount that I used that was right - just a little did nothing and a little more gives you a lovely gray-headed look, that&#x27;s not unlike you dusting your hair with flour.  This stuff does not brush out.      They should say that this product is not for fine hair, and that you should test it on your skin before trying.    The point - my hair felt heavier - so more flat because it&#x27;s fine - and dirtier.  Totally not what you&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair and my scalp is naturally oily. Wanting to conserve water by not having to shower every single morning, I bought some of this dry shampoo spray since it claims to clean hair and remove oil. I followed the directions, lifting my hair at the roots and spraying it on, then rubbing it in gently and leaving it on for 3-5 minutes. Well, my hair definitely did NOT feel cleaner-it felt even greasier! It also looked greasier with an unnatural shine. Bah! Maybe I used too much, or maybe my hair is just too thick or my scalp too oily for this stuff to work properly. In any case, I&#x27;m not buying this again as it does not work whatsoever for me.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different application techniques for this product because I really wanted it to work. Of course I followed the directions the first few times, but it still makes my hair look greasier than it did before application. It doesn&#x27;t do a thing for my hair (medium length, highlighted, keratin straightened). I love the idea, but it doesn&#x27;t deliver...</li>
            <li> Product was awful - made my fine shiny hair lifelessly dull &amp; coarse - could barely pull a brush through it.&lt;br /&gt;Tried it a couple times, same results each time.&lt;br /&gt;Threw it away.</li>
            <li> Product works just as it should. Great price too.</li>
            <li> I have no problems with this product that sound as nightmarish as everyone else&#x27;s. I bought the minis to take with me to the gym and the cans don&#x27;t clog, my hair never feels greasy, I have no white residue (my hair is very dark brown and long), and it doesn&#x27;t weigh me down or smell too overpowering once I have worked it through my hair. I use small sprays on the sides, top and back of my head, probably 6 small sprays max and massage it into my scalp. I actually just used this tonight so I wouldn&#x27;t have to have the hassle of drying and my hair is just fine. I don&#x27;t know if people are using too much or if the larger bottles have functional issues but I have had no problem with the minis or the product and it has been a great solution for not over washing my hair. It&#x27;s a shame that because of all of the negative reviews I think this product will be short lived. I&#x27;m sorry to hear that other people have had so many problems.</li>
            <li> I have used Pssst before which isn&#x27;t bad. It does leave your hair a little white but worked through out the day. I have fine/ thin hair and it gets oily if I don&#x27;t wash it everyday but if I do then it also gets dry easily. So I bought this when I saw the commercials figuring Tressame is a decent brand but I don&#x27;t like it at all. The product really only works for a short period of time before it feels greasy, dull, weighed down, and dirty. Perhaps I am doing it wrong but I haven&#x27;t had a problem with Pssst. I think I&#x27;m going back to that, or trying the new Victoria Secret Sexy Dry Shampoo because the whole line of hair products has been receiving good reviews.</li>
            <li> I am at work right now.  My hair looks as if I have washed it with car oil and mud.  There is nothing I can do to make this bad-hair-day better other than throwing the 2 cans of this dry shampoo garbage away the minute I get home.  I have thick, long hair.  I am not meticulous about keeping it perfect- impossible!  In fact, I kind of let my hair do its own thing 97% of the time and I get loads of compliments from all sorts of people.  Tresemme has made a fool out of me!  I look like I slept in a garbage can last night.  If your looking for an affordable dry shampoo that can be found at most pharmacies, I highly recommend Bed Head.  Tresemme and Bed Head are the only brands that I have tried, and I really hate myself for deciding to try something else right now.  Should have bought Bed Head.  Why....why!!!!????  (This is my second attempt, believing that I surely misread the directions the first time...I am an idiot for doing this a second time).  If I could upload pictures on this review, I would show you the gunk that is left on my hands after I run my fingers through my oil-slick.  It&#x27;s pretty gross, ladies.  This is my first review ever, and I am doing this so none of you will make this mistake, and Tresemme will rethink their recipe here.</li>
            <li> It takes A LOT for this product to work the slightest bit in my hair and about an hour later my hair looks just as dirty as before. Some advice- buy baby powder (way cheaper) put some in you hand and rub it on your dirty hair, flip you hair upside down and shake it to rid the excess powder. Works way better!!</li>
            <li> This product is horrible! If you&#x27;re looking for a dry shampoo do NOT buy this one. Dove makes a dry shampoo that&#x27;s amazing. This one almost sprays wet and if you have oily hair at all makes it feel and look more oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my third can of this product.  I. Love. It.  I have fine light blonde hair, and it tends to get oily/flat after the first day.  I&#x27;ve used this product right after a shower to give my hair some additional volume (especially before a long day), or second day I will spray around my crown, and WOW.  My hair has a ton of volume and it smells fantastic.  A lot of times I&#x27;ll use it before putting my hair up, and it looks like I have 3x the hair and looks perfectly fresh.  I have gotten tons of compliments on my hair while using this product as well and people commenting on how great I smell, which is at times a little awkward though welcome :)  I&#x27;m not sure about the bad reviews, but from my experience, A++  Hint, you can get this at the big box stores for a substantially better price.</li>
            <li> Got this product as I was to have surgery and it was such a mess to use.....easier to get a friend to drive me to beauty salon</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and it takes a long time to dry and style my hair. I was wanting to hop in the shower to wash it, but with it being cold weather now and the heater going, my hair is drying out a bit. I flopped my hair over and sprayed only along the roots, parting every so often to cover all the roots along my hair. I waited about 2 minutes for it to dry, brushed it out, and now it&#x27;s full of volume and looks great. I don&#x27;t know what the other users were doing wrong, but it works great for me! I am considering giving it as a part of my christmas gift baskets to family. It&#x27;s so convenient. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple years now without any complaints.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have really oily hair, but if I wash it everyday, it gets really dried out and I get bad split ends. I figured this would be the perfect solution but it was not... It is just a bottle of more oil and grease in a bottle. It did not clean my hair whatsoever. It was very sticky and matted my hair together and did not brush out. I could barely wash it out when I washed my hair. I am going to try the foam shampoo... Maybe that one will work better. I definitely do not recommend this to anyone!!</li>
            <li> I honestly think that the people giving this negative reviews are using too much of this product.  The best way to go about it is to use a little at a time and apply more if needed.  Do NOT wait until your hair is ridiculously oily to use it or it will feel gunky.  It&#x27;s not a miracle worker!&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. I wanted to try this product because I usually spend $12 for dry shampoo at Sephora and it was getting too expensive.  This stuff is not dry shampoo its hair spray.  It smells like hairspray, is sticky, and sits in your hair.  I have naturally curly hair and I was looking for a product to use in my hair when I straighten it and want to keep it straight for a few extra days.  You might as well spend the extra money and get a real dry shampoo, not this fake stuff.  It made my hair more greasy and stiff.  They need to reevaluate this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reviewing this item and giving three stars because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as bad as one star...I think many don&#x27;t understand exactly how to use dry shampoos.  I have been using them on and off for the last 10 years or so myself.  I can tell you that this one is certainly &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; but there are better products out there.  I find that this one is difficult to get all out once it dries and it leaves MAJOR buildup on my brush and I&#x27;m one of those who keeps a very clean brush...I clean the hair out of it every time I use it and wash it thoroughly often.  Upon using said brush and this dry shampoo today, there was so much buildup that it shed on my black shirt as if I have dandruff.  It does work okay on my hair...making it appear fresher and giving it a nice clean scent.  I definitely prefer the last brand that I used which was the &amp;#34;Not Your Mother&#x27;s Clean Freak Refreshing Dry Shampoo&amp;#34; (http://www.amazon.com/Not-Your-Mothers-Refreshing-Shampoo/dp/B0057NE7NQ/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1409773515&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;not+your+mothers+dry+shampoo).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how some of the other reviewers are using this product, but I&#x27;m not having ANY issues with it. My hair is extremely fine &amp; has to washed at least once a day or it looks like an oil spill on my head. I figured anything is worth a shot once, but I love this product so much that I&#x27;m looking for a site that will sell it by the case. I use it EVERY morning because I walk my kids to school &amp; hated having to throw a hat over my nasty-looking hair to do it (even if I had just washed my hair the night before). Now I can just spray this on, fix my daughter&#x27;s hair while it&#x27;s drying, brush mine out &amp; go. It gives it lots of body, too, which is just an added bonus. Love love love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I gave this dry shampoo a try because it&#x27;s only $5. It&#x27;s worth only $5. The first thing I noticed was the smell - it smells like hair spray, which I don&#x27;t use hair spray so I don&#x27;t want my head to smell like it.  After spraying the amount I usually use in hair, turning my head upside down to finger through, and turning upright again, my fingers were covered in what looked like white powder.  I also noticed that my roots (that yes need to be touched up) had turned a shade of white/gray.  It doesn&#x27;t look too awful if you have blonde hair, however i can say that I will not be buying this product again. Big Sexy is were it&#x27;s at.</li>
            <li> This product is really great if you use it properly and trust me once you get used to it you&#x27;ll love it. Try spraying it in your hair first thing in the morning before washing your face,brushing your teeth or putting on make up. Massage the product into your hair because it IS powdery. But then throw your hair up in a poney or bun and finish getting ready. After about 10-15 mins the product has soaked up any oils and has given your hair new life. If you&#x27;re nervous about it you can even put it on before bed and let it soak up oils overnight which is great too. I have very dark brown hair and it doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast when used the right way. Also be sure you&#x27;re holding the can almost an as length away.</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t believe that this is sold as a dry shampoo - I swear that no matter how closely (or not closely) I follow the directions it makes my hair MORE oily.  It is the opposite of dry \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot; it&#x27;s like spraying oil into your hair.  I&#x27;ve tried using both more and less of the product and each time I was shocked at how awful it was.  Seriously, it&#x27;s insulting that that this is even marketed as a dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> this is a fantastic product just remember to use only a little. too much and it defeats the purpose</li>
            <li> I REALLY wanted this to work.  I have oily hair and I envy my friends who wash their hair every three days without stinky, greasy, separated locks.  I dutifully shook the can before each and every spray.  I used a little at a time, letting it completely dry and brushing afterward.  What a mess.  In the time it took me to brush the dandruffy looking goo out of my hair, I could have taken a shower, washed, conditioned and styled my hair and been dressed and primped for a night out.  And I didn&#x27;t think I used that much!  My dream lives on . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  The Batiste line works much better but I found it too expensive for too little product.  I have started using baby powder and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.  Like the sprays, it makes my hair a bit duller, without much shine, but it absorbs the oils.  My hair is rather dark and the baby powder blends in easily.  Way better than this stuff ever did.</li>
            <li> EWW, Tresemme are you listening to us? It had a nasty wet feeling. It looked greasy. I had to dump baby powder on top just to salvage it before I went out.  When I complained to two other friends, they each said they had the exact same experience. Do yourself a favor and RUN! My friends recommend Dove dry shampoo as the best low budget option, and my previous beloved dry shampoo was Klorane (you can find it at Ulta) but I wanted to find a cheaper alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this dry shampoo a chance on three different occasions and then dumped the full can into the TRASH. And I never do that with full product. I was hopeful that maybe it was user error, but three tries was too many.</li>
            <li> I use this every other day because I have class Monday, Wednesday, Friday and I take a PE class so I get sweaty and everything so it seems pointless to me to shower before just to get dirty again. I shower Tuesday and Thursday night and then use the spray the next morning. I noticed that I had to use quite a bit of it, but it works well enough. It still doesn&#x27;t look like freshly showered hair, but there is a good enough difference. I&#x27;m not sure how it would do against a full few days of non-washed hair, because my hair tends to be on the oily side, especially my bangs, but for a quick touch-up before going to class in the morning, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised by all the one star reviews here. I tried it out, and it wasn&#x27;t bad.  My hair is brown, mostly straight and quite fine so even one day of not washing and it looks all greasy and limp.  One day I just wanted to run to the store so I tried it, and it actually did make my hair look both less oily and thicker.  Felt gross as anything, but it looked alright.  It&#x27;s possible my expectations were low, as I hadn&#x27;t used a dry shampoo in some 20 years prior to this, and it was definitely an improvement from way back when.</li>
            <li> I had been dead set on trying Bed Head&#x27;s Oh Bee Hive dry shampoo for a few weeks but kept putting it off due to it&#x27;s high price. A friend of mine recommended I try this product. It was $4.99 at Target so I bought it on the spot. I used it and saw immediate results. The slightly greasy hair look clean again, and I also noticed a nice shine. I didn&#x27;t have to use much. I concentrated mostly on my roots but also gave a few sprays throughout the rest of my hair. I bought this kind of tresemme dry shampoo because it&#x27;s specified as volumizing. I have to say that I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in volume so for that reason I&#x27;m giving the product 3 stars. Had it added the volume it advertised it would be an easy 4. I will definitely continue using my bottle until it is gone. I do plan on spending the extra once it&#x27;s gone to compare the difference with Bed Heads product.</li>
            <li> Perfect, due to a busy schedule, plus it was cheaper than the price(s) at a brick and mortar store which has worldwide stores.</li>
            <li> This product reminds me of spray on deodorant or tan-in-a-can. I used it once and realized that it was technology that needs to be improved on before I use it in my hair again. I don&#x27;t like the feeling of &amp;#34;wet powder&amp;#34; on my scalp...</li>
            <li> This is the first review i&#x27;ve ever written about any product. Normally I don&#x27;t care enough to write one so this in itself just explain just how angry I am. I have always had way too much hair. It&#x27;s naturally very curly and thick and my whole life I&#x27;ve just had the worst time controlling it. This summer I decided it would be easier to wash my hair less often when I have it blown out so that I don&#x27;t have to work with it as much. I thought hey, tresemme is supposed to have a good dry shampoo. Maybe I&#x27;ll try that. Huge mistake. Not only did it make my hair more greasy than it was to begin with, it made it so dry and tangled that even after I washed it and combed it out, so much hair came out that I thought I had some sort of disease. I&#x27;m not kidding. I had no idea what was wrong with me. I started eating meat again after 6 years of devoted vegetarianism incase it was protein or iron deficiency. I threw away my regular shampoo and started taking biotin. I had no idea what it could be. Then I put the pieces together. The serious hair loss started when I started using this piece of crap! Now I have almost no hair left on my head and signifiant bald spots. I&#x27;m only 20 years old and it&#x27;s absolutely humiliating having to walk around like this! I would give this product a negative amount of stars if I could and I&#x27;m going to find out if there&#x27;s a way I can sue this company. I now have to cut most of my hair off after working hard to grow it long and have been having severe panic attacks due to my hair loss. So not only do I want my money back for this shit product I would also like them to pay for my therapy bills.</li>
            <li> I tried this a couple years ago and was so disappointed that I wrote the company and they promptly sent me a coupon so I could more of this useless stuff. Last week I saw it on sale and thought they may have reworked the formula by now so I bought it. Same result...greasy, stringy, clumps of hair and I followed the directions carefully. Do not buy this. Suave is much better and Batiste is the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using less and I&#x27;ve tried using more. My hair just feels stiff, and full of residue.  It really does feel dirtier.  I could only see using it for some elaborate up-do when you really want your hair to have texture and stickiness. Blah.</li>
            <li> I thought that maybe people were using it wrong but this is honestly the worst dry shampoo I have ever used. It made my hair feel gross and ten times as dirty as before. It also smells like the nasty generic floral smell they use on scratch and sniff flowers or something. This product was overall very displeasing to me.</li>
            <li> LOVE!!!  Will reorder when i run out!</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo stinks and doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve tried 2 other dry shampoo brands after this and they both worked 10x better and didn&#x27;t have such a strong scent.</li>
            <li> I bought this for two reasons. One, I live in the country and frequently lose power during storms, meaning I can&#x27;t shower. And secondly, I try not to wash my hair more often than I have to because I dye it. That being said, I have fine hair that gets greasy very quickly. I thought this would be a great solution, but it&#x27;s the exact opposite! My hair looks relatively okay (no white residue, a little less oily), even though it&#x27;s dark, but it feels like I haven&#x27;t washed it in a week! I can&#x27;t stand to even touch it and no attempts to volumize it help now that the dry shampoo has gunked it up and weighed it down. I&#x27;ll definitely never be buying this again!0</li>
