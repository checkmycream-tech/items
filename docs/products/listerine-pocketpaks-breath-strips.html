    <ol>
            <li>Great taste!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not found a flavor of these strips that wasn&#x27;t delightful.  </li>
            <li>Got here on time Great flavor and great for after eating</li>
            <li>These are perfectly strong with great taste!</li>
            <li>This is a good product though.</li>
            <li>They are a nice mints.</li>
            <li>Yes, they do taste very strong, but then I knew that.  </li>
            <li>Can take it everywhere, it is very comfortable to carry, takes up almost no space.</li>
            <li>My friends in Russia also love them.</li>
            <li>is better.</li>
            <li>and I paid more than twice what the price is now in all stores.  </li>
            <li>I can take most of the blame for that myself.  </li>
            <li>Better than a breath mint, but this have some &#x27;sting&#x27;</li>
            <li>I love how compact they are.</li>
            <li>- the best possible recommendation.</li>
            <li>Strong flavor.</li>
            <li>I like these because they freshen up the breath quickly and are better than chewing gum.</li>
            <li>Ordered it in cinnamon flavor, got cool heat</li>
            <li>What I do with these is switch the mint one to this red plastic holder so I can more easily see when I am out.</li>
            <li>Pretty hot!  </li>
            <li>I miss read the amount sold and felt I paid too much for the amount I got.  </li>
            <li>I appreciated getting a refund.</li>
            <li>The flavor of these are way better than any other listerine breath strip.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t carry in stores and quick breath picker upper</li>
            <li>I LOVE these little strips of breath heaven.  </li>
            <li>With candy drops or gum you easily know when you are coming down to the end but not with these.  </li>
            <li>especially those in a long meeting, at the end, before speaking, you can use it to give a rich breath to your mouth.</li>
            <li>I prefer the cinnamon flavor over the others Listerine offers.</li>
            <li>There are a number of different flavors, I like the “Cool Heat” which is close to cinnamon and also for a few seconds is “hot” to the tongue like a “fireball” candy might be.  </li>
            <li>Cinnamon is by far my favorite, and I have had a hard time finding it at my local drug and/or grocery stores.</li>
            <li>They do what they are supposed to do--make my breath smell fresh better than toothpaste--and there is apparently some science behind cinnamon vs other flavors.</li>
            <li>Secondly, the package is quite small and easily fits into your pocket.  </li>
            <li>If you like the taste of regular Listerine mouth wash, you might like this; but I wanted a cinnamon flavor in my mouth (such as the old cinnamon Tic-Tac&#x27;s), and the Listerine taste overpowered everything.  </li>

            <li> First - these breath strips really do clean up any bad breath when eating out or when you are not home to rinse or brush your teeth.  </li>
            <li> These work well for me at night when I wake up with a dry mouth from working outside in the heat.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t want the full blast I usually pull a strip half way out then shut the lid, breaking the strip in half.</li>
            <li> Works well for dry mouth!</li>
            <li> Thirdly, I cannot give it 5 stars because I hate that you cannot tell when you are coming down to the last few strips; the filled container doesn’t look much different than when you only have 2 or 3 left…that’s tough.  </li>
            <li> and these are so small it doesn’t matter.  </li>
            <li> I hate carrying anything I absolutely don’t need to</li>
            <li> Sorry, it is not the product&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li> I was wrong about that</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe these are not in stores anywhere! Don&#x27;t know if they are discontinued or what. The flavor of these are way better than any other listerine breath strip. If they discontinued making them, they should reconsider!</li>
            <li> Sorry, it is not the product&#x27;s fault. I just don&#x27;t like them. It felt like melting plastic in my mouth, but others like them. Just not for me.</li>
            <li> These are perfectly strong with great taste!</li>
            <li> I like these because they freshen up the breath quickly and are better than chewing gum. My friends in Russia also love them.</li>
            <li> They are a nice mints. especially those in a long meeting, at the end, before speaking, you can use it to give a rich breath to your mouth. Can take it everywhere, it is very comfortable to carry, takes up almost no space. But I like the mint flavor. is better.It is stronger. lasts longer.</li>
            <li> While these do the job, they taste like listerine and not cinnamon.  However, they do what they need to do.</li>
            <li> I miss read the amount sold and felt I paid too much for the amount I got.  I returned the product.  I appreciated getting a refund.</li>
            <li> Got here on time Great flavor and great for after eating</li>
            <li> I gave it one star because at the time I thought this was discontinued.  I was wrong about that and I paid more than twice what the price is now in all stores.  I can take most of the blame for that myself.  This is a good product though.</li>
            <li> Cinnamon is by far my favorite, and I have had a hard time finding it at my local drug and/or grocery stores.</li>
            <li> Better than a breath mint, but this have some &#x27;sting&#x27; so if you are no tolerant of spicy foods/candies, you may want to try one before you buy.</li>
            <li> Great taste!  Pretty hot!  Works well for dry mouth!</li>
            <li> Yes, they do taste very strong, but then I knew that.  If I don&#x27;t want the full blast I usually pull a strip half way out then shut the lid, breaking the strip in half.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t carry in stores and quick breath picker upper</li>
            <li> If you like the taste of regular Listerine mouth wash, you might like this; but I wanted a cinnamon flavor in my mouth (such as the old cinnamon Tic-Tac&#x27;s), and the Listerine taste overpowered everything.  I won&#x27;t be buying these again.</li>
            <li> Strong flavor. They&#x27;ll burn the taste buds off your tongue. Just kidding. I love how compact they are. I carry one in my purse, one in my car, and one at work. I prefer the cinnamon flavor over the others Listerine offers.</li>
            <li> First - these breath strips really do clean up any bad breath when eating out or when you are not home to rinse or brush your teeth.  There are a number of different flavors, I like the “Cool Heat” which is close to cinnamon and also for a few seconds is “hot” to the tongue like a “fireball” candy might be.

With candy drops or gum you easily know when you are coming down to the end but not with these.  They should put some indication in the container when you are pulling the next to last strip, otherwise, for taste and value they are a “5”.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not found a flavor of these strips that wasn&#x27;t delightful.  Granddaughter says &amp;#34;your breath smells good&amp;#34;  - the best possible recommendation.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these little strips of breath heaven.  The merchant got the item to me speedily to the smelling pleasure of those around me.  What I do with these is switch the mint one to this red plastic holder so I can more easily see when I am out.</li>
            <li> Ordered it in cinnamon flavor, got cool heat instead.&lt;br /&gt;THEY DO NOT TASTE THE SAME</li>
            <li> These work well for me at night when I wake up with a dry mouth from working outside in the heat.</li>
            <li> They do what they are supposed to do--make my breath smell fresh better than toothpaste--and there is apparently some science behind cinnamon vs other flavors.</li>
