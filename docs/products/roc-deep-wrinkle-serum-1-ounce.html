            <li>I absolutely love this stuff!</li>
            <li>So glad I bought this product!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not a doctor, but as a consumer, I&#x27;ll share my opinions based on my own research:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After a month of use I haven&#x27;t noticed improvement but it feels nice.</li>
            <li>No irritation, no stinging feeling which I liked.</li>
            <li>I honestly would have to say that I like this product.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and appears to be effective.  </li>
            <li>The RoC brand being the most inexpensive and popular sold it for</li>
            <li>I stopped using the product and put every kind of emollient I could think of to try to make it better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d used the original Roc Retinol Correxion eye cream for years with good results and no irritation.  </li>
            <li>After two weeks, users may begin applying more frequently until they find the best routine for their skin.  </li>
            <li>Great for first time users.</li>
            <li>The appearance of fine lines is reduced!  </li>
            <li>I will certainly buy this product again for the results and the great price.</li>
            <li>, more squeezes out than I need</li>
            <li>This product is my husbands favorite eye cream.</li>
            <li>What this tells me is that there is more fragrance in the product than there is Retinol.</li>
            <li>I love ROC products and this eye cream didn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li>Many people had problems with reddening and irritation of the skin with Retin-A, and it was never to be used around the eyes.</li>
            <li>so i am pleased.</li>
            <li>I love that product.</li>
            <li>and I have noticed a change!  :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a purer form of Vitamin A that works to reduce the appearance of wrinkles, and it does benefit many women.  </li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love it, won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>The first couple of weeks were good in terms of irritation.</li>
            <li>Does not sting or burn and is great for sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very mild and subsides within minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant improvement in my fine lines even after many weeks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would suggest to anyone interested in anti-aging products to perform their own research on the differences between Retinol vs. Retinoic Acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facts on Retinol vs. Retinoic Acid (aka Retin-A):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I was hoping to see some smoothing effect on those fine lines.</li>
            <li>I use it every night before bed, and it seems like it&#x27;s emollient and moisturizing while also delivering the retinol that will help with those fine lines.  </li>
            <li>am hoping that after longer use, I will see a difference in the fine lines I have around my eyes also.  </li>
            <li>and I thought since it is &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34;,  it would be fine.  </li>
            <li>I usually never write reviews, but want to make sure this wonderful product isn&#x27;t discontinued from amazon just because of the above unfavorable review.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m giving this product 5 stars BECAUSE it doesn&#x27;t cause irritation, not that I notice a huge difference in my skin or anything</li>
            <li>The one that is for regular skin worked great.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product b/c I have heard and read so many good things about it, however, once I received the product and examined the ingredients included, I was less</li>
            <li>For my very sensitive I&#x27;m glad to have this available.  </li>
            <li>If you are happy with the other one, I suggest you stay with it.</li>
            <li>This gentler, lightweight formula, the manufacturer states, contains a unique blend of powerful anti-aging ingredients known to fight wrinkles:</li>
            <li>My skin is super moisturized</li>
            <li>So, if your skin can tolerate retinoic acid and you learn the dosage that works for you, you are likely better off using retinoic acid products as opposed to Retinols, if you are seeking faster and more visible results.  </li>
            <li>It is mild and I could tell the difference in just one day.</li>
            <li>The product irritates my skin (I use the sensitive night cream), and has a very strong masking perfume to it, but that leaves me to question whether I am having a reaction to the Retinol or whether it&#x27;s the overpowering fragrance.</li>
            <li>They also recommend sticking with the product: they state that it is important to be consistent in its use, as the benefits of retinol are seen over time.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see a huge difference yet but don&#x27;t expect too much from an OTC product.</li>
            <li>This product is really helping smooth out my under eye lines.</li>
            <li>This product might be formulated for those with more sensitive skin around the eye, but it irritated my eye area just as much as presumably stronger formulations and I had to give it away.  </li>
            <li>This product might be formulated for those with more sensitive skin around the eye, but it irritated my eye area just as much as presumably stronger formulations and I had to give it away.  </li>
            <li>and it seems to work fine so far.</li>
            <li>Feels good on skin, but I can feel it is working by little tingling ...</li>
            <li>strangely enough I have used this product before and love it.  </li>
            <li>How funny is that.  </li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says it will do</li>
            <li>So, I figured this one could only be better.  </li>
            <li>Thanks RoC!</li>
            <li>Many of the ingredients in this product are known to be harmful - such as it is loaded with parabens.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love the ROC eye cream, but I ordered the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; skin instead of the regular, thinking, since I do so</li>
            <li>purchased product to begin my first retinol routine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really liking this!  </li>
            <li>whether you use a retinol product day and/or night, wear a sunscreen of SPF 15 or higher during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>..lso remember always to protect your skin: whether you use a retinol product day and/or night, wear a sunscreen of SPF 15 or higher during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since the first day I tried this eye cream it stings my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I generally love ROC products and use the night cream and eye cream regularly.  </li>
            <li>If you buy it don&#x27;t get too close to your eyes though, as the skin very close to the eye is much thinner than elsewhere, and does not replace as quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried MANY and it&#x27;s about the same as all, including much higher-priced product.</li>
            <li>Probably not as much benefit from it as the higher retinol content, but at least&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li>But, BJ&#x27;s had a double product package, specially priced with a coupon, and I fell for it!  </li>
            <li>, I honestly did not give it much of a chance after researching some of the ingredients on the skin deep cosmetics database and finding that there was strong evidence that they were extremely harmful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my skin becoming much softer, smoother, and tighter in this area in the last year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product -- the skin around the eyes is generally one of *the* most sensitive parts of your body.</li>
            <li>I do not notice any significant differences, but the fine lines indeed have become less visible.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles around my eyes, just some fine lines</li>
            <li>Hard to find a good eye cream.</li>
            <li>This really doesn&#x27;t irritate</li>
            <li>The only caveat being that Retinol products are available over the counter, whereas Retin-A  products (retinoic acid) are by prescription</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very inexpensive for something that works.</li>
            <li>I really want to combat wrinkles under my eyes</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see much of the wrinkles on my face improve</li>
            <li>It seems to be doing what it&#x27;s supposed to and will take time to see any real difference.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it makes too much of a difference</li>
            <li>I am stuck with a whole regimen of this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Always</li>
            <li>It does not irritate my face, but I have yet to see if really works.</li>
            <li>I will keep using it, I like it so much.</li>
            <li>it felt heavy and kind of greasy</li>
            <li>well the regular, the sensitive would be even better.</li>
            <li>Any of us who have been using cosmaceuticals for long or have been doing skin care for a long time have encountered Retin-A (a form of Vitamin A, available by Rx), first used for Acne then to smooth and reduce wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I was super excited about using this product and making my tired-looking eyes and dark circles</li>
            <li>Maybe lightened dark circles and faded some wrinkles, but not too much more than that.</li>
            <li>so went with the sensitive cream first since I didn&#x27;t know how I would react.</li>
            <li>More money down the drain</li>
            <li>would hope that for the normal retail price of $25/ounce, ROC could produce a higher quality, more natural product with less unnatural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Been using &#x27;Roc Retinol Correxion - Sensitive Eye Cream&#x27; with much satisfaction.  </li>
            <li>Vitamins A &amp; D are the ONLY vitamins that can be absorbed by the skin.</li>
            <li>Retinol is a less potent form of Vitamin A that can be used on sensitive skin, including around your eyes.</li>
            <li>Dark circles, puffiness, fine lines and crinkles.</li>
            <li>Will have to be more careful shopping next time.</li>
            <li>is very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>is very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>If your skin is truly sensitive, or, you are truly concerned about eye area dryness and wrinkles, you won&#x27;t want to bother with this one!</li>
            <li>I ordered the sensitive skin version by accident and it burns my skin/eyes!</li>
            <li>and/or the evening, in small dots around the eye area, and gently smoothed  until it is  thoroughly absorbed, and that  a sunscreen of SPF 15 or higher be applied during the day while using the eye</li>
            <li>The really fine lines around my eyes seem slightly less noticeable</li>
            <li>A little too strong for my skin, Gives me some redness.</li>
            <li>am switching to Afirm 2x - a product with .30% Retinol (other available formulas are Afirm 1x, .15% Retinol for very sensitive skin, as well as Afirm 3x, .60% Retinol for more tolerant skin) -- at least this way</li>
            <li>I purchased this sensitive cream thinking that since I&#x27;ve never used retinol products before I should start on the easy side,  well, the cream moisturizes a little bit but didn&#x27;t do the wonders that the other reviewers are describing, next time I&#x27;m going to try the non sensitive, maybe that will work better.</li>
            <li>I specifically bought the sensitive eye cream because of my acne prone and very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I need the sensitive formula as I have very sensitive skin and Amazon is one place where I can get it.</li>
            <li>In other words, Retinol is simply less effective than retinoic acid.  </li>
            <li>I learned that I got the one for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This is gentle enough &amp; still gets the job done.</li>
            <li>He has sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too early to see a difference, but I have hope.</li>
            <li>But for some reason, the ROC for sensitive, makes my eyelids burn when I apply it.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The fact that &#x27;Roc&#x27; is made for &#x27;Sensitive Skin&#x27; is another perk.</li>
            <li>i have been usein this cream nearly 2 weeks now</li>
            <li>RoC Retinol Correxion Sensitive Eye Cream is advertised as a milder retinol formula that will help condition skin to retinoids.</li>
            <li>It is, its makers state, designed for women whose skin is sensitive to retinol, or who have never tried retinol.</li>
            <li>so I purchased the sensitive skin version.  </li>
            <li>I received an old product.</li>
            <li>So far, I like it.</li>
            <li>I have been known to react to strong fragrances on my face, and as such typically avoid them.</li>
            <li>I normally use the regular RoC correxion eye cream and have done so for years.  </li>
            <li>So when I saw this new \\&quot;sensitive \\&quot; formulation, I thought it would be much better, but it was actually worse than the regular cream.</li>
            <li>Very surprised that it is so different.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t compared the ingredients of the regular vs sensitive version, but it feels like the effects are reversed!</li>
            <li>What I would do if I were you is to try out this product, I actually use if for my entire fact, and I would dab some on your neck and lower half of your face the first time you use it, so if it really irritates you, it won&#x27;t be the end of the world</li>
            <li>lot of products such as this claim that one key active ingredient is the answer to fabulous skin improvement, but actually they have skin irritants that simply cause your skin to become inflamed.  </li>
            <li>First use I did have slight burning sensation and I continue to have it with each use</li>
            <li>I can better gauge the amount of Retinol my skin can handle without worrying about unnecessary strong masking fragrances irritating my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>\\&quot;blind\\&quot; assumption is that I&#x27;m having a reaction to the high concentration of fragrance as opposed to the UNKNOWN concentration of Retinol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My \\&quot;blind\\&quot; assumption is that I&#x27;m having a reaction to the high concentration of fragrance as opposed to the UNKNOWN concentration of Retinol.   </li>
            <li>This product burns when I apply it and also tends to leave my eyelids dry a short time after (my skin is normally oily).  </li>
            <li>I am not sure this would be the case if the cream was fresh.</li>
            <li>so I am willing to endure a little itching in the middle of the night.  </li>
            <li>Well, I am nobody&#x27;s definition of a young woman, and I have been using skin products - and retinol products--for a very long time.  </li>
            <li>Well, I am nobody&#x27;s definition of a young woman, and I have been using skin products - and retinol products--for a very long time.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any real change in the skin under my eyes but the skin soft less dry than without using this product.</li>
            <li>but you want to let it dry completely for about 10 minutes before applying any makeup</li>
            <li>, ive tryed quite a few now,from expensive to cheap , all promising this n that, in truth they have made my skin worse not better,thats my honest opinion,</li>
            <li>This product actually did sting my eyes the first few times I used it</li>

            <li> The one that is for regular skin worked great.  </li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product b/c I have heard and read so many good things about it, however, once I received the product and examined the ingredients included, I was less</li>
            <li> For my very sensitive I&#x27;m glad to have this available.  </li>
            <li> If you are happy with the other one, I suggest you stay with it.</li>
            <li> This gentler, lightweight formula, the manufacturer states, contains a unique blend of powerful anti-aging ingredients known to fight wrinkles:</li>
            <li> My skin is super moisturized</li>
            <li> So, if your skin can tolerate retinoic acid and you learn the dosage that works for you, you are likely better off using retinoic acid products as opposed to Retinols, if you are seeking faster and more visible results.  </li>
            <li> It is mild and I could tell the difference in just one day.</li>
            <li> The product irritates my skin (I use the sensitive night cream), and has a very strong masking perfume to it, but that leaves me to question whether I am having a reaction to the Retinol or whether it&#x27;s the overpowering fragrance.</li>
            <li> They also recommend sticking with the product: they state that it is important to be consistent in its use, as the benefits of retinol are seen over time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a huge difference yet but don&#x27;t expect too much from an OTC product.</li>
            <li> This product is really helping smooth out my under eye lines.</li>
            <li> This product might be formulated for those with more sensitive skin around the eye, but it irritated my eye area just as much as presumably stronger formulations and I had to give it away.  </li>
            <li> This product might be formulated for those with more sensitive skin around the eye, but it irritated my eye area just as much as presumably stronger formulations and I had to give it away.  </li>
            <li> and it seems to work fine so far.</li>
            <li> Feels good on skin, but I can feel it is working by little tingling ...</li>
            <li> strangely enough I have used this product before and love it.  </li>
            <li> How funny is that.  </li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says it will do</li>
            <li> So, I figured this one could only be better.  </li>
            <li> Thanks RoC!</li>
            <li> Many of the ingredients in this product are known to be harmful - such as it is loaded with parabens.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love the ROC eye cream, but I ordered the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; skin instead of the regular, thinking, since I do so</li>
            <li> purchased product to begin my first retinol routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really liking this!  </li>
            <li> whether you use a retinol product day and/or night, wear a sunscreen of SPF 15 or higher during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ..lso remember always to protect your skin: whether you use a retinol product day and/or night, wear a sunscreen of SPF 15 or higher during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since the first day I tried this eye cream it stings my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I generally love ROC products and use the night cream and eye cream regularly.  </li>
            <li> If you buy it don&#x27;t get too close to your eyes though, as the skin very close to the eye is much thinner than elsewhere, and does not replace as quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried MANY and it&#x27;s about the same as all, including much higher-priced product.</li>
            <li> Probably not as much benefit from it as the higher retinol content, but at least&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li> But, BJ&#x27;s had a double product package, specially priced with a coupon, and I fell for it!  </li>
            <li> , I honestly did not give it much of a chance after researching some of the ingredients on the skin deep cosmetics database and finding that there was strong evidence that they were extremely harmful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my skin becoming much softer, smoother, and tighter in this area in the last year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product -- the skin around the eyes is generally one of *the* most sensitive parts of your body.</li>
            <li> I do not notice any significant differences, but the fine lines indeed have become less visible.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles around my eyes, just some fine lines</li>
            <li> Hard to find a good eye cream.</li>
            <li> This really doesn&#x27;t irritate</li>
            <li> The only caveat being that Retinol products are available over the counter, whereas Retin-A  products (retinoic acid) are by prescription</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very inexpensive for something that works.</li>
            <li> I really want to combat wrinkles under my eyes</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much of the wrinkles on my face improve</li>
            <li> It seems to be doing what it&#x27;s supposed to and will take time to see any real difference.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it makes too much of a difference</li>
            <li> I am stuck with a whole regimen of this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Always</li>
            <li> It does not irritate my face, but I have yet to see if really works.</li>
            <li> I will keep using it, I like it so much.</li>
            <li> it felt heavy and kind of greasy</li>
            <li> well the regular, the sensitive would be even better.</li>
            <li> Any of us who have been using cosmaceuticals for long or have been doing skin care for a long time have encountered Retin-A (a form of Vitamin A, available by Rx), first used for Acne then to smooth and reduce wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I was super excited about using this product and making my tired-looking eyes and dark circles</li>
            <li> Maybe lightened dark circles and faded some wrinkles, but not too much more than that.</li>
            <li> so went with the sensitive cream first since I didn&#x27;t know how I would react.</li>
            <li> More money down the drain</li>
            <li> would hope that for the normal retail price of $25/ounce, ROC could produce a higher quality, more natural product with less unnatural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Been using &#x27;Roc Retinol Correxion - Sensitive Eye Cream&#x27; with much satisfaction.  </li>
            <li> Vitamins A &amp; D are the ONLY vitamins that can be absorbed by the skin.</li>
            <li> Retinol is a less potent form of Vitamin A that can be used on sensitive skin, including around your eyes.</li>
            <li> Dark circles, puffiness, fine lines and crinkles.</li>
            <li> Will have to be more careful shopping next time.</li>
            <li> is very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> is very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> If your skin is truly sensitive, or, you are truly concerned about eye area dryness and wrinkles, you won&#x27;t want to bother with this one!</li>
            <li> I ordered the sensitive skin version by accident and it burns my skin/eyes!</li>
            <li> and/or the evening, in small dots around the eye area, and gently smoothed  until it is  thoroughly absorbed, and that  a sunscreen of SPF 15 or higher be applied during the day while using the eye</li>
            <li> The really fine lines around my eyes seem slightly less noticeable</li>
            <li> A little too strong for my skin, Gives me some redness.</li>
            <li> am switching to Afirm 2x - a product with .30% Retinol (other available formulas are Afirm 1x, .15% Retinol for very sensitive skin, as well as Afirm 3x, .60% Retinol for more tolerant skin) -- at least this way</li>
            <li> I purchased this sensitive cream thinking that since I&#x27;ve never used retinol products before I should start on the easy side,  well, the cream moisturizes a little bit but didn&#x27;t do the wonders that the other reviewers are describing, next time I&#x27;m going to try the non sensitive, maybe that will work better.</li>
            <li> I specifically bought the sensitive eye cream because of my acne prone and very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I need the sensitive formula as I have very sensitive skin and Amazon is one place where I can get it.</li>
            <li> In other words, Retinol is simply less effective than retinoic acid.  </li>
            <li> I learned that I got the one for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> This is gentle enough &amp; still gets the job done.</li>
            <li> He has sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too early to see a difference, but I have hope.</li>
            <li> But for some reason, the ROC for sensitive, makes my eyelids burn when I apply it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The fact that &#x27;Roc&#x27; is made for &#x27;Sensitive Skin&#x27; is another perk.</li>
            <li> i have been usein this cream nearly 2 weeks now</li>
            <li> RoC Retinol Correxion Sensitive Eye Cream is advertised as a milder retinol formula that will help condition skin to retinoids.</li>
            <li> It is, its makers state, designed for women whose skin is sensitive to retinol, or who have never tried retinol.</li>
            <li> so I purchased the sensitive skin version.  </li>
            <li> I received an old product.</li>
            <li> So far, I like it.</li>
            <li> I have been known to react to strong fragrances on my face, and as such typically avoid them.</li>
            <li> I normally use the regular RoC correxion eye cream and have done so for years.  </li>
            <li> So when I saw this new \\&quot;sensitive \\&quot; formulation, I thought it would be much better, but it was actually worse than the regular cream.</li>
            <li> Very surprised that it is so different.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t compared the ingredients of the regular vs sensitive version, but it feels like the effects are reversed!</li>
            <li> What I would do if I were you is to try out this product, I actually use if for my entire fact, and I would dab some on your neck and lower half of your face the first time you use it, so if it really irritates you, it won&#x27;t be the end of the world</li>
            <li> lot of products such as this claim that one key active ingredient is the answer to fabulous skin improvement, but actually they have skin irritants that simply cause your skin to become inflamed.  </li>
            <li> First use I did have slight burning sensation and I continue to have it with each use</li>
            <li> I can better gauge the amount of Retinol my skin can handle without worrying about unnecessary strong masking fragrances irritating my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> \\&quot;blind\\&quot; assumption is that I&#x27;m having a reaction to the high concentration of fragrance as opposed to the UNKNOWN concentration of Retinol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My \\&quot;blind\\&quot; assumption is that I&#x27;m having a reaction to the high concentration of fragrance as opposed to the UNKNOWN concentration of Retinol.   </li>
            <li> This product burns when I apply it and also tends to leave my eyelids dry a short time after (my skin is normally oily).  </li>
            <li> I am not sure this would be the case if the cream was fresh.</li>
            <li> so I am willing to endure a little itching in the middle of the night.  </li>
            <li> Well, I am nobody&#x27;s definition of a young woman, and I have been using skin products - and retinol products--for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Well, I am nobody&#x27;s definition of a young woman, and I have been using skin products - and retinol products--for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any real change in the skin under my eyes but the skin soft less dry than without using this product.</li>
            <li> but you want to let it dry completely for about 10 minutes before applying any makeup</li>
            <li> , ive tryed quite a few now,from expensive to cheap , all promising this n that, in truth they have made my skin worse not better,thats my honest opinion,</li>
            <li> This product actually did sting my eyes the first few times I used it</li>
            <li> So far, i have noticed a difference in my dark circles under my eyes</li>
            <li> But I can see this one is working, and it&#x27;s definitely one of those &amp;#34;little goes a LONG way!&amp;#34; but I started once a day at night and now use it in the morning and evening with no problems.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Retin-A is one of several brand names on the market for \\&quot;tretinoin\\&quot; also referred to as \\&quot;trans-retinoic acid\\&quot; or simply \\&quot;retinoic acid\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retinol, on the other hand, is simply a form of Vitamin A and has a less direct effect on the skin than retinoic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The manufacturers recommend beginning the use of retinol products early, in the user&#x27;s late twenties to early thirties.  </li>
            <li> any more seems harsh on my skin and also seems unnecessary.</li>
            <li> So, even though it&#x27;s for sensitive eyes, my eyes still get a little itchy in my sleep.</li>
            <li> It does not dry the areas under my eyes and around my eyelids as some other creams.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this cream wouldn&#x27;t cause me any trouble considering it&#x27;s for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It took far too long for my skin to heal, and now I&#x27;m dealing with eyes that are over-sensitive and tearing constantly, so my eyes look far worse</li>
            <li> Hope it can relieve the dry lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Seems to dry up my under eye skin.</li>
            <li> After using the regular Roc Correxion eye cream for some time, my skin was very dehydrated, irritated, and my eyes looked worse than before I started using the product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Retinol, of course, is not a new product; it&#x27;s been around for a while.  </li>
            <li> , i cannot see no diffrance atall, i picked this as my skin reacts to cream and leaves me  with red blotches, i was  hoping this cream would of atleast take the sharp noticable dark circles under my eye  down a shade, not to totally brightn my eye to perfection as its only cream ,</li>
            <li> I feel its not worth even the low price.</li>
            <li> (I hate getting rashes near my eyes, they&#x27;d create fine lines that won&#x27;t go away).  </li>
            <li> Tried lots of different creams, but they all were too harsh for my skin.</li>
            <li> biggest problem with Roc is that I&#x27;ve found absolutely no published information regarding the percentage of Retinol</li>
            <li> the fact that the not-so-pleasant fragrance is overpowering (and completely unnecessary, especially in a sensitive skin product - wth?), I&#x27;m giving this two stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m only 26, so no huge wrinkles yet, just wanted this as a preventative.</li>
            <li> High concentrations of Retinol can be just as irritating as retinoic acid products, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> use evey other night to build tolerance, works well, no burning</li>
            <li> Even though I didn&#x27;t have any irritation issues in the beginning, after 2-3 months of usage, my skin started to react with extreme burning sensation and I stop using the product.  </li>
            <li> They believe that if you experience minor skin irritation, this may be temporary while your skin adjusts to the product and that: you should just decrease usage for a few days..</li>
            <li> Sometimes it burns a little when I put it on, but not for very long.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t horrible and I&#x27;ll try it for a bit since it might be tolerable for good results (not too many lines at 33, but bad dark circles and just trying to stay ahead of time).  </li>
            <li> I gave this a try, and have purchased it again, because it does actively reduce the wrinkles around your eyes, and softens the deeper ones.</li>
            <li> So, to ASSUME that any potential reaction is actually from the Retinol in the product, especially given the heavy perfumy fragrance, is questionable.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is not about the product but the packaging from the seller.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small tube but lasts long time.</li>
            <li> They also recommend starting slowly; beginning by applying a small amount (a little goes a long way) every other day for about two weeks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll echo what a previous poster said - why the need to add fragrance?  </li>
            <li> have seen improvements around my eyes in less than a week.</li>
            <li> I experience a slight sensation around my eyes when the product is applied, but it subsides within minutes and no redness at all.  </li>
            <li> And I mean, I suffer from seasonal allergies, have eczema, and could get hives randomly, and am very careful about using skincare products, especially ones like these that are notorious for causing flareups among us sensitive people.  </li>
            <li> With either Retinol or Retinoic Acids, your skin learns to tolerate increased dosages over time, with the lessening of negative side effects in the long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided to try this because it was a little cheaper</li>
            <li> it will peel off and has little to no efficacy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had friends who have really disliked this product</li>
            <li> used it a few times....</li>
            <li> Tried it 3 times hoping my skin would \\&quot;acclimate\\&quot;, but it only burned worse with each application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for years, ever since Aveda killed their eye cream with tourmaline line.  </li>
            <li> use, I&#x27;ve noticed lightened dark circles (still present, just not as bad), and especially less puffiness and when I wake first thing in the morning after using it, my eyes look less tired.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer, I have random hives and just general sensitivity</li>
            <li> Roc fails to provide us with the final concentration of Retinol.</li>
            <li> so when it arrived the cap had actually broken off from being crushed.</li>
            <li> Not like the one that the RoC sale today this is an old product.i was vey unhappy.</li>
            <li> This time I noticed that the packaging was a little different and it also stings like crazy.  </li>
            <li> The smell reminds me of a bottle of age-old cold cream in your grandmother&#x27;s boudoir.leasant fragrance is overpowering (and completely unnecessary, especially in a sensitive skin product - wth?)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d considered buying it from Amazon, saw some of the negative reviews and almost decided not to try it.  </li>
            <li> The makers state that the eye cream will help fight lines and wrinkles around the delicate eye area with minimal/ no irritation, and that, with continued use, users will notice healthier, younger-looking eyes.  </li>
            <li> (I am in my late 20s -- I just have deep-set eyes).</li>
            <li> anyone says there is little or no scent to this product, I&#x27;d suggest that their sense of smell must have been severely impaired by a cold or some other ailment.</li>
            <li> If anyone says there is little or no scent to this product, I&#x27;d suggest that their sense of smell must have been severely impaired by a cold or some other ailment.</li>
            <li> I mean, why not?</li>
            <li> I dont know my worse lines are because I did not moisture my face frequently, or it is the bad effect of this cream.</li>
            <li> guess Boots No7 wasn&#x27;t so bad after all, I&#x27;m going back to that.</li>
            <li> And I have tough skin.</li>
            <li> Now they are worse.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item at BJ&#x27;s warehouse and unfortunately ended up with two.  </li>
            <li> Believe me worse!</li>
            <li> Hate to waste it!</li>
            <li> The smell reminds me of a bottle of age-old cold cream in your grandmother&#x27;s boudoir.</li>
            <li> Nottttt :(  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great daytime moisturizer. Goes on light and not greasy at all but does its job wonderfully. My skin is super moisturized</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff! I turned 30 and decided it was time for some retinol in my life. The RoC brand being the most inexpensive and popular sold it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had friends who have really disliked this product and I believe it&#x27;s because they didn&#x27;t ease into it. I use it about once a week, sometimes twice a week... any more seems harsh on my skin and also seems unnecessary. I&#x27;ve noticed my skin becoming much softer, smoother, and tighter in this area in the last year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, more squeezes out than I need so I put it on my lips. I mean, why not? Hate to waste it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for about a week so can&#x27;t comment on results but it defintely stings.  It isn&#x27;t horrible and I&#x27;ll try it for a bit since it might be tolerable for good results (not too many lines at 33, but bad dark circles and just trying to stay ahead of time).  Like another reviewer, I have random hives and just general sensitivity but I haven&#x27;t had the same reaction-free experience so wanted to issue a warning.</li>
            <li> strangely enough I have used this product before and love it.  This time I noticed that the packaging was a little different and it also stings like crazy.  checking online I learned that I got the one for sensitive skin.  How funny is that.  The one that is for regular skin worked great.  Will have to be more careful shopping next time.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says it will do</li>
            <li> This really doesn&#x27;t irritate so I use it everywhere, not just my eyes.  It seems to work too--skin is smoother where I use it.</li>
            <li> Worked well for the price.</li>
            <li> Good product... But I just started using it.. Feels good on skin, but I can feel it is working by little tingling ...</li>
            <li> I purchased this item at BJ&#x27;s warehouse and unfortunately ended up with two.  I&#x27;d considered buying it from Amazon, saw some of the negative reviews and almost decided not to try it.  But, BJ&#x27;s had a double product package, specially priced with a coupon, and I fell for it!  Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did.  I&#x27;d used the original Roc Retinol Correxion eye cream for years with good results and no irritation.  So, I figured this one could only be better.  Nottttt :(  This product burns when I apply it and also tends to leave my eyelids dry a short time after (my skin is normally oily).  I continued using the product hoping the effect would be temporary.  No such chance!  If your skin is truly sensitive, or, you are truly concerned about eye area dryness and wrinkles, you won&#x27;t want to bother with this one!</li>
            <li> This works great. Tried lots of different creams, but they all were too harsh for my skin. This is gentle enough &amp; still gets the job done. Thanks RoC!</li>
            <li> I only used it once. Hope it can relieve the dry lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks and it seems to work fine so far. Maybe lightened dark circles and faded some wrinkles, but not too much more than that. Solid product.</li>
            <li> This product is my husbands favorite eye cream. He has sensitive eyes and it does not irritate them. He orders it often as needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this periodically at night. I do have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll echo what a previous poster said - why the need to add fragrance?  The product irritates my skin (I use the sensitive night cream), and has a very strong masking perfume to it, but that leaves me to question whether I am having a reaction to the Retinol or whether it&#x27;s the overpowering fragrance. I have been known to react to strong fragrances on my face, and as such typically avoid them. Had I known this would be so overpowering, I&#x27;d have avoided it altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest problem with Roc is that I&#x27;ve found absolutely no published information regarding the percentage of Retinol you are getting in each of their products. So, to ASSUME that any potential reaction is actually from the Retinol in the product, especially given the heavy perfumy fragrance, is questionable.  Having never used Retinol products before, I am in the dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am switching to Afirm 2x - a product with .30% Retinol (other available formulas are Afirm 1x, .15% Retinol for very sensitive skin, as well as Afirm 3x, .60% Retinol for more tolerant skin) -- at least this way I can better gauge the amount of Retinol my skin can handle without worrying about unnecessary strong masking fragrances irritating my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the list of ingredients, \\&quot;Fragrance\\&quot; is listed as the 21st ingredient, and Retinol is the 34th of a total of 38 ingredients, if I counted them all correctly.  What this tells me is that there is more fragrance in the product than there is Retinol. For purposes of fact, ingredients are listed in order of highest concentration to lowest. Roc fails to provide us with the final concentration of Retinol. What a shame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a doctor, but as a consumer, I&#x27;ll share my opinions based on my own research:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve come across various claims that the product \\&quot;prepares\\&quot; you for Retinoids. Meaning, you use this product before switching to actual retinoic acid products (i.e. Retin-A). With either Retinol or Retinoic Acids, your skin learns to tolerate increased dosages over time, with the lessening of negative side effects in the long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest to anyone interested in anti-aging products to perform their own research on the differences between Retinol vs. Retinoic Acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facts on Retinol vs. Retinoic Acid (aka Retin-A):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retin-A is one of several brand names on the market for \\&quot;tretinoin\\&quot; also referred to as \\&quot;trans-retinoic acid\\&quot; or simply \\&quot;retinoic acid\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retinol, on the other hand, is simply a form of Vitamin A and has a less direct effect on the skin than retinoic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Another fact: Vitamins A &amp; D are the ONLY vitamins that can be absorbed by the skin. Vitamin E simply sit on the surface, thereby acting as an emulsifier or moisturizer, but application of Vitamin E onto the skin provides zero benefits in terms of vitamin absorption. So don&#x27;t think that buying a Vitamin E skin cream is benefitting your vitamin E intake requirements).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Retinol has fewer side effects, it also takes longer to see visible results as opposed to prescription based retinoic acid.  In other words, Retinol is simply less effective than retinoic acid.  High concentrations of Retinol can be just as irritating as retinoic acid products, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people alleviate the side effects (dryness and peeling) of retinoic acids with the increased use of moisturizers (moisturizers with hyaluronic acids are beneficial as hyaluronic acids help to hydrate the skin). So, if your skin can tolerate retinoic acid and you learn the dosage that works for you, you are likely better off using retinoic acid products as opposed to Retinols, if you are seeking faster and more visible results.  The only caveat being that Retinol products are available over the counter, whereas Retin-A  products (retinoic acid) are by prescription only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since Roc doesn&#x27;ttell us what percentage of Retinol the consumer is actually getting, coupled with the hefty price tag, and the fact that the not-so-pleasant fragrance is overpowering (and completely unnecessary, especially in a sensitive skin product - wth?), I&#x27;m giving this two stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My \\&quot;blind\\&quot; assumption is that I&#x27;m having a reaction to the high concentration of fragrance as opposed to the UNKNOWN concentration of Retinol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone says there is little or no scent to this product, I&#x27;d suggest that their sense of smell must have been severely impaired by a cold or some other ailment. The smell reminds me of a bottle of age-old cold cream in your grandmother&#x27;s boudoir.leasant fragrance is overpowering (and completely unnecessary, especially in a sensitive skin product - wth?), I&#x27;m giving this two stars.

            <li> use evey other night to build tolerance, works well, no burning</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product b/c I have heard and read so many good things about it, however, once I received the product and examined the ingredients included, I was less thrilled.&lt;br /&gt;A lot of products such as this claim that one key active ingredient is the answer to fabulous skin improvement, but actually they have skin irritants that simply cause your skin to become inflamed.  This of course pushes out the wrinkles.  Many of the ingredients in this product are known to be harmful - such as it is loaded with parabens.&lt;br /&gt;I would hope that for the normal retail price of $25/ounce, ROC could produce a higher quality, more natural product with less unnatural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I used it a few times.... it felt heavy and kind of greasy, I honestly did not give it much of a chance after researching some of the ingredients on the skin deep cosmetics database and finding that there was strong evidence that they were extremely harmful.</li>
            <li> I love ROC products and this eye cream didn&#x27;t disappoint. The sensitive formula works well with my skin so that there is minimal stinging upon application. My only complaint is not about the product but the packaging from the seller. It wasn&#x27;t packaged well so when it arrived the cap had actually broken off from being crushed. They did issue an immediate refund though.</li>
            <li> I bought it for laughter lines. Now they are worse. Believe me worse! You need to moisturize your face all the time when you use this cream. I dont know my worse lines are because I did not moisture my face frequently, or it is the bad effect of this cream.</li>
            <li> After a month of use I haven&#x27;t noticed improvement but it feels nice. I&#x27;ve tried MANY and it&#x27;s about the same as all, including much higher-priced product.</li>
            <li> Eye cream-made skin sting.</li>
            <li> After using the regular Roc Correxion eye cream for some time, my skin was very dehydrated, irritated, and my eyes looked worse than before I started using the product. So when I saw this new \\&quot;sensitive \\&quot; formulation, I thought it would be much better, but it was actually worse than the regular cream. WOW WHAT A BURN...........I felt like my eyes were on fire, running to get something to fan my face with. Tried it 3 times hoping my skin would \\&quot;acclimate\\&quot;, but it only burned worse with each application. And I have tough skin. More money down the drain *rats*.&lt;br /&gt;I guess Boots No7 wasn&#x27;t so bad after all, I&#x27;m going back to that.</li>
            <li> Not doing what I needed it for</li>
            <li> I like anything RoC makes; wish they (Johnson &amp; Johnson) would stop animal testing though.</li>
            <li> Another gift that I haven&#x27;t used but they wouldn&#x27;t have asked for it if it wasn&#x27;t something they thought worked for them.</li>
            <li> I specifically bought the sensitive eye cream because of my acne prone and very sensitive skin. I don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles around my eyes, just some fine lines so I was hoping to see some smoothing effect on those fine lines. The first couple of weeks were good in terms of irritation. No irritation, no stinging feeling which I liked. But I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant improvement in my fine lines even after many weeks.For me, it&#x27;s no different than a simplelight moisturizer for under eye skin. It&#x27;s a small tube but lasts long time. Even though I didn&#x27;t have any irritation issues in the beginning, after 2-3 months of usage, my skin started to react with extreme burning sensation and I stop using the product.  I don&#x27;t think I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> For my very sensitive I&#x27;m glad to have this available.  The stronger strength burned.  It&#x27;s too early to see a difference, but I have hope.</li>
            <li> Not like the one that the RoC sale today this is an old product.i was vey unhappy. I don&#x27;t recommend it</li>
            <li> I honestly would have to say that I like this product. It does not dry the areas under my eyes and around my eyelids as some other creams. I do not notice any significant differences, but the fine lines indeed have become less visible.</li>
            <li> As described and speedy shipping but it didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin.</li>
            <li> Used 7 days..appears to do the job!</li>
            <li> have seen improvements around my eyes in less than a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for years, ever since Aveda killed their eye cream with tourmaline line.  It&#x27;s a go to product for under the eye, and I definitely notice a tightening and feel that it helps reduce any purple/discoloration.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love the ROC eye cream, but I ordered the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; skin instead of the regular, thinking, since I do so well the regular, the sensitive would be even better. But for some reason, the ROC for sensitive, makes my eyelids burn when I apply it. If you are happy with the other one, I suggest you stay with it.</li>
            <li> Any of us who have been using cosmaceuticals for long or have been doing skin care for a long time have encountered Retin-A (a form of Vitamin A, available by Rx), first used for Acne then to smooth and reduce wrinkles. Many people had problems with reddening and irritation of the skin with Retin-A, and it was never to be used around the eyes. Retinol is a less potent form of Vitamin A that can be used on sensitive skin, including around your eyes. I gave this a try, and have purchased it again, because it does actively reduce the wrinkles around your eyes, and softens the deeper ones. If you buy it don&#x27;t get too close to your eyes though, as the skin very close to the eye is much thinner than elsewhere, and does not replace as quickly. But I can see this one is working, and it&#x27;s definitely one of those &amp;#34;little goes a LONG way!&amp;#34; but I started once a day at night and now use it in the morning and evening with no problems. It&#x27;s also very inexpensive for something that works.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I need the sensitive formula as I have very sensitive skin and Amazon is one place where I can get it. It has lightened the circles under my eyes and made them brighter.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see that this has done a thing and I am almost done with the tube.</li>
            <li> I ordered the sensitive skin version by accident and it burns my skin/eyes! I never had a problem with the regular version.</li>
            <li> purchased product to begin my first retinol routine. It is mild and I could tell the difference in just one day. Skin looks softer around the eye. I have been using once a day at bed time. Great for first time users.</li>
            <li> I usually never write reviews, but want to make sure this wonderful product isn&#x27;t discontinued from amazon just because of the above unfavorable review.  I have sensitive skin.  And I mean, I suffer from seasonal allergies, have eczema, and could get hives randomly, and am very careful about using skincare products, especially ones like these that are notorious for causing flareups among us sensitive people.  What I would do if I were you is to try out this product, I actually use if for my entire fact, and I would dab some on your neck and lower half of your face the first time you use it, so if it really irritates you, it won&#x27;t be the end of the world (I hate getting rashes near my eyes, they&#x27;d create fine lines that won&#x27;t go away).  So I&#x27;m giving this product 5 stars BECAUSE it doesn&#x27;t cause irritation, not that I notice a huge difference in my skin or anything, I&#x27;m only 26, so no huge wrinkles yet, just wanted this as a preventative.</li>
            <li> Helps the friend to buy, she said with is being very good.Can then use looked the long-term effect, the good speech can continue the purchase.</li>
            <li> Terrific results in a short time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really liking this!  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month, and I think I do see diminished crow&#x27;s feet.  Sometimes it burns a little when I put it on, but not for very long. I use it every night before bed, and it seems like it&#x27;s emollient and moisturizing while also delivering the retinol that will help with those fine lines.  I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
            <li> So far, i have noticed a difference in my dark circles under my eyes so i am pleased. i&#x27;ve only been using it consistantly for about two weeks to I am hoping that after longer use, I will see a difference in the fine lines I have around my eyes also.  So far, so good.  And for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I normally use the regular RoC correxion eye cream and have done so for years.  I love that product. It works and has been the only product that my eye area can handle.  I decided to try this because it was a little cheaper and I thought since it is &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34;,  it would be fine.  It STINGS!  And then it dries up on my skin and literally looks like I am peeling.  Very surprised that it is so different.  I will never buy again - going back to the regular RoC eye cream.</li>
            <li> Been using &#x27;Roc Retinol Correxion - Sensitive Eye Cream&#x27; with much satisfaction.  The appearance of fine lines is reduced!  The fact that &#x27;Roc&#x27; is made for &#x27;Sensitive Skin&#x27; is another perk.</li>
            <li> I really want to combat wrinkles under my eyes so I am willing to endure a little itching in the middle of the night.  So, even though it&#x27;s for sensitive eyes, my eyes still get a little itchy in my sleep.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product!  I have been using it about 2-3 weeks and I have noticed a change!  :)</li>
            <li> i have been usein this cream nearly 2 weeks now, i cannot see no diffrance atall, i picked this as my skin reacts to cream and leaves me  with red blotches, i was  hoping this cream would of atleast take the sharp noticable dark circles under my eye  down a shade, not to totally brightn my eye to perfection as its only cream , these creams r becomein just money makin scams, ive tryed quite a few now,from expensive to cheap , all promising this n that, in truth they have made my skin worse not better,thats my honest opinion,</li>
            <li> No noticeable difference but you want to let it dry completely for about 10 minutes before applying any makeup</li>
            <li> I like that this cream does not burn or irritate my skin.  Probably not as much benefit from it as the higher retinol content, but at least&lt;br /&gt;my skin can tolerate it.</li>
            <li> dries flaky, doesn&#x27;t absorb well</li>
            <li> I purchased this sensitive cream thinking that since I&#x27;ve never used retinol products before I should start on the easy side,  well, the cream moisturizes a little bit but didn&#x27;t do the wonders that the other reviewers are describing, next time I&#x27;m going to try the non sensitive, maybe that will work better.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much of the wrinkles on my face improve</li>
            <li> RoC Retinol Correxion Sensitive Eye Cream is advertised as a milder retinol formula that will help condition skin to retinoids. It is, its makers state, designed for women whose skin is sensitive to retinol, or who have never tried retinol. The makers state that the eye cream will help fight lines and wrinkles around the delicate eye area with minimal/ no irritation, and that, with continued use, users will notice healthier, younger-looking eyes.  This gentler, lightweight formula, the manufacturer states, contains a unique blend of powerful anti-aging ingredients known to fight wrinkles: RoC retinol, a clinically proven wrinkle-fighting ingredient that works to keep skin looking younger for longer; and hyaluronic acid that helps bind the essential moisture in your skin to hydrate and re-plump wrinkles. They recommend that it be applied in  the morning, and/or the evening, in small dots around the eye area, and gently smoothed  until it is  thoroughly absorbed, and that  a sunscreen of SPF 15 or higher be applied during the day while using the eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retinol, of course, is not a new product; it&#x27;s been around for a while.  It&#x27;s a purer form of Vitamin A that works to reduce the appearance of wrinkles, and it does benefit many women.  The manufacturers recommend beginning the use of retinol products early, in the user&#x27;s late twenties to early thirties.  They also recommend starting slowly; beginning by applying a small amount (a little goes a long way) every other day for about two weeks. After two weeks, users may begin applying more frequently until they find the best routine for their skin.  They also recommend sticking with the product: they state that it is important to be consistent in its use, as the benefits of retinol are seen over time. They believe that if you experience minor skin irritation, this may be temporary while your skin adjusts to the product and that: you should just decrease usage for a few days.. Finally, they state you should also remember always to protect your skin: whether you use a retinol product day and/or night, wear a sunscreen of SPF 15 or higher during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RoC was founded in France in 1957 by pharmacist Jean-Charles Lissarrague and a collaboration of dermatologists.  Well, I am nobody&#x27;s definition of a young woman, and I have been using skin products - and retinol products--for a very long time.  This product might be formulated for those with more sensitive skin around the eye, but it irritated my eye area just as much as presumably stronger formulations and I had to give it away.  I can&#x27;t recommend it to anyone who knows the area around their eyes is very sensitive.  Wish I had a product I could recommend..lso remember always to protect your skin: whether you use a retinol product day and/or night, wear a sunscreen of SPF 15 or higher during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RoC was founded in France in 1957 by pharmacist Jean-Charles Lissarrague and a collaboration of dermatologists.

            <li> This product actually did sting my eyes the first few times I used it but I guess my eyes got used to it. I don&#x27;t see a huge difference yet but don&#x27;t expect too much from an OTC product. It seems to be doing what it&#x27;s supposed to and will take time to see any real difference.  For deep wrinkles, you need to go under laser treatments. No cream will remove deep wrinkles.</li>
            <li> After a week I could see a difference in my skin.  Love this will buy  it again.and I will be using  this for ever.</li>
            <li> Since the first day I tried this eye cream it stings my eyes.  I feel its not worth even the low price.</li>
            <li> I have been using for about 1.5 months nightly. My biggest facial concern has always been my eye area. Dark circles, puffiness, fine lines and crinkles. I had never used anything with Retinol so went with the sensitive cream first since I didn&#x27;t know how I would react. First use I did have slight burning sensation and I continue to have it with each use but it&#x27;s very mild and subsides within minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With use, I&#x27;ve noticed lightened dark circles (still present, just not as bad), and especially less puffiness and when I wake first thing in the morning after using it, my eyes look less tired. The really fine lines around my eyes seem slightly less noticeable and I hope with longer use will improve. I will continue to use this product!</li>
            <li> This product has kept me from getting wrinkles around the eyes, I am 62 and have none.</li>
            <li> I generally love ROC products and use the night cream and eye cream regularly.  The local Rite Aid was out of the regular eye cream so I purchased the sensitive skin version.  Ouch!  It stings and leaves a lingering red patch under my eyes.  I haven&#x27;t compared the ingredients of the regular vs sensitive version, but it feels like the effects are reversed!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love it, won&#x27;t buy again. Seems to dry up my under eye skin.</li>
            <li> I was super excited about using this product and making my tired-looking eyes and dark circles go away (I am in my late 20s -- I just have deep-set eyes). I was hoping this cream wouldn&#x27;t cause me any trouble considering it&#x27;s for sensitive skin. After two nights of use I woke up with skin around my eyes that was red and scaly. I stopped using the product and put every kind of emollient I could think of to try to make it better. It took far too long for my skin to heal, and now I&#x27;m dealing with eyes that are over-sensitive and tearing constantly, so my eyes look far worse off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product -- the skin around the eyes is generally one of *the* most sensitive parts of your body. Putting something this intense on that skin is asking for trouble.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it makes too much of a difference but it&#x27;s ok.  Hard to find a good eye cream.</li>
            <li> I received an old product. Everytime I have used this cream it will peel off and has little to no efficacy. I am not sure this would be the case if the cream was fresh.</li>
            <li> A little too strong for my skin, Gives me some redness.</li>
            <li> Just started to use product. So far, I like it. Very smooth and appears to be effective.  Arrived promptly and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> May be my skin type but my skin did not like these Roc products at all.&lt;br /&gt;I saw where another review had problems too&lt;br /&gt;It left a sore on my chin so I quit using it for a while and tried later..&lt;br /&gt;Then I ended up with 2 sores on my cheek.&lt;br /&gt;Now I am stuck with a whole regimen of this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Always buy 1 then buy the rest of the regimen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite pleased with this product.  I experience a slight sensation around my eyes when the product is applied, but it subsides within minutes and no redness at all.  I bought this product because of under eye puffiness and the need for tightening above and below my eyes.  I will certainly buy this product again for the results and the great price.</li>
            <li> It does not irritate my face, but I have yet to see if really works.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any real change in the skin under my eyes but the skin soft less dry than without using this product.</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this product!  Love it</li>
            <li> Great eye cream. Will definitely purchase again. Does not sting or burn and is great for sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> This product is really helping smooth out my under eye lines. I will keep using it, I like it so much.</li>
