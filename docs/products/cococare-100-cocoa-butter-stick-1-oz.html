            <li>I am totally in love with this product!</li>
            <li>This cocoa butter softens skin and improves skin texture while providing a nice medium for scar mobilizations.  </li>
            <li>It does seem to be a particularly effective emollient and is quite without any of the additives that experts are advising us to stay away from.</li>
            <li>So many good uses.</li>
            <li>Not a miracle but very helpful, very nice!</li>
            <li>(I bought it in a store, not from Amazon, and it was only $1.99), works great, smells incredible, and I can apply it to the backs of my hands or my legs, etc.</li>
            <li>so it applys very easily to my lips.</li>
            <li>and I liked it a lot better</li>
            <li>This is an easy to use convenient product that gets carried around in my purse!</li>
            <li>Easily throw it in your bag and go!</li>
            <li>It also smells mildly of chocolate, which makes it all the more pleasant to use.</li>
            <li>but the cocoa smell wasnt as strong as i would have liked it</li>
            <li>I love these things.  </li>
            <li>The product is so simple and perfect and glides on...</li>
            <li>It shouldn&#x27;t cost more than $1.75 wherever you get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will surely buy this again.</li>
            <li>I hope it works better than the Spectragel.  </li>
            <li>I love this product because it&#x27;s inexpensive</li>
            <li>While it does moisturize, I think that a better moisturizer is coconut oil.  </li>
            <li>So glad Amazon has it.</li>
            <li>the more liquidly it would be.  </li>
            <li>so I would use this more in the winter.</li>
            <li>got to get more.  </li>
            <li>i love this stick</li>
            <li>So every time I use it I have to make sure that it doesn&#x27;t fall onto the floor.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s more like lotion.</li>
            <li>It gives your skin a glow and is excellent for adding the extra umph after a tan</li>
            <li>I absolutely love cocoa butter for lips now</li>
            <li>and i will keep buying more.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>i love this</li>
            <li>Just wish it came in an easier more sanitary container like a mini deoderant.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;d order more.</li>
            <li>It lookes really high quality definatly a great price</li>
            <li>&amp; It smells strongly of chocolate :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very greasy and it has a wonderful smell.</li>
            <li>Well - Can Be Used All Over Body,  Face, Lips, Hands - Easy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very basic, very cheap and very effective.</li>
            <li>It fits easily in a purse and when applied (after some elbow grease), does moisturize.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing because cocoa butter melts easily, the hotter your climate</li>
            <li>Easy application .Hope</li>
            <li>Really strong Smell</li>
            <li>I thought I would receive a stick that would have a substance inside that could be smoothly and easily applied like a lip balm.  </li>
            <li>To Smooth Dry/Frizzed Hair</li>
            <li>they will continue to be available..</li>
            <li>now its smooth.</li>
            <li>Good for scars and a way better price than I could get in local stores.</li>
            <li>I got this product because I recently got a  new tattoo and someone told me it works the best.</li>
            <li>Cocoa butter is great for everything from stretch marks, to dry skin, to discoloration.</li>
            <li>cocoa butter is most pleasant and the cocoa smell is there but not very strong - quite acceptable.</li>
            <li>It smells good and the stick form was convenient as first but at some point the stick fell completely out and hasn&#x27;t held since.</li>
            <li>I find cocoa butter the fastest absorbing most protective oils ive used</li>
            <li>It melts right away with the heat of your skin and rubs on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be a loyal Cococare Cocoa Butter Stick user for life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cocoa butter generally melts at about 90 degrees Fahrenheit and is not creamy or pliable on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>For All Ages - Works For Chapped Lips - Great For Dry Patches - Cheap Enough To Have Extras - Easy To Pack For Trips - Works</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great little travel stick or for on the go</li>
            <li>great stuff, used for eyebrow flaking - cleared it up in a few days</li>
            <li>The scar has now faded to a nice white with improvements in texture and stiffness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;ve found a natural alternative to using Vaseline to moisturize my feet.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice, small, and compact and great for it&#x27;s low price.</li>
            <li>I love this so much more than any other cocoa butter product I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>Because I have allergies, it is important to try products without huge financial investment, so this seems reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Already recieved a few comments about how lovely the room smelled when I walked in :).</li>
            <li>Most coconut oils that are left at room temperature are soft and can be smoothed fairly easily across the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>smell of this is really fresh, and you can tell it&#x27;s 100% pure.</li>
            <li>There are products out there that claim to do the same thing, but will probably cost you a lot more.  </li>
            <li>of course there is a first time for everything</li>
            <li>Regular lotion is okay, but bothers my allergies, specifically allergy eyes.</li>
            <li>os rxtreme tightness around my wrist scar is feeling much better since I switched to this as opposed to regular lotions.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Right now I am using it on my (now happy) lips, rather than the commercial products that have additives with long chemical names.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather pay 15 times more for something that has a proper twist-up applicator.</li>
            <li>Just roll it on and it will leave whatever part of your body soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes in handy for adults and kids that bruise easily or are a bit on the clumsy side.</li>
            <li>I love pure cocoa butter and use it daily.</li>
            <li>It seems to be lightening the more minor scars and the area</li>
            <li>Tried and true natural resource.</li>
            <li>THIS STUFF IS LIKE MAGIC ON MY 62 YEAR OLD DRY SKIN, INSTANT MOIST &amp; SMOOTH SKIN WITH THE FIRST APPLICATION!!</li>
            <li>This stick is 100% pure cocoa butter and can be used on lips and body.</li>
            <li>some kind of coco not really sweet smelling</li>
            <li>Rattles around loosely in a push-up container that doesn&#x27;t fit the product!</li>
            <li>It kept my tattoo&#x27;s color very vibrant and it helped it heal fast.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky which is nice because shea butter is a little on the sticky side.</li>
            <li>It turned my rough flaky elbows smooth in ONE USE!</li>
            <li>I really like cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>it would be greatly appreciated it they could look into this one&lt;br /&gt;this</li>
            <li>Very shining and protects well.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s REAL cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>oh well, at least it smells good</li>
            <li>This product is better for melting and mixing with other skin healing oils and butters for making homemade lotions or soaps.</li>
            <li>purchased this cocoa butter stick specifically for my lips, because they dry out very quickly.</li>
            <li>it was so cheap and lasts so long.</li>
            <li>If you read the ingredients you will notice that cocoa butter is the main one.</li>
            <li>I keep these on hand in case my main supply of food grade cocoa butter runs out.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought it for scarring after an accident but since have found a thousand uses for it: chapstick, dry skin, scar cream, etc.</li>
            <li>and prevents normal transpiration and absorption of necessary medications you apply later, is an allergen for some plus is not biodegradable and these days is found in a huge majority of skin products.</li>
            <li>At the moment where I live</li>
            <li>Coco butter sticks always works nothing new here.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for sensitive skin/allergies.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fan of natural products and like this much better than the alternatives which usually contain mineral oil as a main ingredient.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other reviewers commented that it&#x27;s dry (instead of wet and oily), but all you have to do is wipe it back and forth on your lips firmly and that heats it up perfectly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty tiny.</li>
            <li>All natural, my skin loves it!  </li>
            <li>natural!</li>
            <li>Rarely had a use for it, once in a while I would use for extremely dry spots.</li>
            <li>The user has to push the product up (like a push pop) and this is not always easy; the stiff product gets stuck in the tube and doesn&#x27;t budge easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Left with large scars.</li>
            <li>I am moving towards using natural products on skin, hair,etc.</li>
            <li>and i think i ll never use again non natural creams for my body and face.</li>
            <li>the stick comes out completely.</li>
            <li>It smells so much like cocoa that since I bought this as a present</li>
            <li>I am currently in Afghanistan in need of a good product to aid with my hperpigmentation due to the harsh weahther conditions here</li>
            <li>I normally buy this in store from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply, but I had a couple bucks left on a gift card and got it here.</li>
            <li>If the cocoa is a little stiff you can warm it up on your forehead before using it on sensitive areas like eyes.  </li>
            <li>This one is considerably cheaper than the other brand I can find locally (the other brand goes for $2.49 at the health food store) and its easier to come by at many chain pharmacy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I received the product and barely opened it</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hilariously big, I think some the product was missing, because it was only filled 3/4 of the way</li>
            <li>So far so good - the cap itself pushes it down without creating a mess, at least at 55F.</li>
            <li>I recently had major neck surgery and arm surgery.</li>
            <li>Yellow slime leaking from the bottom of the package onto my bare leg and arms.....</li>
            <li>Pros: Inexpensive - Long Lasting - 100% Natural - Smells</li>

            <li> Already recieved a few comments about how lovely the room smelled when I walked in :).</li>
            <li> Most coconut oils that are left at room temperature are soft and can be smoothed fairly easily across the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> smell of this is really fresh, and you can tell it&#x27;s 100% pure.</li>
            <li> There are products out there that claim to do the same thing, but will probably cost you a lot more.  </li>
            <li> of course there is a first time for everything</li>
            <li> Regular lotion is okay, but bothers my allergies, specifically allergy eyes.</li>
            <li> os rxtreme tightness around my wrist scar is feeling much better since I switched to this as opposed to regular lotions.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Right now I am using it on my (now happy) lips, rather than the commercial products that have additives with long chemical names.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather pay 15 times more for something that has a proper twist-up applicator.</li>
            <li> Just roll it on and it will leave whatever part of your body soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes in handy for adults and kids that bruise easily or are a bit on the clumsy side.</li>
            <li> I love pure cocoa butter and use it daily.</li>
            <li> It seems to be lightening the more minor scars and the area</li>
            <li> Tried and true natural resource.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS LIKE MAGIC ON MY 62 YEAR OLD DRY SKIN, INSTANT MOIST &amp; SMOOTH SKIN WITH THE FIRST APPLICATION!!</li>
            <li> This stick is 100% pure cocoa butter and can be used on lips and body.</li>
            <li> some kind of coco not really sweet smelling</li>
            <li> Rattles around loosely in a push-up container that doesn&#x27;t fit the product!</li>
            <li> It kept my tattoo&#x27;s color very vibrant and it helped it heal fast.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky which is nice because shea butter is a little on the sticky side.</li>
            <li> It turned my rough flaky elbows smooth in ONE USE!</li>
            <li> I really like cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> it would be greatly appreciated it they could look into this one&lt;br /&gt;this</li>
            <li> Very shining and protects well.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s REAL cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> oh well, at least it smells good</li>
            <li> This product is better for melting and mixing with other skin healing oils and butters for making homemade lotions or soaps.</li>
            <li> purchased this cocoa butter stick specifically for my lips, because they dry out very quickly.</li>
            <li> it was so cheap and lasts so long.</li>
            <li> If you read the ingredients you will notice that cocoa butter is the main one.</li>
            <li> I keep these on hand in case my main supply of food grade cocoa butter runs out.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought it for scarring after an accident but since have found a thousand uses for it: chapstick, dry skin, scar cream, etc.</li>
            <li> and prevents normal transpiration and absorption of necessary medications you apply later, is an allergen for some plus is not biodegradable and these days is found in a huge majority of skin products.</li>
            <li> At the moment where I live</li>
            <li> Coco butter sticks always works nothing new here.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for sensitive skin/allergies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of natural products and like this much better than the alternatives which usually contain mineral oil as a main ingredient.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other reviewers commented that it&#x27;s dry (instead of wet and oily), but all you have to do is wipe it back and forth on your lips firmly and that heats it up perfectly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty tiny.</li>
            <li> All natural, my skin loves it!  </li>
            <li> natural!</li>
            <li> Rarely had a use for it, once in a while I would use for extremely dry spots.</li>
            <li> The user has to push the product up (like a push pop) and this is not always easy; the stiff product gets stuck in the tube and doesn&#x27;t budge easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Left with large scars.</li>
            <li> I am moving towards using natural products on skin, hair,etc.</li>
            <li> and i think i ll never use again non natural creams for my body and face.</li>
            <li> the stick comes out completely.</li>
            <li> It smells so much like cocoa that since I bought this as a present</li>
            <li> I am currently in Afghanistan in need of a good product to aid with my hperpigmentation due to the harsh weahther conditions here</li>
            <li> I normally buy this in store from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply, but I had a couple bucks left on a gift card and got it here.</li>
            <li> If the cocoa is a little stiff you can warm it up on your forehead before using it on sensitive areas like eyes.  </li>
            <li> This one is considerably cheaper than the other brand I can find locally (the other brand goes for $2.49 at the health food store) and its easier to come by at many chain pharmacy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I received the product and barely opened it</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hilariously big, I think some the product was missing, because it was only filled 3/4 of the way</li>
            <li> So far so good - the cap itself pushes it down without creating a mess, at least at 55F.</li>
            <li> I recently had major neck surgery and arm surgery.</li>
            <li> Yellow slime leaking from the bottom of the package onto my bare leg and arms.....</li>
            <li> Pros: Inexpensive - Long Lasting - 100% Natural - Smells</li>
            <li> The product is stiff and crumbly and doesn&#x27;t glide very well across the skin.  </li>
            <li> The entire thing has to be sort of held by the middle and squeezed so the cocoa butter stick doesn&#x27;t just push back down or fall completely out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda hard at first</li>
            <li> I really like this small convenience  size cococare stick.</li>
            <li> This pure cocoa butter does not affect my allergies in the least.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get it out short of scooping it with a spoon, which is not really what you want to do with a &amp;#34;moisturizing stick.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The package came before I expected and because I wasn&#x27;t the person who checked the mailbox, it was left in the sun all night and Sunday morning.</li>
            <li> I have to wait so long for one product.</li>
            <li> I have ordered a bunch of things on Amazon, some the same day as this product and some before, and somehow I have recieved all of my other products</li>
            <li> but it may not, also as a tip you can use it other place such as if you have a dry patch</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone with dry skin or stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it would melt like that if it was full of chemicals and fake stuff.</li>
            <li> However, I live in the northeast and when it gets colder, it can be really hard to push up the stick with your finger.</li>
            <li> cocoa butter stick comes packaged in a plastic tube with a manual push-up feature that means that with each use, if you want to recap it, you must push it back down.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific little product.  </li>
            <li> I think in the future I will buy the little jar of the coco butter</li>
            <li> I recommend buying in store to avoid receiving a partially melted or cracked stick.  </li>
            <li> When I received this stick, it wasn&#x27;t quite what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I noticed my hand was wet</li>
            <li> I also use it on my eyelids, lips, and rough skin.</li>
            <li> It could be a little tighter, When you push the product up it will just fall back down unless you keep your finger in place holding it.</li>
            <li> You can also melt it and add it as an ingredient to any other health and beauty products.</li>
            <li> I realized I had a bruise on my arm the other day.</li>
            <li> I use this on a scar every other day and it has been fading as well.</li>
            <li> the lid pretty difficult to get off.</li>
            <li> I know it can be used for other things</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve yet to find other uses for it.</li>
            <li> One step I have taken is to stop using Vaseline and other petroleum products.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still small enough to put in my purse.</li>
            <li> The one I purchased seems to have a stronger scent than other brands ive tried which I adore.</li>
            <li> ...will find other supplier in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;margaret</li>
            <li> The stick is at least .25&amp;#34; smaller in diameter than the container, so it is totally loose???</li>
            <li> Too dry couldn&#x27;t  even use it waste of money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m like a dark olive and my moms a dark chocolate.</li>
            <li> Do you have dark spots?</li>
            <li> , I looked down and was mortified by what I saw.</li>
            <li> Not fun to find lint and junk that creeped into the tube when its half used.</li>
            <li> I have used this since I was a little girl.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help at all with my stretch marks and it was very hard to apply on the skin, the stick kept pushing back in</li>
            <li> I purchased a Cococare Coco Butter stick a few months ago.</li>
            <li> Unlike some other cocoa butter balms (like Palmer&#x27;s stick) this can be difficult to use due to</li>
            <li> I unfortunately purchased online another time and it was broken which kept it from pushing up properly.</li>
            <li> The packaging kinda sucks, you have to push it up like a push pop and</li>
            <li> I may need to order again, but at least I know to check my mailbox on and before the determined delivery date in order to avoid this happening again.</li>
            <li> and it really sucks</li>
            <li> I bought one just to check it out, it was completely dried up and broken.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin, but hate to use conventional lotion because my work requires a lot of computer use.  </li>
            <li> Irritating</li>
            <li> came broken...</li>
            <li> i was certainly not happy about that as i am allergic to the shea butter and did want the 100 % cocoa butter...</li>
            <li> Having the sensation of lotion on my finger tips is very annoying because it affects my keyboarding speed and the overall sensation.  </li>
            <li> was just an unfortunate event</li>
            <li> I plan to also use it on the place where my computer stool has made unpleasant calluses as well as on my elbows that rest on the desk until I think to stop that behavior.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was a gift and they didn&#x27;t have anything bad to say about the product.</li>
            <li> I also hate the packaging of this product.  </li>
            <li> I had surgery on my elbow with some nasty scarring.  </li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t it disgusting that manufacturers DON&#x27;T CARE?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this so much more than any other cocoa butter product I&#x27;ve ever used! &amp; It smells strongly of chocolate :) I originally bought it for scarring after an accident but since have found a thousand uses for it: chapstick, dry skin, scar cream, etc. It turned my rough flaky elbows smooth in ONE USE! This is an easy to use convenient product that gets carried around in my purse! This is going to be a product I use for the rest of my life!</li>
            <li> Got it for a friend, he swears by it and loves it.</li>
            <li> I would never buy this product again.  I bought one just to check it out, it was completely dried up and broken.  I tried to rub it on and it wouldn&#x27;t even transfer to the skin.  Save your money and just by Palmers Cocoa Butter Lotion at Wal-mart, works great (I discovered it after I made this mistake purchase)</li>
            <li> Pros: Inexpensive - Long Lasting - 100% Natural - Smells Awesome - Non Irritating - Absorbs Well - Can Be Used All Over Body,  Face, Lips, Hands - Easy To Use - Sooths &amp; Softens - Great For All Ages - Works For Chapped Lips - Great For Dry Patches - Cheap Enough To Have Extras - Easy To Pack For Trips - Works To Smooth Dry/Frizzed Hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love It! Not a miracle but very helpful, very nice!</li>
            <li> I have used cocoa butter for years and truly believe in its healing properties. I finally realized if you take your hair dryer and heat up the cocoa butter stick after pushing it up, it will soften up and make it easier to rub on your skin. Hope this helps everyone!</li>
            <li> Perfect...Perfect size, Perfect price, Simply Perfect!</li>
            <li> Stuck in the container after one or two days. Can&#x27;t get it out short of scooping it with a spoon, which is not really what you want to do with a &amp;#34;moisturizing stick.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I received the product and barely opened it and it was all melted. had to throw it away. such a shame</li>
            <li> I love these things.  I buy them 2 or 3 at a time and throw one in my purse, one in a gym bag, and one in my husband&#x27;s shaving kit bag.  The product is so simple and perfect and glides on...</li>
            <li> This has been a staple of mine forever.  I&#x27;m a fan of natural products and like this much better than the alternatives which usually contain mineral oil as a main ingredient. I normally buy this in store from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply, but I had a couple bucks left on a gift card and got it here. Your local Wal-mart might have it too, mine stopped carrying it years ago. It shouldn&#x27;t cost more than $1.75 wherever you get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in handy for adults and kids that bruise easily or are a bit on the clumsy side. Easily throw it in your bag and go! I recommend buying in store to avoid receiving a partially melted or cracked stick.  I unfortunately purchased online another time and it was broken which kept it from pushing up properly. You can also melt it and add it as an ingredient to any other health and beauty products.</li>
            <li> I really like cocoa butter. The stick is convenient. However, I live in the northeast and when it gets colder, it can be really hard to push up the stick with your finger. I usually end up running it under hot water, or cramming the end of a butter knife in there. I wish it had a bigger diameter too. It&#x27;s pretty tiny.</li>
            <li> This product is working quite well. It melts right away with the heat of your skin and rubs on smoothly. It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky which is nice because shea butter is a little on the sticky side. It&#x27;s nice, small, and compact and great for it&#x27;s low price. I will surely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have used this since I was a little girl. My mom has used this since forever. Cocoa butter is great for everything from stretch marks, to dry skin, to discoloration. Use it! Especially if you have a darker pigmentation. I&#x27;m like a dark olive and my moms a dark chocolate.</li>
            <li> I have used this daily on my face to keep from getting wrinkles.  I&#x27;m 44 this year and have been using these sticks for about the last 7 years and have noticed my face seems to be defying the aging process.  There are products out there that claim to do the same thing, but will probably cost you a lot more.  I bought these because Walgreens stopped carrying them.  This is the source I will use if I cannot find them anywhere else.  Order them during the winter or cooler months, because they will liquefy during the summer.  They seem to know this, because the packaging kept it from leaking out.</li>
            <li> Works quite well. I hope it works better than the Spectragel.  I&#x27;ve said all I want to say.  Good bye</li>
            <li> Too dry couldn&#x27;t  even use it waste of money</li>
            <li> This is a terrific little product.  I have dry skin, but hate to use conventional lotion because my work requires a lot of computer use.  Having the sensation of lotion on my finger tips is very annoying because it affects my keyboarding speed and the overall sensation.  I love this product because it&#x27;s inexpensive (I bought it in a store, not from Amazon, and it was only $1.99), works great, smells incredible, and I can apply it to the backs of my hands or my legs, etc. without getting it on my fingertips.  It&#x27;s very basic, very cheap and very effective.</li>
            <li> When I received this stick, it wasn&#x27;t quite what I expected.  I thought I would receive a stick that would have a substance inside that could be smoothly and easily applied like a lip balm.  Not so.  The product is stiff and crumbly and doesn&#x27;t glide very well across the skin.  I also hate the packaging of this product.  The user has to push the product up (like a push pop) and this is not always easy; the stiff product gets stuck in the tube and doesn&#x27;t budge easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the size of the product.  It fits easily in a purse and when applied (after some elbow grease), does moisturize.  While it does moisturize, I think that a better moisturizer is coconut oil.  Coconut oil can be purchased as a liquid but also within a jar in a solid state. Most coconut oils that are left at room temperature are soft and can be smoothed fairly easily across the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is made in the United States.</li>
            <li> Do you have dark spots? Bruises? acne discolorations? Buy this now! It&#x27;s only like $1. Trust me this will change your life. I realized I had a bruise on my arm the other day. I put this product on the bruise 3-4 times a day and now 3 days later its basically gone. I use this on a scar every other day and it has been fading as well.</li>
            <li> I had surgery on my elbow with some nasty scarring.  This cocoa butter softens skin and improves skin texture while providing a nice medium for scar mobilizations.  The scar has now faded to a nice white with improvements in texture and stiffness. I highly recommend.  It also smells mildly of chocolate, which makes it all the more pleasant to use.</li>
            <li> of course there is a first time for everything&lt;br /&gt;this was it&lt;br /&gt;the product was never sent&lt;br /&gt;:-(&lt;br /&gt;amazon has been wonderful over the years and it will continue to serve millions of customers  ... it would be greatly appreciated it they could look into this one&lt;br /&gt;this was just an unfortunate event</li>
            <li> I have this stick here that I&#x27;ve had for probably over 2 years.  Still good.&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers commented that it&#x27;s dry (instead of wet and oily), but all you have to do is wipe it back and forth on your lips firmly and that heats it up perfectly.  Mwah!</li>
            <li> great stuff, used for eyebrow flaking - cleared it up in a few days</li>
            <li> My mom bought this when I was a kid. I&#x27;m now 48, I have her last stick from years ago. Rarely had a use for it, once in a while I would use for extremely dry spots. Worked great! I recently had major neck surgery and arm surgery. Left with large scars. Regular lotion is okay, but bothers my allergies, specifically allergy eyes. This pure cocoa butter does not affect my allergies in the least. It seems to be lightening the more minor scars and the area os rxtreme tightness around my wrist scar is feeling much better since I switched to this as opposed to regular lotions.  I haven&#x27;t seen it in a store in years. So glad Amazon has it. 100%pure, probably why its not affecting allergies and skin adversely.Highly recommend for sensitive skin/allergies.</li>
            <li> Smell like chocolate yum!! I&#x27;m guessing because cocoa butter melts easily, the hotter your climate the more liquidly it would be.  At the moment where I live it&#x27;s blazing summer so it applys very easily to my lips. Very shining and protects well. I did put it in the fridge for a bit and I liked it a lot better so I would use this more in the winter. The packaging kinda sucks, you have to push it up like a push pop and the lid pretty difficult to get off. But over all it&#x27;s a great product for the lips, love the size it&#x27;s hilariously big, I think some the product was missing, because it was only filled 3/4 of the way but it may not, also as a tip you can use it other place such as if you have a dry patch</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help at all with my stretch marks and it was very hard to apply on the skin, the stick kept pushing back in</li>
            <li> I bought a one-ounce stick at my local health food store, for two bucks. Because I have allergies, it is important to try products without huge financial investment, so this seems reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now I am using it on my (now happy) lips, rather than the commercial products that have additives with long chemical names. I plan to also use it on the place where my computer stool has made unpleasant calluses as well as on my elbows that rest on the desk until I think to stop that behavior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cocoa butter is most pleasant and the cocoa smell is there but not very strong - quite acceptable. It does seem to be a particularly effective emollient and is quite without any of the additives that experts are advising us to stay away from. (Think \\&quot;dimethicone\\&quot;, a silicon polymer that makes products more spreadable but unfortunately forms an impenetrable barrier that, while it may prevent moisture loss, also traps bacteria, etc. and prevents normal transpiration and absorption of necessary medications you apply later, is an allergen for some plus is not biodegradable and these days is found in a huge majority of skin products. Whew. Isn&#x27;t it disgusting that manufacturers DON&#x27;T CARE?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cocoa butter stick comes packaged in a plastic tube with a manual push-up feature that means that with each use, if you want to recap it, you must push it back down. So far so good - the cap itself pushes it down without creating a mess, at least at 55F. But it doesn&#x27;t bode well for this coming summer. Also there was no protective packaging which means that nothing would prevent another customer from trying it out, contributing a virus that might or might not survive on that medium, and putting it back on the shelf.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t actually used this cocoa butter yet, but I intend to update my review when I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this cocoa butter stick specifically for my lips, because they dry out very quickly. I know it can be used for other things but I&#x27;ve yet to find other uses for it. The package came before I expected and because I wasn&#x27;t the person who checked the mailbox, it was left in the sun all night and Sunday morning. When I picked up the package I felt how big the sticks were (I bought 2 and they much bigger than I thought they would be)... halfway up my driveway I noticed my hand was wet, I looked down and was mortified by what I saw. Yellow slime leaking from the bottom of the package onto my bare leg and arms..... oh well, at least it smells good and it&#x27;s REAL cocoa butter. I don&#x27;t think it would melt like that if it was full of chemicals and fake stuff. I may need to order again, but at least I know to check my mailbox on and before the determined delivery date in order to avoid this happening again.</li>
            <li> I am moving towards using natural products on skin, hair,etc. One step I have taken is to stop using Vaseline and other petroleum products. The only problem I had was the fact that Vaseline was the only product that kept my feet moisturized while I wore sandals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day I saw the Cococare Cocoa Butter Stick at CVS and decided to give it a try. I rubbed the stick on my feet followed by a touch of olive oil. The mixture kept my feet supple and moisturized all day while I walked around in sandals! The mixture absorbed into my skin wonderfully. I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;ve found a natural alternative to using Vaseline to moisturize my feet. I&#x27;ll be a loyal Cococare Cocoa Butter Stick user for life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Cocoa Butter</li>
            <li> Great product!  All natural, my skin loves it!  Tried and true natural resource. Easy application .Hope they will continue to be available..</li>
            <li> got to get more.  So many good uses.</li>
            <li> Lamest packaging EVER! Rattles around loosely in a push-up container that doesn&#x27;t fit the product! The entire thing has to be sort of held by the middle and squeezed so the cocoa butter stick doesn&#x27;t just push back down or fall completely out. The stick is at least .25&amp;#34; smaller in diameter than the container, so it is totally loose??? Also too crumbly and flakey...will NOT purchase again. I&#x27;d rather pay 15 times more for something that has a proper twist-up applicator. You get what you pay for, people!</li>
            <li> Good for scars and a way better price than I could get in local stores.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove scars.</li>
            <li> I use this cocoa butter to prevent scarring. It has worked exceedingly well over the years. If you read the ingredients you will notice that cocoa butter is the main one. I also use it on my eyelids, lips, and rough skin.</li>
            <li> Great body moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I got this product because I recently got a  new tattoo and someone told me it works the best. They did not lie when they said it. It kept my tattoo&#x27;s color very vibrant and it helped it heal fast. It&#x27;s not very greasy and it has a wonderful smell.</li>
            <li> came broken... but good</li>
            <li> I use this cocoa butter on my face and it looks great since i use it. the smell is great also. i love this stick and i think i ll never use again non natural creams for my body and face. just five stars without hesitation.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and they didn&#x27;t have anything bad to say about the product.</li>
            <li> Coco butter sticks always works nothing new here. This stuff removed all of my stretch marks, but I had to use twice a day and buy plenty of them</li>
            <li> I love pure cocoa butter and use it daily. This stick is 100% pure cocoa butter and can be used on lips and body. Unlike some other cocoa butter balms (like Palmer&#x27;s stick) this can be difficult to use due to it&#x27;s hardness. Cocoa butter generally melts at about 90 degrees Fahrenheit and is not creamy or pliable on it&#x27;s own. This product is better for melting and mixing with other skin healing oils and butters for making homemade lotions or soaps. I keep these on hand in case my main supply of food grade cocoa butter runs out.</li>
            <li> the stick comes out completely.</li>
            <li> Nice and delicious! Smells like chocolate and can keep my lips moisture. I&#x27;ve already recommended it to everybody around me.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Cococare Coco Butter stick a few months ago. I use it moisten my cuticles after I was my hands. It smells good and the stick form was convenient as first but at some point the stick fell completely out and hasn&#x27;t held since. So every time I use it I have to make sure that it doesn&#x27;t fall onto the floor. I think in the future I will buy the little jar of the coco butter that&#x27;s more like lotion.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face as sort of a make up replacement.  If the cocoa is a little stiff you can warm it up on your forehead before using it on sensitive areas like eyes.  It gives your skin a glow and is excellent for adding the extra umph after a tan</li>
            <li> This is perfect. I absolutely love cocoa butter for lips now, it&#x27;s the only thing that works and it&#x27;s still small enough to put in my purse.</li>
            <li> I am totally in love with this product! it was so cheap and lasts so long. Just roll it on and it will leave whatever part of your body soft and smooth. Plus it makes my body smell like chocolate! Would recommend to anyone with dry skin or stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Smells yummy! works great! natural! no itch. feels good. i bought 3 sticks and i will keep buying more. it was crumbly but i just melt the cocoa butter in the container in the microwave and let it thicken at room temperature. now its smooth. love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great little travel stick or for on the go or if you don&#x27;t wanna get it on your hands. It&#x27;s kinda hard at first but then it starts to melt on your skin. It smells like chocolate! I love that it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li> i love this i used it in my she butter whipp it melted really good but the cocoa smell wasnt as strong as i would have liked it</li>
            <li> I have ordered a bunch of things on Amazon, some the same day as this product and some before, and somehow I have recieved all of my other products but this is yet to arrive. What is the hold up? I am currently in Afghanistan in need of a good product to aid with my hperpigmentation due to the harsh weahther conditions here and it really sucks I have to wait so long for one product.</li>
            <li> Having eczema I go through alot of various moisturizers cocoa butter being one of my favorites. This one is considerably cheaper than the other brand I can find locally (the other brand goes for $2.49 at the health food store) and its easier to come by at many chain pharmacy&#x27;s. The one I purchased seems to have a stronger scent than other brands ive tried which I adore. Already recieved a few comments about how lovely the room smelled when I walked in :). I find cocoa butter the fastest absorbing most protective oils ive used which is why I prefer it for my purse. Just wish it came in an easier more sanitary container like a mini deoderant. One of these days i&#x27;ll buy some empties and do it myself. Not fun to find lint and junk that creeped into the tube when its half used.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as described. The only thing I will nit pick is the tube it&#x27;s in. It could be a little tighter, When you push the product up it will just fall back down unless you keep your finger in place holding it. That is the only flaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this is really fresh, and you can tell it&#x27;s 100% pure. It smells so much like cocoa that since I bought this as a present and now I&#x27;m trying to hide it, the smell is going to be a problem.  It lookes really high quality definatly a great price to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom LIne Is: I&#x27;ll be buying this as needed and it will probably be my go-to brand from now on.</li>
            <li> Really strong Smell, it literally fell apart when I opened, going to try for a week to see a difference in my Stretch marks.</li>
            <li> just the smell was a bit werid but it might be something i just get used too or something it smelled like.. some kind of coco not really sweet smelling</li>
            <li> you didn NOT send me the cococare 100% cocoa butter, but substituted shea butter...i was certainly not happy about that as i am allergic to the shea butter and did want the 100 % cocoa butter...i also placed an order for 3 of those sticks (cocoa butter) and those too came through as shea butter...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i notified amazon of this and they credited my account for the three sticks of shea butter...i had opened this replacement shea butter  to see if i could use it as a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so...will find other supplier in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;margaret keith</li>
            <li> I really like this small convenience  size cococare stick.Recommended for any one who just want to moisturize there skin when needed.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It is great.  It&#x27;s a great moisturizer and has no chemicals. I use it on my face also.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good it smells reallly nice and it seems to be helping. it&#x27;s also a really great value i&#x27;ve been useing it a lot so i&#x27;m almost out but i&#x27;d order more.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS LIKE MAGIC ON MY 62 YEAR OLD DRY SKIN, INSTANT MOIST &amp; SMOOTH SKIN WITH THE FIRST APPLICATION!! I&#x27;M GOING TO STOCK UP ON THESE BEFORE THEY WAKE UP AND TRIPLE THE PRICE!!</li>
