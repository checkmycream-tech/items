            <li>I couldn&#x27;t agree more!</li>
            <li>I bought this item on Bubzbeauty&#x27;s recommendation and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I think I love it!</li>
            <li>She raved about how clean it make her face and that although it doesn&#x27;t exfloiate as good as the Clarisonic</li>
            <li>, still it&#x27;s pretty self explanatory and works great.</li>
            <li>she felt like it cleaned better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a much better option than just using my fingers.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something more exfoliating that this pad turned out to be.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>You must get this! :-)</li>
            <li>would recommend this product for anyone looking for a cute and efficient way to wash their face.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I found this product here.</li>
            <li>and so far so good!</li>
            <li>Let me tell you, I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li>package came VERY quickly.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin glowing and baby smooth.</li>
            <li>I liked this so much</li>
            <li>Its good for daily use or even fully exfoliating a mask or scrub to rub in better on the skin.</li>
            <li>This cleansing pad is silicone and easier to keep clean.  </li>
            <li>but I just use clean hands to finish washing my face.</li>
            <li>Makes a difference when you massage your face, is great for circulation plus the material is very flexible and soft.</li>
            <li>It also very gentle and cleans super easy.</li>
            <li>I use Pro X Cleansing system by Oil of Olay and have for years because it makes my face clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>skin glowed after the first use even without using any specials soaps or potions!</li>
            <li>My chin and forehead are very smooth and clear now, but I have to continue to work on the tip and folds of my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i chose this to see if it worked, because it is supposed to have similar effects to the foreo luna, a pricey but amazing tool for skin care.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say this is probably worth about $5 and not the $10 I paid.</li>
            <li>It is made out of silicone, feels gentle yet really massaging and is just really an inexpensive tool to get that face clean!</li>
            <li>this product is definitely one of my favorite purchases, it also came just as described.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this seller!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;xoxo :)</li>
            <li>I remove my makeup first with a cleansing towelette and then apply my liquid cleanser and water.</li>
            <li>This cleansing pad is so gentle!</li>
            <li>I am liking this pad so much!</li>
            <li>I know it is pretty self-explanatory-</li>
            <li>Got mine at a cute Japanese store at the mall here in San Jose, CA for a 1.50!</li>
            <li>In addition, the nub like texture was too soft to really clean pores or remove any traces of makeup.</li>
            <li>it really feels like you&#x27;re having a deep clean in your skin!</li>
            <li>This little handy dandy silicon pad does the trick for me.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see any difference using this, if anything, it made me break out.</li>
            <li>and I really like the combo of foaming cleanser with this brush, compared to when I used an exfoliating cleanser with no brush.</li>
            <li>I feel that this pad cleanses and scrubs very well without scratching at all.  </li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>I really like how my skin feels and looks while using this product.</li>
            <li>bristles are super soft and non-irritating to the skin, but still manages to clean deep.</li>
            <li>It really did not deliver.</li>
            <li>Cleans REALLY well.</li>
            <li>This little item is just short of amazing!  </li>
            <li>, then use this tool to get a deep clean.</li>
            <li>I used to use a facial brush to deep clean my face with my favorite cleanser but found facial brushes irritated my skin.</li>
            <li>I purchased this particular pad from watching Jen of From Head To Toe&#x27;s March Favorites Video on YouTube.</li>
            <li>It does make my face red temporarily but that goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>Unless you have gaping pores, the &amp;#34;scrubies&amp;#34; are too large to clear out blackheads.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and soft.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;d recommend, especially for more sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and this doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle yet deeply cleanses your skin.</li>
            <li>Most of the ones I use in the past always scratch and irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>I just put some drops of my facial cleanser on it and girl, does this make everything nice and foamy!You are able to hygienically store this with the little sucker and just suck it to the mirror.</li>
            <li>Only down side that I noticed is that my skin doesn&#x27;t feel completely clean when using this because it is so gentle</li>
            <li>I saw this cleansing pad in a youtube tutorial on &amp;#34;how to achieve clear skin&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It helps exfoliate but is gentle enough not to aggravate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>If you really want to try this type of product, look at related products on amazon.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not harsh on my skin, I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Even sensitive skinned people will find this pad to be useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was a bit surprised.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m taking one star off for the higher price--I went ahead and purchased anyway because I knew I&#x27;d get this relatively faster than the other options shipping from Hong Kong.  </li>
            <li>The pad itself is about 3 inches long, not too big, but you&#x27;ll find that it doesn&#x27;t really matter how big</li>
            <li>Active acne users, be gentle with this.</li>
            <li>I also purchased something similar from Sephora at half the price, but the pads are flimsy and less easy to manage.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to try it with it out with other specialty facial cleansers to really ramp up this champ!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough to exfoliate my extremely sensitive skin and sturdy enough to last years without breaking down.</li>
            <li>The one I bought on Amazon came a little different, and didn&#x27;t seem like the real thing.</li>

            <li> The one I bought on Amazon came a little different, and didn&#x27;t seem like the real thing.</li>
            <li> It is gentle and I&#x27;ve definitely seen my skin improve over the course of the past couple of days.</li>
            <li> First off, this was much smaller than expected and can only cover a small area of the face while cleansing.</li>
            <li> As soon as you use this your face feels really smooth, it&#x27;s weird.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had it long at all, so</li>
            <li> I am curious though what the bottom portion of the pad does, seeing as how it has a different texture than the rest.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, so exfoliation is a must.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too harsh on my skin and leaves it feeling deeply cleaned and open.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday, I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and my face always feels really clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i wet my face, slap on a cleanser</li>
            <li> I can exfoliate my skin enough to rid all the dead skin and dirt out of my face every morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely getting a backup and a few for my mom and sister!</li>
            <li> There are tons of cheaper alternatives; I wish I would have done my research better before purchasing this product. :(</li>
            <li> but I would like to know what the other texturized surface is used for...</li>
            <li> it nearly wipes away blackheads for me, even on hard to navigate places like my nose!</li>
            <li> It helps and I do see a reduction in black heads.</li>
            <li> The quality was not good, and was way different than the one I bought from sasa.</li>
            <li> I bought this little pad to try to get rid of what I *thought*</li>
            <li> this little guy is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This little guy makes my face glow.</li>
            <li> Well I did a test and used a toner after cleaning with both and by far this little thing didn&#x27;t leave anything behind!</li>
            <li> I use it everyday, its a must-have product for me.</li>
            <li> I dot my facial cleanser over my face then use this to scrub, it&#x27;s non irritating.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see what a difference it makes in a few weeks!</li>
            <li> I use this cleansing pad when I am too lazy to pull out my clarisonic and it works well.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s ridiculously overpriced for what the product is-- 10 bucks for a bit of rubbery plastic?</li>
            <li> Although I did not notice my black heads going away, yet. :(</li>
            <li> so I might have been using it wrong</li>
            <li> I was shocked because my Pro X always leaves some dirt/make up on my toner pad.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see any difference using this, if anything, it made me break out. It&#x27;s smaller than it appears maybe if the instructions were in English that would help.</li>
            <li> Great addition to my skincare. I use it with the Garnier Moisture Rescue foaming cleanser and I really like the combo of foaming cleanser with this brush, compared to when I used an exfoliating cleanser with no brush. I think my skin likes it too-- though that might just be the change in cleanser brands.</li>
            <li> it nearly wipes away blackheads for me, even on hard to navigate places like my nose! i wet my face, slap on a cleanser, then use this tool to get a deep clean. i chose this to see if it worked, because it is supposed to have similar effects to the foreo luna, a pricey but amazing tool for skin care. this product is definitely one of my favorite purchases, it also came just as described.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cleansing pad! I purchased this particular pad from watching Jen of From Head To Toe&#x27;s March Favorites Video on YouTube. She raved about how clean it make her face and that although it doesn&#x27;t exfloiate as good as the Clarisonic she felt like it cleaned better. I couldn&#x27;t agree more! My skin is very sensitive and this doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. It&#x27;s very gentle yet deeply cleanses your skin. I can already tell a difference and I haven&#x27;t had it long at all, so I can&#x27;t wait to see what a difference it makes in a few weeks! I&#x27;m definitely getting a backup and a few for my mom and sister!</li>
            <li> I bought this little pad to try to get rid of what I *thought* were blackheads on my nose and chin, but I&#x27;m realizing are actually sebaceous filaments.  I feel that this pad cleanses and scrubs very well without scratching at all.  I squirt some Cetaphil on the pad and get to work, but I&#x27;ll try the Oil Cleansing Method when the weather begins to turn colder.  My chin and forehead are very smooth and clear now, but I have to continue to work on the tip and folds of my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m taking one star off for the higher price--I went ahead and purchased anyway because I knew I&#x27;d get this relatively faster than the other options shipping from Hong Kong.  Overall, I&#x27;d recommend, especially for more sensitive skin.  Active acne users, be gentle with this.</li>
            <li> I really like this it really feels like you&#x27;re having a deep clean in your skin! Although I did not notice my black heads going away, yet. :(</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting. Was happy with the purchase. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this item on Bubzbeauty&#x27;s recommendation and I absolutely love it! It&#x27;s gentle enough to exfoliate my extremely sensitive skin and sturdy enough to last years without breaking down. I&#x27;m so happy I bought it!</li>
            <li> Love this product! It&#x27;s not too harsh on my skin and leaves it feeling deeply cleaned and open. Its good for daily use or even fully exfoliating a mask or scrub to rub in better on the skin. It&#x27;s a much better option than just using my fingers. The only thing was I couldn&#x27;t read the directions on the back because they were all in a different language so I might have been using it wrong, still it&#x27;s pretty self explanatory and works great. I use it everyday, its a must-have product for me.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something more exfoliating that this pad turned out to be. Unless you have gaping pores, the &amp;#34;scrubies&amp;#34; are too large to clear out blackheads. Personally, I get the same degree of exfoliating effect using this as I would just scrubbing my face with a washcloth. Plus, it&#x27;s ridiculously overpriced for what the product is-- 10 bucks for a bit of rubbery plastic? If you really want to try this type of product, look at related products on amazon. There are tons of cheaper alternatives; I wish I would have done my research better before purchasing this product. :(</li>
            <li> I use it with philosophy purity face wash and massage on my face in the shower. I tend to wash my face in the shower in the morning and at night I use different products. I like it. It helps and I do see a reduction in black heads. It&#x27;s gentle and soft.</li>
            <li> I used to use a facial brush to deep clean my face with my favorite cleanser but found facial brushes irritated my skin. This little handy dandy silicon pad does the trick for me. I dot my facial cleanser over my face then use this to scrub, it&#x27;s non irritating.</li>
            <li> This little item is just short of amazing!  I&#x27;m a product &#x27;junkie&#x27; and am constantly searching for products which will improve my complexion.  I&#x27;d been using the Clarisonic system, but was concerned with bacteria accumulation after even one use.  This cleansing pad is silicone and easier to keep clean.  I can use any of my facial cleansers and even scrubs with this.  My complexion has obviously improved....pores are even smaller!  I also purchased something similar from Sephora at half the price, but the pads are flimsy and less easy to manage.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s not harsh on my skin, I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. Only down side that I noticed is that my skin doesn&#x27;t feel completely clean when using this because it is so gentle but I just use clean hands to finish washing my face.</li>
            <li> I use this cleansing pad when I am too lazy to pull out my clarisonic and it works well.  It does make my face red temporarily but that goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product on sasa.com before but I lost it, that&#x27;s why I wanted to buy a second one. The one I bought on Amazon came a little different, and didn&#x27;t seem like the real thing. The quality was not good, and was way different than the one I bought from sasa.</li>
            <li> I really like how my skin feels and looks while using this product.</li>
            <li> I saw this cleansing pad in a youtube tutorial on &amp;#34;how to achieve clear skin&amp;#34;. Let me tell you, I was not disappointed! The pad itself is about 3 inches long, not too big, but you&#x27;ll find that it doesn&#x27;t really matter how big this little guy is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are super soft and non-irritating to the skin, but still manages to clean deep. Even sensitive skinned people will find this pad to be useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin glowed after the first use even without using any specials soaps or potions! I can&#x27;t wait to try it with it out with other specialty facial cleansers to really ramp up this champ!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My package came VERY quickly. It arrived within 2 days of me ordering it. I would definitely recommend this seller!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;xoxo :)</li>
            <li> First off, this was much smaller than expected and can only cover a small area of the face while cleansing. In addition, the nub like texture was too soft to really clean pores or remove any traces of makeup. I remove my makeup first with a cleansing towelette and then apply my liquid cleanser and water. I then used the item in a circular motion on my face. It really did not deliver. Out it goes.</li>
            <li> I give it 5 stars. I like it a lot and makes my skin feel awesome! Great price as well!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, so exfoliation is a must. Most of the ones I use in the past always scratch and irritate my skin. This cleansing pad is so gentle! I can exfoliate my skin enough to rid all the dead skin and dirt out of my face every morning. It leaves my skin glowing and baby smooth.</li>
            <li> I am liking this pad so much! It is made out of silicone, feels gentle yet really massaging and is just really an inexpensive tool to get that face clean! I love it and I am so happy I found this. I just put some drops of my facial cleanser on it and girl, does this make everything nice and foamy!You are able to hygienically store this with the little sucker and just suck it to the mirror. I saw they have this now at Sephora for only $6! You must get this! :-)</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday, I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and my face always feels really clean.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product for anyone looking for a cute and efficient way to wash their face.</li>
            <li> I liked this so much I purchased a second one to keep in the shower. It helps exfoliate but is gentle enough not to aggravate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleansing pad for about a week now and so far so good! It does the job and it does it well. It is gentle and I&#x27;ve definitely seen my skin improve over the course of the past couple of days. I am curious though what the bottom portion of the pad does, seeing as how it has a different texture than the rest. The one thing I do wish for in the product is instructions in english. I know it is pretty self-explanatory- but I would like to know what the other texturized surface is used for...</li>
            <li> This little guy makes my face glow. Cleans REALLY well. I was a bit surprised. I use Pro X Cleansing system by Oil of Olay and have for years because it makes my face clean and fresh. Well I did a test and used a toner after cleaning with both and by far this little thing didn&#x27;t leave anything behind! I was shocked because my Pro X always leaves some dirt/make up on my toner pad. I think I will pick up another one. Got mine at a cute Japanese store at the mall here in San Jose, CA for a 1.50! It also very gentle and cleans super easy. I think I love it!</li>
            <li> As soon as you use this your face feels really smooth, it&#x27;s weird. I just think it was a bit overpriced! I&#x27;d say this is probably worth about $5 and not the $10 I paid.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I found this product here. I sed to buy it on chinatown nyc. Makes a difference when you massage your face, is great for circulation plus the material is very flexible and soft. I will buy it again.</li>
