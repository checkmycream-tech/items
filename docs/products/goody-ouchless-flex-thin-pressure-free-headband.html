            <li>They are very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>The flexible tips make these very comfortable and helps hold the band&#x27;s in place.</li>

            <li>I love these headbands.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the flex tip, but they do the job.</li>
            <li>I will continue my search for more of the Ouchless Flex Comfort headbands without the flex tip...</li>
            <li>I am confident using these knowing</li>
            <li>my favorite headband.  </li>
            <li>what more to say.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Works ok -</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find such a great selection, quantity, and quality of headbands at such a great deal!!!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s because they fall off my head easily.  </li>
            <li>I suffer from headaches and these are easy on the head.  </li>
            <li>I love these, been converting my family members to them since normal headbands hurt and give me kind of a headache.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much-we are so pleased!</li>
            <li>They fit the head perfectly without being too tight.</li>
            <li>I looked at the package, YOU BEND IT to fit your head.</li>
            <li>These are advertised as pressure free and they are--</li>
            <li>have only been wearing it a day, so I do not know how it will hold up over time, but today I am delighted.</li>
            <li>It is cheap but it is not that useful.</li>
            <li>and so they neither look quite right nor feel so comfortable.</li>
            <li>I am a mother who enjoys being able to put her hair back using these comfort headbands (age-appropriate for all:)</li>
            <li>These headbands are great - they don&#x27;t pinch my head and I can adjust if they do start to feel tight.</li>
            <li>For the right sized head, I think they&#x27;d be comfortable, but for my head size, they didn&#x27;t really shape or form to my head</li>
            <li>you are not sure, I encourage you to give it a try, I am really happy I did.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The headbands look nice enough (though clearly plastic) but they didn&#x27;t really fit well.</li>
            <li>saying they were shipping a set of headbands and to return the first set.</li>
            <li>Wish i could find more colors of the same style.</li>
            <li>These are comfortable, hold my hair back well, and are very durable.</li>
            <li>I wish the 1\\&quot; headbands of the same style and brand were as comfortable.</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;handle&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Better than most but still uncomfortable after awhile.</li>
            <li>When I got it out of the package it was sure it was going to be too small, I put it on and thought What is with the thing sticking out??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much more durable than the ones I can buy in my small town.</li>
            <li>Oh well, it does hold my hair back when I really need it!</li>
            <li>I think if they made the adjustable part larger I might be able to get away with it, but it just isn&#x27;t long enough and still causes pressure points for me.</li>
            <li>Old fashioned bands always gave me a headache and didn&#x27;t stay in place.  </li>
            <li>There was no mention that there was a size difference (like child size vs adult)</li>
            <li>I have very thick hair and many headbands</li>

            <li> It can not hold your hair very tight.</li>
            <li> are to small for my head, but I have had this on all day and my hair has stayed put.</li>
            <li> I had some of these that were longer on the sides with small combs at each end.  </li>
            <li> I had them for years and was unable to find them after they finally broke.  </li>
            <li> I complained to Amazon and they sent me another order of 6 headbands.</li>
            <li> You can bend the tips so that there isn&#x27;t any pressure being placed behind your ears and it will still stay in place.</li>
            <li> I use these everyday, and these are almost impossible to break.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t they read the complaint!!</li>
            <li> And it makes me feel so weird around ears when I put it on</li>
            <li> Sadly this headbadn still gives me headaches everytime i wear it.  </li>

            <li> I got it at another store but I am going to get more. I needed a headband because my favorite one broke, I grabbed this as a replacement. When I got it out of the package it was sure it was going to be too small, I put it on and thought What is with the thing sticking out??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I looked at the package, YOU BEND IT to fit your head. Both sides actually bend but one comes pre bent. I have very thick hair and many headbands are to small for my head, but I have had this on all day and my hair has stayed put. I LOVE IT. Very comfortable too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are not sure, I encourage you to give it a try, I am really happy I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only been wearing it a day, so I do not know how it will hold up over time, but today I am delighted.</li>
            <li> Love these headbands.  They fit the head perfectly without being too tight.</li>
            <li> The details say \\&quot;50 count\\&quot; in groups of 3. There were a total of 6 heaqdbands in the pkg. that I got.  I complained to Amazon and they sent me another order of 6 headbands. I specifically mentioned the \\&quot;50 count\\&quot; and expected that amount! Why else would they put \\&quot;50 count\\&quot; in the description? Then I got an email from Amazon  saying they were shipping a set of headbands and to return the first set. If I didn&#x27;t return them then they were charging me for them again and with additional shipping.  When they arrived it ws another set of 6 headbands.......... Don&#x27;t they read the complaint!! What a waste of my time and theirs.  Now What?  I should just send them back and drive to Walmart.</li>
            <li> These 1/2\\&quot; headbands are the best I&#x27;ve ever worn.  They are very comfortable.  I wish the 1\\&quot; headbands of the same style and brand were as comfortable.</li>
            <li> These are advertised as pressure free and they are--but it&#x27;s because they fall off my head easily.  I had some of these that were longer on the sides with small combs at each end.  I had them for years and was unable to find them after they finally broke.  I used them under my shower cap to keep my hair dry.  These slip off under the shower cap.  I definitely would not buy them again.</li>
            <li> I love these headbands.  The flexible tips make these very comfortable and helps hold the band&#x27;s in place. Old fashioned bands always gave me a headache and didn&#x27;t stay in place.  I wear glasses and I can bend the tips out of the way of the glasses ear pieces.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love the flex tip, but they do the job. I will continue my search for more of the Ouchless Flex Comfort headbands without the flex tip...</li>
            <li> I use these everyday, and these are almost impossible to break. I am confident using these knowing they won&#x27;t snap on me mid-day, or mid-trip. The rubber ends are great too. And if my toddler pulls it off my head, I&#x27;m not going to panic that if he bites it, or pulls on it that it will suddenly snap apart into pieces and cause any injuries. This is the prefect headband for me. Hope they make it forever!</li>
            <li> my favorite headband.  what more to say.  :)</li>
            <li> There was no mention that there was a size difference (like child size vs adult) these seem to be a child&#x27;s head size. It is much smaller than the one I already have.</li>
            <li> I suffer from headaches and these are easy on the head.  Wish i could find more colors of the same style.</li>
            <li> These headbands are great - they don&#x27;t pinch my head and I can adjust if they do start to feel tight.</li>
            <li> I wear hairbands every day. These are comfortable, hold my hair back well, and are very durable. Much more durable than the ones I can buy in my small town. I would recommend these.</li>
            <li> The headbands look nice enough (though clearly plastic) but they didn&#x27;t really fit well. For the right sized head, I think they&#x27;d be comfortable, but for my head size, they didn&#x27;t really shape or form to my head and so they neither look quite right nor feel so comfortable.</li>
            <li> Not ouchless. Better than most but still uncomfortable after awhile.</li>
            <li> It is cheap but it is not that useful. It can not hold your hair very tight. And it makes me feel so weird around ears when I put it on</li>
            <li> Works ok - but I really don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;handle&amp;#34; that sticks out. Odd configuration. Oh well, it does hold my hair back when I really need it!</li>
            <li> Not a big fan--found the shape to be strange</li>
            <li> They are snug and still hurt the sides of my head, and I have a smaller head.  I wish the flex were continued further up.</li>
            <li> Sadly this headbadn still gives me headaches everytime i wear it.  I think if they made the adjustable part larger I might be able to get away with it, but it just isn&#x27;t long enough and still causes pressure points for me.</li>
            <li> I love these, been converting my family members to them since normal headbands hurt and give me kind of a headache. You can bend the tips so that there isn&#x27;t any pressure being placed behind your ears and it will still stay in place. Came with 3 black, 1 brown, 1 purple, and 1 gray.</li>
            <li> I am a mother who enjoys being able to put her hair back using these comfort headbands (age-appropriate for all:) What an excellent buy- I have not been able to find such a great selection, quantity, and quality of headbands at such a great deal!!! Thanks so much-we are so pleased!</li>
