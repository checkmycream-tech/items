            <li> The makeup I got looked like a little kids like dress up kit.</li>
            <li> It is low quality makeup and very very very hard to get off.</li>
            <li> The outside plastic container was broken into pieces and there was makeup spilling out all of the sides.</li>
            <li> and it was broken the colors where smashed they where every where and it was open.</li>
            <li> When this arrived the makeup was all over the place, dried up and cracked, all over the inside of the box.  </li>
            <li> It was broken and all the powders were shattered and mixed into the few that survived; rendering them unusable.</li>
            <li> very little (can be used for makeup fixes)&lt;br</li>
            <li> NOT SURE</li>
            <li> but was a bit small than it looks.</li>
            <li> Everything came as expected, except the lid was broken when I got it.  </li>
            <li> Small and contains all that is needed.</li>
            <li> Well its small an compact.</li>
            <li> Was for my mom and she&#x27;s hasn&#x27;t any  bad comment so far</li>
            <li> The only negative was the putter casing was CRACKED really bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m talking scrubbing face, taking shower, lots of soap hard to get off!</li>
            <li> A WEAK 6X6 SQUARE BOX.&lt;br /&gt;IM</li>
            <li> A couple of colours where broken</li>
            <li> but the case came broken and that is why I gave a three star rating.</li>
            <li> I was not happy about the care of the product so buyer beware.</li>
            <li> 3 eye-shadow brushes- Not great</li>
            <li> The product came broken and</li>
            <li> Plastic tray broken and makeup chipping out.</li>

            <li> My product arrived in good condition, the colors are beautiful</li>
            <li> It may have got broke during delivery. Part of the plastic was broke and a couple of the eye shadows. The rest of it was ok though. I didn&#x27;t send it back because the colors that were broke I wouldn&#x27;t use anyway. A little disappointed but overall I&#x27;m happy with the quality of the make-up.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves it and the colors are good</li>
            <li> Was so excited to get this for my daughter For Christmas! She loves make up and thought this would be perfect. Arrived completely trashed!

            <li> The first one I received was broken, a mess. The second one came just fine. Its a fun product but was a bit small than it looks.</li>
            <li> every piece of make up was shattered and the parts don&#x27;t stick together. worst make up kit I have ever bought</li>
            <li> The products are wonderful. But mine arrived missing  the mirror,  one slide out tray that is not connected and and a blush that was completely shattered. I would have sent it back but I really love the the staying power and the pigmentation.</li>
            <li> Arrived in great shape. Little smaller than I expected but a perfect gift. Its really neat how it opens up.</li>
            <li> AWESOME!!!!  Everything I need in one package.  Could use more eye shadow brushes though.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 6 year old daughter&#x27;s party and was blown away! This is SUCH a nice kit!! I use the blush and eye shadow myself every day. I am completely impressed for the quality. What a great deal.</li>
            <li> broke before it arrived was I pieces when received .</li>
            <li> Nice set, with many useful colours</li>
            <li> the makeup came quick and everything was intact. This was everything I was looking for and was a good price. I love how it opens up. For me thats pretty convenient. I would definitely recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> i bought it for someone in my family but it came damaged some off them where ruined and it was broken the colors where smashed they where every where and it was open.</li>
            <li> Got the makeup set delivered today.&lt;br /&gt;1. The makeup came intact- 5 stars for that&lt;br /&gt;2. The makeup quality- have not tried but seems good&lt;br /&gt;3. The makeup quantity- very little (can be used for makeup fixes)&lt;br /&gt;4. The makeup kit design- cute but be careful while opening , because you can chip of some eye-shadow color with your nails while opening. Plastic case does not close , so better have the outer cardboard case while travelling.&lt;br /&gt;5. 3 eye-shadow brushes- Not great; one blush brush- good; 1 eye pencil- nice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL- A decent one for $21( but not worth for more than 21). Good for starters. Holds good as a gift.</li>
            <li> Color is not very vivid and does not last very long. But is a fair deal for the amount of money.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it. But she is 20, so.</li>
            <li> came in early! Perfect conditions! Beautiful colors! Love all the mac and shinny colors! And the lip-sticks!  Easy to open and close! I would recommend!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my daughter as her first makeup kit and we absolutely love it. I did order different brushes to go with it since these aren&#x27;t that great of quality but all and all it is perfect for what we needed</li>
            <li> I bought this for my step-daughter as a xmas gift along with some make-up brushes and other beauty products.  When this arrived the makeup was all over the place, dried up and cracked, all over the inside of the box.  Needless to say this item was returned.  What I received looked nothing like the picture.  The best way to describe what we got would be if you took the picture, blew it up, and then boxed it up and mailed it to someone.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit for my niece who loves to do makeup and pretend to be a makeup artist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loves that it has so many choices and colors. It has given her TONS of fun since Christmas, and when I see her in some of her videos, I get to see what she can do with makeup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors seem vivid, and to stay put.</li>
            <li> Everything came as expected, except the lid was broken when I got it.  It has a lot of color choices to pick from and folds up so that I can easily put it away in my vanity drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Was for my mom and she&#x27;s hasn&#x27;t any  bad comment so far</li>
            <li> The make up works better than any I have ever used I love it</li>
            <li> the perfect came protected and all but the shippers need to be fragile when something is labeled fragile, which it was. The makeup came in perfect shape except the face-powder type thing was in ashes spilling everywhere because it was broken</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter who is 8. this makeup is strictly for play. I went ahead and purchased a more expensive product hoping that the quality would be decent. It is low quality makeup and very very very hard to get off. I&#x27;m talking scrubbing face, taking shower, lots of soap hard to get off! On the other hand the case is really cool.</li>
            <li> Great for my daughters stage make up. Small and contains all that is needed. Fits well in makeup kit. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more</li>
            <li> teenage grand daughter will love it</li>
            <li> It is smaller than it seems in the picture and fragile but it has a lot of colors.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Just like it looks my girlfriend  loved it . And said it was really good makeup. Not the cheap stuff .</li>
            <li> It was broken and all the powders were shattered and mixed into the few that survived; rendering them unusable. Either put a HANDLE WITH CARE label on them or don&#x27;t ship.</li>
            <li> I loved .. The product is original and meets my expectations .. in excellent condition it was received the package in time for holiday gifts</li>
            <li> The product came broken and the interior deteriorated.&lt;br /&gt;A shame not to have sent complaint for as long as I could have claimed.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product to anyone !!!</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it. Cool secret compartments.</li>

            <li> Smaller than expected</li>
            <li> Arrived damaged.  Plastic tray broken and makeup chipping out.</li>
            <li> Product and shipping as stated. Very easy interaction</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and in great condition! This was a gift for mother&#x27;s day and my Mom loved it! Yay!</li>
            <li> I purchased sets for My nieces and daughters to go along with their Christmas cash since adult kids are harder to buy for. all were very impressed witth quality. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Got in and makeup was broken.</li>
            <li> Compact, easy for traveling with a variety of colors perfect for every look!</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought and just an eye shadow pallet with a lil bit of lip gloss... Great colors though..</li>
            <li> I absolutly hated what I got. It was nothing like the picture. At all. The makeup I got looked like a little kids like dress up kit.</li>
            <li> I just received my kit today. From read the description I figured it was this big spread of make. 252pcs RIGHT?? Well its small an compact. The only negative was the putter casing was CRACKED really bad an some of the shadows were broken because of it. I guess what do you expected for $23.00</li>
            <li> Great love it .. You receive exactly what on the picture.</li>
            <li> The design wasn&#x27;t together as pictures. Make up seems good enough for play make up.</li>
            <li> Love the colors. Such a variety.</li>
            <li> The cover dose not stay on.</li>
            <li> The product is very high standard makeup kit,very gentle on skin,colors are unique,I wish to have a bigger kit of the same product with more products an colors.</li>
            <li> The engineering that went into this box is amazing!</li>
            <li> all in good condition , thanks</li>
