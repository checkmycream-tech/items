            <li>Works good.</li>
            <li>It is a good tool for practicing and learning how to tattoo.</li>
            <li>Otherwise good.  </li>
            <li>We found that the best way to clean the skin is to use baby wipes.  </li>
            <li>Even on your own tatoo&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Excellent quality and fast shipping, can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li>I would honestly give this product a rating of 0 stars.</li>
            <li>They r good for the designs that u aint sure of wat color to put in it.</li>
            <li>Good for us new people; if anyone knows of better options if they could reply and advise that would be awesome.</li>
            <li>Itd be nice if excessd ink came off a lil better...</li>
            <li>This product met my needs very well, good product at a good price</li>
            <li>they smell funny and the powder is a pin in the bum, but they are great practice mats.</li>
            <li>The lead won&#x27;t smear, and stays on the skin better than you&#x27;d imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>Lining on it is okay.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terrible.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find better skin at a better price.</li>
            <li>I wish it was a better quality.</li>
            <li>The Lining went okay</li>
            <li>Great Product,  as advertised:  Good quality and low price.</li>
            <li>i was also told that tatting an orange would be better for training...</li>
            <li>ok for what it was intended for</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, great price.</li>
            <li>so he can get better and better</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>There are so many discolorations and specks of something on them the size of a pencil eraser.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I would probably buy more, if I need them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Animal skin is much better but not as easy to get a hold of or sanitary</li>
            <li>Good practice for the real thing.  </li>
            <li>You MUST use A&amp;D or Vasoline to tattoo on and clean it because if you dont it will stain and you won&#x27;t be able to see your work.</li>
            <li>It is easy to go through it with a shader.</li>
            <li>Very quick delivery.</li>
            <li>This is cool and all but its still an ok buy just to have some type of practice i stop using it after awhile</li>
            <li>The tattoo skins I think are best used tapped down to something.</li>
            <li>plus they are cheap.</li>
            <li>These are great for the price and definitely an alternative to pig skins for beginners.</li>
            <li>Use fruit, it&#x27;s redilly available and whatever you don&#x27;t use for tattoing you can just eat.</li>
            <li>Bought these things cause they were cheap.</li>
            <li>And it is cheap as dirt cheapest I found and trust me</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far from good quality.</li>
            <li>very happy with the purchase and would recommend for those looking for high quality and low price.</li>
            <li>bought this item and was excited to see how they were.</li>
            <li>can clean off your lead transfer by using Vaseline and cloth.</li>
            <li>I am going to try baby oil to clean away the smearing.</li>
            <li>Pretty good qualities specially for the price I definitely plan on getting more</li>
            <li>Very smooth and felt like real skin.</li>
            <li>They are great machine blotters for testing a machines functions but not very representative of skin.</li>
            <li>Listen, if you&#x27;re either a beginner or a professional, these skins are amazing practice.</li>
            <li>Not an extremely accurate analog for skin, but useful for beginners</li>
            <li>Cool arrived on time fis description</li>
            <li>I would say they are good if you only want to get use to using a tattoo gun (the weight of tattoo guns, the vibration, etc.)</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are only good for practicing getting used to the process of tattooing and to work on the precision of your line.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>Good product that actually works.</li>
            <li>Id say its a good product to line with only.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only good for learning how the machine feels in your hand.</li>
            <li>All in all, not bad at all for what they are.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>As far as practice skins go theyre pretty good.</li>
            <li>works like it should, never used practice skin before but its not bad.</li>
            <li>These are adequate for use in practicing&lt;br /&gt;tattooing</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although they are cheap and was delivered very fast.</li>
            <li>Pretty good feeling overall.</li>
            <li>Will soon move to real skin, which I&#x27;m comfortable with.  </li>
            <li>but i guess its fun to play with when u have nobody to practice on</li>
            <li>I cannot recommend this product as a useful tattoo practice medium.</li>
            <li>Tender, delicious human flesh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t suggest using it as a skin graft material as it&#x27;s not really suited for that.</li>
            <li>they were useful though</li>
            <li>I use the blue Shop Towels by Scott, they have a rougher texture and clean better..</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d imagine post everyone understands that right away.</li>
            <li>u can not whip the ink off to see if you r tattoo right.</li>
            <li>They work, hard as hell to wipe, but i guess for starting its a great way to feel more comfortable with the machine.</li>
            <li>Useful for practice when we got our first tattoo machine and wanted to practice</li>
            <li>It can get messy because the ink kind of smears, but overall a good training tool.</li>
            <li>Quality and large in size!</li>
            <li>Everytime you wipe with your green soap, make sure you put more jelly on.</li>
            <li>While most of us are used to using tattoo pens, or felt tips the rubber skins take lead from mechanical pencils quite well, standard No. 2 graphite pencils work</li>
            <li>These really work!  </li>
            <li>Seems to do the trick though I suggest laying it on a softer surface like a neoprene mouse pad to more simulate the sponginess of human flesh.</li>
            <li>Is exactly what the title says.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making your product for beginners like me!</li>
            <li>First thing, the size of these are off.</li>
            <li>would recommend this product to&lt;br /&gt;others who are interested in a practice&lt;br /&gt;method for advancing one&#x27;s tatooing skills.</li>
            <li>after lining its troublesome, so i ended up lining the whole stencil and it took a good while to wipe it down.</li>
            <li>The ink smears easy on the rubber skins and that&#x27;s assuming it actually stays on the skin in the first place.</li>
            <li>First, let&#x27;s say that these are no where close to what tattooing on real skin is like</li>
            <li>the sheets ran out pretty fast...</li>
            <li>I ordered 2 packages of 5 large sheets.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent hours looking on every site out there for better deals.</li>
            <li>This is very helpful while you gauge the pressure needed and the needle depth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s might help a bit in practicing to tattoo but from what I could tell, it doesn&#x27;t seem at all like tattooing real skins.</li>
            <li>Although, I&#x27;ve never tattooed on real skin before.</li>
            <li>Spent more time cleaning than working.  </li>
            <li>Coat whole thing in petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li>any flaws are very visible.</li>
            <li>Besides that, you can&#x27;t really practice techniques that well on these.</li>
            <li>should graduate to real skin as soon as you develop those skills.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t really get the feel of tattooing using this.</li>
            <li>Practice skin is nothing like the real deal it doesn&#x27;t bleed and it vibrates way too much</li>
            <li>It does not hold ink and its much like tattooing on an eraser.</li>
            <li>Came fast to the house.</li>
            <li>However, it would be years before I would tattoo on real skin if I choose to do that, so this product allows me to do this.</li>
            <li>Nothing like real skin.</li>
            <li>but it is very messy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is more durable than some of the other skins out there.</li>
            <li>but they are really thin other than that it&#x27;s a good skin would def order more in the near future :)</li>
            <li>But would much rather practice cosmetic tattooing by hand on this than live persons.  </li>
            <li>Beyond that, it teaches more bad habits than good.</li>
            <li>and she said that these sheets were better quality than those that came with her  previous tattoo kit that I had ordered from another Vendor.</li>
            <li>This stuff is decent.</li>
            <li>Decent.</li>
            <li>Luckily my friend had given me an extra practice skin to use while waiting for my order to arrive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely tattoo practice skin, and it&#x27;s taken ink, so I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s worth more potential purchases from myself and others in the future!</li>
            <li>I clean my skin first and make sure it&#x27;s dry, and lay down my drawing obviously lead-down and take my finger and just gently rub the backside to press it against the skin.</li>
            <li>Still a great deal it just takes getting used to the fake skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take ink like normal skin does so</li>
            <li>Heck of a lot cheaper than some other brands around from the other tattoo supply places and works just as good.</li>
            <li>I had to back these with duct tape and use them over cardboard because the line needle just cuts right through.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found this skin fairly easy to tattoo on but very hard to clean.</li>
            <li>I am new to tattooing.  </li>
            <li>Cant wait to practice my tattooing skills, Buy these if you&#x27;re new to tattooing and still practicing technique.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m as new to tattooing as it comes</li>
            <li>The only reason why I didnt give a higher rating was the quantity of the sheets.</li>
            <li>Basically it&#x27;s only good for seeing a general idea of how thick a new liner you&#x27;ve never used before will be.</li>
            <li>Could of used my moms old dance pants</li>
            <li>but they fill totally diff then real skin</li>
            <li>No instructions as far as use.</li>
            <li>i recommend the old using fruit technique.</li>
            <li>Real skin is Completely different.</li>
            <li>I have worked in tattoo shops for nearly a decade and all this will teach you to do</li>
            <li>This was perfect for the base of my project which was to create differing wounds for students to classify.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t bother on these and would look locally for pig skin or search the internet for high quality practice skins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>just wanted to practice on some fake skin before the real deal, and i found that when tattooing on fake skin it kind of grabs the needle way more than normal skin.</li>
            <li>I am a professional tattoo artist who needed synthetic skin for a tattoo demonstration conducted outside of my shop.  </li>
            <li>and it stains it so you can barely see what you are doing</li>
            <li>so looks like a hot mess.</li>
            <li>Hard to get clean lines.</li>

            <li> can clean off your lead transfer by using Vaseline and cloth.</li>
            <li> I am going to try baby oil to clean away the smearing.</li>
            <li> Pretty good qualities specially for the price I definitely plan on getting more</li>
            <li> Very smooth and felt like real skin.</li>
            <li> They are great machine blotters for testing a machines functions but not very representative of skin.</li>
            <li> Listen, if you&#x27;re either a beginner or a professional, these skins are amazing practice.</li>
            <li> Not an extremely accurate analog for skin, but useful for beginners</li>
            <li> Cool arrived on time fis description</li>
            <li> I would say they are good if you only want to get use to using a tattoo gun (the weight of tattoo guns, the vibration, etc.)</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are only good for practicing getting used to the process of tattooing and to work on the precision of your line.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> Good product that actually works.</li>
            <li> Id say its a good product to line with only.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only good for learning how the machine feels in your hand.</li>
            <li> All in all, not bad at all for what they are.</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> As far as practice skins go theyre pretty good.</li>
            <li> works like it should, never used practice skin before but its not bad.</li>
            <li> These are adequate for use in practicing&lt;br /&gt;tattooing</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although they are cheap and was delivered very fast.</li>
            <li> Pretty good feeling overall.</li>
            <li> Will soon move to real skin, which I&#x27;m comfortable with.  </li>
            <li> but i guess its fun to play with when u have nobody to practice on</li>
            <li> I cannot recommend this product as a useful tattoo practice medium.</li>
            <li> Tender, delicious human flesh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t suggest using it as a skin graft material as it&#x27;s not really suited for that.</li>
            <li> they were useful though</li>
            <li> I use the blue Shop Towels by Scott, they have a rougher texture and clean better..</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d imagine post everyone understands that right away.</li>
            <li> u can not whip the ink off to see if you r tattoo right.</li>
            <li> They work, hard as hell to wipe, but i guess for starting its a great way to feel more comfortable with the machine.</li>
            <li> Useful for practice when we got our first tattoo machine and wanted to practice</li>
            <li> It can get messy because the ink kind of smears, but overall a good training tool.</li>
            <li> Quality and large in size!</li>
            <li> Everytime you wipe with your green soap, make sure you put more jelly on.</li>
            <li> While most of us are used to using tattoo pens, or felt tips the rubber skins take lead from mechanical pencils quite well, standard No. 2 graphite pencils work</li>
            <li> These really work!  </li>
            <li> Seems to do the trick though I suggest laying it on a softer surface like a neoprene mouse pad to more simulate the sponginess of human flesh.</li>
            <li> Is exactly what the title says.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making your product for beginners like me!</li>
            <li> First thing, the size of these are off.</li>
            <li> would recommend this product to&lt;br /&gt;others who are interested in a practice&lt;br /&gt;method for advancing one&#x27;s tatooing skills.</li>
            <li> after lining its troublesome, so i ended up lining the whole stencil and it took a good while to wipe it down.</li>
            <li> The ink smears easy on the rubber skins and that&#x27;s assuming it actually stays on the skin in the first place.</li>
            <li> First, let&#x27;s say that these are no where close to what tattooing on real skin is like</li>
            <li> the sheets ran out pretty fast...</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 packages of 5 large sheets.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent hours looking on every site out there for better deals.</li>
            <li> This is very helpful while you gauge the pressure needed and the needle depth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s might help a bit in practicing to tattoo but from what I could tell, it doesn&#x27;t seem at all like tattooing real skins.</li>
            <li> Although, I&#x27;ve never tattooed on real skin before.</li>
            <li> Spent more time cleaning than working.  </li>
            <li> Coat whole thing in petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> any flaws are very visible.</li>
            <li> Besides that, you can&#x27;t really practice techniques that well on these.</li>
            <li> should graduate to real skin as soon as you develop those skills.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t really get the feel of tattooing using this.</li>
            <li> Practice skin is nothing like the real deal it doesn&#x27;t bleed and it vibrates way too much</li>
            <li> It does not hold ink and its much like tattooing on an eraser.</li>
            <li> Came fast to the house.</li>
            <li> However, it would be years before I would tattoo on real skin if I choose to do that, so this product allows me to do this.</li>
            <li> Nothing like real skin.</li>
            <li> but it is very messy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is more durable than some of the other skins out there.</li>
            <li> but they are really thin other than that it&#x27;s a good skin would def order more in the near future :)</li>
            <li> But would much rather practice cosmetic tattooing by hand on this than live persons.  </li>
            <li> Beyond that, it teaches more bad habits than good.</li>
            <li> and she said that these sheets were better quality than those that came with her  previous tattoo kit that I had ordered from another Vendor.</li>
            <li> This stuff is decent.</li>
            <li> Decent.</li>
            <li> Luckily my friend had given me an extra practice skin to use while waiting for my order to arrive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely tattoo practice skin, and it&#x27;s taken ink, so I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s worth more potential purchases from myself and others in the future!</li>
            <li> I clean my skin first and make sure it&#x27;s dry, and lay down my drawing obviously lead-down and take my finger and just gently rub the backside to press it against the skin.</li>
            <li> Still a great deal it just takes getting used to the fake skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take ink like normal skin does so</li>
            <li> Heck of a lot cheaper than some other brands around from the other tattoo supply places and works just as good.</li>
            <li> I had to back these with duct tape and use them over cardboard because the line needle just cuts right through.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found this skin fairly easy to tattoo on but very hard to clean.</li>
            <li> I am new to tattooing.  </li>
            <li> Cant wait to practice my tattooing skills, Buy these if you&#x27;re new to tattooing and still practicing technique.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m as new to tattooing as it comes</li>
            <li> The only reason why I didnt give a higher rating was the quantity of the sheets.</li>
            <li> Basically it&#x27;s only good for seeing a general idea of how thick a new liner you&#x27;ve never used before will be.</li>
            <li> Could of used my moms old dance pants</li>
            <li> but they fill totally diff then real skin</li>
            <li> No instructions as far as use.</li>
            <li> i recommend the old using fruit technique.</li>
            <li> Real skin is Completely different.</li>
            <li> I have worked in tattoo shops for nearly a decade and all this will teach you to do</li>
            <li> This was perfect for the base of my project which was to create differing wounds for students to classify.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t bother on these and would look locally for pig skin or search the internet for high quality practice skins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> just wanted to practice on some fake skin before the real deal, and i found that when tattooing on fake skin it kind of grabs the needle way more than normal skin.</li>
            <li> I am a professional tattoo artist who needed synthetic skin for a tattoo demonstration conducted outside of my shop.  </li>
            <li> and it stains it so you can barely see what you are doing</li>
            <li> so looks like a hot mess.</li>
            <li> Hard to get clean lines.</li>
            <li> They do not take in ink as easily as skin do and is very hard to practice shading on as you cannot wipe off the extra ink on the surface without creating a mess that makes everything under it super hard to see.</li>
            <li> great quality product just wish they were a little less expensive</li>
            <li> I completely wiped it down.</li>
            <li> Fixed it from sliding by taping it down.</li>
            <li> The colors are not nearly as vivid after application like they would be if you are working on actual skin.</li>
            <li> This one in particular was the least simular to tattooing on human skin.  </li>
            <li> Does not take ink well at all, you actually learn bad habits from this stuff like overworking and not going deep enough because these things are super thin and going to the REAL depth causes needle damage and the whole problem gets exacerbated.</li>
            <li> It will help you out in the long run, trust me.</li>
            <li> So thin the needles go right through.</li>
            <li> too thin and not enough like real skin</li>
            <li> the title says it all, not worth the money, doesnt hold ink and just overall</li>
            <li> it breaks the excess/surface ink loose, then wipe.</li>
            <li> On the flip side with it being thin, it&#x27;s teaches new people not to dig into too deep.</li>
            <li> Plus, you&#x27;d probably get a nasty infection and have to get more skin grafts which really can hurt, or so I am told, though I&#x27;ve never had one.</li>
            <li> Got what was expected</li>
            <li> Came promptly and as expected.  </li>
            <li> Creepy feeling but fun as all get out.  </li>
            <li> Not even remotely what&#x27;s advertised.</li>
            <li> Not much to really say about this one.</li>
            <li> It holds ink decently, but it is tough to build up values.</li>
            <li> He had been wanting to get some practice skins to keep his skills sharp and improve on his technique.</li>
            <li> Arrived before expected - BONUS!</li>
            <li> Listen to the other reviews and pass on these.</li>
            <li> If you are trying to learn I would recommend these to you hands down.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend doing a half dip.</li>
            <li> Seriously avoid these things if you want actual practice of lining, color and shading.</li>
            <li> Still stained black.</li>
            <li> I found these to be a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money.</li>
            <li> Not even with the green soap.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on these things</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> So, the skin is very odd.</li>
            <li> But be careful, it is a little thin.</li>
            <li> Dry it off then put on a thin coat of jelly and work in circles with your fingers</li>
            <li> It is so tough it teaches you to press a lot harder than you need to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how you would practice tattooing on it.</li>
            <li> so when I go to wipe some excessive ink off part of the stencil goes with it</li>
            <li> Not sure what this is about</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thin piece of latex rubber, with typical latex powder.</li>
            <li> Did I need to put something underneath it if I&#x27;m tattooing on a hard surface?</li>
            <li> It is also hard to shade on these.</li>
            <li> Its hard to tattoo on.</li>
            <li> but it is misleading to say the least.</li>
            <li> Just plain tough to tattoo on though.</li>
            <li> but the min you wipe the ink away it leaves black in all over the fake skin</li>
            <li> this item sucks its very hard.</li>
            <li> This is not a good way to learn.</li>
            <li> The surface was basically just too tough.  </li>
            <li> Ink doesn&#x27;t take well, stencils are hard to transfer, and if you look at it wrong, it tears.</li>
            <li> They are really thin rubber.</li>
            <li> Not great.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re about a millimeter thick which is just about useless in any practice sense</li>
            <li> use pig skin or fruit dont waste your time with this crap</li>
            <li> These things are useless</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fake skin for practicing tattoo work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used practice skin, so this stuff is weird.  </li>
            <li> This fake skin is a very poor quality.</li>
            <li> This is a very thin version of what I tried years ago.</li>
            <li> Seem very thin.</li>
            <li> Would be very frustrating to even try to learn or practice with these.</li>
            <li> I am unhappy with the tatto sheets.</li>
            <li> leaves the image a lil dirty lookin.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to tattoo on.</li>
            <li> Ink does not set into this and shading is impossible.</li>
            <li> No wash or solution with drying time needed like with Ink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this by accident and want to share this with everyone since I&#x27;ve been doing the painful Ink method for a while</li>
            <li> Really disappointed with the quality.</li>
            <li> When I received this product I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s awful to wipe the excess&lt;br /&gt;Ink off.</li>
            <li> These skins are horrible</li>
            <li> This product was terrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great Products!  Just what the artist wanted.</li>
            <li> use pig skin or fruit dont waste your time with this crap</li>
            <li> This product met my needs very well, good product at a good price</li>
            <li> I found these to be a waste of money.  They are great machine blotters for testing a machines functions but not very representative of skin.</li>
            <li> First, let&#x27;s say that these are no where close to what tattooing on real skin is like but I&#x27;d imagine post everyone understands that right away. If you are just starting out these are a must, you can still get an idea of what it&#x27;s like and it&#x27;s good method/stability practice with your gun. Also I wanna add a note about stencil transfers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found a different/possibly better way to transfer stencils on these fake \\&quot;skins\\&quot; if you can call them that. While most of us are used to using tattoo pens, or felt tips the rubber skins take lead from mechanical pencils quite well, standard No. 2 graphite pencils work but for some reason not as well. I use 0.7mm basic lead refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paper; Notebook and printer paper will work find if you take your eraser on the back side of the paper and rub your eraser over the back side of your drawing. However I use Calco/Calque Tracing paper that is semi-transparent, you can pick this stuff up just about anywhere. Walmart is where I get mine. The tracing paper will allow you to transfer the lead drawing with ease. I clean my skin first and make sure it&#x27;s dry, and lay down my drawing obviously lead-down and take my finger and just gently rub the backside to press it against the skin. No wash or solution with drying time needed like with Ink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this by accident and want to share this with everyone since I&#x27;ve been doing the painful Ink method for a while and it&#x27;s a pain in the neck. The ink smears easy on the rubber skins and that&#x27;s assuming it actually stays on the skin in the first place. The lead won&#x27;t smear, and stays on the skin better than you&#x27;d imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can clean off your lead transfer by using Vaseline and cloth. I use the blue Shop Towels by Scott, they have a rougher texture and clean better.. plus they are cheap. if you need help or have questions you can contact me via email. liquid.knights(at)gmail-dot-com.</li>
            <li> Pretty good feeling overall.</li>
            <li> Quality practice skins. Great for beginners. You can use front and back. Takes the ink well and don&#x27;t show up on the reverse side at all. Will purchase again in the future. Shipping was good also.</li>
            <li> It gets scratchy when shading. Lining on it is okay. But it&#x27;s awful to wipe the excess&lt;br /&gt;Ink off. I&#x27;d recommend doing a half dip. It&#x27;s not terrible. You just have to go scrub it in the sink every couple minutes.</li>
            <li> Got what was expected</li>
            <li> Latex garbage.. Could of used my moms old dance pants</li>
            <li> My son loved these to practice on. Very smooth and felt like real skin. We then framed the skins when he was done</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT, HELPING ME LEARN TATTOOING. I HAVE BEEN USING THESE BUT HAD THE SMALLER ONES PRIOR AND NOW NEED TO PRACTICE ON THE LARGER ONE</li>
            <li> I am unhappy with the tatto sheets. Why is that? Well I&#x27;m still waiting for them to arrive, so to me they are cause of disapointement and will make my trust in internet buissness go lower than it allready was...</li>
            <li> This is cool and all but its still an ok buy just to have some type of practice i stop using it after awhile</li>
            <li> Practice skin is NOTHING like human skin. Don&#x27;t waste your time and money. If you are a beginner, just practice on yourself. It will help you out in the long run, trust me. Rubber does NOT COMPARE TO HUMAN flesh!</li>
            <li> We found that the best way to clean the skin is to use baby wipes.  It works great!!!!  Even on your own tatoo&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> These things are useless</li>
            <li> Came promptly and as expected.  The sheets are generous in size.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thin piece of latex rubber, with typical latex powder. I&#x27;m not sure how you would practice tattooing on it. I used it as an alternative to pig skin for a laboratory experiment... the experiment didn&#x27;t go so well.</li>
            <li> I found this skin fairly easy to tattoo on but very hard to clean. The colors are not nearly as vivid after application like they would be if you are working on actual skin. I coated the skin with A &amp; D before beginning and while practicing and I still had problems with cleaning the excess ink away. I am going to try baby oil to clean away the smearing.</li>
            <li> Listen, if you&#x27;re either a beginner or a professional, these skins are amazing practice. I won&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find better skin at a better price. I always prefer pig skin, but these are simple. I&#x27;ve spent hours looking on every site out there for better deals. It&#x27;s always Amazon. Great product.</li>
            <li> I am new to tattooing.  The practice skin my Tattoo equipment came with was nothing close to the quality of these.   If you are trying to learn I would recommend these to you hands down.  They still smear of course but with some practice you can control that.  Excellent quality and fast shipping, can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> i guess there good they came in what they were supposed to and they look good but they fill totally diff then real skin but i guess its fun to play with when u have nobody to practice on</li>
            <li> No instructions as far as use. Did I need to put something underneath it if I&#x27;m tattooing on a hard surface? No inserts at all to cover any possible questions</li>
            <li> great quality product just wish they were a little less expensive</li>
            <li> I cant wipe off the ink so looks like a hot mess. I wish it was a better quality. But good practice</li>
            <li> Cool arrived on time fis description</li>
            <li> bought this item and was excited to see how they were. Really disappointed with the quality. They are really thin rubber. Smear and doesn&#x27;t hold ink well at all. So thin the needles go right through. I wouldn&#x27;t bother on these and would look locally for pig skin or search the internet for high quality practice skins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although they are cheap and was delivered very fast.</li>
            <li> This is very helpful while you gauge the pressure needed and the needle depth. It can get messy because the ink kind of smears, but overall a good training tool.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t feel like skin at all. It&#x27;s might help a bit in practicing to tattoo but from what I could tell, it doesn&#x27;t seem at all like tattooing real skins. Although, I&#x27;ve never tattooed on real skin before.</li>
            <li> this item sucks its very hard. The needle just bounced around on it and the ink did not  transfer to it . DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> Its great for a bigginer but they are really thin other than that it&#x27;s a good skin would def order more in the near future :)</li>
            <li> Creepy feeling but fun as all get out.  These really work!  Good practice for the real thing.  If you&#x27;re wanting to try and make lampshades, though, this isn&#x27;t what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> I am a professional tattoo artist who needed synthetic skin for a tattoo demonstration conducted outside of my shop.  I ordered several types of practice skin from several vendors.  This one in particular was the least simular to tattooing on human skin.  The surface was basically just too tough.  The Lining went okay but when I went to do shading &amp; color no amount of pressure or machine adjustment resulted in ink penetrating the surface of this material.  I cannot recommend this product as a useful tattoo practice medium.</li>
            <li> Spent more time cleaning than working.  This worked best for me...    Coat whole thing in petroleum jelly. Everytime you wipe with your green soap, make sure you put more jelly on. Everytime i changed colors I completely wiped it down. Dry it off then put on a thin coat of jelly and work in circles with your fingers it breaks the excess/surface ink loose, then wipe. Re-coat and start next color.    Takes a fair amount of effort to get the ink in. All in all, not bad at all for what they are. Good practice medium.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like tattooing plastic, it won&#x27;t take the ink and it breaks the needle tip, would not recommend to anyone, stay away from this.</li>
            <li> They are what they are.</li>
            <li> If you use good ink, the drips wont come off of this sheet of rubber. Essentially its just a g</li>
            <li> This was perfect for the base of my project which was to create differing wounds for students to classify. Cost effective solution that worked beautifully. Great quality product.</li>
            <li> I am using it to practice tattooing and it does not work as well as i thought it would. It doesn&#x27;t take ink like normal skin does so any flaws are very visible. It is also hard to shade on these. If you are going to learn to tattoo i recommend the old using fruit technique. Still a great deal it just takes getting used to the fake skin.</li>
            <li> Great Product,  as advertised:  Good quality and low price. very happy with the purchase and would recommend for those looking for high quality and low price.</li>
            <li> The skins work great will be ordering more when I need and will get some pre-printed also and the price was great.</li>
            <li> This is more durable than some of the other skins out there. Get you some and see for your self.</li>
            <li> This stuff is decent. Not great. Not bad. Decent. Its hard to tattoo on. You MUST use A&amp;D or Vasoline to tattoo on and clean it because if you dont it will stain and you won&#x27;t be able to see your work. Just plain tough to tattoo on though. Hard to get clean lines. Would rather tattoo on a banana or honeydew melon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fake skin for practicing tattoo work. Seems to do the trick though I suggest laying it on a softer surface like a neoprene mouse pad to more simulate the sponginess of human flesh. Tender, delicious human flesh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t suggest using it as a skin graft material as it&#x27;s not really suited for that. Plus, you&#x27;d probably get a nasty infection and have to get more skin grafts which really can hurt, or so I am told, though I&#x27;ve never had one. I do have a suit made out of skin but I don&#x27;t tattoo it. Whoever had it before me did, though.</li>
            <li> These are great for the price and definitely an alternative to pig skins for beginners. However, these are not in anyway like skin at all. They do not take in ink as easily as skin do and is very hard to practice shading on as you cannot wipe off the extra ink on the surface without creating a mess that makes everything under it super hard to see. I would say they are good if you only want to get use to using a tattoo gun (the weight of tattoo guns, the vibration, etc.) Besides that, you can&#x27;t really practice techniques that well on these.</li>
            <li> I had to back these with duct tape and use them over cardboard because the line needle just cuts right through.&lt;br /&gt;These are only good for practicing getting used to the process of tattooing and to work on the precision of your line.&lt;br /&gt;You should graduate to real skin as soon as you develop those skills. Real skin is Completely different.</li>
            <li> Nothing like skin. Very difficult to tattoo on.</li>
            <li> A must need for practice!</li>
            <li> These skins are horrible can&#x27;t really get the feel of tattooing using this. If you can get some pig skin do it</li>
            <li> Not even remotely what&#x27;s advertised.</li>
            <li> like the product good for front and back!came one time       needleboy will be hearing from me again</li>
            <li> Is exactly what the title says. My son is getting his practice on. Works well for practice!</li>
            <li> It was not all that great it dose it&#x27;s job but the min you wipe the ink away it leaves black in all over the fake skin and it stains it so you can barely see what you are doing I wish you could rub the ink away with out it staining</li>
            <li> Practice skin is nothing like the real deal it doesn&#x27;t bleed and it vibrates way too much</li>
            <li> Bought these to train students. Good durability and pigment transfer.</li>
            <li> Basically it&#x27;s only good for seeing a general idea of how thick a new liner you&#x27;ve never used before will be. Does not take ink well at all, you actually learn bad habits from this stuff like overworking and not going deep enough because these things are super thin and going to the REAL depth causes needle damage and the whole problem gets exacerbated. Use fruit, it&#x27;s redilly available and whatever you don&#x27;t use for tattoing you can just eat. Seriously avoid these things if you want actual practice of lining, color and shading.</li>
            <li> This is a very thin version of what I tried years ago. Would not purchase again. It is easy to go through it with a shader. It holds ink decently, but it is tough to build up values.</li>
            <li> When I received this product I was very disappointed. It&#x27;s far from good quality. The needle from the machine punctures the skin to where you can only use one side and even then you can pull your tattoo from the skin. I would honestly give this product a rating of 0 stars. Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> the sheets ran out pretty fast...i was also told that tatting an orange would be better for training...they were useful though</li>
            <li> My daughter is learning how to tattoo.. and she said that these sheets were better quality than those that came with her  previous tattoo kit that I had ordered from another Vendor. I would re order from this vendor again. Great Quality. Great Value.</li>
            <li> If you are wanting to learn tattooing do not purchase this skin. I have worked in tattoo shops for nearly a decade and all this will teach you to do is butcher peoples skin. It is so tough it teaches you to press a lot harder than you need to. Go buy a honeydew melon or some pig skin</li>
            <li> Purchased these for my oldest son who is a very talented tattoo artist. He had been wanting to get some practice skins to keep his skills sharp and improve on his technique. He was very happy with these skins and they met all his expectations.</li>
            <li> too thin and not enough like real skin</li>
            <li> Quality and large in size! Cant wait to practice my tattooing skills, Buy these if you&#x27;re new to tattooing and still practicing technique. DO NOT tattoo people if you&#x27;re not a licensed tattooer. That&#x27;s called scratching and if you respect and know anything about the industry you&#x27;d respect that &amp;#34;rule&amp;#34;. Happy Tattooing guys!</li>
            <li> ok for what it was intended for</li>
            <li> Good skins and good value. Look, this stuff is for beginners to practice line work. It does what its supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Product just as described.Very quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Good product that actually works. Ink holds well and stencils with ease. Fixed it from sliding by taping it down. The biggest problem is wiping excess ink off. after lining its troublesome, so i ended up lining the whole stencil and it took a good while to wipe it down. Still stained black. Id say its a good product to line with only.</li>
            <li> As far as practice skins go theyre pretty good. They hold the ink well. You can see where skin would be gettin damaged. Itd be nice if excessd ink came off a lil better... leaves the image a lil dirty lookin.</li>
            <li> This product was terrible. I only used about an 8th of one sheet. It&#x27;s only good for learning how the machine feels in your hand. Beyond that, it teaches more bad habits than good. Do not buy this!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great price. But be careful, it is a little thin. So put something under it before practicing. On the flip side with it being thin, it&#x27;s teaches new people not to dig into too deep.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely tattoo practice skin, and it&#x27;s taken ink, so I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s worth more potential purchases from myself and others in the future!</li>
            <li> This fake skin is a very poor quality. It does not hold ink and its much like tattooing on an eraser. Save yourself some time and money and pick up some pig skin.</li>
            <li> So, the skin is very odd. While it HOLDS ink well, the ink doesn&#x27;t WIPE OFF well. Not even with the green soap. So be prepared for anything you practice with to be forever smeared.</li>
            <li> my friend likes to practice on skin  so he can get better and better but like my dad say practice perfect</li>
            <li> Arrived as described, a great linework practice tool.</li>
            <li> Good for us new people; if anyone knows of better options if they could reply and advise that would be awesome.</li>
            <li> Good for practice. Came fast to the house. Not much to really say about this one. If you are starting out I recommend starting on this.</li>
            <li> The practice ink doesn&#x27;t hold stencil ink so when I go to wipe some excessive ink off part of the stencil goes with it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used practice skin, so this stuff is weird.  But would much rather practice cosmetic tattooing by hand on this than live persons.  Will soon move to real skin, which I&#x27;m comfortable with.  Arrived before expected - BONUS!</li>
            <li> They work, hard as hell to wipe, but i guess for starting its a great way to feel more comfortable with the machine. Animal skin is much better but not as easy to get a hold of or sanitary</li>
            <li> These practice skins do not hold ink well at all. Seem very thin. Would not recommend at all. Would be very frustrating to even try to learn or practice with these. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m as new to tattooing as it comes and this is a hobby for me becasue I love it. However, it would be years before I would tattoo on real skin if I choose to do that, so this product allows me to do this. Thanks for making your product for beginners like me!</li>
            <li> Works good. Heck of a lot cheaper than some other brands around from the other tattoo supply places and works just as good.</li>
            <li> First thing, the size of these are off. Way off. They are listed as 8 x 12 inches yet I received ones that are 6 x 8 inches. Not sure what this is about but it is misleading to say the least. Luckily my friend had given me an extra practice skin to use while waiting for my order to arrive. Ink doesn&#x27;t take well, stencils are hard to transfer, and if you look at it wrong, it tears.</li>
            <li> I used them about twice already and I can actually say they are the 💣 my ninja, in fact got my lines up to par !!</li>
            <li> Bought these things cause they were cheap. They&#x27;re about a millimeter thick which is just about useless in any practice sense and they dont take ink at all. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on these things</li>
            <li> Works for the intended purpose. Not mind blowing, but does what i need it to! Useful for practice when we got our first tattoo machine and wanted to practice</li>
            <li> they smell funny and the powder is a pin in the bum, but they are great practice mats. pigment wipes up wel, and they offer a bit of resistance, just like skin.</li>
            <li> works like it should, never used practice skin before but its not bad.</li>
            <li> Nothing like real skin. This is not a good way to learn. you can put a pen in your machine and practice lines on paper and get the same effect. This is not what skin will feel like when tattooing</li>
            <li> The only reason why I didnt give a higher rating was the quantity of the sheets. If there were more to a package It would have been perfect.</li>
            <li> the title says it all, not worth the money, doesnt hold ink and just overall is junk . purchase grapefruit instead.</li>
            <li> This paper does it&#x27;s job. It is a good tool for practicing and learning how to tattoo.</li>
            <li> Pretty good qualities specially for the price I definitely plan on getting more</li>
            <li> Not an extremely accurate analog for skin, but useful for beginners</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t even use them. There are so many discolorations and specks of something on them the size of a pencil eraser. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> the  skin feels life like ,but when it comes to putting ink ,it will not take color (at aLL).&lt;br /&gt;black take but it is very messy.&lt;br /&gt;still practicing and trying to make with what i have</li>
            <li> Was as advertised,fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Ink does not set into this and shading is impossible. Listen to the other reviews and pass on these.</li>
            <li> I loved the tattoo skins they got here from across the country in 3 days must have for any tattoer!  The tattoo skins I think are best used tapped down to something. Overall.......BUY it. And it is cheap as dirt cheapest I found and trust me I checked almost everywhere.....</li>
            <li> got all the sheets in perfect condition. just wanted to practice on some fake skin before the real deal, and i found that when tattooing on fake skin it kind of grabs the needle way more than normal skin. Just a heads up.</li>
            <li> I dont like the skin cause u can not whip the ink off to see if you r tattoo right. They r good for the designs that u aint sure of wat color to put in it.</li>
            <li> These are adequate for use in practicing&lt;br /&gt;tattooing with a liner needle...&lt;br /&gt;I would probably buy more, if I need them.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to&lt;br /&gt;others who are interested in a practice&lt;br /&gt;method for advancing one&#x27;s tatooing skills.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the needle will glide, sometimes it will get stuck because it just feels like rubber.  Otherwise good.  Only have used twice though.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 packages of 5 large sheets.  One package came with only 4 sheets.  Can I get the final sheet that I paid for?</li>
