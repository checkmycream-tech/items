            <li>[[VIDEOID:mo2WXSHCCFUZZPB]]I absolutely love the lipstick holder.</li>
            <li>But it seems like it will hold most lipstick cases.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe it was so cheap!</li>
            <li>Most of which come in sets of 6</li>
            <li>so I was able to put three sets in each.</li>
            <li>I really love this I used it to hold some of my nail polish</li>
            <li>But love the product.</li>

            <li>I am going to be buying more as I have too many lip products.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Fits all my MAC lipsticks and most of my sephora...</li>
            <li>and I forgot that most of them existed so I never used them.</li>
            <li>I ordered  more for Christmas  gifts.</li>
            <li>My lipsticks look so cute now :)</li>
            <li>The description needs more detail.</li>

            <li>lipstick fit really nice in this (:</li>
            <li>so i ordered 3 more:)</li>
            <li>I already purchased like 6 love them</li>

            <li>Fast shipping great condition</li>
            <li>Looks just like the picture or perphas even better.</li>
            <li>It had many scratches</li>
            <li>they are a great price versus the overpriced versions, and I thought mine would come chipped like other reviewers experienced</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and very nice packaged.</li>
            <li>Great little organizers for a great price.</li>
            <li>Questions asked do not apply to product, asks easy to apply, how many times applied - this is just the holder.</li>
            <li>The slots are slightly smaller then imagened but fit my lippies perfectly!</li>
            <li>Great little make up organizer, perfect for lipsticks and certain types of nail polish.</li>
            <li>For $3 I managed to fit in all my MAC lipsticks:)</li>
            <li>Most eGo style batteries fit too.</li>
            <li>two and all the slots are filled mostly with flavorings to make e-liquid.</li>
            <li>awesome i only had three lipstick containers that didnot fit and all my glosses fit as well.</li>
            <li>Good packaging and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much</li>
            <li>Other than that it is wonderful and fits all lipsticks except the oval shaped ones.</li>
            <li>Other than that, great product, great price, just, better packaging would be appreciated.</li>
            <li>so you can see everything easy.</li>
            <li>This is just what I was looking for and arrived in perfect condition minus a couple of scratches that when filled up you can&#x27;t even see.</li>
            <li>but this make it so easy and neat to see what is what.</li>
            <li>row - makes it easy to see.</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t flimsy plastic that bends or chips easily.</li>
            <li>Easy.</li>
            <li>They hold strong.</li>
            <li>,two QTIPS long.&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s pretty nice for the price üëè</li>
            <li>The polishes fit perfectly in the display case and they weren&#x27;t tight it was easy in easy out.</li>
            <li>Is compact ans easy to fit in a drawer too.</li>
            <li>Looks fine</li>
            <li>but it works just fine..</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li>Since the crack is on the bottom of the product it still works fine.</li>
            <li>shipped fast and arrived clean and in nice, safe packaging.</li>
            <li>Item was shipped quickly; I was pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I at first purchased one of these and loved it so much that I bought two more.</li>
            <li>It works great for&lt;br /&gt;lip stick (mostly) but not one single nail polish fit in the squares, and that is what I bought it for.  </li>
            <li>I discovered that mascara and concealer can fit in the stand also, not just lipstick and gloss.</li>
            <li>I just hope it will all fit to this case</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something cheap to hold lipsticks or glosses, then this is what you need.</li>
            <li>it holds 24 lipsticks, the larger based sticks are a tighter fit, but they all fit great</li>
            <li>I can get them to fit in the compartments</li>
            <li>Overall, I am so happy with this lipstick organizer</li>
            <li>I bought this specifically for my julep nail polish because I saw another customer submitted their photo where their polish fit</li>
            <li>It took about a month to ship, but with free shipping I didn&#x27;t expect it overnight.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great quality, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>None of my nail polishes fit.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, it has zipped fill slits.  </li>
            <li>but its free and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not so great and it very fragile.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>Nail polish doesn&#x27;t fit into the squares though</li>
            <li>an assortment of products fit in here and</li>
            <li>You can fit mac ,nars and Maybelline lipsticks.</li>
            <li>I could barely fit anything in the holes.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t complain when its really cheap.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li>The material is really cheap</li>
            <li>but it was not recommended as it would costs more than it is worth.</li>
            <li>A lot of my lip glosses fit well, too.</li>
            <li>It shows nail posh would fit.</li>
            <li>I could put my Vamo v5 in a slot, but it&#x27;s a snug fit.</li>
            <li>And my cosm√©tics don&#x27;t fit plus was damaged for the mail</li>
            <li>I saw &amp;#34;Nail Polish&amp;#34; and thought it will fit nail polish.</li>
            <li>I also use them to organize mascara and anything else that will fit into the holes.</li>
            <li>It makes is so much easier to find my items when they are nicely organized and visible.</li>
            <li>and they fit all my lipsticks.</li>
            <li>Since I didn&#x27;t pay much for it, it&#x27;s okay, but not the most well made product.</li>
            <li>I threw out old stuff because, honestly, who needs more than 28 lip colors?</li>
            <li>I think the changing levels is very useful.</li>
            <li>It holds most of my lipsticks with no problem, all except one that is in a very large lipstick case.  </li>
            <li>Great lipstick holder some lipsticks fit a little to snug but most fit just fine</li>
            <li>This is pretty cheaply made but does fit most lipsticks.  </li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with the storage ability of this product but was hoping for something more like it was originally advertised as.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased with the first one I purchased</li>
            <li>So useful!</li>
            <li>, it is kind of big, takes a lot of room in your vanity but it fit most of my lipstick (mac, Revlon,)</li>
            <li>Took about 2 weeks or so but its worth the wait!</li>
            <li>Liked it and possibly going to order more</li>
            <li>fit my lipstick perfectly, quick shipping also.</li>
            <li>Super cheap material.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve filled it up so will need to buy another soon from the seller such a good price and came safetly wrapped.</li>
            <li>And the price is right!</li>
            <li>Item received just as described and shipping dates were right on the money!</li>
            <li>i only ordered one at first to scope it out lol</li>
            <li>Packing was great and shipping quicker than expected.</li>
            <li>Good for standard sized lipsticks.</li>
            <li>But it still keeps my lipstick ready to find, which I always struggle with because I use so many colors.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and the product is outstanding</li>
            <li>It came cracked, but I still love it haha</li>
            <li>My came with a littke crack on the top, which really bothered me</li>
            <li>Overall good product I would recommend it.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>But for the price not bad.......</li>
            <li>Ok for lipstick and good for eye pencils - squares are tight but helps with organizing  like the elevation of rows-  not for nail polish</li>
            <li>BUT it does fits essential oil bottles perfectly (the basic slim roll on bottles).</li>
            <li>the product is tremendous quality for the price imma</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly but I&#x27;m amazed it made it in one piece.</li>
            <li>Wanted a nice cheap present for my wife for Christmas.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really complain though, as the product was fairly cheap and shipping was free.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m really please and will be ordering 2 more since I own 64 lipsticks.</li>
            <li>My mac lipsticks fit perfectly my kat von d ones fit a little tight but on the back ones it fit good.</li>
            <li>real well asi was looking for something to get my lipsticks and brushes out of drawers and into a easily reachable within eye view place, so</li>
            <li>There exactly as the picture shows!</li>
            <li>so I bought several more!...</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted for my lipstick collection!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>I found most 10ml or less fits nicely.</li>
            <li>Just be gentle and it&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>some of them are too large but they somewhat fit.</li>
            <li>The lipstick organizer would have been more useful if it was bigger, it didn&#x27;t fit all my lipsticks and it took a while to come.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have much lip products, but since getting this I have filled it up üòÑ</li>
            <li>nice stands with several, however, chipped</li>
            <li>Nice product, took forever to actually receive almost a month</li>
            <li>It was in perfect condition when i got it in the mail, i expected the sections to be a tad bigger.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping; was not broken :)</li>
            <li>Worth the wait.</li>
            <li>although, recieved cracked from the front and broken from the side works perfectly for me!</li>
            <li>So useful.</li>
            <li>I already own two and just bought a third.</li>
            <li>It actually was really nice ...</li>
            <li>it holds many lipsticks and that it&#x27;s clear.</li>
            <li>really nice and cheap compared to a lot of other acrylic holders</li>
            <li>This is extremely small but exactly PERFECT for my 5 year old and her chapsticks!</li>
            <li>There was a crack in the side of mine but other than that it was good</li>
            <li>other than that I loved it, the quality, the price &amp; everything about it</li>
            <li>This is a good holder for the price but be aware it only holds very slender nail polish bottles or lipstick.</li>
            <li>Shipping took quite awhile but the price is right.</li>
            <li>(right after i opened it) and one of the divider pieces cracked.</li>
            <li>the price point was right although i had a to wait for it  to be shipped from china.</li>
            <li>just right</li>
            <li>I loved it!super small and easily to fit it in my vanity table, took almost 3 weeks to get it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier to have them organized in one of these than to have to dig through drawers to find the right one!</li>
            <li>and it is loose and doesn&#x27;t fit that great as it is too skinny and long</li>
            <li>they said it would cost more than its worth to ship it back</li>
            <li>Product arrived faster than the expected shipping date and will fit most lipsticks</li>
            <li>Although this is perfect for all lipsticks and lipstain, it will likely not fit any nail polish bottles, so I would not buy it for that purpose.</li>
            <li>(variety of different brands) fast shipping &amp; packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>It actually looks pretty sitting out in the bathroom and makes it easy to grab your color and run out the door!</li>
            <li>took a little time but good buy</li>
            <li>So, it makes organizing makeup so much easier!</li>
            <li>First off shipping took over a month &amp; the packaging came in a envelope instead of a box.</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It came exactly on time</li>
            <li>It fits pretty much everything!</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it was made for.</li>
            <li>What can i say this product is not expensive</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m going to be purchasing another very soon!</li>
            <li>Small and simple, perfect for organizing lipsticks and lip glosses.</li>
            <li>arrived in about 3 weeks and it is great for storing various products and currently mine has mac lipsticks, they&#x27;re real mascara, baby skin, and elf lip scrub.</li>
            <li>Exactly how it looks .</li>
            <li>It is small, but still holds a number of lipsticks and glosses and looks really nice!  </li>
            <li>This lipstick organizer is exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Will come back to buy more.</li>
            <li>Due to my large collection of lippys will be purchasing more!</li>
            <li>I thinks it&#x27;s a good thing because it&#x27;s better for storage, this is definitely not a nail polish case as it is small.</li>
            <li>Smaller than expected but great for holding lipstick</li>
            <li>Was able to fit few mascaras and aye pencils.</li>
            <li>I really love how this organizer can hold so many lipsticks but is still very small and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space.  </li>
            <li>love the price, takes away from the long wait.</li>
            <li>Very compact in size so it won&#x27;t take up much space on your vanity !</li>
            <li>mostly fits the purpose, mac lipstick fit however a few bigger ones from maybelline for example dont fit.</li>
            <li>Although it came with piece broken off,it arrived very fast and I am happy with it.</li>
            <li>Revlon lip butters seem to fit really well too, but lipsticks like Maybelline Color Sensational in the thicker square packaging are just a little too big for these compartments...</li>
            <li>(I have a rather large lipstick collection).  </li>
            <li>I have a large makeup collection &amp; only have 3 spots left so I will be ordering again for sure!</li>
            <li>so I know exactly where to go for a particular look.</li>
            <li>So far it fits all of my favorite lip products like YSL&#x27;s Sheer Candy balms (which are in a larger-than-normal sized metal tube, to give you an idea on how large the slots are).</li>
            <li>Have a lot of my lipsticks on display now thanks to this.</li>
            <li>Much easier to find the shade I&#x27;m looking for hehe</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this organizer, it&#x27;s simple and goes with anything.</li>
            <li>very sturdy acryllic.</li>
            <li>It took this almost a month to arrive, but here again for the price I couldn&#x27;t complain much.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I really found this to be helpful and really helps you get organized.</li>
            <li>and it really helps to have it.</li>
            <li>Since lipstick come in different sizes now not all my lipsticks fit in it</li>
            <li>The nail polish case does not confirm to modern nail polish bottles that are out now.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this lipstick stand...</li>
            <li>It was what I was wanting...love it  Thanks</li>
            <li>It was great because I ordered the one that holds 24 and it came in the Mail broken 3 weeks after I bought itn</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and it fits my lipsticks and body oil bottles.</li>
            <li>Very plastic.</li>
            <li>and it does not take up too much space  </li>
            <li>than i thought it would be, I put the lipsticks that i want to try or haven&#x27;t used much in it</li>
            <li>It makes it so much easier to find the color I want.</li>
            <li>Still very helpful.</li>
            <li>Would buy again and highly recommend!</li>
            <li>highly recommend this to anyone looking for a lipstick holder!</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>it lives on my nightstand and every time I&#x27;m getting ready to go out, I can see all my options.</li>
            <li>The organizer holds a lot of lip products (24) but my bigger square lipsticks don&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>like this so much I bought</li>
            <li>I received my item whole/complete and not broken.</li>
            <li>It feels very plasticy and I feel like it can crack/</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely ordering another one because not all my lipsticks fit on this one</li>
            <li>but I suppose I do not mind too much</li>
            <li>Just large enough to hold all the lipsticks I needed to clean up the area &amp; made everything much easier to get to.</li>
            <li>This was the main reason I wanted it.</li>
            <li>It is ok for lipstick and such, but not anything larger.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>They get the job done and I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Not so content it came cracked but very small literally can fit lipsticks (1-each slot)  or the the skinny nail designs not all nail polishes fit.</li>
            <li>Would be better if plastic was a little thicker</li>
            <li>Came quicker than anticipated and definitely worth the price, simple and high quality.</li>
            <li>and they look classy and very organized.  </li>
            <li>Fits different brands of lipstick, and it&#x27;s extremely useful with decluttering.</li>
            <li>Will not hold the normal sized polish bottles but does hold lipsticks well.</li>
            <li>It fits lipsticks and other item just fine.</li>
            <li>One of the organizers had a broken spot on the bottom luckily its in an unnoticeable area but packaging for this item could be done a bit better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still too new and shiny for any place</li>
            <li>I have no nail polish bottles tiny enough to fit.</li>
            <li>The extra big size lipsticks won&#x27;t fit in the holder.  </li>
            <li>Only 3 stars because its a great set up for my lipsticks but when I got them in the mail, on the side was already broken.</li>
            <li>It was okay, much smaller than expected and can&#x27;t hold any nail Polish</li>
            <li>Very Fast Shipping,  Overall</li>
            <li>Too small for nail polish, that&#x27;s for sure.  </li>
            <li>The shipping time is long but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>but it only fits skinny nail polish so its mostly for lipsticks and mascara bottles and other cosmetics</li>
            <li>Its sooo small, there is no way you can fit nail polish in this organizer!</li>
            <li>Not sure what I&#x27;ll use this for, because i don&#x27;t have that many tubes of lipstick.</li>
            <li>but I got mine not 1 but TWO weeks early!</li>
            <li>However, it does hold all of my lipsticks, and once the lipsticks are in there, it looks a lot less cheap.</li>
            <li>It makes such a difference to be able to see all the lipsticks and the names of the colors at one time instead of looking through a dark drawer.  </li>
            <li>Cheaply made, super thin material.</li>
            <li>Super light, thin plastic that hasn&#x27;t broke on me yet after owning it for over 6 months now.  </li>
            <li>It does, but only of a certain size.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t even fit a little Essie nail polish.</li>
            <li>Steer clear, yo.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clear organizer for all of my lipsticks.</li>
            <li>Clear.</li>
            <li>Both clear cosmetic stands were  cracked, but I kept them because  </li>
            <li>Arrived completely shattered.  </li>
            <li>The stuffing is too soft.  </li>
            <li>Came Early.</li>
            <li>No let downs so far.</li>
            <li>These things really gave me my dresser back.</li>
            <li>nothing unexpected for the price.</li>
            <li>When I brought this item, the description was &amp;#34;L-Zone Clear Cosmetic Stand 24 Lipstick Organizer Nail Polish Makeup Case Display Rack Holder &amp;#34; (copied and pasted directly from my order history).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely ordering a few more..</li>
            <li>Due to the price being so cheap I am just going to glue them back together</li>
            <li>Not good at all many lip sticks will not fit and no Nail polish will fit at all the insides</li>
            <li>as soon as I received my first one I immediately orderd a second &amp; now I&#x27;m going to get a third!</li>
            <li>It is small enough to keep on my bathroom counter top.  </li>
            <li>They hold lots of different brands from drugstore to high end.</li>
            <li>Way to small can&#x27;t even put a nail polish bottle in it, it&#x27; might fit a qutip..</li>
            <li>This is so small I do not have ANY nail polishes or lipsticks that will even fit in here.  </li>
            <li>it was so small not even the minis would fit in the compartments.</li>
            <li>I wanted it for lipstick, so it worked, but the holes would definitely not hold normal sized nail polishes.</li>
            <li>They are a little loose, but it appears to be a great way to display small numbers of lip balms in a clean/professional way.</li>
            <li>The only reason I&#x27;m giving this item 4 stars instead of 5 is because I have a hard time fitting my Maybelline lipsticks (or any squared shaped lipstick tube for that matter) into the compartments.  </li>
            <li>The size really worked for me and it fits different kinds of  regular size lipsticks ...</li>
            <li>fits a broad size of lipsticks.&lt;br /&gt;-nars&lt;br /&gt;-revlon</li>
            <li>Very cheap and thin plastic.  </li>
            <li>but her fine brushed, small bottles.  </li>
            <li>It is very well made and got it sooner than expected</li>
            <li>When I got this in the mail, the box was damaged, and when I opened it, the product had broken pieces, I&#x27;m able to use it</li>
            <li>I received this item and the package was smushed &amp; the product inside was chipped/cracked about a inch worth of plastic missing.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be ordering a couple more for my nail polish and other little things.</li>
            <li>Was kind of skeptical at first due to mixed reviews.</li>
            <li>Very small, this product is not as advertised, it will not even fit a standard bottle of nail polish in it, this product was a complete waist of money.</li>
            <li>Loved it and received it in less than two weeks the only thing down was that it come with a little chipped</li>
            <li>It was very small and it didn&#x27;t fit anything</li>
            <li>This product is a very small it doesn&#x27;t fit any of my nail polishes</li>
            <li>Not what i expected its more for lipstick and the small design nail polish and its way smaller ..</li>
            <li>It was smaller than I expected, but I didn&#x27;t really look at the dimensions.  </li>
            <li>Product had several chips upon opening - nothing major.</li>
            <li>and i dint look at the size its only five inches :o</li>
            <li>but it did arrive with few pretty substantial cracks</li>
            <li>It is fine for MAC or Loreal but will not hold Sephora or Victoria&#x27;s Secret etc.</li>
            <li>but they fit so snug that it is very hard to get them back out of the organizer.  </li>
            <li>I like the product but a bad quality for a good price.</li>
            <li>Good product bad seller.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> but it&#x27;s nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li> is astounding</li>
            <li> Also two or three line up together nicely</li>
            <li> This is a handy inexpensive organizer and it fits my lip glosses.</li>

            <li> I will be ordering another one soon!!! :)</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2WXSHCCFUZZPB]]I absolutely love the lipstick holder.</li>
            <li> But it seems like it will hold most lipstick cases.  </li>
            <li> I love that I don&#x27;t have to search all over my vanity for my lipsticks.</li>
            <li> Love this stand.  </li>

            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it was so cheap!</li>
            <li> Most of which come in sets of 6</li>
            <li> so I was able to put three sets in each.</li>
            <li> I really love this I used it to hold some of my nail polish</li>
            <li> But love the product.</li>

            <li> Most nail polish bottles are not the size of a lipstick holder.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> I am going to be buying more as I have too many lip products.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Fits all my MAC lipsticks and most of my sephora...</li>
            <li> and I forgot that most of them existed so I never used them.</li>
            <li> I ordered  more for Christmas  gifts.</li>
            <li> My lipsticks look so cute now :)</li>
            <li> The description needs more detail.</li>
            <li> overall, I&#x27;m really happy!!</li>
            <li> lipstick fit really nice in this (:</li>
            <li> so i ordered 3 more:)</li>
            <li> I already purchased like 6 love them</li>
            <li> I might need more off this.</li>
            <li> I love this cosmetic stand.</li>
            <li> Perfect for lipstick and lipstick only.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping great condition</li>
            <li> Looks just like the picture or perphas even better.</li>
            <li> It had many scratches</li>
            <li> they are a great price versus the overpriced versions, and I thought mine would come chipped like other reviewers experienced</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and very nice packaged.</li>
            <li> Great little organizers for a great price.</li>
            <li> Questions asked do not apply to product, asks easy to apply, how many times applied - this is just the holder.</li>
            <li> The slots are slightly smaller then imagened but fit my lippies perfectly!</li>
            <li> Great little make up organizer, perfect for lipsticks and certain types of nail polish.</li>
            <li> For $3 I managed to fit in all my MAC lipsticks:)</li>
            <li> Most eGo style batteries fit too.</li>
            <li> two and all the slots are filled mostly with flavorings to make e-liquid.</li>
            <li> awesome i only had three lipstick containers that didnot fit and all my glosses fit as well.</li>
            <li> Good packaging and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much</li>
            <li> Other than that it is wonderful and fits all lipsticks except the oval shaped ones.</li>
            <li> Other than that, great product, great price, just, better packaging would be appreciated.</li>
            <li> so you can see everything easy.</li>
            <li> This is just what I was looking for and arrived in perfect condition minus a couple of scratches that when filled up you can&#x27;t even see.</li>
            <li> but this make it so easy and neat to see what is what.</li>
            <li> row - makes it easy to see.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t flimsy plastic that bends or chips easily.</li>
            <li> Easy.</li>
            <li> They hold strong.</li>
            <li> ,two QTIPS long.&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s pretty nice for the price üëè</li>
            <li> The polishes fit perfectly in the display case and they weren&#x27;t tight it was easy in easy out.</li>
            <li> Is compact ans easy to fit in a drawer too.</li>
            <li> Looks fine</li>
            <li> but it works just fine..</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li> Since the crack is on the bottom of the product it still works fine.</li>
            <li> shipped fast and arrived clean and in nice, safe packaging.</li>
            <li> Item was shipped quickly; I was pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I at first purchased one of these and loved it so much that I bought two more.</li>
            <li> It works great for&lt;br /&gt;lip stick (mostly) but not one single nail polish fit in the squares, and that is what I bought it for.  </li>
            <li> I discovered that mascara and concealer can fit in the stand also, not just lipstick and gloss.</li>
            <li> I just hope it will all fit to this case</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something cheap to hold lipsticks or glosses, then this is what you need.</li>
            <li> it holds 24 lipsticks, the larger based sticks are a tighter fit, but they all fit great</li>
            <li> I can get them to fit in the compartments</li>
            <li> Overall, I am so happy with this lipstick organizer</li>
            <li> I bought this specifically for my julep nail polish because I saw another customer submitted their photo where their polish fit</li>
            <li> It took about a month to ship, but with free shipping I didn&#x27;t expect it overnight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great quality, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> None of my nail polishes fit.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, it has zipped fill slits.  </li>
            <li> but its free and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so great and it very fragile.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> Nail polish doesn&#x27;t fit into the squares though</li>
            <li> an assortment of products fit in here and</li>
            <li> You can fit mac ,nars and Maybelline lipsticks.</li>
            <li> I could barely fit anything in the holes.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t complain when its really cheap.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> The material is really cheap</li>
            <li> but it was not recommended as it would costs more than it is worth.</li>
            <li> A lot of my lip glosses fit well, too.</li>
            <li> It shows nail posh would fit.</li>
            <li> I could put my Vamo v5 in a slot, but it&#x27;s a snug fit.</li>
            <li> And my cosm√©tics don&#x27;t fit plus was damaged for the mail</li>
            <li> I saw &amp;#34;Nail Polish&amp;#34; and thought it will fit nail polish.</li>
            <li> I also use them to organize mascara and anything else that will fit into the holes.</li>
            <li> It makes is so much easier to find my items when they are nicely organized and visible.</li>
            <li> and they fit all my lipsticks.</li>
            <li> Since I didn&#x27;t pay much for it, it&#x27;s okay, but not the most well made product.</li>
            <li> I threw out old stuff because, honestly, who needs more than 28 lip colors?</li>
            <li> I think the changing levels is very useful.</li>
            <li> It holds most of my lipsticks with no problem, all except one that is in a very large lipstick case.  </li>
            <li> Great lipstick holder some lipsticks fit a little to snug but most fit just fine</li>
            <li> This is pretty cheaply made but does fit most lipsticks.  </li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with the storage ability of this product but was hoping for something more like it was originally advertised as.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased with the first one I purchased</li>
            <li> So useful!</li>
            <li> , it is kind of big, takes a lot of room in your vanity but it fit most of my lipstick (mac, Revlon,)</li>
            <li> Took about 2 weeks or so but its worth the wait!</li>
            <li> Liked it and possibly going to order more</li>
            <li> fit my lipstick perfectly, quick shipping also.</li>
            <li> Super cheap material.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve filled it up so will need to buy another soon from the seller such a good price and came safetly wrapped.</li>
            <li> And the price is right!</li>
            <li> Item received just as described and shipping dates were right on the money!</li>
            <li> i only ordered one at first to scope it out lol</li>
            <li> Packing was great and shipping quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> Good for standard sized lipsticks.</li>
            <li> But it still keeps my lipstick ready to find, which I always struggle with because I use so many colors.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and the product is outstanding</li>
            <li> It came cracked, but I still love it haha</li>
            <li> My came with a littke crack on the top, which really bothered me</li>
            <li> Overall good product I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> But for the price not bad.......</li>
            <li> Ok for lipstick and good for eye pencils - squares are tight but helps with organizing  like the elevation of rows-  not for nail polish</li>
            <li> BUT it does fits essential oil bottles perfectly (the basic slim roll on bottles).</li>
            <li> the product is tremendous quality for the price imma</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly but I&#x27;m amazed it made it in one piece.</li>
            <li> Wanted a nice cheap present for my wife for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really complain though, as the product was fairly cheap and shipping was free.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m really please and will be ordering 2 more since I own 64 lipsticks.</li>
            <li> My mac lipsticks fit perfectly my kat von d ones fit a little tight but on the back ones it fit good.</li>
            <li> real well asi was looking for something to get my lipsticks and brushes out of drawers and into a easily reachable within eye view place, so</li>
            <li> There exactly as the picture shows!</li>
            <li> so I bought several more!...</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted for my lipstick collection!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I found most 10ml or less fits nicely.</li>
            <li> Just be gentle and it&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> some of them are too large but they somewhat fit.</li>
            <li> The lipstick organizer would have been more useful if it was bigger, it didn&#x27;t fit all my lipsticks and it took a while to come.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have much lip products, but since getting this I have filled it up üòÑ</li>
            <li> nice stands with several, however, chipped</li>
            <li> Nice product, took forever to actually receive almost a month</li>
            <li> It was in perfect condition when i got it in the mail, i expected the sections to be a tad bigger.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping; was not broken :)</li>
            <li> Worth the wait.</li>
            <li> although, recieved cracked from the front and broken from the side works perfectly for me!</li>
            <li> So useful.</li>
            <li> I already own two and just bought a third.</li>
            <li> It actually was really nice ...</li>
            <li> it holds many lipsticks and that it&#x27;s clear.</li>
            <li> really nice and cheap compared to a lot of other acrylic holders</li>
            <li> This is extremely small but exactly PERFECT for my 5 year old and her chapsticks!</li>
            <li> There was a crack in the side of mine but other than that it was good</li>
            <li> other than that I loved it, the quality, the price &amp; everything about it</li>
            <li> This is a good holder for the price but be aware it only holds very slender nail polish bottles or lipstick.</li>
            <li> Shipping took quite awhile but the price is right.</li>
            <li> (right after i opened it) and one of the divider pieces cracked.</li>
            <li> the price point was right although i had a to wait for it  to be shipped from china.</li>
            <li> just right</li>
            <li> I loved it!super small and easily to fit it in my vanity table, took almost 3 weeks to get it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier to have them organized in one of these than to have to dig through drawers to find the right one!</li>
            <li> and it is loose and doesn&#x27;t fit that great as it is too skinny and long</li>
            <li> they said it would cost more than its worth to ship it back</li>
            <li> Product arrived faster than the expected shipping date and will fit most lipsticks</li>
            <li> Although this is perfect for all lipsticks and lipstain, it will likely not fit any nail polish bottles, so I would not buy it for that purpose.</li>
            <li> (variety of different brands) fast shipping &amp; packaged nicely.</li>
            <li> It actually looks pretty sitting out in the bathroom and makes it easy to grab your color and run out the door!</li>
            <li> took a little time but good buy</li>
            <li> So, it makes organizing makeup so much easier!</li>
            <li> First off shipping took over a month &amp; the packaging came in a envelope instead of a box.</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It came exactly on time</li>
            <li> It fits pretty much everything!</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it was made for.</li>
            <li> What can i say this product is not expensive</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m going to be purchasing another very soon!</li>
            <li> Small and simple, perfect for organizing lipsticks and lip glosses.</li>
            <li> arrived in about 3 weeks and it is great for storing various products and currently mine has mac lipsticks, they&#x27;re real mascara, baby skin, and elf lip scrub.</li>
            <li> Exactly how it looks .</li>
            <li> It is small, but still holds a number of lipsticks and glosses and looks really nice!  </li>
            <li> This lipstick organizer is exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Will come back to buy more.</li>
            <li> Due to my large collection of lippys will be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> I thinks it&#x27;s a good thing because it&#x27;s better for storage, this is definitely not a nail polish case as it is small.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected but great for holding lipstick</li>
            <li> Was able to fit few mascaras and aye pencils.</li>
            <li> I really love how this organizer can hold so many lipsticks but is still very small and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space.  </li>
            <li> love the price, takes away from the long wait.</li>
            <li> Very compact in size so it won&#x27;t take up much space on your vanity !</li>
            <li> mostly fits the purpose, mac lipstick fit however a few bigger ones from maybelline for example dont fit.</li>
            <li> Although it came with piece broken off,it arrived very fast and I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> Revlon lip butters seem to fit really well too, but lipsticks like Maybelline Color Sensational in the thicker square packaging are just a little too big for these compartments...</li>
            <li> (I have a rather large lipstick collection).  </li>
            <li> I have a large makeup collection &amp; only have 3 spots left so I will be ordering again for sure!</li>
            <li> so I know exactly where to go for a particular look.</li>
            <li> So far it fits all of my favorite lip products like YSL&#x27;s Sheer Candy balms (which are in a larger-than-normal sized metal tube, to give you an idea on how large the slots are).</li>
            <li> Have a lot of my lipsticks on display now thanks to this.</li>
            <li> Much easier to find the shade I&#x27;m looking for hehe</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this organizer, it&#x27;s simple and goes with anything.</li>
            <li> very sturdy acryllic.</li>
            <li> It took this almost a month to arrive, but here again for the price I couldn&#x27;t complain much.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really found this to be helpful and really helps you get organized.</li>
            <li> and it really helps to have it.</li>
            <li> Since lipstick come in different sizes now not all my lipsticks fit in it</li>
            <li> The nail polish case does not confirm to modern nail polish bottles that are out now.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this lipstick stand...</li>
            <li> It was what I was wanting...love it  Thanks</li>
            <li> It was great because I ordered the one that holds 24 and it came in the Mail broken 3 weeks after I bought itn</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and it fits my lipsticks and body oil bottles.</li>
            <li> Very plastic.</li>
            <li> and it does not take up too much space  </li>
            <li> than i thought it would be, I put the lipsticks that i want to try or haven&#x27;t used much in it</li>
            <li> It makes it so much easier to find the color I want.</li>
            <li> Still very helpful.</li>
            <li> Would buy again and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> highly recommend this to anyone looking for a lipstick holder!</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> it lives on my nightstand and every time I&#x27;m getting ready to go out, I can see all my options.</li>
            <li> The organizer holds a lot of lip products (24) but my bigger square lipsticks don&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> like this so much I bought</li>
            <li> I received my item whole/complete and not broken.</li>
            <li> It feels very plasticy and I feel like it can crack/</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely ordering another one because not all my lipsticks fit on this one</li>
            <li> but I suppose I do not mind too much</li>
            <li> Just large enough to hold all the lipsticks I needed to clean up the area &amp; made everything much easier to get to.</li>
            <li> This was the main reason I wanted it.</li>
            <li> It is ok for lipstick and such, but not anything larger.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> They get the job done and I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Not so content it came cracked but very small literally can fit lipsticks (1-each slot)  or the the skinny nail designs not all nail polishes fit.</li>
            <li> Would be better if plastic was a little thicker</li>
            <li> Came quicker than anticipated and definitely worth the price, simple and high quality.</li>
            <li> and they look classy and very organized.  </li>
            <li> Fits different brands of lipstick, and it&#x27;s extremely useful with decluttering.</li>
            <li> Will not hold the normal sized polish bottles but does hold lipsticks well.</li>
            <li> It fits lipsticks and other item just fine.</li>
            <li> One of the organizers had a broken spot on the bottom luckily its in an unnoticeable area but packaging for this item could be done a bit better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still too new and shiny for any place</li>
            <li> I have no nail polish bottles tiny enough to fit.</li>
            <li> The extra big size lipsticks won&#x27;t fit in the holder.  </li>
            <li> Only 3 stars because its a great set up for my lipsticks but when I got them in the mail, on the side was already broken.</li>
            <li> It was okay, much smaller than expected and can&#x27;t hold any nail Polish</li>
            <li> Very Fast Shipping,  Overall</li>
            <li> Too small for nail polish, that&#x27;s for sure.  </li>
            <li> The shipping time is long but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> but it only fits skinny nail polish so its mostly for lipsticks and mascara bottles and other cosmetics</li>
            <li> Its sooo small, there is no way you can fit nail polish in this organizer!</li>
            <li> Not sure what I&#x27;ll use this for, because i don&#x27;t have that many tubes of lipstick.</li>
            <li> but I got mine not 1 but TWO weeks early!</li>
            <li> However, it does hold all of my lipsticks, and once the lipsticks are in there, it looks a lot less cheap.</li>
            <li> It makes such a difference to be able to see all the lipsticks and the names of the colors at one time instead of looking through a dark drawer.  </li>
            <li> Cheaply made, super thin material.</li>
            <li> Super light, thin plastic that hasn&#x27;t broke on me yet after owning it for over 6 months now.  </li>
            <li> It does, but only of a certain size.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even fit a little Essie nail polish.</li>
            <li> Steer clear, yo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clear organizer for all of my lipsticks.</li>
            <li> Clear.</li>
            <li> Both clear cosmetic stands were  cracked, but I kept them because  </li>
            <li> Arrived completely shattered.  </li>
            <li> The stuffing is too soft.  </li>
            <li> Came Early.</li>
            <li> No let downs so far.</li>
            <li> These things really gave me my dresser back.</li>
            <li> nothing unexpected for the price.</li>
            <li> When I brought this item, the description was &amp;#34;L-Zone Clear Cosmetic Stand 24 Lipstick Organizer Nail Polish Makeup Case Display Rack Holder &amp;#34; (copied and pasted directly from my order history).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely ordering a few more..</li>
            <li> Due to the price being so cheap I am just going to glue them back together</li>
            <li> Not good at all many lip sticks will not fit and no Nail polish will fit at all the insides</li>
            <li> as soon as I received my first one I immediately orderd a second &amp; now I&#x27;m going to get a third!</li>
            <li> It is small enough to keep on my bathroom counter top.  </li>
            <li> They hold lots of different brands from drugstore to high end.</li>
            <li> Way to small can&#x27;t even put a nail polish bottle in it, it&#x27; might fit a qutip..</li>
            <li> This is so small I do not have ANY nail polishes or lipsticks that will even fit in here.  </li>
            <li> it was so small not even the minis would fit in the compartments.</li>
            <li> I wanted it for lipstick, so it worked, but the holes would definitely not hold normal sized nail polishes.</li>
            <li> They are a little loose, but it appears to be a great way to display small numbers of lip balms in a clean/professional way.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving this item 4 stars instead of 5 is because I have a hard time fitting my Maybelline lipsticks (or any squared shaped lipstick tube for that matter) into the compartments.  </li>
            <li> The size really worked for me and it fits different kinds of  regular size lipsticks ...</li>
            <li> fits a broad size of lipsticks.&lt;br /&gt;-nars&lt;br /&gt;-revlon</li>
            <li> Very cheap and thin plastic.  </li>
            <li> but her fine brushed, small bottles.  </li>
            <li> It is very well made and got it sooner than expected</li>
            <li> When I got this in the mail, the box was damaged, and when I opened it, the product had broken pieces, I&#x27;m able to use it</li>
            <li> I received this item and the package was smushed &amp; the product inside was chipped/cracked about a inch worth of plastic missing.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be ordering a couple more for my nail polish and other little things.</li>
            <li> Was kind of skeptical at first due to mixed reviews.</li>
            <li> Very small, this product is not as advertised, it will not even fit a standard bottle of nail polish in it, this product was a complete waist of money.</li>
            <li> Loved it and received it in less than two weeks the only thing down was that it come with a little chipped</li>
            <li> It was very small and it didn&#x27;t fit anything</li>
            <li> This product is a very small it doesn&#x27;t fit any of my nail polishes</li>
            <li> Not what i expected its more for lipstick and the small design nail polish and its way smaller ..</li>
            <li> It was smaller than I expected, but I didn&#x27;t really look at the dimensions.  </li>
            <li> Product had several chips upon opening - nothing major.</li>
            <li> and i dint look at the size its only five inches :o</li>
            <li> but it did arrive with few pretty substantial cracks</li>
            <li> It is fine for MAC or Loreal but will not hold Sephora or Victoria&#x27;s Secret etc.</li>
            <li> but they fit so snug that it is very hard to get them back out of the organizer.  </li>
            <li> I like the product but a bad quality for a good price.</li>
            <li> Good product bad seller.</li>
            <li> Nail polishes dont even fit its only for lipsticks smh false advertisment</li>
            <li> I have other clear organizers on my vanity that this matches</li>
            <li> got it broken cannot fit polish in it unless it small bottle very disapointed</li>
            <li> Many reviews complained about this product being too small for their lipstick tubes.  </li>
            <li> I really like this little lipstick organizer!  </li>
            <li> , I accidentally dropped it on my front concrete steps minutes after receiving due to my hands being full of mail &amp; other Amazon purchases, I thought I had surely broken it but not a single scratch!</li>
            <li> so the only thing that bothered me was how long it took.</li>
            <li> This definitely does the job it is intended to do, my lipsticks stay put all day long, unless I remove them.</li>
            <li> Only had a couple random brands that didn&#x27;t fit, ie.</li>
            <li> It actually came a bit earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Plus standard size lip gloss and lipstick will fit along with small tubes of mascara primer and other small products.</li>
            <li> This was a little smaller than I thought as it is just big enough to hold lipstick or mascara.  </li>
            <li> She says that bottles of nail polish will not fit in it, even though it clearly states in the title that it was made for lipstick AND nail polish.</li>
            <li> This is much, much smaller than what I expected.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not heavy heavy duty</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected,</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected</li>
            <li> but it still stays in as long as I don&#x27;t bump it.</li>
            <li> cause it took long to get here</li>
            <li> They were much smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> so you have to be extra careful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waited so long for this package.</li>
            <li> Shipping will take long considering it&#x27;s coming from China</li>
            <li> it such a drag to send back.not ever buying these again</li>
            <li> Shipping takes too long!</li>
            <li> If they are bigger than the standard tube (wider) they will not fit in this.  </li>
            <li> Listed for lipstick and nail polish, however slots are much too small for the average size bottle of nail polish.</li>
            <li> but they openings are not big enough for quite a few of mine.</li>
            <li> Hate it so much it said it was a nail polish holder but not even my striper nail polishes fit</li>
            <li> I store some of my essential oils in it, though the fatter ones I have to store upside down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it takes up a small amount of space, which was necessary since i have recently downsized.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a little bigger</li>
            <li> but it had a little chip in it in the back when I received it in the mail.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to be a little bigger</li>
            <li> It took a while to get here but got here a little earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> The compartments are a little smaller than what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I received the stand a lot sooner than I expected so</li>
            <li> It is also not very stable.</li>
            <li> Round tubes such as M.A.C., Lime Crime, Revlon, NYX, etc.</li>
            <li> Works as expected for lip sticks.</li>
            <li> It does NOT fit 10ml essential oil bottles as i thought another reviewer stated.</li>
            <li> shippig was fast but it arrived broken with a crack in it and a chip of one of the squares</li>
            <li> There was no real protection.</li>
            <li> It is still empty.</li>
            <li> It was everything I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as thick as the more expensive acrylic holders</li>
            <li> It was cracked in several places, and is not very durable or heavy.</li>
            <li> Its not super pretty, and its not great quality.</li>
            <li> but it is a accurate size for inexpensive  lipstick to expensive !</li>
            <li> The only down side is there was a little crack</li>
            <li> Just spend the little extra money on something higher quality, even if it did come intact any little drop or some sort of harsh movement would of broken t with out a doubt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure people who want to use it for make up won&#x27;t be disappointed either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and simple.</li>
            <li> I recommend trying other products before getting this one.</li>
            <li> I had purchased these from an other seller and</li>
            <li> Only fits the square lipsticks and small circle ones and chapsticks.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t expect it to hold any nailpolish except for the Julep brand and any other square-shaped nailpolish</li>
            <li> The slots are too small to hold my Essential oils</li>
            <li> Also, its a bit sharp around the edges....</li>
            <li> Was small and wanted to return didn&#x27;t get money back</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an acrylic lipstick holder you may be disappointed in this one though because it is a thinner, more flimsy (in comparison to acrylic) plastic.</li>
            <li> I would have given more stars but unforuntetly due to poor packaging this product cane broken!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as thick as my other acrylic lip holder so it actually arrived damaged.</li>
            <li> Not worth it for me to return</li>
            <li> average lipstick can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price or the wait to receive them.</li>
            <li> so I have them upside down</li>
            <li> It was delivered Crack therefore 2 thumbs down</li>
            <li> Also, when it arrived the plastic was chipped on one corner, and it was cracked down the backside.</li>
            <li> (Unless they&#x27;re upside down.)</li>
            <li> The shipping took awhile, but other than that no complaints!</li>
            <li> These questions are odd.</li>
            <li> Mine came slightly cracked or would give 5 stars.</li>
            <li> My daughter is still able to use them, but it is disappointing to pay for something that is broken when it arrives.</li>
            <li> When i first got this i was a little disappointed because it is A LOT smaller</li>
            <li> Just not able to hold lipsticks that are too wide .</li>
            <li> Now I can clearly see what I have, instead of making unnecessary repeat lip color purchases add I&#x27;ve done in the past.</li>
            <li> On the flip side, because it is made from a thinner plastic they may have a tendency to crack a little easier (but since all they do is just sit on a counter or vanity, you shouldn&#x27;t have an issue with that).  </li>
            <li> I went to grab the package and it sounded like there were little beads hitting the plastic.</li>
            <li> The acrylic was a little cloudy and scratched but</li>
            <li> Maybe it was my fault that I didn&#x27;t read other reviews and check out how small this was.</li>
            <li> Get this if we have lots of little glosses and round lipsticks</li>
            <li> money is well spent I would recommend this product !!!</li>
            <li> Just a little embarrassed to give someone a present that is broken.</li>
            <li> Smaller than it appears &amp; it came broken not so damiged still usable .</li>
            <li> I was upset that it did not fit my nail polishes.  </li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> but when I open the package the bottom seemed like it was dropped because it was broken.</li>
            <li> It was broken in the back, not noticeable when I put lipsticks in, but probably could have been prevented if it came in a box instead of a bag...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> And mine came in broken from 3 different places.</li>
            <li> so that i know i didn&#x27;t waste money on them</li>
            <li> Finger nail polish bottles will not fit into hole, no matter what shape or size</li>
            <li> One of mine came chipped with a chunk missing out of it.</li>
            <li> One downside: it does not fit nail polish.</li>
            <li> Nail polish will not fit in it the slots.</li>
            <li> When it finally came today I open it to find it&#x27;s broken!!</li>
            <li> as far as quality it is very poorly made</li>
            <li> You really cant go wrong with this thing because it does the job!</li>
            <li> small and takes up little space</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re expecting a comestic organizer that&#x27;s about medium size then you&#x27;ll waste a few dollars!</li>
            <li> Hi, my product was very little</li>
            <li> I use this for nail polish it fits my Art Deco nail stripers, Julep polish, Hard Candy&#x27;s round bottles,</li>
            <li> It is flimsy and small.</li>
            <li> are way to small</li>
            <li> Not sure what I was thinking......</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS REALLY SMALL.</li>
            <li> Boxes kinda small.</li>
            <li> I purchased it to hold nail polish slots to small.</li>
            <li> The compartments were too small.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to be as small.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really small (can of soda for comparison).</li>
            <li> Too small for nail polish asked them to return it</li>
            <li> Not what it&#x27;s day toooo small</li>
            <li> IT is a organizer so i am not sure about some of the questions</li>
            <li> they are small slots.</li>
            <li> Organized lipsticks and small make up</li>
            <li> The cubes are so small not even kids size nail polish fits.</li>
            <li> This took Over A month to come and had a small crack in it.</li>
            <li> It comes in a fitted very thin cardboard cover and that was vacuumed sealed into a regular envelope.</li>
            <li> Victoria&#x27;s Secret and one other</li>
            <li> The image is deceiving it is tiny tiny crap.</li>
            <li> Came broken, all the way from china, the packaing was very poor, not worth sending back for refund</li>
            <li> I mean it&#x27;s alittle small</li>

            <li> Its very small thought</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Very small</li>
            <li> Overall, bad quality and not at all what it advertises.</li>
            <li> but it kinda sucks buying something with broken pieces.</li>
            <li> What I received was thin plastic, broken on the corners, and too small for all</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is that one was broken when it arrived in the mail, which was too bad.</li>
            <li> I received this yesterday and was a bit disappointed, only because I was under the impression it would hold nail polishes...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Cute! Have a lot of my lipsticks on display now thanks to this. Much easier to find the shade I&#x27;m looking for hehe</li>
            <li> This is the second stand that I have bought. I love it! I discovered that mascara and concealer can fit in the stand also, not just lipstick and gloss. So, it makes organizing makeup so much easier!</li>
            <li> I use this for my essential oil roll on bottles and it works great!</li>
            <li> There was a crack in the side of mine but other than that it was good</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this organizer, it&#x27;s simple and goes with anything.</li>
            <li> It was very small and it didn&#x27;t fit anything</li>
            <li> Very Fast Shipping,  Overall Please!</li>
            <li> much smaller than I thought</li>
            <li> This item was already cracked when I received it not sturdy at all</li>
            <li> Cheap but good for what it&#x27;s for</li>
            <li> This is much, much smaller than what I expected. It will serve its purpose but it&#x27;s nothing spectacular. I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> It served the purpose I purchased it for.  It was smaller than I expected, but I didn&#x27;t really look at the dimensions.  I would purchase another.</li>
            <li> When I got this in the mail, the box was damaged, and when I opened it, the product had broken pieces, I&#x27;m able to use it but it kinda sucks buying something with broken pieces.</li>
            <li> my lipstick badly needs to be organized, i might be needing this. I just hope it will all fit to this case</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for here.  This is pretty cheaply made but does fit most lipsticks.  If they are bigger than the standard tube (wider) they will not fit in this.  Shipping took quite awhile but the price is right.</li>
            <li> I received the stand a lot sooner than I expected so that was a nice surprise! The stand is perfect for my lipsticks and it&#x27;s not too bulky. The owner contacted me via email making sure I had received my package and if there was anything they could do to fix it. They were great and I would buy from them again.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product. It is flimsy and small. It does not hold any larger style lipsticks. It is fine for MAC or Loreal but will not hold Sephora or Victoria&#x27;s Secret etc. It is also not very stable. I am disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Not good at all many lip sticks will not fit and no Nail polish will fit at all the insides are way to small</li>
            <li> Had a bunch of lipsticks I did not know what to do it and this item saved the day!  Yeah very happy with this but and the reviews were on point!!</li>
            <li> I love my lipstick holder! It&#x27;s the perfect size to sit on my vanity and have my lipsticks on display! It&#x27;s much easier to have them organized in one of these than to have to dig through drawers to find the right one! There exactly as the picture shows! I&#x27;m thinking of ordering another!:)</li>
            <li> Very good quality and price! The shipping took awhile, but other than that no complaints!</li>
            <li> First off shipping took over a month &amp; the packaging came in a envelope instead of a box. There for two out of the four I ordered had cracked on the back which is not noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides that it serves it&#x27;s purpose for a great price. It&#x27;s not as thick as the more expensive acrylic holders but it&#x27;s not a bendable material either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It fits my Mac, Maybeline, Revlon, Milani, NYX, Wet &amp; Wild, &amp; Avon lippies. It fits the Mac lippies perfect right side up &amp; in the boxes. However I like to see the name on the lippies so I have them upside down &amp; they tilt to the side. Which doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this item. Packaging just needs to be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Updating my review***  I can&#x27;t post another picture BUT it does fits essential oil bottles perfectly (the basic slim roll on bottles). I will be ordering two more &amp; will update with pictures once I receive them. Hopefully they won&#x27;t arrive broken.....</li>
            <li> Compartments not big enough for nail polish bottles!  This was the main reason I wanted it. Also, it was supposed to be a Christmas gift for my granddaughter, but it took a month to arrive - after Christmas was over!</li>
            <li> I could organize my lipsticks at last. Is compact ans easy to fit in a drawer too. The turndown for me is that it took arond a month to arrive.</li>
            <li> Arrived completely shattered.  Useless. Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> fits a broad size of lipsticks.&lt;br /&gt;-nars&lt;br /&gt;-revlon&lt;br /&gt;-mac&lt;br /&gt;-milani&lt;br /&gt;-rimmel london&lt;br /&gt;-nicka k&lt;br /&gt;-sephora collection&lt;br /&gt;-maybelline&lt;br /&gt;-wet n wild&lt;br /&gt;-nyx&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i also store five to ten q-tips in the last square to do edge touch-ups.&lt;br /&gt;it takes up a small amount of space, which was necessary since i have recently downsized. very sturdy acryllic. shipped fast and arrived clean and in nice, safe packaging. will order again if i find myself buying more lipstick/lipgloss.</li>
            <li> This is not at all usable as a nail polish holder, but perfect for lipstick. If you are looking for something cheap to hold lipsticks or glosses, then this is what you need. It&#x27;s not the best material, but for the price it gets the job done. It seems to come from China so if you&#x27;re in a hurry to receive it you may wanna look elsewhere. It took this almost a month to arrive, but here again for the price I couldn&#x27;t complain much.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for all of my lip products. It even holds my smaller lip glosses and chapsticks perfectly. Great height between levels so you can see everything easy.</li>
            <li> One of the organizers had a broken spot on the bottom luckily its in an unnoticeable area but packaging for this item could be done a bit better.</li>
            <li> Good value for the money. Looks fine</li>
            <li> Smaller than what I was thinking.  Not sure what I was thinking...... it holds 24 lipsticks, the larger based sticks are a tighter fit, but they all fit great</li>
            <li> Loved it and received it in less than two weeks the only thing down was that it come with a little chipped</li>
            <li> really nice and cheap compared to a lot of other acrylic holders but it did arrive with few pretty substantial cracks but once the lipsticks go in it is all good and btw ik it says nail polish rack but trust me  you could really only use it for lipstick</li>
            <li> No tracking number &amp; it came in bag ! Not a box !!</li>
            <li> I ended up ordering 3 of these! I organized my makeup tower (yes I said tower) and they look classy and very organized.  love them</li>
            <li> I was so pleased with the first one I purchased so I bought several more!...(I have a rather large lipstick collection).  I really love how this organizer can hold so many lipsticks but is still very small and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space.  A lot of cosmetic organizers like this tend to be so chunky, thick, and heavy that it seems there is more acrylic than actual storage space.  On the flip side, because it is made from a thinner plastic they may have a tendency to crack a little easier (but since all they do is just sit on a counter or vanity, you shouldn&#x27;t have an issue with that).  The only reason I&#x27;m giving this item 4 stars instead of 5 is because I have a hard time fitting my Maybelline lipsticks (or any squared shaped lipstick tube for that matter) into the compartments.  Round tubes such as M.A.C., Lime Crime, Revlon, NYX, etc. fit perfectly into each compartment.  Revlon lip butters seem to fit really well too, but lipsticks like Maybelline Color Sensational in the thicker square packaging are just a little too big for these compartments...(sometimes I can get them to fit in the compartments but they fit so snug that it is very hard to get them back out of the organizer.  Overall, I am so happy with this lipstick organizer and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Ok for lipstick and good for eye pencils - squares are tight but helps with organizing  like the elevation of rows-  not for nail polish</li>
            <li> For the price it does the job it&#x27;s not heavy heavy duty but it works just fine..</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a way to display my nail polishes from julep maven for the longest time! I&#x27;m so glad that I found this seller! The polishes fit perfectly in the display case and they weren&#x27;t tight it was easy in easy out. Plus standard size lip gloss and lipstick will fit along with small tubes of mascara primer and other small products.</li>
            <li> nice stands with several, however, chipped</li>
            <li> Not so content it came cracked but very small literally can fit lipsticks (1-each slot)  or the the skinny nail designs not all nail polishes fit. But hey it was chea so yea..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy, and I got this to use as a eCig battery/tanks/juice organizer and it works perfectly for that. Seems it&#x27;s made from a durable plastic and didn&#x27;t see anything wrong with it. I&#x27;m sure people who want to use it for make up won&#x27;t be disappointed either.</li>
            <li> Too small for nail polish, that&#x27;s for sure.  Very cheap and thin plastic.  Piece of junk!</li>
            <li> Great for the price. Works as expected for lip sticks.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. Arrived a week before delivery date, Good size for storage.</li>
            <li> It arrived broken. Took one month to ship. It does NOT fit 10ml essential oil bottles as i thought another reviewer stated.</li>
            <li> Greet love it plan on getting more!!!!</li>
            <li> Nice product, took forever to actually receive almost a month</li>
            <li> I love my organizers! Although I was disappointed when I received my second one I purchased due to the broken merchandise I received upon its arrival.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for...Very cheap looking thing, took forever to recieve.</li>
            <li> I loved it ... Ordering more</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Fits all my lipsticks and glosses perfectly. Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I know this product is under five dollars, but BEWARE THIS PRODUCT IS REALLY SMALL. If you&#x27;re expecting a comestic organizer that&#x27;s about medium size then you&#x27;ll waste a few dollars!</li>
            <li> It was cracked in several places, and is not very durable or heavy.</li>
            <li> So useful! Looks adorable and keeps my obsession organized lol</li>
            <li> Love these things. Great little organizers for a great price.</li>
            <li> Due to my large collection of lippys will be purchasing more! Amazing addition to my vanity! And compared to department store this is great quality for the price. Would like to add the durability is astounding, I accidentally dropped it on my front concrete steps minutes after receiving due to my hands being full of mail &amp; other Amazon purchases, I thought I had surely broken it but not a single scratch! Love! Don&#x27;t second guess this buy!</li>
            <li> I bought this specifically for my julep nail polish because I saw another customer submitted their photo where their polish fit so a big thank you to them. I will be buying more of these they are a great price versus the overpriced versions, and I thought mine would come chipped like other reviewers experienced but it didn&#x27;t bother me because it still would have served its purpose. Thankfully it came packed with styrofaom and double bubble wrapped so no chips or scratches, very very happy customer</li>
            <li> Awesome definitely will repurchase</li>
            <li> Its not super pretty, and its not great quality. However, it does hold all of my lipsticks, and once the lipsticks are in there, it looks a lot less cheap. You really cant go wrong with this thing because it does the job!</li>
            <li> Liked it and possibly going to order more</li>
            <li> I order this thinking it was big enough to put nail polish in. My mistake :-(  If you were thinking like me, think again</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why we had to answer any of the above questions, they have nothing to do with this lipstick holder!! The holder fits my lipsticks perfectly and I am about to order another one</li>
            <li> Very small. I have no nail polish bottles tiny enough to fit.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected but great for holding lipstick</li>
            <li> Great product shipping could be better but overall great item.</li>
            <li> Smaller than it appears &amp; it came broken not so damiged still usable .</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> came on time,  one was broke and they gave me a refund  for it very nice fits perfectly</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something to hold my lipsticks in &amp; this item is perfect glad I bought this !!money is well spent I would recommend this product !!!</li>
            <li> Broke in the mail . Not worth it for me to return</li>
            <li> This product advertised that it would hold lip stick and or nail polish.  I was upset that it did not fit my nail polishes.  It works great for&lt;br /&gt;lip stick (mostly) but not one single nail polish fit in the squares, and that is what I bought it for.  The product is much smaller then&lt;br /&gt;i thought it was going to be.</li>
            <li> Came quicker than anticipated and definitely worth the price, simple and high quality. This was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> awesome i only had three lipstick containers that didnot fit and all my glosses fit as well. very happy! small and takes up little space</li>
            <li> Boxes kinda small. Good for standard sized lipsticks.</li>
            <li> smaller than it appears. Nothing fits.&lt;br /&gt;Even average lipstick can&#x27;t. A waste of money.</li>
            <li> I really found this to be helpful and really helps you get organized. I thought it was a great deal and it really helps to have it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great size and very compact for my shelf. It&#x27;s small and simple. Love it. I even ordered another one since I was so happy with it. Can&#x27;t beat the price either.</li>
            <li> This thing came broken for one... But it came on time and it does what it&#x27;s suppose to do</li>
            <li> I orderd 5 but three of them were scratched!!</li>
            <li> fit my lipstick perfectly, quick shipping also.</li>
            <li> DOES  NOT HOLD NAIL POLISH BOTTLES unless they are really tiny.  Smaller than expected, but i use it for a variety of cosmetic items, just can&#x27;t use it for the reason I bought it.</li>
            <li> It was in perfect condition when i got it in the mail, i expected the sections to be a tad bigger. Since lipstick come in different sizes now not all my lipsticks fit in it ane had to.purchase a bigger one.</li>
            <li> Love it. I do think I need another one already. I have more lipsticks then I thought</li>
            <li> I loved it !! :))&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied</li>
            <li> awesome. no complaints, perfect for lipstick,  glosses n mascaras</li>
            <li> Basic lipstick holder! Gets the work done! Great price!</li>
            <li> It was delivered Crack therefore 2 thumbs down</li>
            <li> It fits 98% of my lipsticks (the ones from Victoria&#x27;s Secret just barely fit). I absolutely love this. It took about a month to ship, but with free shipping I didn&#x27;t expect it overnight. It actually came a bit earlier than expected. It&#x27;s great quality, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> This is great! It fits perfectly on my makeup vanity/desk, all my lipsticks and glosses fit. Will definitely be ordering a couple more for my nail polish and other little things.</li>
            <li> This is such an affordable lipstick holder.  It also doesn&#x27;t overwhelm your space. It is perfect for organzing and displaying your lipsticks.  Also two or three line up together nicely</li>
            <li> Product only hold tubes of lipstick. I purchased it to hold nail polish slots to small.</li>
            <li> It was broken :( other than that I loved it, the quality, the price &amp; everything about it is 5 out of 5.</li>
            <li> After waiting 3 weeks for it to come in the mail, it was cracked and broken when I received it.</li>
            <li> The lipstick organizer would have been more useful if it was bigger, it didn&#x27;t fit all my lipsticks and it took a while to come. So I would recommend a bigger organizer.</li>
            <li> It came exactly on time but when I open the package the bottom seemed like it was dropped because it was broken. Other than that it is wonderful and fits all lipsticks except the oval shaped ones. But for it&#x27;s price it is totally worth it!!!</li>
            <li> Weird questions for an acrylic box but...my wife loves these, it was just enough room for her lipsticks</li>
            <li> None of my nail polishes fit. The compartments were too small. The word nail polish should be taken off the description of the product.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected</li>
            <li> Came broken, all the way from china, the packaing was very poor, not worth sending back for refund</li>
            <li> The questions do not apply to the product. The nail polish case does not confirm to modern nail polish bottles that are out now. Disappointed it should be labeled as a lipstick case.</li>
            <li> This is just what I was looking for and arrived in perfect condition minus a couple of scratches that when filled up you can&#x27;t even see. This fits lip sticks/chap sticks and most lip glosses perfectly. I have one lip gloss that I have in it that is about the width and length of a pen and it is loose and doesn&#x27;t fit that great as it is too skinny and long but it still stays in as long as I don&#x27;t bump it.</li>
            <li> Love this item ... The size really worked for me and it fits different kinds of  regular size lipsticks ... I love it .. I will repurchase this item ... You can&#x27;t say No to the price ... I really recommend this lipstick stand...</li>
            <li> Little disappointed... It was broken in the back, not noticeable when I put lipsticks in, but probably could have been prevented if it came in a box instead of a bag...</li>
            <li> This lip holder is perfect for all my lip products. It fits pretty much everything! I didn&#x27;t have much lip products, but since getting this I have filled it up üòÑ</li>
            <li> Fast shipping; was not broken :)</li>
            <li> The pillow design and width is very good.  The stuffing is too soft.  Fortunately, it has zipped fill slits.  I added a 1 inch sheet of foam cushion to the top and bottom then putting the original stuffing in between them and it very good, now.</li>
            <li> It helps keep my lipsticks organized</li>
            <li> The corner was broken when I received it.</li>
            <li> shippig was fast but it arrived broken with a crack in it and a chip of one of the squares</li>
            <li> Love my lipstick holder! Keeps me organized</li>
            <li> Love it...it fits my Mac lipsticks good!!</li>
            <li> awesome fits lipsticks just like you see in makeup collection videos on youtube and its hella cheap also iknow the shipping sucks because it takes FOREVER but its free and the product is tremendous quality for the price imma be buying like 10 more i only ordered one at first to scope it out lol</li>
            <li> Love this lipstick stand! Great for holding all of my favorites! :)</li>
            <li> Shipping took forever! Worth the wait. although, recieved cracked from the front and broken from the side works perfectly for me! Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I will be buying another one of these things soon.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for holding lipsticks.&lt;br /&gt;Took a while to get to me but it comes from China...so makes sense.</li>
            <li> ITEM WAS BROKEN WHEN i RECEIVED IT :/</li>
            <li> This product is a very small it doesn&#x27;t fit any of my nail polishes but, it does hold a lot of my lipsticks and lip stains. I ordered two of them and only one broke. But I managed to put the pieces together but, it was still disappointing. I recommend trying other products before getting this one. It&#x27;s not so great and it very fragile.</li>
            <li> Way to small can&#x27;t even put a nail polish bottle in it, it&#x27; might fit a qutip..</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to be as small. I went to grab the package and it sounded like there were little beads hitting the plastic. I open it up to a ripped box and found pieces of plastic in the bag. For some reason, something must&#x27;ve happened and broke part of the lipstick holder.... Horrible impression.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. I bought it for my sensanail gel nail polishes. They don&#x27;t fit. Was able to fit few mascaras and aye pencils.</li>
            <li> It didnt come cracked but then someone kicked it while walking by (right after i opened it) and one of the divider pieces cracked. Just be gentle and it&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> What a deal! For $3 I managed to fit in all my MAC lipsticks:)</li>
            <li> Questions asked do not apply to product, asks easy to apply, how many times applied - this is just the holder. However does not hold nail polish as stated in the description - gave it away</li>
            <li> Great for organizing my lipstick collection</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product. I use it for my lipsticks. They hold strong. I bought 2 of them. I clue them together.  They loOK great!...</li>
            <li> Came in the mail broken not worth my money for a broken item</li>
            <li> I am a stickler for organization and this purchase looks great and organizes my lipsticks and lip glosses perfectly. I have other clear organizers on my vanity that this matches</li>
            <li> These questions are odd. This is a lipstick holder, not a cosmetic. It works great and was cheap.</li>
            <li> It is very well made and got it sooner than expected</li>
            <li> Ordered this to hold lip balm tubes and it works perfectly! They are a little loose, but it appears to be a great way to display small numbers of lip balms in a clean/professional way. And the price is right!</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a little bigger but it&#x27;s fine I still love it. Fits all of my lipsticks and lip glosses perfectly.</li>
            <li> Love it for my organization skills :)</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly but I&#x27;m amazed it made it in one piece. The packaging was awful. There was no real protection. It comes in a fitted very thin cardboard cover and that was vacuumed sealed into a regular envelope. The smallest bump could&#x27;ve left it cracked and crumbled.</li>
            <li> I received it broken.</li>
            <li> This crappery is teeny tiny. Smaller than teeny tiny. Doesn&#x27;t even fit a little Essie nail polish. Steer clear, yo.</li>
            <li> all my lipsticks fit good i love it grate way to organize my lipsticks will be buying another one .</li>
            <li> This item came cracked and damaged when I received it. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> My stand came in good shape and does the job.</li>
            <li> they are okay, it is kind of big, takes a lot of room in your vanity but it fit most of my lipstick (mac, Revlon,) the square ones don&#x27;t (nars, loreal,maybelline)&lt;br /&gt;if you are looking for something that holds all your lipstick circle and squares this is not for you, but if you only have cylinder this would help</li>
            <li> Mine came slightly cracked or would give 5 stars. But it still keeps my lipstick ready to find, which I always struggle with because I use so many colors. Nail polish doesn&#x27;t fit into the squares though</li>
            <li> I purchased 3 of these and they do their job. They hold lots of different brands from drugstore to high end. The quality is ok, a couple of them came chipped on the bottom. Bottom line...Would I buy these again? yes!</li>
            <li> Took about 2 weeks or so but its worth the wait! Came in great condition! I will be ordering another one soon!!! :)</li>
            <li> Perfect! It does exactly what it was made for. What more can u ask for?!</li>
            <li> Helped me organized my Favorite MAC lipsticks!  Came Early.</li>
            <li> Garbage! Not big enough for anything. Lipstick only</li>
            <li> When I got it it had a crack in it. I wanted it for lipstick, so it worked, but the holes would definitely not hold normal sized nail polishes. Since I didn&#x27;t pay much for it, it&#x27;s okay, but not the most well made product.</li>
            <li> Fits several of my lipsticks.... not only for MAC product!  The shipping time is long but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2WXSHCCFUZZPB]]I absolutely love the lipstick holder. I purchased 2 of these holders.  They truly help with organizing my vanity.  They hold various sized lipsticks, but it can be tricky with larger lipsticks. The extra big size lipsticks won&#x27;t fit in the holder.  But it seems like it will hold most lipstick cases.  I love that I don&#x27;t have to search all over my vanity for my lipsticks.</li>
            <li> Super cheap material. And mine came in broken from 3 different places. But I guess you get what you paid for. Just spend the little extra money on something higher quality, even if it did come intact any little drop or some sort of harsh movement would of broken t with out a doubt. It feels very cheap.</li>
            <li> RECIEVE BROKEN FROM THE SIDE.</li>
            <li> What can i say this product is not expensive so it is something at an affordable price to place your lipsticks in. My mac lipsticks fit perfectly my kat von d ones fit a little tight but on the back ones it fit good. Over all all my lipsticks fit so i love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really small (can of soda for comparison). I thinks it&#x27;s a good thing because it&#x27;s better for storage, this is definitely not a nail polish case as it is small. I like the product but a bad quality for a good price. Sadly, mine came broken but it&#x27;s not that big of a deal.</li>
            <li> Love this stand.  Perfect start for organizing! Ordered multiple quantities to use.  Use product for lipstick,  makeup brushes, and etc.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, unbeatable price, great customer service, and great product!&lt;br /&gt;Holds 98% of my lipsticks! Only had a couple random brands that didn&#x27;t fit, ie. Victoria&#x27;s Secret and one other I can&#x27;t think of. Will be ordering more :)</li>
            <li> It came with two broken squares on the side</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!  This does not hold nail polish jars.. It may hold eye pencils but not as it is advertised.. Bummer!  :(</li>
            <li> Great product, great price. Might buy more!</li>
            <li> Wish I ordered an extra!</li>
            <li> Great lipstick holder some lipsticks fit a little to snug but most fit just fine</li>
            <li> Item was shipped quickly; I was pleased with the product. All my lipstick fit nicely.</li>
            <li> Very nice. Organized all my lipglosses and lipsticks. I threw out old stuff because, honestly, who needs more than 28 lip colors? Now I can clearly see what I have, instead of making unnecessary repeat lip color purchases add I&#x27;ve done in the past.</li>
            <li> Great little make up organizer, perfect for lipsticks and certain types of nail polish. I love mine and I&#x27;m going to be purchasing another very soon! I love it and I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I really loved it really great product</li>
            <li> It was what I was wanting...love it  Thanks</li>
            <li> Small and simple, perfect for organizing lipsticks and lip glosses.</li>
            <li> I use this for nail polish it fits my Art Deco nail stripers, Julep polish, Hard Candy&#x27;s round bottles, revlon nail art polishes amazing value works great</li>
            <li> When opened the box actuallty though that it was going to be a big lipstick organizer. Very small. It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Love these I purchased two!</li>
            <li> It came broken from one coner</li>
            <li> Not what i expected its more for lipstick and the small design nail polish and its way smaller .. but i like it to keep my lipstick in one place</li>
            <li> It was great because I ordered the one that holds 24 and it came in the Mail broken 3 weeks after I bought itn</li>
            <li> I love this! I can&#x27;t believe it was so cheap! Shipping was fast and the product is outstanding</li>
            <li> These are perfect I even got two just for my baby lips.. Most of which come in sets of 6 so I was able to put three sets in each.</li>
            <li> Hate it so much it said it was a nail polish holder but not even my striper nail polishes fitüëé</li>
            <li> this is very nice but i wanted this for nail polish but it only fits skinny nail polish so its mostly for lipsticks and mascara bottles and other cosmetics and i dint look at the size its only five inches :o</li>
            <li> Too small for nail polish asked them to return it they said it would cost more than its worth to ship it back</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of them, and I love them! The only issue I have is that one was broken when it arrived in the mail, which was too bad. Other than that, great product, great price, just, better packaging would be appreciated.</li>
            <li> As shown in picture. I like it but it had a little chip in it in the back when I received it in the mail. No biggy. My lipsticks fit perfectly</li>
            <li> I really love this I used it to hold some of my nail polish</li>
            <li> Product is smaller than it appears. And is in very poor condition!</li>
            <li> arrived in about 3 weeks and it is great for storing various products and currently mine has mac lipsticks, they&#x27;re real mascara, baby skin, and elf lip scrub. an assortment of products fit in here and urs great for the price</li>
            <li> Hole sizes are for skinny bottles of polish</li>
            <li> Shipping takes too long! But love the product.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality items!</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved this :) very convenient price !!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and it fits my lipsticks and body oil bottles. I will order another.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s was broken when I receive it in the mail I was up set put didn&#x27;t want to return it cause it took long to get here and if I would of return it. It would of take in longer</li>
            <li> Horrible horrible don&#x27;t buy please!!!! Not what it&#x27;s day toooo small</li>
            <li> We ordered this two separate times and both times they were cracked. My daughter is still able to use them, but it is disappointing to pay for something that is broken when it arrives.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> i received this broken. :-(</li>
            <li> I had purchased these from an other seller and the we&#x27;re great! These came all the way from Hong Kong in an envelope broken and cracked. If you can find a better seller their excellent. You can fit mac ,nars and Maybelline lipsticks. Good product bad seller.</li>
            <li> This is just perfect. I&#x27;ve filled it up so will need to buy another soon from the seller such a good price and came safetly wrapped.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it. It is still empty. No let downs so far. I think the changing levels is very useful.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price!</li>
            <li> Only 3 stars because its a great set up for my lipsticks but when I got them in the mail, on the side was already broken. Very plastic. But it still works good.</li>
            <li> They were much smaller than expected. I could barely fit anything in the holes.</li>
            <li> Its sooo small, there is no way you can fit nail polish in this organizer! False advertisement! I&#x27;m sending mine back!</li>
            <li> Finally received my product after 3 1/2 weeks. I like it a lot and it fits all my lipsticks.</li>
            <li> Good product,i&#x27;m buying more,great price</li>
            <li> I would have given more stars but unforuntetly due to poor packaging this product cane broken! I can still use it but was bummed! The slots are slightly smaller then imagened but fit my lippies perfectly!</li>
            <li> IT is a organizer so i am not sure about some of the questions but it holds my lipsticks the one i have placed in there already comfortably and a couple of my lip pencils and brushes it has a nice compact feel to it and it does not take up too much space  so it is working out real well asi was looking for something to get my lipsticks and brushes out of drawers and into a easily reachable within eye view place, so this very handy and useful. the price point was right although i had a to wait for it  to be shipped from china.</li>
            <li> It does the job. I was a little disappointed that there were small cracks but I can&#x27;t complain when its really cheap. Overall I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I mean it&#x27;s alittle small but it would be good for your lipsticks ‚ù§Ô∏è</li>
            <li> It took a while to get here but got here a little earlier than expected. Smaller than the advertisement made it seem also. Overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with the storage ability of this product but was hoping for something more like it was originally advertised as. A &amp;#34;nail polish storage rack&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I like them but was under the assumption that they were larger in size.</li>
            <li> This is so small I do not have ANY nail polishes or lipsticks that will even fit in here.  The image is deceiving it is tiny tiny crap.</li>
            <li> Love it. I have alot of MAC lipsticks and i jus had them laying in my drawer but this make it so easy and neat to see what is what. Its very small thought so i wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for anything bigger than a MAC bullet size lipstick</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick holder. I have ordered two and will order more as my collection grows &amp;#62;.&amp;#60;</li>
            <li> Very small, this product is not as advertised, it will not even fit a standard bottle of nail polish in it, this product was a complete waist of money.</li>
            <li> Perfect for someone as unorganized as myself.</li>
            <li> It came cracked, but I still love it haha</li>
            <li> Arrived completely broken and seller did nothing. Cheaply made, super thin material. Not worth the price or the wait to receive them.</li>
            <li> Just perfect ! Exactly how it looks . Just remember it&#x27;s not some big lipstick holder but it is a accurate size for inexpensive  lipstick to expensive ! Just not able to hold lipsticks that are too wide . Perfect for make up gurus and had it over a year and it looks as good as new !!</li>
            <li> Wanted a nice cheap present for my wife for Christmas. This product sounded like what she needed to organize her nail polish. What I received was thin plastic, broken on the corners, and too small for all but her fine brushed, small bottles.  Not quite what I thought I was getting.</li>
            <li> So useful. Only fits the square lipsticks and small circle ones and chapsticks.</li>
            <li> i hate it, it is too slow, i have been waiting for 1 month!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This tookawhile to come in, and it came cracked, but it&#x27;s useable.</li>
            <li> 1 of them was broken when I got it. I don&#x27;t mind because it still holds my stuff. The material is really cheap so you have to be extra careful</li>
            <li> Listed for lipstick and nail polish, however slots are much too small for the average size bottle of nail polish.</li>
            <li> This was a little smaller than I thought as it is just big enough to hold lipstick or mascara.  Good packaging and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Although it came with piece broken off,it arrived very fast and I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> So disappointed it came completely broken !!!!</li>
            <li> Will definitely be getting another one. Fits different brands of lipstick, and it&#x27;s extremely useful with decluttering.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for anything to hold your nail polish, DO NOT GET THIS. I wanted something to hold my OPI nail polish so I could see all my colors and it was so small not even the minis would fit in the compartments. Also, when it arrived the plastic was chipped on one corner, and it was cracked down the backside. Overall, bad quality and not at all what it advertises. I should have checked the dimensions, yes, but the quality of the product when it arrived was terrible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waited so long for this package. When it finally came today I open it to find it&#x27;s broken!! What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Product arrived faster than the expected shipping date and will fit most lipsticks but I don&#x27;t expect it to hold any nailpolish except for the Julep brand and any other square-shaped nailpolish bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I purchased this product as a gift for a friend to hold her collection of lipsticks. I was disappointed in the packaging, as it was housed in flimsy cardboard that covered the surfaces of the product (did not have any padding whatsoever). I shook the package before opening it and I could hear pieces of plastic rolling around. Product had several chips upon opening - nothing major. I can&#x27;t really complain though, as the product was fairly cheap and shipping was free. Just a little embarrassed to give someone a present that is broken.</li>
            <li> It says that it&#x27;s a lipstick/nail polish case. However it does not hold nail polish bottles. Not sure what I&#x27;ll use this for, because i don&#x27;t have that many tubes of lipstick.</li>
            <li> When i first got this i was a little disappointed because it is A LOT smaller than i thought it would be, I put the lipsticks that i want to try or haven&#x27;t used much in it so that i know i didn&#x27;t waste money on them and it&#x27;s definitely working. I&#x27;m actually pretty happy with it now and thinking of buying another.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Exactly what I wanted for my lipstick collection!</li>
            <li> Pretty small.  ,two QTIPS long.&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s pretty nice for the price üëè</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clear organizer for all of my lipsticks. It makes it so much easier to find the color I want.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping great material packed safely would buy again</li>
            <li> Many reviews complained about this product being too small for their lipstick tubes.  I have not had that problem at all.  It fits all tubes I own perfectly without trying to force them into the container.  These include square maybelline tubes, clinique makeup, mac cosmetics, and NYX lipsticks.  Although this is perfect for all lipsticks and lipstain, it will likely not fit any nail polish bottles, so I would not buy it for that purpose.</li>
            <li> Holds my lipstick but not my nail polish. Still very helpful.</li>
            <li> Item works well for holding various items.</li>
            <li> Item received just as described and shipping dates were right on the money! Would buy again and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The slots are too small to hold my Essential oils</li>
            <li> I have several of these.  I use two for lipsticks, one for mascara and eyeliner, and one for eyeshadow sticks.  These things really gave me my dresser back.</li>
            <li> sooooo in love with this! as soon as I received my first one I immediately orderd a second &amp; now I&#x27;m going to get a third! fits all my lipsticks/gloss perfectly! (variety of different brands) fast shipping &amp; packaged nicely. I have a large makeup collection &amp; only have 3 spots left so I will be ordering again for sure! highly recommend this to anyone looking for a lipstick holder!</li>
            <li> Says it will hold nail polish, wont even hold my mini nail polishes. I bought this for my nail polishes. Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> The product came in a timely manner but was not as described on line. It says it holds lipstick and nail polish. It does hold most lipsticks but holds NO NAIL POLISHISH that I own. Most nail polish bottles are not the size of a lipstick holder. So if you wish to use this for polish as I did it DOES NOT work.&lt;br /&gt;Also I could return it but it was not recommended as it would costs more than it is worth. Therefore I am stuck with an item I cannot use!&lt;br /&gt;The description needs to specify the size of the holes so you can tell if it will hold the item you wish to use it for.</li>
            <li> Nail polishes dont even fit its only for lipsticks smh false advertisment</li>
            <li> The product serves its purpose. The acrylic was a little cloudy and scratched but nothing unexpected for the price. I would order again and again. I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> My growing collection of lipsticks are filling up this great product nicely! A lot of my lip glosses fit well, too. Packing was great and shipping quicker than expected. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Great way to organize lipsticks - I like how they are raised by row - makes it easy to see.</li>
            <li> I received this yesterday and was a bit disappointed, only because I was under the impression it would hold nail polishes... It does, but only of a certain size. It came before the estimated delivery date and is over all a great buy. It fits lipsticks and other item just fine. Also, its a bit sharp around the edges....so don&#x27;t leave it around kids!</li>
            <li> It was okay, much smaller than expected and can&#x27;t hold any nail Polish but it came in good timing and looks good</li>
            <li> This is extremely small but exactly PERFECT for my 5 year old and her chapsticks!</li>
            <li> I thought the squares would be larger.  It is ok for lipstick and such, but not anything larger.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for my makeup table.  It is small, but still holds a number of lipsticks and glosses and looks really nice!  You can leave this out and it helps with your organization.  Very nice quality and really worth the money.  I am going to be buying more as I have too many lip products.</li>
            <li> Was kind of skeptical at first due to mixed reviews. But over all I&#x27;m very pleased. Shipping will take long considering it&#x27;s coming from China but I got mine not 1 but TWO weeks early! So happy about that. The only down side is there was a little crack but nothing too bad. It&#x27;s like an internal crack so it&#x27;s okay. Overall I&#x27;m really please and will be ordering 2 more since I own 64 lipsticks.</li>
            <li> FInally...enough slots!  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This lipstick organizer is exactly what I was expecting. Super light, thin plastic that hasn&#x27;t broke on me yet after owning it for over 6 months now.  So far it fits all of my favorite lip products like YSL&#x27;s Sheer Candy balms (which are in a larger-than-normal sized metal tube, to give you an idea on how large the slots are). I purchased this lipstick organizer at a great price here on Amazon, and I would recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> Was small and wanted to return didn&#x27;t get money back</li>
            <li> Finger nail polish bottles will not fit into hole, no matter what shape or size the bottle is</li>
            <li> This holds my lipsticks beautifully. I was expecting it to be a little bigger but it&#x27;s the perfect size for display. My came with a littke crack on the top, which really bothered me but it&#x27;s not a big deal. Overall good product I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I give the product 5 stars, however, one was broken.</li>
            <li> Fits all my MAC lipsticks and most of my sephora... some of them are too large but they somewhat fit. Very nice.</li>
            <li> I have since bought more because they are the perfect addition to my vanity, showcases my lipsticks very well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Very small I thought It would&#x27;ve been bigger that&#x27;s y I gave it two stars but it&#x27;s still a good product</li>
            <li> This is PERFECT for holding my lipsticks. It&#x27;s the cheapest lipstick holder I&#x27;ve found and although it&#x27;s a thinner plastic than others that doesn&#x27;t bother me. I already own two and just bought a third. They get the job done and I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> The product is how it is pictured and described. However, both of the items that I ordered arrived broken. They were extremely poorly packaged. Due to the price being so cheap I am just going to glue them back together but I wouldn&#x27;t order these from this company if I were you.</li>
            <li> Just perfect for JULEP nail polish bottles AND the LA COLOR ART DECO; Art pens!</li>
            <li> product arrived timely and will serve its intended purpose</li>
            <li> I have a billion lip products. It&#x27;s a problem. And an even bigger problem was that they were all stashed in a bowl and I forgot that most of them existed so I never used them. So wasteful. I ordered this and it&#x27;s perfect - it lives on my nightstand and every time I&#x27;m getting ready to go out, I can see all my options. It looks nicer and helps me use all my products. Win-win.</li>
            <li> Good product. Would be better if plastic was a little thicker</li>
            <li> I use this to organize  my lipstick. I loved it so much I ordered  more for Christmas  gifts. Excellent  product  if you have a lot of lipsticks. I also use it to put my lip pencils and lip gloss.</li>
            <li> One of mine came chipped with a chunk missing out of it.</li>
            <li> It was very tiny . It shows nail posh would fit. But or doesn&#x27;t thought would be much bigger then it was</li>
            <li> It was everything I expected.</li>
            <li> It took FOREVER to arrive and one of the 2 I bought was cracked.</li>
            <li> The plastic isn&#x27;t super awesome super strong material but it isn&#x27;t flimsy plastic that bends or chips easily. I LOVE IT! My lipsticks look so cute now :)</li>
            <li> Arrived with pieces broken off of it.  Will not hold the normal sized polish bottles but does hold lipsticks well.</li>
            <li> The organizer holds a lot of lip products (24) but my bigger square lipsticks don&#x27;t fit. It&#x27;s not as thick as my other acrylic lip holder so it actually arrived damaged. Customer service was great about it but they are out of stock so they issued a refund. This is rated 3 stars because it was thinner acrylic than I was expecting, it arrived broken and it didn&#x27;t fit my square lipsticks. Get this if we have lots of little glosses and round lipsticks but they openings are not big enough for quite a few of mine.</li>
            <li> This is a good holder for the price but be aware it only holds very slender nail polish bottles or lipstick. It is good quality but I gave it 3 stars because it does not let the consumer know they are small slots. The description needs more detail.</li>
            <li> I have zero patience so the only thing that bothered me was how long it took. But I love the product!! I immediately started putting my makeup and such in it. One downside: it does not fit nail polish. (Unless they&#x27;re upside down.) overall, I&#x27;m really happy!!</li>
            <li> took a little time but good buy</li>
            <li> Great organization of my lipsticks, liners, and glosses. I keep all my shades in their separate rows so I know exactly where to go for a particular look. Easy.</li>
            <li> Organized lipsticks and small make up just right</li>
            <li> lipstick fit really nice in this (:</li>
            <li> I loved it!super small and easily to fit it in my vanity table, took almost 3 weeks to get it but for  can&#x27;t beat the price!!</li>
            <li> I use mine for lip sticks and lip pencils. It fits perfectly on my dresser and helps me see all my colors so I know what I am working with.</li>
            <li> This works well for keeping flavors or e-liquid bottles organized. I found most 10ml or less fits nicely. Also one can have multiple of tanks, 306&#x27;s, RDA, RTA and clearomizers in one place. Most eGo style batteries fit too. I could put my Vamo v5 in a slot, but it&#x27;s a snug fit. It&#x27;s still too new and shiny for any place snug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this so much I bought two and all the slots are filled mostly with flavorings to make e-liquid.</li>
            <li> The partitions are not big enough for a lot of nail polish containers and the sections do not have removable slots so you could insert something bigger. But for the price not bad.......I store some of my essential oils in it, though the fatter ones I have to store upside down. However, it is inexpensive.</li>
            <li> The compartments are a little smaller than what I expected.  The plastic is thin and cheap.</li>
            <li> Arrived broken and in shards; plastic is of cheap quality. Packaging was also destroyed.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my sister. She says that bottles of nail polish will not fit in it, even though it clearly states in the title that it was made for lipstick AND nail polish.</li>
            <li> Item arrived at my house cracked and broken. This item was for my daughter who waited some time to receive it.&lt;br /&gt;She was upset when it arrived in the shape it was.</li>
            <li> I bought one n loved it so i ordered 3 more:)</li>
            <li> got it broken cannot fit polish in it unless it small bottle very disapointed</li>
            <li> Hi, my product was very little And my cosm√©tics don&#x27;t fit plus was damaged for the mail, is useless.</li>
            <li> I received this item and the package was smushed &amp; the product inside was chipped/cracked about a inch worth of plastic missing. Since the crack is on the bottom of the product it still works fine. When standing up on my desk you can&#x27;t even see it. Otherwise, the product works great.</li>
            <li> It actually was really nice ...but I came cracked</li>
            <li> When I brought this item, the description was &amp;#34;L-Zone Clear Cosmetic Stand 24 Lipstick Organizer Nail Polish Makeup Case Display Rack Holder &amp;#34; (copied and pasted directly from my order history). Maybe it was my fault that I didn&#x27;t read other reviews and check out how small this was. I saw &amp;#34;Nail Polish&amp;#34; and thought it will fit nail polish. The cubes are so small not even kids size nail polish fits. I don&#x27;t have enough lipsticks for this, so I guess it will just become one of the items I don&#x27;t throw out but will be using it for two lipsticks...</li>
            <li> As pictured. Clear. Holds 24 regular size lipsticks.(4x6) beautiful. Came without a scratch or broken. However, shipping was unfortunately bad but its understandable and I don&#x27;t mind waiting.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved it! I received my item whole/complete and not broken. I definitely will be ordering this again soon.</li>
            <li> Smaller then I imagined not all my lipstick for so I had to replace with some thinner lip glosses. It feels very plasticy and I feel like it can crack/break at any moment.</li>
            <li> Came chipped but good for the price.</li>
            <li> I loved it. Just large enough to hold all the lipsticks I needed to clean up the area &amp; made everything much easier to get to.</li>
            <li> Wanted a nail caddy and got lipstick caddy. Not happy.</li>
            <li> Perfect size and great way to display and store my lipsticks</li>
            <li> I already purchased like 6 love them</li>
            <li> Keeps all my lipsticks organized</li>
            <li> Great product. I received it a bit late but when i have the chance I will try to reorder again . I might need more off this.</li>
            <li> Great quality! Great Price. No complaints. As a makeup artist these acrylic holders can be a bit pricey but I love them !</li>
            <li> I love this cosmetic stand. I use it to organize my lipsticks and lipglosses. I also use them to organize mascara and anything else that will fit into the holes. It makes is so much easier to find my items when they are nicely organized and visible. I at first purchased one of these and loved it so much that I bought two more. I highly recommend this item!</li>
            <li> This definitely does the job it is intended to do, my lipsticks stay put all day long, unless I remove them. I like that it is tiered so that I can see all my lipsticks without having to dig around for them. If you are looking for an acrylic lipstick holder you may be disappointed in this one though because it is a thinner, more flimsy (in comparison to acrylic) plastic.</li>
            <li> Perfect for lipstick and lipstick only.</li>
            <li> Shipping took over a month however it was just what I needed</li>
            <li> This took Over A month to come and had a small crack in it. But I like it .</li>
            <li> mostly fits the purpose, mac lipstick fit however a few bigger ones from maybelline for example dont fit. as far as quality it is very poorly made and it is shipped in a very thin plastic.</li>
            <li> I really like this little lipstick organizer!  It is small enough to keep on my bathroom counter top.  It holds most of my lipsticks with no problem, all except one that is in a very large lipstick case.  It makes such a difference to be able to see all the lipsticks and the names of the colors at one time instead of looking through a dark drawer.  This is very handy and doesn&#x27;t compete with any colors or designs in my bathroom.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is advertised as a nail polish holder. Nail polish will not fit in it the slots. If you want something for lipstick it will work but not for nail polish.</li>
            <li> This is a handy inexpensive organizer and it fits my lip glosses. The problem is the garbage packing job they did before shipping it. A plastic item like this should be padded or protected somehow. Nope, they placed it in a thin plastic mailer and shipped it out. So it arrived with a crack in it. It&#x27;s still usable but it&#x27;s a shame they put no effort in packaging the item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely handy and my lipsticks fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Fast shipping great condition it was just  as described just what I was looking for ! I&#x27;m definitely ordering another one because not all my lipsticks fit on this one</li>
            <li> Would have given the product 5 stars, but I received it broken. :( I like that it holds many lipsticks and that it&#x27;s clear. I have a photo I just don&#x27;t know how to upload it.</li>
            <li> No complaints here. Holds a variety of my lipsticks.  I&#x27;m definitely ordering a few more..no cracks or nicks. Makes well for presentation and also organization</li>
            <li> Looks just like the picture or perphas even better. Fast delivery and very nice packaged. Will come back to buy more.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for my Bare Minerals lip gloss &amp;#34; collection &amp;#34; I can see every color I&#x27;ve got. I&#x27;m not rummaging through a drawer or make up bag. It actually looks pretty sitting out in the bathroom and makes it easy to grab your color and run out the door!</li>
            <li> No stars should be an option. Received it broken. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Great material, fits perfectly in my bathroom mirror cabinet! Great for organizing lipsticks and not having them falling out of the mirror cabinet all the time! Great purchase!</li>
            <li> cute addition to my make up collection! love the price, takes away from the long wait.</li>
            <li> Cute lipstick holder ! Very compact in size so it won&#x27;t take up much space on your vanity ! Great Price ! I&#x27;ll be ordering more of these for myself and friends soon !</li>
            <li> It was sufficient. It had many scratches but I suppose I do not mind too much Bc it&#x27;s just to hold my lipsticks. I bought two and they fit all my lipsticks.</li>
            <li> There was dust inside it and on the very left there was a crack</li>
            <li> This item does not hold any of my nail polish no matter what size. It only holds lipstick, you need to change the info</li>
            <li> Both clear cosmetic stands were  cracked, but I kept them because  it such a drag to send back.not ever buying these again at least from&lt;br /&gt;this buyer.</li>
