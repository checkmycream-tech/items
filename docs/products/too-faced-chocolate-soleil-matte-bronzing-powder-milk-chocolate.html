            <li>I love that this isn&#x27;t shimmery</li>
            <li>so I love the matte aspect as well.</li>
            <li>I love this , I do not like my face in the sun</li>
            <li>My favorite bronzer, and</li>
            <li>I love this bronzer.</li>
            <li>I love that it is matt, no shimmer...</li>
            <li>But maybe it works better for people with darker skin than mine.</li>
            <li>I recently started contouring and it works great!</li>
            <li>Love this, smells fantastic, not orangey and shimmery!</li>
            <li>Love that it is matte.</li>
            <li>Love the smell..</li>
            <li>/&gt;you will LOVE this product</li>
            <li>this is definitely the best one i have bought</li>
            <li>This is my favorite bronzer.</li>
            <li>I love this bronzer.  </li>
            <li>Lovely stuff.</li>
            <li>its matte with no sparkles like most bronzers &amp; you can apply it in layers to fit any skin tone ....</li>
            <li>I bought other pressed powders to contour with but this works best.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and stays nice and fresh looking for hours.</li>
            <li>A lot of people have posted how much the love the smell, but I honestly think it smells kinda salty like Play-Dough</li>
            <li>so I tried this .. fantastic without drying</li>
            <li>The powder seems light</li>
            <li>I thought it would be way too light</li>
            <li>but it is a light color for a bronzer.  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice bronzer for fair skinned people like myself, but it&#x27;s not orange or dark to work with, blending with help for more natural looks</li>
            <li>so I totally recommend if you are fair skinned or lightly tanned.</li>
            <li>So, you may have to use multiple layers if you are darker than a fair skin tone.</li>
            <li>and I am blonde and quite fair.  </li>
            <li>cuz i love it SO MUCH,</li>
            <li>Sometimes I lightly brush it over my entire face if I&#x27;m not wearing foundation because it does cover up and gives a nice finish.</li>
            <li>The powder actually tastes sweet and smells nice.</li>
            <li>If you use a nice big fluffy brush this goes on nice and light, and you can add contour to your face by putting it on with a more compact brush in the areas where you want to add definition, like around the jaw, under cheekbones and around temples.</li>
            <li>It works well for contouring and gives a more natural look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s by far my favorite and will repurchase it.  </li>
            <li>Most every other bronzer I have used has some kind of sparkle or shimmer to it, and that does not create a very natural look.</li>
            <li>shipping was SUPER fast.. came within almost 5 days of me buying it..</li>
            <li>I am blonde hair and very light skinned..</li>
            <li>This is the first bronzer I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>I do not want any more of this product or any further charges.</li>
            <li>when i first opened the compact</li>
            <li>first bronzer</li>
            <li>I only give it a 4 out of 5 because I think I like benefits hoola bronzer better.</li>
            <li>It works exactly the way it should.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really recommend this.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this!</li>
            <li>Only gave it four stars because I would prefer this to be fragrance free.</li>
            <li>&amp; i didnt know because the one i normally buy is much darker than this one was...</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY suggest this for ones who are looking to have a :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells like chocolate initially when I first apply this.</li>
            <li>so it looks natural.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m enjoying this product as much as others do judging by other reviews I&#x27;ve read prior to making a purchase.</li>
            <li>I use it over my foundation for a general tan look.</li>

            <li> I honestly do not like this as much anymore.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> and so I generally put a few strokes on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Not sure the chocolate smell enhances it for me, but it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Very subtle contouring for my skin because it is very close to my skin tone.</li>
            <li> For some odd reason a few hours later my cheeks are covered in this unnatural looking layer of make up.</li>
            <li> and my face is extremely oily</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too dark or &amp;#34;muddy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I was nervous to purchase a bronzer online and not have it in my hands before purchasing it where I could compare on how dark it would be on my skin as if I would do in a drug store..</li>
            <li> i think i have ever used that does not look too dark and does not make me look glossy/shiney in photo&#x27;s because it is matte and no gold shimmer.  </li>
            <li> It is very expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> If you get a little dust up your nose you swear you can taste the chocolate..</li>
            <li> After a few months of using it I noticed that it would oxidize a LOT after a couple hours after applying.</li>
            <li> It honestly looked awful.</li>
            <li> and it is not easily over-done as some bronzers are.</li>
            <li> The chocolate smell is actually a little annoying - smells sorta good and sorta bad.</li>
            <li> Not sure how else to describe it.</li>
            <li> aside of that its how I feel about this bronzer, i am obsessed with the smell it makes me want to keep re applying it.</li>

            <li> I love that this isn&#x27;t shimmery and my face is extremely oily so I love the matte aspect as well. It is a delight to smell every time I do my makeup. I also use this for contouring since it&#x27;s not shimmery.</li>
            <li> Very nice product.  Smells like chocolate and goes on like velvet.  I will continue to use this product.  Great for contouring.</li>
            <li> I love this , I do not like my face in the sun so I tried this .. fantastic without drying</li>
            <li> I have been using Too Faced chocolate Soleil for years now. The best bronzing powder ever. I use it over my foundation for a general tan look. Smells amazing! It is very expensive but worth it. It is easy to apply with any brush, has a nice mirror inside, and a beautiful compact case. Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> My favorite bronzer ever!!! Will never use another brand- love the chocolatey smell too!!</li>
            <li> GREAT bronzer, no shimmer so it looks natural.  Looks great with or without a tan.  My favorite bronzer, and I&#x27;ve tried A LOT of them.</li>
            <li> I love this bronzer. It&#x27;s perfect for contouring the face. It&#x27;s not too dark or &amp;#34;muddy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase</li>
            <li> This bronzer is NOT orange. It is very light, unless you are fair. So, you may have to use multiple layers if you are darker than a fair skin tone.</li>
            <li> Very subtle contouring for my skin because it is very close to my skin tone. Sometimes I lightly brush it over my entire face if I&#x27;m not wearing foundation because it does cover up and gives a nice finish. I love that it is matt, no shimmer... I don&#x27;t see why a contouring product should have shimmer in it anyway. The powder actually tastes sweet and smells nice. I&#x27;m going to try the sun bunny too because I&#x27;d like a darker shade.</li>
            <li> 8-11-15 Update on product!  I honestly do not like this as much anymore. I bought it when I started practicing contouring. (A beauty channel on YouTube recommended it.) After a few months of using it I noticed that it would oxidize a LOT after a couple hours after applying. It left my skin (the areas where I contoured) looking orange. It honestly looked awful. I need a lighter shade. But I think this is the lightest. I don&#x27;t really recommend this. But maybe it works better for people with darker skin than mine. ************************************************************  This is the first bronzer I have ever purchased. I recently started contouring and it works great! I bought other pressed powders to contour with but this works best. Its matte so it doesn&#x27;t leave you skin shimmery. Which is great for if you have oily skin. It works well for contouring and gives a more natural look. This is good for people with somewhat light skin.  A lot of people have posted how much the love the smell, but I honestly think it smells kinda salty like Play-Dough haha. But thats not a problem at all. I HIGHLY recommend this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m enjoying this product as much as others do judging by other reviews I&#x27;ve read prior to making a purchase. The powder seems light and so I generally put a few strokes on my cheeks. For some odd reason a few hours later my cheeks are covered in this unnatural looking layer of make up. Not sure how else to describe it. Either my skin type is not working well with this powder or this powder is not of the quality everyone thinks it is.&lt;br /&gt;For comparison, I have been using Estee Lauder bronzing powder for years and never once did I notice a similar issue. Goes on smoothly and stays nice and fresh looking for hours.</li>
            <li> I do not want any more of this product or any further charges. Thank you. Brenda Lindes</li>
            <li> This delicious smelling bronzer is perfect for those of us who are not looking for a noticeable, orange glow.  It adds just a hint of a sun-touched bronze and it is not easily over-done as some bronzers are.</li>
            <li> Love this, smells fantastic, not orangey and shimmery! Perfect! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 5 out of 5...This is a very nice bronzer for fair skinned people like myself, but it&#x27;s not orange or dark to work with, blending with help for more natural looks so I totally recommend if you are fair skinned or lightly tanned.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely bronzer for those with fair skin. Not orangey at all. Love that it is matte. Smells like chocolate initially when I first apply this. Only gave it four stars because I would prefer this to be fragrance free.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.. love the cover .. love the look!!! I am blonde hair and very light skinned.. I was nervous to purchase a bronzer online and not have it in my hands before purchasing it where I could compare on how dark it would be on my skin as if I would do in a drug store.. but I was very happy with this item.. shipping was SUPER fast.. came within almost 5 days of me buying it.. 5 star seller as well.. priority shipping included without even purchasing it!!!! The smell of this bronzer is great as well.. I use coca butter lip balm .. the one that looks like a glue stick and I re-apply it almost every 2 minutes... aside of that its how I feel about this bronzer, i am obsessed with the smell it makes me want to keep re applying it. Aside of the smell  I HIGHLY suggest this for ones who are looking to have a :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-NATURAL LOOK&lt;br /&gt;-GLOW&lt;br /&gt;-FOR WOMEN WITH BLONDE HAIR AND LIGHT/FIAR SKIN APPROVED&lt;br /&gt;-SMELLING AMAZING&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you will LOVE this product</li>
            <li> when i first opened the compact I thought it would be way too light just looking at it and I am blonde and quite fair.  but it actually is perfect on me, first bronzer i think i have ever used that does not look too dark and does not make me look glossy/shiney in photo&#x27;s because it is matte and no gold shimmer.  this is definitely the best one i have bought</li>
            <li> ive always bought this bronzer cuz i love it SO MUCH, its matte with no sparkles like most bronzers &amp; you can apply it in layers to fit any skin tone .... but i guess they make it in different shades &amp; i didnt know because the one i normally buy is much darker than this one was... oh well</li>
            <li> This is my favorite bronzer. Most every other bronzer I have used has some kind of sparkle or shimmer to it, and that does not create a very natural look. The matte finish is nice. If you use a nice big fluffy brush this goes on nice and light, and you can add contour to your face by putting it on with a more compact brush in the areas where you want to add definition, like around the jaw, under cheekbones and around temples.

            <li> Color is too orange but it is a light color for a bronzer.  The chocolate smell is actually a little annoying - smells sorta good and sorta bad.</li>
            <li> Love this bronzer, smells great and is a matte finish which I love. I only give it a 4 out of 5 because I think I like benefits hoola bronzer better.</li>
            <li> I love this bronzer.  It&#x27;s by far my favorite and will repurchase it.  It works exactly the way it should.  It&#x27;s matte, no shimmer at all, which is great.  It&#x27;s not to brown and not orange at all and it&#x27;s smells wonderful.  Just like cocoa.  If you get a little dust up your nose you swear you can taste the chocolate.. Lovely stuff.</li>
