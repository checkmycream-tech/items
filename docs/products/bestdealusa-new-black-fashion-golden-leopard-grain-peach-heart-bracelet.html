            <li>but if you just want something fun and cute than buy it and don&#x27;t give a</li>
            <li>and I enjoy wearing</li>

            <li>I am quite excited to give this to my daughter as a gift.</li>
            <li>A gift for someone special</li>
            <li>I was getting ready for church and decided to wear this bracelet and it wouldn&#x27;t fit around my around wrist..</li>
            <li>The material is not what i expected but is good.</li>
            <li>Def worth what i paid</li>
            <li>It was worth the amount that I paid for it.  </li>
            <li>It is fun and feminine.</li>
            <li>I recieved it pretty quick after placing my order.  </li>
            <li>The price is right</li>
            <li>right they twist on your wrist</li>
            <li>Its really pretty when you get it in the mail.</li>
            <li>I was able to fix it easily enough</li>
            <li>A lot like plastic, but what can you expect, right?&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cute, but the material was a lot different than I thought it was going to be.</li>
            <li>It was beautiful but it was a little big!</li>
            <li>luckily I have tiny wrists and it fits just right.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>The quality of the bracelet is not made very well.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>When i received this bracelet one of the charms fell off and caused the whole bracelet to break it couldn&#x27;t be fixed.</li>
            <li>so I only buy from sites that offer free or very low prices.</li>
            <li>Cute little bracelet !</li>
            <li>Looks a little cheap..like Dime store merchandise..but it is easy to wear.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thin and the charms are placed appropriately !</li>
            <li>I was surprised when my package came in 8 days before it was supposed to.</li>
            <li>cute little bracelet a little tighter than my others also unique little bows if not put on</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very lightweight and fits my average wrist.</li>
            <li>Very delicate and rusts easily.</li>

            <li> Hi To whom it may concern Its not that I hate this item this item is not for an aldut it do not fit around my wrist.  Is this item for a little girl?  Then it should be with the childen items.I was getting ready for church and decided to wear this bracelet and it wouldn&#x27;t fit around my around wrist..</li>
            <li> When i received this bracelet one of the charms fell off and caused the whole bracelet to break it couldn&#x27;t be fixed.</li>
            <li> I love it!! It is beautiful....super nice!!! however, as soon as put it on one of the hearts fell off!! I was able to paste back, so I&#x27;ll keep just because it is beautiful!</li>

            <li> Cute little bracelet ! I love it ! It&#x27;s been a year or so that I bought it ! Hasn&#x27;t broke yet and hoping of course it won&#x27;t ! Hehe:-)</li>

            <li> Very delicate and rusts easily. Metal smell makes me nauseous</li>
            <li> It was beautiful but it was a little big! Wish there was an adjustable latch. But it looked similar to the picture.</li>
            <li> Item was a gift and m cousin loved it No problems what so ever :)  wish you guys could sell more like this.</li>
            <li> Cute bracelet, but you get what you pay for. This has to be the cheapest bracelet on the planet. If I could, I would give it no stars.</li>
            <li> It arrived a lot faster then i expected. The material is not what i expected but is good. It is made very poorly and all the charms look cheap. It is very light and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Very pretty charm bracelet! Fits great.. looks great my only problem ive had is that to fasten it you put the bar throw the circle and when i would put on a coat it sometimes would fall off.</li>
            <li> I was well pleased with this bracelet. Its really pretty when you get it in the mail. It looks better in person then it did on my computer.  I will buy more from this company.  kg</li>
            <li> Ok, yes it&#x27;s an inexpensive bracelet.It&#x27;s not supposed to be luxury quality. I&#x27;m rating it for what it is. It&#x27;s cute. Up close, yes it looks it&#x27;s price but if you just want something fun and cute than buy it and don&#x27;t give a **** what others think. It looks great next to my rose gold tone watch and it doesn&#x27;t make too much noise. It&#x27;s very lightweight and fits my average wrist.You can always hang it on a hanbag or keychain if you don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Very cute! The price is right and I enjoy wearing this makes a great gift Have A Great Day All!</li>

            <li> she really liked it it looks like what you see on there site and she so into cheetcha stuff and the price was great I said I would never buy on line and I was wrong I have found so many nice things at great prices the only thing I have learned is to watch out for the shipping cost that was a big eye opener so I only buy from sites that offer free or very low prices.</li>
            <li> These bracelets are for no one over the age of 3. DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!!!!! I REPEAT DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM!!!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift. I recieved it pretty quick after placing my order.  The quality of the bracelet is not made very well.</li>
            <li> I received this item in a timely manner but when I took a really good like at it the leopard print heart has scratches on it and a diamond was missing on another. definitely would not recommend the item. I know its cheap but its not like its free.</li>
            <li> I had to wait almost a month and a half before I even got it. And when I finally got it in the mail it was already broken on one of the heart charms. I wore it to dinner and two charms fell off. Then out to the car another popped off. I could find better jewlery at Claires in the mall. Bad quality and honestly too expensive for this braclet. TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE!!!!! Do not buy!</li>
            <li> I loved this bracelet i received it today and i fell in love its so beautiful i really loved it ordering more for my family :)</li>

            <li> Item looks very cheap. Was not too satisfied with it and i hardly wear it. Don&#x27;t really recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Upon receiving this item, it was already broken. All the charms were off of it. Only one or two were on there. I really love it and was excited to wear it.</li>
            <li> The bracelet is adorable and I wear it a lot, but it is not well made.  In fact, when I received it, it was broken upon opening it.  I was able to fix it easily enough and I do like it, just not the most well made bracelet.</li>
            <li> Just something to wear with jeans not high dollar but really cute to wear around casually .  Def worth what i paid</li>
            <li> This says nothing online you have to see it in person I gave it to my niece as a gift.</li>
            <li> I love this bracelet,and could not remember where I had purchased it.  It was worth the amount that I paid for it.  It is well made, even though the charms are not of a super quality, it is really pretty to wear, and I get many compliments when I wear it!</li>
            <li> A gift for someone special and she loves it</li>

            <li> A lot like plastic, but what can you expect, right?&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cute, but the material was a lot different than I thought it was going to be.</li>
            <li> Looks a little cheap..like Dime store merchandise..but it is easy to wear. The gold fades on it..and does not look like it would hold up</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT WAS NOT FOR ME I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE IT WAS NOT FOR ME NEVER AGAIN</li>
            <li> I love this bracelet. It is fun and feminine. The charms are dainty but you can still make out what the charms are. However, this bracelet is very small like child size luckily I have tiny wrists and it fits just right.</li>
