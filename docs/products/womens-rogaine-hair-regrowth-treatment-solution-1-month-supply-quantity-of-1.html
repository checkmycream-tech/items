            <li> what a mess! I&#x27;d just rather wear a wig than mess with all this stuff...</li>
            <li> Its going slow after using this last bottle i probably  want get it again they say you should see results  in three months maybe its not for me by me been menopause how do you think th he foam is</li>
            <li> I got a lot of new hair growth from the first bottle.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it was going great, a couple of weeks I started to see baby hairs growing which surprised me and my hair didn;t fall out as often.</li>
            <li> Women Rogaine really helped my hair growth. Now I&#x27;m able to get my hair braided.I&#x27;m feeling like a new person.</li>
            <li> ehh dont waste your money. On the box it basically tells you that you will be buying 4 more boxes before you even see results and for the price thats not happeneing. I&#x27;ve gotten 3&amp;#34; of growth just from taking biotin. Still on a hunt for a product to make my hair thicker.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say this product dried out my hair amd scalp  and gave me head sores due to the dryness.  Guess not all products will work on everyone same</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. The product did not work for me</li>
            <li> I does work on my balding spots for months at a time.  Only need one bottle a year for good results.</li>
            <li> Was not what I thought</li>
            <li> helps stop shedding all over the head.</li>
            <li> Nervous about using it.</li>
            <li> It truly works! I seen new growth and thickness in my problem areas! If you do what the directions say you should see results like I did!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect after reading the reviews.  Some people swore it was wonderful and others said it was awful or worse, useless.  I took a chance as the part in my hair keeps getting wider.  Most embarrassing.  I have used it for 3 weeks now, applying twice a day as directed, styling my hair normally, and I do seem to be having success.  I see tiny little fuzlets growing.  I color my hair.  It does not alter the color.  The fuzz is coming in my natural color.  The directions warn that it does that.  The liquid does run, so be sure to tilt your head back.  I tilt my head back and apply along the hairline, let gravity do the rest. The dropper lets you apply as much as you wish to wherever you need it.  The only drawback I had was no in-depth directions, and all my questions were not answered in the pamphlet that comes in the box.  For me, it&#x27;s working. Yay!</li>
            <li> I have always taken pride in my hair. I am a natural blond and at 80 the grey in my hair looks like highlights. So  it was disturbing to see my scalp showing through on t.he front of my scalp and even more in the back. After 2 1/2 months of Rogaine THe front of my scalp is much improved but the back has a ways to go.  I will continue with application. on the whole I am pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> like it rogain in general is good</li>
            <li> Would buy from again. No problems. I really don&#x27;t know what else to say. If you want to keep your hair get this product.</li>
