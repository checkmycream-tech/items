            <li>Love this!!</li>
            <li>I was grossed out in a good way.</li>
            <li>This is good.  </li>
            <li>Well I guess 6 months is good when you think about it.</li>
            <li>but this one is by far the best!</li>
            <li>Feels great... gets rid of dry skin... great to use before self tanners</li>
            <li>One of my favorite things, I had no idea</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>it made my spray tan more even.</li>
            <li>I love that it lifts your hair before shaving and gives you a close shave.</li>
            <li>This is good, at first I thought it was doing nothing</li>
            <li>but I can easily get 6-8 months out of one of these.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been a loyal MicrodermaMitt customer since!</li>
            <li>and my skin is SMOOTH again after FIFTEEN YEARS of giving up.</li>
            <li>It does smooth the skin, makes it feel silky.</li>
            <li>A true must-have.</li>
            <li>Not only will your body be nice and soft, but you will condition your skin and any body product you use will soak in nicely.</li>
            <li>Used as directed, it does a great job of removing dead skin cells from the body.  </li>
            <li>how much dead skin I had until this mitt helped me wash it off, lol.</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t even paying attention to the difference in the appearence of my skin because i was already excited about how much softer my skin felt even after just one use.</li>
            <li>Return right away.</li>
            <li>Used faithfully and thoroughly, it will help reduce callous formation on the feet, keeping the heels and feet, in general, looking more well-groomed.</li>
            <li>This REALLY works!  </li>
            <li>first stumbled onto this MicrodermaMitt by accident.</li>
            <li>I got bright red stretch marks on my inner thighs when i gained some weight about 15 years ago.</li>
            <li>My skin feels super soft.</li>
            <li>They say to use it just wet without any products, but I like it better with my body wash.</li>
            <li>My daughter is very selective in the products that she uses for her daughter.  </li>
            <li>You get A LOT of dead skin if you soak yourself in a hot bath for 5 mins or more.</li>
            <li>It is very fine and needs little effort.</li>
            <li>This is GREAT, GREAT, GREAT -- body exfoliation is a big deal to me; I have used my fingernails in the past because scrubs leave me cold, but that leaves temporary red marks, and this mitt gets the superficial dead skin effortlessly.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t realize how expensive they were until today but worth it for sure!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live with out and will buy another.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels more polished--great for the summer:)&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing long-term results, especially on the rough spots like elbows and heels.</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve ever NOT had bumps on the back of my arms!</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft after using it in the shower--</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to know that they use during every bath time because it helps.</li>
            <li>I was amazed how much it sloughed off the first few times I used it.</li>
            <li>I figured that if losing weight didnt make them go away completely, I was doomed to have streaky, rippled skin on my inner thighs forever.</li>
            <li>Seriously, my skin has never been so soft, and clean.</li>
            <li>and then the dead skin rolls right off.</li>
            <li>I really could&#x27;ve just used a rough piece of fabric to achieve the same results.</li>
            <li>To make things even better, i had a few small scars from burns from a curling iron incident (ouchies).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> Only needs water to help dry skin roll off leg, feet and arms.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll feel like a snake molting its dead skin, replacing it with baby soft, years younger skin underneath!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use this a couple of times per week in the shower as per the instructions (on damp skin without soap) and it does a superb job of exfoliating the nasty little red bumps off my arms.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all - expensive and cheap, prescription strength, department store brand, and drug store brands.</li>
            <li> I totally look forward to using it every other day.</li>
            <li> But I learne\nd that you need to be NOT soaking wet and the mitt has to be well wrung out</li>
            <li> I totally just wasted money.</li>
            <li> I only used it a few times but have not found it to be that benefitial.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that wasn&#x27;t to rough.  </li>
            <li> It took all the dead skin cells off my back and knees.  </li>
            <li> The burn scars have also SIGINIFICANTLY decreased in appeareace so much that i am hopeful that they, too, will be a thing of the past for me</li>
            <li> This mitt is average.</li>
            <li> this mitt beats every scrub, salt, exfoliating brush, and treatment on the market - hands down.</li>
            <li> I had a spray tan that started to wear down uneven and one use</li>
            <li> Sadly it didn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> recommended to me - it&#x27;s a little pricey,, but performs as claimed.  </li>
            <li> and I had wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> But after a couple of weeks i randomly looked at my inner thighs (an idea my eyes tend to avoid) and the stretch marks are GONE</li>
            <li> Had hard time keeping this mitt on my hand, and I felt like it just didn&#x27;t do the job as well as skin brushes and the mesh scrubbers/exfoliations.</li>
            <li> seriously could not be happier with this mitt.</li>
            <li> Bad purchase.</li>
            <li> I hate when that happens.</li>

            <li> This mitt does a great job of exfoliating my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my mitt for a couple of months.  Used as directed, it does a great job of removing dead skin cells from the body.  My legs were always flaky and dry-looking.  My skin is smoother and no longer as flaky as it was.  Used faithfully and thoroughly, it will help reduce callous formation on the feet, keeping the heels and feet, in general, looking more well-groomed.</li>
            <li> I got bright red stretch marks on my inner thighs when i gained some weight about 15 years ago. 5 years ago I lost a lot of that weight and the lines turned from red to white, and my skin had a rippled texture in that area. I figured that if losing weight didnt make them go away completely, I was doomed to have streaky, rippled skin on my inner thighs forever. To make things even better, i had a few small scars from burns from a curling iron incident (ouchies).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t even paying attention to the difference in the appearence of my skin because i was already excited about how much softer my skin felt even after just one use. But after a couple of weeks i randomly looked at my inner thighs (an idea my eyes tend to avoid) and the stretch marks are GONE and my skin is SMOOTH again after FIFTEEN YEARS of giving up. The burn scars have also SIGINIFICANTLY decreased in appeareace so much that i am hopeful that they, too, will be a thing of the past for me soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I seriously could not be happier with this mitt. It feels like imperfections all over my body are smoothing away every time i use it  A true must-have.</li>
            <li> This is good, at first I thought it was doing nothing and I had wasted my money.  But I learne\nd that you need to be NOT soaking wet and the mitt has to be well wrung out and then the dead skin rolls right off.</li>
            <li> Aw man...I totally just wasted money. I hate when that happens. I really could&#x27;ve just used a rough piece of fabric to achieve the same results. Bummer. My KP totally laughed at this mitt. :(</li>
            <li> This is not the wonder exfoliate that I thought it would be. I only used it a few times but have not found it to be that benefitial.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different brands of the korean mitts that do the same thing but this one is by far the best! It is very fine and needs little effort. You get A LOT of dead skin if you soak yourself in a hot bath for 5 mins or more. I was grossed out in a good way.</li>
            <li> This mitt is average. I definitely prefer larger body buffers/scrubbers. Had hard time keeping this mitt on my hand, and I felt like it just didn&#x27;t do the job as well as skin brushes and the mesh scrubbers/exfoliations.</li>
            <li> This did not work at all. Could not exfoliate at all. Do not buy this. Bad purchase. Return right away.</li>
            <li> This is an essential tool for keeping my keratosis pilaris at bay.  I use this a couple of times per week in the shower as per the instructions (on damp skin without soap) and it does a superb job of exfoliating the nasty little red bumps off my arms.  The instructions say to replace every three months but I can easily get 6-8 months out of one of these.</li>
            <li> This thing works. My skin feels so soft after using it in the shower--like I used Dove moisture soap or something. I didn&#x27;t know skin could feel like that with no moisturizers. I was amazed how much it sloughed off the first few times I used it. I totally look forward to using it every other day.</li>
            <li> This is good.  It does smooth the skin, makes it feel silky. They say to use it just wet without any products, but I like it better with my body wash.</li>
            <li> recommended to me - it&#x27;s a little pricey,, but performs as claimed.  I will never again use the standard bath &amp;#34;scrubby&amp;#34;.  Only needs water to help dry skin roll off leg, feet and arms.  Skin feel stimulated after using.</li>
            <li> Love this!! One of my favorite things, I had no idea how much dead skin I had until this mitt helped me wash it off, lol. Seriously, my skin has never been so soft, and clean. I dont even use soap on arms, legs etc, just scrub with this mitt. Its the best.</li>
            <li> I use this once weekly after I&#x27;ve showered...I wait just a minute, scrub all over then rinse off. Invigorating and efective</li>
            <li> Feels great... gets rid of dry skin... great to use before self tanners</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve ever NOT had bumps on the back of my arms! Love it.  Will try the acne mitt too.</li>
            <li> This REALLY works!  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Loved it! I had a spray tan that started to wear down uneven and one use it made my spray tan more even. My skin feels super soft.</li>
            <li> this mitt beats every scrub, salt, exfoliating brush, and treatment on the market - hands down. Period. I&#x27;ve tried them all - expensive and cheap, prescription strength, department store brand, and drug store brands. This mitt annihilates them all. Just follow the simple directions and you&#x27;ll be amazed at the skin that&#x27;s revealed! You&#x27;ll feel like a snake molting its dead skin, replacing it with baby soft, years younger skin underneath!&lt;br /&gt;I first stumbled onto this MicrodermaMitt by accident. It came as a sample in a pack of beauty products I received from Birchbox one month. I tried it in the shower one day and I&#x27;ve been a loyal MicrodermaMitt customer since! I even use the one for your face!</li>
            <li> This is GREAT, GREAT, GREAT -- body exfoliation is a big deal to me; I have used my fingernails in the past because scrubs leave me cold, but that leaves temporary red marks, and this mitt gets the superficial dead skin effortlessly.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 2 yo granddaughter who has KP.  I wanted something that wasn&#x27;t to rough.  My daughter is very selective in the products that she uses for her daughter.  I was pleasantly surprised to know that they use during every bath time because it helps.</li>
            <li> I got this as a birthday gift from my mother. Though it was not something I would of bought myself once I used it I loved it! It took all the dead skin cells off my back and knees.  I love that it lifts your hair before shaving and gives you a close shave. Sadly it didn&#x27;t last too long. Well I guess 6 months is good when you think about it. Can&#x27;t live with out and will buy another. Didn&#x27;t realize how expensive they were until today but worth it for sure!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product! It smoothes out the skin and can be used with or  without soap, but try it after you let your body stand in the steam, then use it with whatever soap or shower gel.  Not only will your body be nice and soft, but you will condition your skin and any body product you use will soak in nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice, but I can tell it definitely works! My skin looks and feels more polished--great for the summer:)&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing long-term results, especially on the rough spots like elbows and heels.</li>
