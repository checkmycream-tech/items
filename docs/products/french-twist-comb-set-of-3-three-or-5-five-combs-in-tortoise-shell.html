            <li>They are nice.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m going to do with 3 combs, but I guess it&#x27;s nice to have a backup.</li>

            <li>I was happy to find them on Amazon and quickly bought them.  </li>
            <li>Good quality product, perfect for french twist.</li>
            <li>so maybe this is good for medium to fine</li>
            <li>They are smooth with a good tortoiseshell brown color.  </li>
            <li>Some people may not know how to use, a picture might be nice with ad on website, then you would sell more</li>

            <li>Great for french twist,  well made great quality.</li>
            <li>I love the combs - it makes putting my shoulder length hair up so easy!  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also very comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>So I was pleased to find 3 are shipped together as 1 item.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s better for her than for me.</li>
            <li>This is a much better solution.</li>
            <li>At $5/each, they should be better quality.</li>
            <li>And it hurts even more when I try to use it as a hairpin.</li>
            <li>I would have been better served going to the dollar store,</li>
            <li>Perfect for a french twist with my medium length hair.</li>
            <li>lOVE</li>
            <li>It looks elegant--</li>
            <li>Okay?</li>
            <li>Fabulous!  </li>
            <li>They work OK as decorative side combs, but that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li>Keeps the hair nice and secure.</li>
            <li>I love them.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>These are perfect for women who have long, curly hair.</li>
            <li>- I was so excited!.  </li>
            <li>Nothing works as well and as easily as this comb.</li>
            <li>Does not break easily.  </li>
            <li>Is is an easy way to hold my hair up off of my neck and keep it out of my face.</li>
            <li>Would have given this for stars if it did not break easily.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to know that these are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>This comb is perfect for keeping my hair up without weighing it down with lots of pins and clips.  </li>
            <li>But it slips out of my fine hair and not-long-enough hair.  </li>
            <li>I purchased these and the hold my fine hair up.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that is below shoulder length.  </li>
            <li>quick updo anytime!</li>
            <li>I made the purchase and the combs were a huge hit.  </li>
            <li>Came before I expected them which made it all the more great.  </li>
            <li>Huge combs.  </li>
            <li>The combs are smoothly finished with no snags.</li>
            <li>I have no idea how to make a French Twist with these combs but they are great for just twisting my hair up and stuffing it in.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy them and they keep my hair neatly in place.</li>
            <li>It did take a few times to figure out the best way to insert the comb, but once I did</li>
            <li>I ordered these online because I can&#x27;t find the right ones for my hair anywhere!</li>
            <li>Many thanks</li>
            <li>The combs are a wonderful accessory for thick hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to others who have thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li>I would admire other women who have what looks like a high pony tail but would fall like a cascading waterfall evenly dispersed to conceal whatever it was holding it all together so perfectly.</li>
            <li>It does take some practice if you are new to twisting.:-)</li>
            <li>First time ever!</li>
            <li>the comb did a great job firmly holding my hair in place.</li>
            <li>All in all, I don&#x27;t think it was worth the $.</li>
            <li>I was looking for sturdy, economical combs that I can decorate myself.  </li>
            <li>These are ok French Twist combs, but nothing special.</li>
            <li>This falls right out.  </li>
            <li>Also, there was something about the curvature of them that was too severe or something because I couldn&#x27;t get it to stay in quite right.</li>
            <li>I use these combs daily for a French twist and they hold beautifully.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good, had to use a nail file to sand some sharp edges off, but you can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
            <li>Strong and holds my thick long hair wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I was happy to have found these combs since I lost my last comb and couldn&#x27;t find a replacement in any of my local stores.</li>
            <li>Strong and classy looking.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps a smaller lighter version would work better for my needs.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with these French Combs.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Your reviews need to be smaller as I have nothing more to say.</li>
            <li>I had one of these french twist combs that I bought from Hawaii many years ago.</li>
            <li>Nearly exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>but this one is exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>But I can&#x27;t find exactly what I want.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve been able to get back in the groove to use these.</li>
            <li>These are exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I love these, they are such a nicer way to put my hair up than in a pony tail.</li>
            <li>Pretty combs.</li>
            <li>The combs on the other hand though beautiful, are very fragile, It would not hold my hair up.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine but kind of thick.</li>
            <li>In short, works great while in your hair, but be careful about where you store it.</li>
            <li>I WASN&#x27;T ABLE TO FIND IN ANY STORES AFTER MY OLDER ONE FINALLY BROKE</li>
            <li>The comb&#x27;s teeth aren&#x27;t going to easily break which is a necessary feature.</li>
            <li>They are simlpe, pure but hign quality.</li>
            <li>lol They aren&#x27;t really sharp but they are pointed and LONG.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why a good clip like this is so hard to find.</li>
            <li>I have been using these 3 combs for over a month and they have not broken.</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s so much of it</li>
            <li>It worked really well as I like to use it as a hairpin to hold up my hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold my hair in place w/o causing too much pain.</li>
            <li>I have had these before and was at a loss when they were used so much they broke.  </li>
            <li>but I expected better than five uses per comb before they broke.  </li>
            <li>The reason I did not give the product a 5 was really because the tines need to be filed/sanded off along the sides where they come out of the mold or are cut apart</li>
            <li>They hold very well.</li>
            <li>Just one comb holds all my hair very well.  </li>
            <li>The com is very sturdy and does not bend or break.</li>
            <li>Very disapointing.</li>
            <li>The prongs didn&#x27;t feel very sturdy, like one could snap pretty easily, and the tips of them were sharp and scratched my head.</li>
            <li>I really liked these combs for a quick and easy french twist however it is too bad the teeth break out easily.  </li>
            <li>I have very heavy hair, these combs stay in nicely.  </li>
            <li>I have straight, soft hair.  </li>
            <li>The normal ones don&#x27;t go through all of my hair.</li>
            <li>I have past my shoulder length hair that is very fine.</li>
            <li>Works great, holds the hair in place but the teeth seem to be a little tight.  </li>
            <li>The old one I had was missing too many teeth.  </li>
            <li>the plastic is more flexible than ones i have had in the past...  but held my hair , which is not thick...</li>
            <li>I have chemical free type 4A hair and would recommend this product to other natural curlies.</li>
            <li>Instead, the first one I tried, broke the second time I used it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these French twist combs for years but first time buying on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>Also the teeth are nice and long to hold my heavy hair.</li>
            <li>You may have to add a few hairpins but is fine.</li>
            <li>but a little cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I have waist-long, naturally curly hair, and am always looking for combs and other hair holding devices that fasten well and quickly and won&#x27;t tear out or break my hair.</li>
            <li>It takes about 5 seconds to twist my hair up into a style that looks classy and holds all day.  </li>
            <li>But the thickness is not a sturdy as my old ones.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so the price seems a little high, but it was worth it.  </li>
            <li>I have thick hair but still, if you hold them at the right angle they slide right into place.</li>
            <li>I very much prefer these over the jaw clips that stick out &amp; poke into the back of your head when you sit in the car or back against anything.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure these combs would work well with fine straighter hair, but maybe.</li>
            <li>It is a shame they are not more durable because the size and curve made them east  to use and comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>They were exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>None of the stores in my area sell these single, large combs.  </li>
            <li>The combs are easy to put in my thick hair and they stay in all day without sliding out.  </li>
            <li>I am able to keep my long thick hair up in a French twist easily with a few minutes of practice.</li>
            <li>You can make the bun/twist starting high or low for a tighter or looser look.</li>
            <li>decently finished, long enough to go under a bun, but not up to the task of holding my hair up.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Update 4 weeks later:  I gave my combs to a friend who has lovely thick long hair.</li>
            <li>This simple design still puzzles me as to how it is able to hold my thick, long hair in place until I remove the comb.</li>
            <li>My hair did start to fall down a little after about an hour of rock climbing, but it was still holding better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I have long hair - No other pins are needed.</li>

            <li> Came before I expected them which made it all the more great.  </li>
            <li> Huge combs.  </li>
            <li> The combs are smoothly finished with no snags.</li>
            <li> I have no idea how to make a French Twist with these combs but they are great for just twisting my hair up and stuffing it in.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy them and they keep my hair neatly in place.</li>
            <li> It did take a few times to figure out the best way to insert the comb, but once I did</li>
            <li> I ordered these online because I can&#x27;t find the right ones for my hair anywhere!</li>
            <li> Many thanks</li>
            <li> The combs are a wonderful accessory for thick hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to others who have thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I would admire other women who have what looks like a high pony tail but would fall like a cascading waterfall evenly dispersed to conceal whatever it was holding it all together so perfectly.</li>
            <li> It does take some practice if you are new to twisting.:-)</li>
            <li> First time ever!</li>
            <li> the comb did a great job firmly holding my hair in place.</li>
            <li> All in all, I don&#x27;t think it was worth the $.</li>
            <li> I was looking for sturdy, economical combs that I can decorate myself.  </li>
            <li> These are ok French Twist combs, but nothing special.</li>
            <li> This falls right out.  </li>
            <li> Also, there was something about the curvature of them that was too severe or something because I couldn&#x27;t get it to stay in quite right.</li>
            <li> I use these combs daily for a French twist and they hold beautifully.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good, had to use a nail file to sand some sharp edges off, but you can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
            <li> Strong and holds my thick long hair wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I was happy to have found these combs since I lost my last comb and couldn&#x27;t find a replacement in any of my local stores.</li>
            <li> Strong and classy looking.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps a smaller lighter version would work better for my needs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with these French Combs.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Your reviews need to be smaller as I have nothing more to say.</li>
            <li> I had one of these french twist combs that I bought from Hawaii many years ago.</li>
            <li> Nearly exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> but this one is exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> But I can&#x27;t find exactly what I want.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been able to get back in the groove to use these.</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I love these, they are such a nicer way to put my hair up than in a pony tail.</li>
            <li> Pretty combs.</li>
            <li> The combs on the other hand though beautiful, are very fragile, It would not hold my hair up.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine but kind of thick.</li>
            <li> In short, works great while in your hair, but be careful about where you store it.</li>
            <li> I WASN&#x27;T ABLE TO FIND IN ANY STORES AFTER MY OLDER ONE FINALLY BROKE</li>
            <li> The comb&#x27;s teeth aren&#x27;t going to easily break which is a necessary feature.</li>
            <li> They are simlpe, pure but hign quality.</li>
            <li> lol They aren&#x27;t really sharp but they are pointed and LONG.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why a good clip like this is so hard to find.</li>
            <li> I have been using these 3 combs for over a month and they have not broken.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s so much of it</li>
            <li> It worked really well as I like to use it as a hairpin to hold up my hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold my hair in place w/o causing too much pain.</li>
            <li> I have had these before and was at a loss when they were used so much they broke.  </li>
            <li> but I expected better than five uses per comb before they broke.  </li>
            <li> The reason I did not give the product a 5 was really because the tines need to be filed/sanded off along the sides where they come out of the mold or are cut apart</li>
            <li> They hold very well.</li>
            <li> Just one comb holds all my hair very well.  </li>
            <li> The com is very sturdy and does not bend or break.</li>
            <li> Very disapointing.</li>
            <li> The prongs didn&#x27;t feel very sturdy, like one could snap pretty easily, and the tips of them were sharp and scratched my head.</li>
            <li> I really liked these combs for a quick and easy french twist however it is too bad the teeth break out easily.  </li>
            <li> I have very heavy hair, these combs stay in nicely.  </li>
            <li> I have straight, soft hair.  </li>
            <li> The normal ones don&#x27;t go through all of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have past my shoulder length hair that is very fine.</li>
            <li> Works great, holds the hair in place but the teeth seem to be a little tight.  </li>
            <li> The old one I had was missing too many teeth.  </li>
            <li> the plastic is more flexible than ones i have had in the past...  but held my hair , which is not thick...</li>
            <li> I have chemical free type 4A hair and would recommend this product to other natural curlies.</li>
            <li> Instead, the first one I tried, broke the second time I used it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these French twist combs for years but first time buying on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> Also the teeth are nice and long to hold my heavy hair.</li>
            <li> You may have to add a few hairpins but is fine.</li>
            <li> but a little cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I have waist-long, naturally curly hair, and am always looking for combs and other hair holding devices that fasten well and quickly and won&#x27;t tear out or break my hair.</li>
            <li> It takes about 5 seconds to twist my hair up into a style that looks classy and holds all day.  </li>
            <li> But the thickness is not a sturdy as my old ones.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so the price seems a little high, but it was worth it.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair but still, if you hold them at the right angle they slide right into place.</li>
            <li> I very much prefer these over the jaw clips that stick out &amp; poke into the back of your head when you sit in the car or back against anything.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure these combs would work well with fine straighter hair, but maybe.</li>
            <li> It is a shame they are not more durable because the size and curve made them east  to use and comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> They were exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> None of the stores in my area sell these single, large combs.  </li>
            <li> The combs are easy to put in my thick hair and they stay in all day without sliding out.  </li>
            <li> I am able to keep my long thick hair up in a French twist easily with a few minutes of practice.</li>
            <li> You can make the bun/twist starting high or low for a tighter or looser look.</li>
            <li> decently finished, long enough to go under a bun, but not up to the task of holding my hair up.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Update 4 weeks later:  I gave my combs to a friend who has lovely thick long hair.</li>
            <li> This simple design still puzzles me as to how it is able to hold my thick, long hair in place until I remove the comb.</li>
            <li> My hair did start to fall down a little after about an hour of rock climbing, but it was still holding better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair - No other pins are needed.</li>
            <li> The combs are very sturdy and rigid, and they held my very thick, curly hair up in a twist very well all day long.</li>
            <li> I expect them to last a long time and when they finally wear out I will buy again.  </li>
            <li> You want the ends of the teeth pressed flat against the skull, that&#x27;s what holds the hair in place.</li>
            <li> Long or short hair</li>
            <li> I have long hair and have not found combs with long enough teeth in stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, but so far it hasn&#x27;t snapped or cracked.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly, unruly hair, and most of the hair things in stores are pretty much useless for me because they just won&#x27;t hold all my hair.  </li>
            <li> I make a loose bun at the back of my head and twist</li>
            <li> however I tuck it in and stays all day long.</li>
            <li> is too long</li>
            <li> I expected a solid item.</li>
            <li> Teeth are too long for using it as a side comb or anchoring a bun.</li>
            <li> She has long hair and she loves them.</li>
            <li> They really hold my thick hair well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this on Amazon - they were impossible to find in local stores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long, straight and heavy and the chignon just keeps slipping down until I give up and re-pin it.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other options for french twist including banana clips and picks, hairpins and barrettes.</li>
            <li> She has very long hair</li>
            <li> I had trouble finding a French comb in local hair accessories stores.</li>
            <li> When I first opened the package and saw how small the combs are, I thought I had wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> My only qualm is that the points are a tad sharp and poke into my scalp a bit, which is expected.  </li>
            <li> Once I knew what they were called I looked for less expensive ones but couldn&#x27;t find anything so although they seem high priced they really aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Nothing is loose, nothing falls out, I could withstand a windy day and not lose the do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m down to the last comb and am not carrying it in my purse so that it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> But it looks less refined than a french twist.  </li>
            <li> This little Comb is terrific</li>
            <li> They are comfy, pretty, subtle, and hold my hair all day without trouble.  </li>
            <li> It takes only a few seconds.</li>
            <li> These combs didn&#x27;t last but a few months in my purse.</li>
            <li> The edges of the teeth are rough and seem to damage my hair.</li>
            <li> Careful not to poke your eye out.</li>
            <li> not real sturdy..</li>
            <li> It took a few tries to remember how to twist and roll (and a trip to youtube to double check)</li>
            <li> The ends are quite sharp, so you have to be careful when putting these in your hair.  </li>
            <li> These combs are sharp at the edges and rip at your hair.  </li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with this comb, it looked lovely but the teeth broke when pushed through my hair</li>
            <li> I typically love these type of combs but was disappointed with theses.</li>
            <li> The combs are well finished, so no worries about sharp edges.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to experiment to see what other styles I can do with them.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to tuck my hair in and protect it from the harsh, dry winter air.</li>
            <li> The edges are rough not cleanly cut.</li>
            <li> Not worth it even for the inexpensive price.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked to find here what looks like exactly the same thing.</li>
            <li> hang out alongside the comb, or you could leave the tail of longer hair hanging down down from the bottom of the twist.</li>
            <li> Money down the drain.</li>
            <li> I ended up sanding the teeth down and that helped a bit.</li>
            <li> The set I received were very sharp and pulled at my hair.</li>
            <li> I found them not very strong.  </li>
            <li> I have long thick hair that I use a hair claw clip to hold up in a bun.  </li>
            <li> I have thick long hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too tight and does not rip out my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this type of comb for the past couple of years as my old ones had either been lost or broken.  </li>
            <li> These are the only combs I have found that can handle my thick and very heavy hair.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used these combs before then the fact they are not as stiff as the ones I had</li>
            <li> These combs are almost impossible to find in the store and they turn a bad hair day into a good hair day in about 2 minutes</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for and at an unbelievable price.</li>
            <li> The tines broke the first time I tried to use one. :(</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and it slides out if I don&#x27;t put the comb in while my hair is still wet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve hardly ever met anyone whose hair is as thick and heavy as mine, and these combs are working fantastically for me.  </li>
            <li> This product was hard to use.  </li>
            <li> Had a hard time finding a hair comb that would go thur</li>
            <li> These are so hard to find, I cannot find them in stores anywhere - except for flowers and embellishments glued to them.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time getting it into place.  </li>
            <li> Hard time finding combs like these in area retail shops.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the outside tines on two of the three combs have broken off - not from being in  my hair, but from being stored in my purse.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and two broke .  </li>
            <li> I do have really thick hair</li>
            <li> I do have thick hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to grow the length of my thick, course, wavy/curly hair for around two years now.</li>
            <li> Ample comb to hold thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li> returned combs since the material the combs are made out of is too slippery; kept falling out even in my thick ethnic hair</li>
            <li> I have relatively thin hair that is a couple of inches past the shoulder.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s practically impossible to find french Twist Combs in retail stores.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They are very hard to put in your hair.</li>
            <li> I found this very disappointing as I carried my last comb around in my purse for years without a problem.</li>
            <li> The length of my hair is about three inches below my shoulders and it is VERY thick.  </li>
            <li> They did not hold my very thick hair in place and the twist kept falling out.</li>
            <li> For an approximate cost of $5 each, per comb...</li>
            <li> I do have rather thin hair though and those with thicker hair might find they dont hold...</li>
            <li> Then, I discovered these combs and knew their secret.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 20 years since my hair was long,and now that it is,I was growing tired of the big,clunky hair clippies.</li>
            <li> Very subtle in the hair.</li>
            <li> These hair combs are difficult to find.  </li>
            <li> I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seems every manufactures is cutting product quality and box sizes this year.  </li>
            <li> So sad!</li>
            <li> But I was wrong!  </li>
            <li> The girl wanted one badly.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the combs because they would not hold my almost-shoulder-length hair.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product and requesting a refund.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> None of the stores in my area sell these single, large combs.  I have not been able to find in store for years!  The old one I had was missing too many teeth.  This 3 pack is great,  I can leave one at work, one at home and carry one in my purse.  I very much prefer these over the jaw clips that stick out &amp; poke into the back of your head when you sit in the car or back against anything.  I can even put a swim cap on over it!</li>
            <li> I like to wear my hair in a French twist and these combs may it a simple process. They arrived on time and in perfection condition. I also liked the fact I received three combs.</li>
            <li> I have waist-long, naturally curly hair, and am always looking for combs and other hair holding devices that fasten well and quickly and won&#x27;t tear out or break my hair. I have tried other options for french twist including banana clips and picks, hairpins and barrettes. Nothing works as well and as easily as this comb. I make a loose bun at the back of my head and twist/tuck it under and slide the comb in to hold it in place. Viola!  (that&#x27;s french y&#x27;all). It takes only a few seconds. Nothing is loose, nothing falls out, I could withstand a windy day and not lose the do. Depending on how you twist or tuck, the look can vary, but all variations have all been attractive. You can make the bun/twist starting high or low for a tighter or looser look. Sometimes, I leave the curly ends hang out alongside the comb, or you could leave the tail of longer hair hanging down down from the bottom of the twist. No hairpins needed, no bobby pins, nothing but this wonderful comb. This is my go-to updo device for daily wear.    The combs are smoothly finished with no snags. The teeth are sturdy and have not threatened to break with proper usage. . .meaning don&#x27;t force it, slide it, wiggle a bit if needed. You want the ends of the teeth pressed flat against the skull, that&#x27;s what holds the hair in place. The quality of the combs is very good.</li>
            <li> I was happy to have found these combs since I lost my last comb and couldn&#x27;t find a replacement in any of my local stores. The combs are very sturdy and rigid, and they held my very thick, curly hair up in a twist very well all day long. Unfortunately, the outside tines on two of the three combs have broken off - not from being in  my hair, but from being stored in my purse. I found this very disappointing as I carried my last comb around in my purse for years without a problem. These combs didn&#x27;t last but a few months in my purse. I&#x27;m down to the last comb and am not carrying it in my purse so that it lasts longer. In short, works great while in your hair, but be careful about where you store it.</li>
            <li> I had trouble finding a French comb in local hair accessories stores. So I was pleased to find 3 are shipped together as 1 item. I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This product was hard to use.  It broke when i put it in my hair.  Money down the drain.</li>
            <li> When I received my combs all three were chipped and had snags. It looked like they were ripped after the manufacturing process.</li>
            <li> Shared one with my granddaughter. She has very long hair and it&#x27;s better for her than for me. I do like the looks of it though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great comb - good quality.  But it slips out of my fine hair and not-long-enough hair.  Perhaps a smaller lighter version would work better for my needs.  I imagine this would be great for longer thicker hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 4 weeks later:  I gave my combs to a friend who has lovely thick long hair. She returned them to me, saying they fall out.</li>
            <li> I found them not very strong.  I have thick hair and two broke .  Thankyou for sending them.  I probably need to get stronger ones with my hair.  Delivery was good though.  Many thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with these French Combs. They are smooth with a good tortoiseshell brown color.  I got these for a friend, she loved them. I will decorate them with some beads for her.</li>
            <li> I have relatively thin hair that is a couple of inches past the shoulder. And I could not get these to stay in my hair. They kept falling off. Had to return it.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for and at an unbelievable price.</li>
            <li> Does not break easily.  I have been using these 3 combs for over a month and they have not broken.</li>
            <li> I purchased this comb from Amazon because a friend could not find one for a neice.  The girl wanted one badly.  I made the purchase and the combs were a huge hit.  I think that the tortoise shell did the trick.  In any event, I am delighted for them both.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. I wanted to tuck my hair in and protect it from the harsh, dry winter air. This holds my hair however I tuck it in and stays all day long. It&#x27;s not too tight and does not rip out my hair. I have chemical free type 4A hair and would recommend this product to other natural curlies.</li>
            <li> Had a hard time finding a hair comb that would go thur my hair and stay put, without falling out in two minutes. This comb is sturdy enough to hold my hair in place for hours.  Love it !</li>
            <li> I ordered these online because I can&#x27;t find the right ones for my hair anywhere! I was thrilled to know that these are exactly what I was looking for. They are made of flexible plastic which means the teeth won&#x27;t break like the brittle combs do. Also the teeth are nice and long to hold my heavy hair.</li>
            <li> The tines broke the first time I tried to use one. :( So sad!</li>
            <li> These are so hard to find, I cannot find them in stores anywhere - except for flowers and embellishments glued to them.  I use them all the time and am ever greatful that I found them!  A definate recommnended item!</li>
            <li> It may be the lack of my skill, but the comb just won&#x27;t stay in my hair. It also hurts my scalp when securing it.</li>
            <li> Works great, holds the hair in place but the teeth seem to be a little tight.  I have a hard time getting it into place.  It may be my hair is too long and there&#x27;s so much of it but I am going with the teeth are too close together. Once the struggle is over though, stays in place all day and hides well because there isn&#x27;t any ornamental distraction.  How often do you get three in a package nowadays? Keep one in the purse, one at home, one at the office...quick updo anytime!</li>
            <li> The combs pulls my hair when I put it in my hair. They are very hard to put in your hair.</li>
            <li> These combs are sharp at the edges and rip at your hair.  Not worth it even for the inexpensive price.  I would rather have one or two good combs.</li>
            <li> Combs arrived on time, packaged nicely, and they work.  I have long thick hair that I use a hair claw clip to hold up in a bun.  But it looks less refined than a french twist.  This is a much better solution.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and have not found combs with long enough teeth in stores. I purchased these and the hold my fine hair up.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with this comb, it looked lovely but the teeth broke when pushed through my hair ...I do have really thick hair so maybe this is good for medium to fine</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the combs because they would not hold my almost-shoulder-length hair. I&#x27;ve used this comb before until it broke, and was very happy to find it again to purchase replacements. Guess I will let my hair grow and try again.</li>
            <li> I have very heavy hair, these combs stay in nicely.  Your reviews need to be smaller as I have nothing more to say.</li>
            <li> I typically love these type of combs but was disappointed with theses. The edges of the teeth are rough and seem to damage my hair. At $5/each, they should be better quality.</li>
            <li> I had one of these french twist combs that I bought from Hawaii many years ago. It worked really well as I like to use it as a hairpin to hold up my hair. One day it snapped on me and I&#x27;ve been looking for a replacement ever since. When I saw some on Amazon, thought I give it a try. The prongs hurt when I comb my hair with it. And it hurts even more when I try to use it as a hairpin. It doesn&#x27;t hold my hair in place w/o causing too much pain. All in all, I don&#x27;t think it was worth the $.</li>
            <li> I have had these before and was at a loss when they were used so much they broke.  I was happy to find them on Amazon and quickly bought them.  I expect them to last a long time and when they finally wear out I will buy again.  I have long hair - No other pins are needed.</li>
            <li> I bought these to use on my wood carvings as teeth and catfish whiskers after I cut them up and bend them. They work just fine.&lt;br /&gt;JJK</li>
            <li> The ends are quite sharp, so you have to be careful when putting these in your hair.  All in all though, I love these combs!</li>
            <li> I really liked these combs for a quick and easy french twist however it is too bad the teeth break out easily.  I do have thick hair but I expected better than five uses per comb before they broke.  It is a shame they are not more durable because the size and curve made them east  to use and comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> Pretty good, had to use a nail file to sand some sharp edges off, but you can&#x27;t beat it for the price. I would order again.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that is below shoulder length.  I use these combs daily for a French twist and they hold beautifully.  Have had them for over a year now, and they are still as nice as the day I got them.</li>
            <li> These are the only combs I have found that can handle my thick and very heavy hair.  So glad to find them again!</li>
            <li> Absolutely beautiful!  Strong and classy looking.  The combs are a wonderful accessory for thick hair. Thank You Amazon!  Will order again!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product and requesting a refund.  For an approximate cost of $5 each, per comb... I expected a solid item. Instead, the first one I tried, broke the second time I used it.  I would have been better served going to the dollar store,</li>
            <li> Works great. I have thin hair and it slides out if I don&#x27;t put the comb in while my hair is still wet. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, but so far it hasn&#x27;t snapped or cracked.</li>
            <li> Hard time finding combs like these in area retail shops. Perfect for a french twist with my medium length hair.</li>
            <li> lOVE THIS PRODUCT IT WORKS PERFECTLY  WITH MY HAIR TEXTURE  I WASN&#x27;T ABLE TO FIND IN ANY STORES AFTER MY OLDER ONE FINALLY BROKE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this type of comb for the past couple of years as my old ones had either been lost or broken.  The combs are easy to put in my thick hair and they stay in all day without sliding out.  They&#x27;re also very comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> I have used these for years and will continue to.  They are comfy, pretty, subtle, and hold my hair all day without trouble.  I do have rather thin hair though and those with thicker hair might find they dont hold... For me, works perfectly!</li>
            <li> I never used a french twist comb before this. Is is an easy way to hold my hair up off of my neck and keep it out of my face.The product does what it is supposed to do; and it was shipped promptly.</li>
            <li> Combs would not stay in my hair, had to return them.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine but kind of thick. I wasn&#x27;t sure whether a comb like this would stay in my hair, but it does a great job. The combs are well finished, so no worries about sharp edges. I&#x27;m glad I bought this on Amazon - they were impossible to find in local stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to grow the length of my thick, course, wavy/curly hair for around two years now. First time ever! I&#x27;ve been learning about products and accessories to help me work with it as I let it grow. This little Comb is terrific and I get lots of compliments when I wear it in a french twist using one of them. I&#x27;m not sure these combs would work well with fine straighter hair, but maybe. As I said, mine is very think and one of these works great!</li>
            <li> I have owned a pair of these combs for forever. Never knew what they were called. Never saw them sold anywhere. Then I lost one. I was shocked to find here what looks like exactly the same thing. If you&#x27;ve never used these combs before then the fact they are not as stiff as the ones I had won&#x27;t make any difference to you. The reason I did not give the product a 5 was really because the tines need to be filed/sanded off along the sides where they come out of the mold or are cut apart (however they make them). The edges are rough not cleanly cut. Once I knew what they were called I looked for less expensive ones but couldn&#x27;t find anything so although they seem high priced they really aren&#x27;t. I have no idea how to make a French Twist with these combs but they are great for just twisting my hair up and stuffing it in. They hold very well. Careful not to poke your eye out. lol They aren&#x27;t really sharp but they are pointed and LONG.</li>
            <li> These French twist combs are just what I needed.  I have very thick, curly, unruly hair, and most of the hair things in stores are pretty much useless for me because they just won&#x27;t hold all my hair.  When I first opened the package and saw how small the combs are, I thought I had wasted my money.  But I was wrong!  Just one comb holds all my hair very well.  It takes about 5 seconds to twist my hair up into a style that looks classy and holds all day.  It looks elegant--like somebody did my hair who actually knew what they were doing!  My hair did start to fall down a little after about an hour of rock climbing, but it was still holding better than I expected.  I&#x27;ve hardly ever met anyone whose hair is as thick and heavy as mine, and these combs are working fantastically for me.  I&#x27;m going to experiment to see what other styles I can do with them.  Yes, they are just plastic so the price seems a little high, but it was worth it.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to others who have thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> They are plastic combs with a faux horn design, and they work as they are supposed to work...&#x27;nuff said.  Okay?</li>
            <li> I have straight, soft hair.  This falls right out.  The shipper got it here promptly and took it back without a quibble.</li>
            <li> This simple design still puzzles me as to how it is able to hold my thick, long hair in place until I remove the comb. I value these and am panicky when I lose one because I know what a treasure it is. I would admire other women who have what looks like a high pony tail but would fall like a cascading waterfall evenly dispersed to conceal whatever it was holding it all together so perfectly. Then, I discovered these combs and knew their secret.</li>
            <li> Nearly exactly what I was looking for.  Ample comb to hold thick hair.  Had my sights set on a darker color like the one I was replacing but this one is exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> These are ok French Twist combs, but nothing special. Don&#x27;t hold my hair in place especially well.  But I can&#x27;t find exactly what I want.</li>
            <li> Some people may not know how to use, a picture might be nice with ad on website, then you would sell more</li>
            <li> Good quality product, perfect for french twist. Teeth are too long for using it as a side comb or anchoring a bun.</li>
            <li> These hair combs are difficult to find.  They were exactly what I expected.  I really enjoy them and they keep my hair neatly in place.</li>
            <li> They are great quality...I got them for my daughter for her birthday. She has long hair and she loves them.</li>
            <li> The length of my hair is about three inches below my shoulders and it is VERY thick.  It did take a few times to figure out the best way to insert the comb, but once I did the comb did a great job firmly holding my hair in place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these French twist combs for years but first time buying on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Good color. Comes 3 in a packet so if you break one you&#x27;re set.  But the thickness is not a sturdy as my old ones.&lt;br /&gt;Seems every manufactures is cutting product quality and box sizes this year.  Same with these combs for the price.</li>
            <li> These combs are almost impossible to find in the store and they turn a bad hair day into a good hair day in about 2 minutes</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair.  This comb is perfect for keeping my hair up without weighing it down with lots of pins and clips.  I use this comb by itself!  Fabulous!  I use the comb to put my hair into a french twist.</li>
            <li> The set I received were very sharp and pulled at my hair. I ended up sanding the teeth down and that helped a bit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s practically impossible to find french Twist Combs in retail stores.&lt;br /&gt;I checked out the reviews and majority were good,some mentioned they were flimsy. I didn&#x27;t find these to be the case-mine are sturdy-like the combs I used to own. It&#x27;s been 20 years since my hair was long,and now that it is,I was growing tired of the big,clunky hair clippies. It took a few tries to remember how to twist and roll (and a trip to youtube to double check) but I&#x27;ve been able to get back in the groove to use these. They really hold my thick hair well. I&#x27;m so glad I ordered these!</li>
            <li> works well holding a french twist.  Very subtle in the hair.</li>
            <li> They are nice. I have past my shoulder length hair that is very fine. It still holds it up well. It does take some practice if you are new to twisting.:-)</li>
            <li> Great for french twist,  well made great quality. Great for my all hair types. Long or short hair I use them daily</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I wanted.  I was looking for sturdy, economical combs that I can decorate myself.  I&#x27;ve decorated one &amp; am very happy with it.  The comb&#x27;s teeth aren&#x27;t going to easily break which is a necessary feature.</li>
            <li> I am able to keep my long thick hair up in a French twist easily with a few minutes of practice. The com is very sturdy and does not bend or break. My only qualm is that the points are a tad sharp and poke into my scalp a bit, which is expected.  I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m going to do with 3 combs, but I guess it&#x27;s nice to have a backup. I</li>
            <li> It hurts scalp. Doesn&#x27;t keep hair in place. Not recomended.</li>
            <li> I love these, they are such a nicer way to put my hair up than in a pony tail.</li>
            <li> I was looking for these to use on a French twist. They did not hold my very thick hair in place and the twist kept falling out.</li>
            <li> Pretty combs. decently finished, long enough to go under a bun, but not up to the task of holding my hair up.  It&#x27;s long, straight and heavy and the chignon just keeps slipping down until I give up and re-pin it.  The point of buying these, though, is to keep the hair up all day.  They work OK as decorative side combs, but that&#x27;s all. Try the Goody spiral pins, they do work.</li>
            <li> Just what i had been looking for. Perfect!!!</li>
            <li> They are great! Came before I expected them which made it all the more great.  Strong and holds my thick long hair wonderfully.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for women who have long, curly hair. The normal ones don&#x27;t go through all of my hair. These were a great find and are easy to use and they keep my hair up all day.</li>
            <li> not real sturdy.. the plastic is more flexible than ones i have had in the past...  but held my hair , which is not thick... nicely all day</li>
            <li> I had purchased these in a store before and could not find them anywhere.  I did a search and found them - I was so excited!.  I love the combs - it makes putting my shoulder length hair up so easy!  Love love love these!</li>
            <li> I was not impressed. The prongs didn&#x27;t feel very sturdy, like one could snap pretty easily, and the tips of them were sharp and scratched my head. Also, there was something about the curvature of them that was too severe or something because I couldn&#x27;t get it to stay in quite right. I had a similar clip from Hawaii several years ago and I loved it. I don&#x27;t know why a good clip like this is so hard to find.</li>
            <li> Would have given this for stars if it did not break easily.</li>
            <li> The order came on time and in good condition. The wrapping was just as it should be.  The combs on the other hand though beautiful, are very fragile, It would not hold my hair up. I was worried I would break a piece just by putting it in my hair. Very disapointing.</li>
            <li> It works great. Keeps the hair nice and secure. Just as advertises. Came as noted when ordered. Could not be happier.</li>
            <li> Huge combs.  I love them.  I have thick long hair.</li>
            <li> Very nice. The people who say these are too brittle or fragile must be using them improperly.  I have thick hair but still, if you hold them at the right angle they slide right into place.</li>
            <li> returned combs since the material the combs are made out of is too slippery; kept falling out even in my thick ethnic hair</li>
            <li> Good packaging good marchandise</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but a little cheaply made.</li>
            <li> They are simlpe, pure but hign quality. Love them!</li>
            <li> I had been looking for these forever.  Delighted they arrived and work great!  You may have to add a few hairpins but is fine.</li>
