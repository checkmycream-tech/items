            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance!</li>
            <li>I purchased this shea butter because of the amazing reviews.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful, perfect and your skin becomes soft  after only one day of washing with the goats milk body wash and using the goats milk Shea butter.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I love the scent -</li>
            <li>Just make sure powdery scent is your style.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the scent and the feel/texture of this shea butter.</li>
            <li>I love the fact its natural, smells incredible and is made with Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li>Personally, the Goat&#x27;s milk is the best fragrance.</li>
            <li>I wished it has more of a cream or whipped texture, as it would be easier to remove from the container, as well as, to apply.</li>
            <li>BUT.......the actual lotion worked great!</li>
            <li>I love shea butter</li>
            <li>Love how it moisturizes.</li>
            <li>Smells good and pretty.  </li>
            <li>It had a strong musky smell.  </li>
            <li>It is a sensual powdery scent but light.</li>
            <li>This smelled real older lady flowery which would have been okay</li>
            <li>Honestly, it has overtones very VERY similar to Viktor and Rolf Flowerbomb (which is my favorite fragrance).</li>
            <li>I used this a while back a loved it however I bought this thing</li>
            <li>This is a great product and I&#x27;ve ordered it before from other vendors.</li>
            <li>But then as you apply it on the skin, it quickly melts.</li>
            <li>The frankenscence and honey are on the exotic and masculine side</li>
            <li>they got it right.</li>
            <li>if that was what I was going for and if my sinuses were all right with that.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m only using it on my feet for sure.</li>
            <li>Love this and the entire Nubian Heritage line!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and well packed.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like the smell of this one that much</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This cream andvery light but deep penetrating.</li>
            <li>this makes your skin feel really moisturized and supple.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited when I got the package and couldn&#x27;t wait to open it.  </li>
            <li>Nubian Heritage products are known for their natural ingredients and strong essential oil scents.</li>
            <li>I ended up giving this to my sister and ordering the Honey and Black Seed which I love.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone.  </li>
            <li>Minimal ingredients, organic and  cruelty free.</li>
            <li>I have to hide this item because of my teenage daughter just love the thick application and shine on her legs.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth it.</li>

            <li> This is a great product and I&#x27;ve ordered it before from other vendors. When I opened this jar, I noticed it had a strange smell. The product itself is hard. Not going to use this. No packing slip was provided.Wasted money.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best shea butter&#x27;s out there!  I highly suggest it.  Personally, I love the scent - some may not.</li>
            <li> Nubian Heritage products are known for their natural ingredients and strong essential oil scents. The texture of this shea butter may feel initially hard and waxy. But then as you apply it on the skin, it quickly melts. I like its moisturizing affect and also  its spicy floral and powdery scent. Just make sure powdery scent is your style.</li>
            <li> I have to hide this item because of my teenage daughter just love the thick application and shine on her legs. I will reorder this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already purchased other nubian heritage butters from Nutricity with no problem. Unfortunately, when I received this one, it was open and it didn&#x27;t smell spicy or powdery like other reviewers described. I&#x27;m not sure if it was an old butter or what, but it didn&#x27;t smell nice...kind of musty. I would return this, but you have to pay shipping, which would be about $5.00 and I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and well packed. Amazon&#x27;s price&lt;br /&gt;from vendor, great! Love this stuff! Smells great!&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizes great. I can&#x27;t abide dry skin! I really&lt;br /&gt;love the smell of Nubian Heritage products. I&lt;br /&gt;think they got it right. My prerogative.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with Nubian Heritage products. Minimal ingredients, organic and  cruelty free.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the scent and the feel/texture of this shea butter. Goes on great. Moisturizes well. Scent lasts all day as well. I will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used shea butter, so for me it is too greasy. But the butter has a pleasant smell and does work well to soften the skin.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance! Great moisturizer, I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> I used this a while back a loved it however I bought this thing a hate it so gross and Nutricty which I bought it from didnt handle it properly hate hate hate will never buy from Them</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell of this one that much so I&#x27;m only using it on my feet for sure. I do like the way the shea butter smoothes the heels of my feet.</li>
            <li> This smelled real older lady flowery which would have been okay if that was what I was going for and if my sinuses were all right with that. They weren&#x27;t. I ended up giving this to my sister and ordering the Honey and Black Seed which I love.</li>
            <li> I always have a container of this in my purse. I love the fact its natural, smells incredible and is made with Shea Butter.  I introduced this product to my boyfriend and he is hooked! He even uses it to style his hair instead of gel/pomeade and says he hair feels healthlier now. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This cream andvery light but deep penetrating. I suffer with Lupus and itches and swells in pain. After rubbing the area it calms the skin.</li>
            <li> I recently became familar with Nubian Heritage shea butter, and I have tried the Frankenscence and Myrrh, the Honey and Black Seed oil, and now the Goat&#x27;s Milk. Personally, the Goat&#x27;s milk is the best fragrance. It is a sensual powdery scent but light. Honestly, it has overtones very VERY similar to Viktor and Rolf Flowerbomb (which is my favorite fragrance). The frankenscence and honey are on the exotic and masculine side so they didn&#x27;t compliment me. So, I&#x27;m sticking with the Goat&#x27;s milk! It&#x27;s truly luxurious.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of it but i am not a fan of the hard consistency of this product. I wished it has more of a cream or whipped texture, as it would be easier to remove from the container, as well as, to apply. Smells terrific though.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, perfect and your skin becomes soft  after only one day of washing with the goats milk body wash and using the goats milk Shea butter.  I highly recommend this product to anyone.  Especially if you have eczema.</li>
            <li> this makes your skin feel really moisturized and supple.  it takes a little while to soak in, because it is shea butter, but it is much easier than other shea butters to work into the skin.  This is an all natural product with about ten ingredients or less in it -and I can pronounce all the ingredients. get some!</li>
            <li> I purchased this shea butter because of the amazing reviews.  I was really excited when I got the package and couldn&#x27;t wait to open it.  Eww, I shouldn&#x27;t have opened it.  Personally for me, it smelled awful.  It had a strong musky smell.  It didn&#x27;t smell bad as in rotten, it just smelled off.  Definitely not the scent for me.  BUT.......the actual lotion worked great!</li>
            <li> Smell is subtle, a little bit greasy, but dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I love shea butter so I add this to my 100% organic shea butters to give them the scent and goat milk properties. Love this and the entire Nubian Heritage line!</li>
            <li> Smells good and pretty.  Love how it moisturizes.</li>
            <li> Smells good and does the job. Prevents dry skin and softens hands etc. the shipping took a while though. Nonetheless, I like the product.</li>
