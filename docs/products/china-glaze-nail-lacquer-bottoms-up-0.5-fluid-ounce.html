            <li>I love it and couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t entirely sure about this color from the swatches online, but I decided to buy it anyway.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>I love china glaze polish</li>
            <li>I love this color.</li>
            <li>Its more on the pastel side.</li>
            <li>Purchased through a great vendor whom I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>, they go on pretty well, and they are so much more affordable then buying them at the store!</li>
            <li>The perfect pink nail polish!</li>
            <li>China glaze takes a few more coats since it&#x27;s on the thins side, but the colors are awesome.</li>
            <li>China Glaze nail polish seems to chip easy.  </li>
            <li>It is the perfect shade of pink!!  </li>
            <li>Great lasting polish.  </li>
            <li>Shipped SO fast!!!</li>
            <li>particularly the warm neon colors.</li>
            <li>just like i said with the other colors this collection was awesome, the colors are super fun</li>
            <li>The first coat was a bit streaky but evened out after two more coats.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re debating between Neon &amp; On &amp; On, which is about the same intensity yet with a coral aspect instead of purple, I&#x27;d recommend deciding whether warm or cool tones better complement your skin tone.</li>
            <li>but it is not the right color!</li>
            <li>a very nice bubble gum pink.</li>
            <li>More pink in person, but still super cute!</li>
            <li>Wow it&#x27;s the best Barbie pink in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>A short time later, as it was being applied to my own toes, another woman and her daughter, who were looking for colors for their own fingers and toes, spied it on me and THEY HAD to have it, too.</li>
            <li>And a bit later, another woman who had since arrived for her own mani-pedi saw it on THEIR toes</li>
            <li>Pretty true to what you see in the bottle.</li>
            <li>China Glaze is great as far as quick dry time and no chipping.</li>
            <li>yet it wont wash out my skin tone, and the shipping was super fast...</li>
            <li>it looks dfferent in real ,its flash pink ,maybe fit young girls better and the scent is bit strong .</li>
            <li>it is so pretty in the bottle, can&#x27;t wait to see how it is on my nails</li>
            <li>and the shipping was FAST!</li>
            <li>It also drys really fast which is a plus for me!</li>
            <li>:) i definitely recommend</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Beautiful neon blue based hot pink!</li>
            <li>I have a large collection of</li>
            <li>I love a pink bubble gum color and this is it.</li>
            <li>Love this shade of pink.</li>
            <li>I probably notice chipping after a week and a half which is ok because by then I am ready to switch it up!</li>
            <li>Color stays on and remains vibrant for weeks.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>Very pretty hot pink!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a pink polish lover but this a bright pink with a little purple in it that is a must have for the summer.</li>
            <li>a pretty color pink instead of the neon pink/purple displayed.</li>
            <li>I had looked several places for this particular color and finally found it online!  </li>
            <li>cause it&#x27;s a very pretty pink, it&#x27;s not blinding pink, but when you go outside you can see it&#x27;s a hot Barbie pink...</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend for all my Barbie pink lovers.</li>

            <li> I was getting fluffed, buffed, and polished for a wedding at my local salon.  I had picked out several colors as possible choices for my mani-pedi. I noticed someone else was having this color applied to her toes.  It made me happy just looking at it. I HAD to have it!  The color was &amp;#34;Bottoms UP&amp;#34; by China Glaze. A short time later, as it was being applied to my own toes, another woman and her daughter, who were looking for colors for their own fingers and toes, spied it on me and THEY HAD to have it, too. And a bit later, another woman who had since arrived for her own mani-pedi saw it on THEIR toes and SHE had to have it too!  In the time I was there, FIVE people saw Bottoms Up  and HAD to have it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I had to have some to freshen up my nails later for the wedding, but also to keep at home for the summer. It is a gorgeous, delicious, happy summer color.  Alas, the local places were all sold out. I had to order online.  Amazon had it, they sent it fast and it arrived in perfect condition. This polish wears surprisingly well---doesn&#x27;t fade or crack or lose its sunny appeal!  Happy Summer fingers and toes, courtesy of Amazon!</li>
            <li> Not at all like the pic. It&#x27;s actually neon</li>
            <li> I love china glaze. china glaze fan!</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t had a chance to use this color yet but I can&#x27;t wait, this is my next one.  it is so pretty in the bottle, can&#x27;t wait to see how it is on my nails</li>
            <li> just like i said with the other colors this collection was awesome, the colors are super fun, they go on pretty well, and they are so much more affordable then buying them at the store! and the shipping was FAST!</li>
            <li> Bottoms Up is BARBIE PINK! So beautiful! Wow it&#x27;s the best Barbie pink in my opinion. Great formula dries fast. Great shipping. Love it thank you!</li>
            <li> Beautiful color! Even better price! China glaze takes a few more coats since it&#x27;s on the thins side, but the colors are awesome.</li>
            <li> Love the color and it has a great formula! It also drys really fast which is a plus for me!</li>
            <li> Sally Hansen has one this same color. Its a bubble gum pink, recommend for spring/summer. looks good on tan skin! takes 2 coats.</li>
            <li> Awwww!! I love this bottoms up polish!!  This is the only color I will use on my nails, toes from now on!!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. Beautiful neon blue based hot pink! The perfect pink nail polish! Wish it wasn&#x27;t limited edition polish color.</li>
            <li> this nail polish is beautiful, its a bright color yet it wont wash out my skin tone, and the shipping was super fast... like two days! :) i definitely recommend</li>
            <li> I love a pink bubble gum color and this is it. I always apply two coats and that is enough. I probably notice chipping after a week and a half which is ok because by then I am ready to switch it up! I HIGHLY recommend for all my Barbie pink lovers.</li>
            <li> Packed great, it was just what I was expecting!  I had looked several places for this particular color and finally found it online!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> My favorite color. a very nice bubble gum pink.</li>
            <li> More pink in person, but still super cute!</li>
            <li> Paint a coat of white as a base to make this color pop. Than 2 coats of this. Nail tech taught me that trick.</li>
            <li> The color is not as described.  It looks lighter from the picture but it&#x27;s probably another color pictured then what was actually sold.</li>
            <li> Very pretty hot pink! But it went on a bit streaky, I had to put 3 coats on.. I&#x27;m going to put a picture up, I put on my ring finger revlons diamond textured over the bottoms up, very cute. The bottoms up didn&#x27;t stay on long, I took a shower the day after I did my nails and almost every nail had peeled halfway off.. I still will wear it, cause it&#x27;s a very pretty pink, it&#x27;s not blinding pink, but when you go outside you can see it&#x27;s a hot Barbie pink...</li>
            <li> This is opaque in 2 coats.  Beautiful color, and china glaze just keeps releasing great colors.  I will be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> Shipped SO fast!!! Got a pedi and they used this color, they didn&#x27;t sell it and I looked all over town for it and couldn&#x27;t find it!! I get complements on the color about 3-4 times a week!! MUST GET</li>
            <li> Good product....great coverage</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a pink polish lover but this a bright pink with a little purple in it that is a must have for the summer. It is really different and isn&#x27;t a typical hot pink. Highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Nice color. Pretty true to what you see in the bottle. China Glaze is great as far as quick dry time and no chipping.</li>
            <li> Great color! I could wear this color everyday all year long. This shade has become on of my fave shades</li>
            <li> The online photos of this nail color doesn&#x27;t come close to giving it justice. It&#x27;s absolutely gorgeous, by far one of the best colors I&#x27;ve ever gotten. China glaze is a great company and the quality of the nail polish is perfect. Not too &amp;#34;runny&amp;#34; and not too &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is my signature color for he summer month. It&#x27; beautiful and bright.  I love it and couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores.</li>
            <li> Love this shade of pink. Gorgeous &amp; fast-drying. China Glaze has great quality nail polish. It&#x27;s cheaper to buy from Amazon. They&#x27;re $7 at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I have a large collection of China Glaze particularly the warm neon colors. I wasn&#x27;t entirely sure about this color from the swatches online, but I decided to buy it anyway. I&#x27;m in love. It is a medium pink-purple shade. It is about the same intensity of Shocking Pink but much more purple. It is also lighter than Pink Voltage. The first coat was a bit streaky but evened out after two more coats. The finish is eggshell-matte so use a shiny topcoat to get a salon looking result. If you&#x27;re debating between Neon &amp; On &amp; On, which is about the same intensity yet with a coral aspect instead of purple, I&#x27;d recommend deciding whether warm or cool tones better complement your skin tone.</li>
            <li> a pretty color pink instead of the neon pink/purple displayed. I love china glaze polish but this mirrors the thousands of pinks that I already have. I wont be sending it back but it is not the right color!</li>
            <li> it looks dfferent in real ,its flash pink ,maybe fit young girls better and the scent is bit strong .</li>
            <li> China Glaze nail polish seems to chip easy.  I have decided I am sticking with OPI from now on if I am spending $$$ on polish why not go for the best.</li>
            <li> Great lasting polish.  Color stays on and remains vibrant for weeks.  It is the perfect shade of pink!!  Purchased through a great vendor whom I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this color. I get a lot of complements on it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ALOT lighter than the picture shows. Its more on the pastel side.</li>
