            <li> I just blow-set my hair in 1/3 the time it normally takes me because of this fabulous boar bristle brush. And 30 minutes later my scalp still tingles! Just ordered more sizes, although this one is perfect for the current length. Just damp-dried 5 hair clumps--side side back back top--and done. Felt so good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good product, just that I am not really good at using it.</li>
            <li> Great size!  My hair is fine and medium length, so blow drying with this brush gives my hair more body.  I gave four stars for this reason, minus a star because the bristles are quite hard.  I prefer softer bristles.</li>
            <li> I like the brush but the bristles melt in the heat of the blow dryer. It seems to defeat the purpose.</li>
            <li> great brush for the money</li>
            <li> Gives incredible volume and really makes my hair silky smooth. That isn&#x27;t a small feat for me...my hair is very long, VERY fine and gets extremely tangled, very easily. Thanks to this brush, I can now ditch my straightening iron - this brush is THAT good. Another fantastic thing? Since it&#x27;s so large, my blow dry time has been cut in half. I&#x27;m planning on getting an assortment of sizes of these brushes, so I can try a bunch of different looks and techniques. The bristles are soft, but I think it&#x27;s the softness of the brush that gives your hair that super silky shine. Others have mentioned that the bristles shed and melt, after 3 months of using this brush, I can officially report that I have not found this to be the case. If you&#x27;re melting the bristles of the brush:&lt;br /&gt;1. Your blow dryer is WAY too hot&lt;br /&gt;2. Your blow dryer is too close to your hair (this will absolutely damage your hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So glad I can finally get my hair to look great without abusing it!</li>
            <li> Great for long thick hair. I find these type work well with long fine hair. Pricy but worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I think its a grat brush but maybe not for thicker longer hair.  My daughter&#x27;s been using it and I think the bristles are little too soft considering the length and thickness of her hair.</li>
            <li> Love this brush. I have fine hair and this adds a lot of body and shine and works great.</li>
            <li> I like the size of this brush a lot.  I also like the soft bristles.  It is a good sturdy brush.&lt;br /&gt;it makes my hair shine although it does cause me to frizz and static a bit. It settles down fast however. Hair feels thicker somehow when I use.  This is great for evenly distributing my leave in serums also.</li>
            <li> Speeds up blow drying time.</li>
            <li> I love it!!! Ordered another for my daughter-in-law</li>
            <li> Really I think this may be my favorite brush for blowdrying my hair I have ever purchased to date! I recommend it.</li>
            <li> nice size but the bristles fall out and make a mess</li>
            <li> As other reviewers noted, the bristles melt while drying hair, so it kind of defeats the purpose of the brush.  I really wanted to like it, too.</li>
            <li> Awesome brush doesn&#x27;t tangle or tear your hair</li>
            <li> I had no idea it was twice the size of my head. I am unable to use it at all</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s excelent good good good</li>
            <li> Just as good as those other high priced salon brushes!</li>
            <li> The bristles fall out and are very malleable; they melt with the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have very thick long hair, and this brush could not really handle it - so I had to divide my hair into multiple sections.&lt;br /&gt;I feel that this brush would be best for someone who has very fine/thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my hair was very prone to static and frizz with this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned it.</li>
            <li> This is a very large brush and one my hairdresser wanted to sell me for $45. What I really like about it is the bristles are soft and don&#x27;t pull your hair. It is perfect for use in styling and gives your hair that professional blow out look.</li>
            <li> Like the size. Works with my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush. It is great for fine, long hair. It is soft and works great with a blow dryer. Seems to give my hair a nice shine too. The only thing that is a drawback at all is that every time I use it, it seems to lose 3-4 bristles.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and she loves it! You can&#x27;t beat real boar hair brushes! Very good price for this well made brush! I&#x27;m going to get one for myself!</li>
