            <li>100% boar bristles, exquisitely crafted wood handle.</li>
            <li>I bought this to make my beard awesome.</li>
            <li>Feels good!</li>
            <li>Great.</li>
            <li>Feels good on the head/scalp, and works great on the eyebrows and mustache.</li>
            <li>Feels so good as I brush my beard</li>
            <li>Good quality brush</li>
            <li>Superior quality brush.</li>
            <li>Good for scalp.</li>
            <li>Good quality and value.  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worked amazing well</li>
            <li>The screws on the top don&#x27;t bother me but are a concern.</li>
            <li>Works ok</li>
            <li>Enjoying the brush for my beard.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s 100% boars hair and no plastic bristles hiding in there like most brushes.</li>
            <li>I tried this brush and some beard oils (essential oils), and am happy with the results my beard stays in place and is looking much better.</li>
            <li>Love this boar bristles brush,  I use it once a day to tame the beard, does a wonderful job.</li>
            <li>Was gonna return but honestly more work than it is worth.</li>
            <li>After trying to use it for my beard as originally purchased, I realized that it was tearing my face up like a 400lb grizzly bear paw.</li>
            <li>bought comb brand, but this is worth the beautiness of the beard.</li>
            <li>DO NOT buy this brush unless you like nylon bristles, because it states right on the brush itself that these are not 100% boar hair but are, in fact, &amp;#34;mixed&amp;#34; with nylon.</li>
            <li>I guess I need a more standard style plastic brush to make it through this beast.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on my scalp and does exactly what I hoped it would do.</li>
            <li>A large brush head.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice stiff brush that works well on my husband&#x27;s beard.  </li>
            <li>Looks great, but the assembly is a little strange.</li>
            <li>Too hard upon arrival, but easily fixed by a good wash with shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think there is a single boar hair within 50 miles of this brush, but there is plenty of cheap plasticky nylon.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>my seem high from a store</li>
            <li>Not all natural.</li>
            <li>So far he had to tighten 2 of them.  </li>
            <li>0% Natural.</li>
            <li>, I had a noticeable patch on my jawline where the hair didn&#x27;t want to grow, but since I&#x27;ve started using this brush the hair above it has straightened out and covers the patch so that it&#x27;s barely noticeable.</li>

            <li> my beard is a month and a half old.</li>
            <li> With that being said, the brush is decent although it does not get through my thick, coarse beard.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically the size of a smaller hair brush so brushing down you mustache is a bit of a squeeze.</li>
            <li> The only thing he doesn&#x27;t like, is that there are 6 small screws on the back side.  </li>
            <li> Amazon, take action against these shady liars!</li>
            <li> This seller should be shut down for claiming that this product contains 100% boar hair bristles.</li>
            <li> It is stiff enough to reach my skin on my thick and bushy beard.  </li>
            <li> dried my beard.  </li>
            <li> Heavy brush... don&#x27;t drop it on your toe.</li>
            <li> I have wasted my time in purchasing this brush and now must deal with the hassle of sending it back--not that I want to keep a dollar store plastic brush, anyway.</li>
            <li> If the brush is to stiff before use I use the palm of my hand with a drop of beard oil and rub the bristles.  </li>
            <li> The brush is very very firm.</li>

            <li> I love it! my beard is a month and a half old. and was not listening to my comb. I tried this brush and some beard oils (essential oils), and am happy with the results my beard stays in place and is looking much better. The brush massages my beard too! Feels good!</li>
            <li> It is stiff enough to reach my skin on my thick and bushy beard.  I use it after I have pat dried my beard.  If the brush is to stiff before use I use the palm of my hand with a drop of beard oil and rub the bristles.  This help maintain the brush and keeps water from mildewing in the brush.  I have had it a month and no issues.</li>
            <li> Heavy brush... don&#x27;t drop it on your toe. Feels good on the head/scalp, and works great on the eyebrows and mustache. A large brush head. Best for guys with shorter hair, I&#x27;d think.</li>
            <li> This brush does NOT have 100% boar bristles as described here.  Packaging of product states boar and nylon bristles.  If you are looking for all boar bristle look elsewhere.  With that being said, the brush is decent although it does not get through my thick, coarse beard.  I guess I need a more standard style plastic brush to make it through this beast.</li>
            <li> Looks great, but the assembly is a little strange. The screws on the top don&#x27;t bother me but are a concern.</li>
            <li> DO NOT buy this brush unless you like nylon bristles, because it states right on the brush itself that these are not 100% boar hair but are, in fact, &amp;#34;mixed&amp;#34; with nylon. I don&#x27;t think there is a single boar hair within 50 miles of this brush, but there is plenty of cheap plasticky nylon. This seller should be shut down for claiming that this product contains 100% boar hair bristles. I have wasted my time in purchasing this brush and now must deal with the hassle of sending it back--not that I want to keep a dollar store plastic brush, anyway. Save your money! Do not buy this brush! Amazon, take action against these shady liars!</li>
            <li> Too hard upon arrival, but easily fixed by a good wash with shampoo and conditioner. Perfect brush for my husbands beard and head, he loves it.</li>
            <li> The brush is very very firm. After trying to use it for my beard as originally purchased, I realized that it was tearing my face up like a 400lb grizzly bear paw. I have since gone to a kent handmade comb for managing my face carpet. I now use this boar bristle brush for my head.</li>
            <li> Feels so good as I brush my beard</li>
            <li> It is excellent for my thinning hair.  It is gentle on my scalp and does exactly what I hoped it would do.</li>
            <li> Must have for beards. But i should have bought the one without a handle.</li>
            <li> Good quality brush but note it&#x27;s a bit big for beard brushing. It&#x27;s basically the size of a smaller hair brush so brushing down you mustache is a bit of a squeeze. Bristle area is 2.5&amp;#34;x3.5&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Superior quality brush. 100% boar bristles, exquisitely crafted wood handle. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Love this boar bristles brush,  I use it once a day to tame the beard, does a wonderful job. Price my seem high from a store bought comb brand, but this is worth the beautiness of the beard.</li>
            <li> Great. Brush. Good for scalp.</li>
            <li> I bought this to make my beard awesome.</li>
            <li> Not all natural. Was gonna return but honestly more work than it is worth. Works ok</li>
            <li> Enjoying the brush for my beard.  Good quality and value.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice stiff brush that works well on my husband&#x27;s beard.  The only thing he doesn&#x27;t like, is that there are 6 small screws on the back side.  So far he had to tighten 2 of them.  They seem to loosen up after continued use.  Probably wouldn&#x27;t have ordered this one if we knew it had screws showing on the back.</li>
            <li> 0% Natural. 100% Plastic</li>
            <li> I purchased this to help detangle my beard a bit. It&#x27;s worked amazing well, I had a noticeable patch on my jawline where the hair didn&#x27;t want to grow, but since I&#x27;ve started using this brush the hair above it has straightened out and covers the patch so that it&#x27;s barely noticeable. I like that it&#x27;s 100% boars hair and no plastic bristles hiding in there like most brushes.</li>
