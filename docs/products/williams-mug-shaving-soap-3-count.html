            <li>Very happy with the shaving soap.  </li>
            <li>It may not be the best soap on the market</li>
            <li>This Williams soap is perfect.</li>
            <li>Lathers up great for a perfect shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried scented soaps (sandalwood smells great), but they don&#x27;t lather as well (and they clash with my cologne).&lt;br /&gt;Williams has the best lather that I know of.  </li>
            <li>Everything is should be, great lather and great price!!</li>
            <li>This stuff works good!</li>

            <li>As for the lather, it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>but once you got the hang of its a great lather.</li>

            <li>The value and smell of this product is great.</li>

            <li>I absolutely love this shaving soap!!</li>
            <li>Great price, nice lather, and no overbearing smell!</li>
            <li>Great price and nice lather!</li>
            <li>This soap has not changed in 30 years and I am very happy with that! :)</li>
            <li>When using the shave brush it is a pleasant experience, again, compared to squirting something out of a can and rubbing onto your face.</li>
            <li>It also has a pleasant lemony scent.</li>
            <li>It is a good soap.</li>
            <li>Fit my mug perfectly.</li>
            <li>Good and inexpensive shaving cream</li>

            <li>Smells good, works well.</li>
            <li>Feels good to get a good shave.</li>
            <li>A good close shave with no cuts.</li>
            <li>smells and feels good</li>
            <li>Good price</li>
            <li>and you have plenty of room to work up a good lather.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the shave soap that came with</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-Get a good shaving brush.</li>
            <li>Williams soap has been around forever for a good reason.</li>
            <li>Smells good too.</li>
            <li>Great product!&lt;br /&gt;Dad&#x27;s favorite shaving soap since the 1940&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I&#x27;m very pleased with this.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t pass on this, it&#x27;s good, smells like a man, works like a charm, and leaves your face stubble free and feeling great.  </li>
            <li>First time use was great!</li>
            <li>My husband has always liked Williams soap.</li>
            <li>The residual coating on my face provides a nice shave</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product!!</li>
            <li>Lathers well, and has a nice manly smell.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent shaving soap that lathers very well.  </li>
            <li>I just couldn&#x27;t say I liked it though, and that was because of the scent...</li>
            <li>Gentle smell that doesn&#x27;t stick around, lathers well, and is a great find for a great price.</li>
            <li>Find your own ritual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite shaving soap but it will give you a good shave and it will make a nice lather.</li>
            <li>It also moisturizes the skin and beard nicely.</li>
            <li>Good clean shave with this soap and smells good too.</li>
            <li>Good shaving soap, like the smell of it and easily to apply with brush.</li>
            <li>Smells great and lathers quickly.</li>
            <li>Priced was good and shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and a good quality!</li>
            <li>shave soaps and the scent is mild and pleasant.</li>
            <li>Wms shv soap wprks good with the right kind of brush.</li>
            <li>exactly what i wanted great price and prime as well.</li>
            <li>Very cheap, cheapest I have ever bought for $1 at my grocery store.</li>
            <li>Very cheap product</li>
            <li>I use it all the time and will be buying more.</li>
            <li>Nothing sexy about it.</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>Many soaps have come after it, but none come close to comparing with the close shave it gives.</li>
            <li>When this soap arrived I was quickly able to add water and generate what seemed like a never ending frothing mass of lather.  </li>
            <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>They both like it better than canned shaving cream.</li>
            <li>My favorite shaving soap, and affordable.</li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>That shaving soap was ok.  </li>
            <li>It was more a hand soap lather than anything else.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the 3 pack of this soap and love it.  </li>
            <li>Glad to have these on hand.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love about shaving soap.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This is a great, reasonably priced shaving soap for those of us who don&#x27;t care to use foam or spend a fortune on &amp;#34;designer&amp;#34; bars of it.</li>
            <li>love this, will buy more.  </li>
            <li>price is also a winner since it is one of the most inexpensive out there.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this shaving soap.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get much better than that.</li>
            <li>Has a good fresh smell and reportedly minimizes irritation, he uses the product with a modern gillette razor and was really happy I was able to find it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I gave this a try.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, the soap is better.</li>
            <li>Love the old-timey smell of this soap and it performs excellently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A nice clean scent.</li>
            <li>My Face and the tubes from Pacific Shaving, for example, make better lather and are more &amp;#34;portable&amp;#34; (you can throw them into your workout bag or luggage much more easily than a mug soap).</li>
            <li>Nice clean smelling soap.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t mind having one cake of this around as a backup, but I find that I now much prefer those that have replaced the &amp;#34;mug&amp;#34; soap at most grocery stores (albeit costing a good deal more).  </li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t need to buy any soap for a long while as this is an EXCELLENT deal.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t super foamy like shaving cream from a can, however, it is nice and maintains its lather.</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve tried this brand of soap and love it!  </li>
            <li>He says that it conditions his beard and his skin as well as making an easy efficient shave.</li>
            <li>Makes shaving easy.</li>
            <li>I also got a cut for the first and only time with Williams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price, and the fact that it is available at many drugstores are the best thing this soap has going for it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the cheap price but will pay a bit more for better quality.</li>
            <li>It lathers fine, and rinses well.</li>
            <li>You should use a fine bristle badger brush.</li>
            <li>Works fine.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-A coffee mug is fine for a shaving mug</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re going to use shaving soap, this Williams soap is fine.</li>
            <li>Great soap makes the skin super soft.</li>
            <li>Same beautiful lather, same lemony fragrance that you remember - if you loved it then, you will love it now.  </li>
            <li>Husband liked the smell and it lathers really well.</li>
            <li>The razor doesn&#x27;t glide as smoothly as with Col. Conk and the Proraso products I have used.  </li>
            <li>Williams feels chalky, like cheap motel soap.  </li>
            <li>Really enjoy this soap.</li>
            <li>Yes it&#x27;s cheap sop</li>
            <li>My husband uses a mug filled with Williams soap.  </li>
            <li>Overall a great product, and I will be ordering it again.</li>
            <li>I have for decades used mug shaving soap, lathers well and the feel is comfortable,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to note that this item includes three cakes of soap.</li>
            <li>Four or so a year so cheap to use.</li>
            <li>yet it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li>Cheap and to the point</li>
            <li>Good stuff as far as my dad is concerned.  </li>
            <li>Works just like the original bar.</li>
            <li>That means, as I found out to my own embarrassment, that ordering a quantity of two means you&#x27;ll end up with SIX cakes, or enough soap for more than a year of close, comfortable shaves.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Wiliams for years, and I&#x27;m never disappointed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s plenty rich and sudsy, and it&#x27;s wetter.</li>
            <li>The way I use this stuff is to add hot tap water to cup just covering soap, sit brush on top and let it stand for 3 minutes or so, this softens the soap and thickens the lather.  </li>
            <li>I used this stuff for over 40 years, and it was great, but with the new formula even a silvertip badger brush won&#x27;t work up a decent lather.   </li>
            <li>Some of the best shave soap I&#x27;ve found so far - especially for the money.</li>
            <li>It would be good, however, if it were available in a larger size.</li>
            <li>Always run clean water over brush and shake every time.</li>
            <li>It just smells like clean soap.</li>
            <li>I would rather have this clean smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>QUICK SHIPPING AND FREE</li>
            <li>but I love this stuff it lathers my face perfectly fine and has a nice light smell I have used other soap</li>
            <li>I enjoy the clean fresh, barber shop  scent.    </li>
            <li>, you don&#x27;t smell like a female after use and it does a good job of softening your whiskers.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face smooth and fresh feeling with out soapy residue.</li>
            <li>It produces a thick creamy lather that is perfect for a close shave.</li>
            <li>It will leave your face  smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve mixed this shaving soap with shaving creams to good effect.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t feel that is true at all.</li>
            <li>Smells great, nice enough lather, but dries up shortly after application, and doesn&#x27;t stay creamy.  </li>
            <li>Not bad</li>
            <li>shaving soap by Williams lathers up quickly.</li>
            <li>Quick background:&lt;br /&gt;-Shaving</li>
            <li>it was pretty inexpensive and was readily available at grocery stores (in the USA anyway).  </li>
            <li>Smells and works really well!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been shaving for many decades and prefer a blade (I&#x27;m now using a Harry&#x27;s razor -- another fine, basic product) with shaving soap to the alternatives.</li>
            <li>Thanks for having it available.</li>
            <li>It lathers very well and helps me get a close comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Based on my success</li>
            <li>If you enjoyed the old fashion barber shop ways, this  is the soap to use.  </li>
            <li>He has many allergies and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t afford a ten or twenty dollar shaving soap then buy Williams and you still get a nice a shave.</li>
            <li>I have used others, but the availability, price, and nice lather, bring me back to Williams.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several other soaps and find this to produce the best lather.</li>
            <li>When I first opened the package, the scent was overpowering, but became fairly mild after airing out in my cabinet for a couple of days.</li>
            <li>and it lathered right up.</li>
            <li>I like the soap because it is priced right</li>
            <li>I just want to get that out of the way right off</li>
            <li>soap is on the harder side so to get a good lather fill up your mug with HOT water and put your brush in the mug.</li>
            <li>praise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest, however, that you pay more attention to the quantity than I apparently did.</li>
            <li>You can pay more for other products, but given the fact that this shaving soap works very well, why pay more for fancy soaps?  </li>
            <li>It will not dry out on your face,  as most of the shaving soaps that, I have used.  </li>
            <li>Just like the old soap and smells the same and works up a good lather.</li>
            <li>Spend the extra money and get a good shaving soap from mama bear or Taylor of old bond Street.</li>
            <li>This soap is very much my favoriate.............</li>
            <li>They first thing he said was it smelled like his grandfather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different soaps and this is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>I just soak it in warm water while showering and with my Whipped Dog synthetic brush(modestly wet) load it up  in about 30 seconds and finish lather on face.</li>
            <li>at first I picked up something affordable from CVS.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried the brush and soap approach</li>
            <li>Hot water, of course..</li>
            <li>but the lather is so much better than the pucks I bought at a local soap company.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t out from  the first order, I just didn&#x27;t want to run out of this product.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely but more.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite daily shaving soaps.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>None better, and Amazon.com is the only source known to me</li>
            <li>My barber uses this, all day, every day, and when I asked him about it, all the pieces fell into place; the fragrance piqued my memory from the first.  </li>
            <li>does exactly what it claims not to do.</li>
            <li>Soak for a few minutes (or while you are showering), pour all the water out, give the brush a couple good shakes and lather away.</li>
            <li>He had trouble finding it anywhere &amp; was delighted when I dropped off this 3 pack.  </li>
            <li>Better lather than any other and rinses off clean.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much of a scent, and it lathers up quickly, and really helps the blade slide across my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The lather isn&#x27;t as nice as other shaving soaps I have tried.</li>
            <li>Good product for a no frills wet shaver, meets all needs, nice everyday soap works well would highly recommend thx</li>
            <li>I very much reccomend this soap, to the straight razor shavers.  </li>
            <li>it smells great but not a good shaving soap.</li>
            <li>This is only my second shave soap purchase, but I love the lather, and it truly does give a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>On a side note, this is pretty much the oldest brand out there, being around since 1840.</li>
            <li>and I like the clean fresh smell that doesn&#x27;t make me smell like a flower, or the lady next door.</li>
            <li>Plus it doesn&#x27;t dry up while shaving like many soaps do today.</li>
            <li>The small wide ones from asparagus at the store are the best The bottom of the soup bowl is about the size of the soap</li>
            <li>Good, long lasting, non face drying lather!  </li>
            <li>This is a fine basic and inexpensive product.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m currently using a kitchen mug that works fine.)</li>
            <li>It lathers pretty well using my existing brush and allows a decent shave.</li>
            <li>Plus, it leaves my skin feeling very dry most of the time</li>
            <li>I went to 3 stores to find it and all they had was a cheap comparison that turned to mush after several uses.</li>
            <li>put in a shaving soap bowl, (You can use straight from the box)</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also quite gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>Bought this as a gift and the receiver really likes it.</li>
            <li>Williams soap is really in a class by itself because of the price.</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s up to your preference, really though - smells</li>
            <li>When ready to use, pour off excess water from cup and shake some of the water off brush as well, it is now ready to stir up a good thick lather.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is easy to get use to and doesn&#x27;t linger long.</li>
            <li>No added fragrance like a lot of other soaps but that is perfectly OK for me.</li>
            <li>This was a good value priced soap, in that it seems to lather &amp; last very well, &amp; is pretty slick.</li>
            <li>Will definetly be back for more in the future .</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE 24 February 2014: I knocked it down to three stars, because it doesn&#x27;t rinse very cleanly.</li>
            <li>Little more work but a lot healthier skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m I really turning into the old fashioned sort of guy.</li>
            <li>I will keep it in case I run out, but otherwise I&#x27;ll stick to paying a few bucks more for Col. Conk.</li>
            <li>Scent is ok but is a acquired smell once you put it on a few</li>
            <li>It makes a decent lather if you let the soap soften in hot water with your brush prior to using.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes a little practice to get the lather right, and it&#x27;s no secret that Williams loves hot water and lots of it.</li>
            <li>I do live in the Denver area and</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling very soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>When I first viewed the product description and the accompanying copy, I realized that I HAD all of those items except the actual soap and lather!  </li>
            <li>Put a touch of water in the bottom of the cup the first time and the puck with stick in place for future latherings.  </li>
            <li>The city water where I live is fairly soft.</li>
            <li>It is cheap and lasts a long time, not enough profit for chain stores.</li>
            <li>For some reason when I put this on, I see myself sitting in a black and white version of the Andy Griffith Show and Floyd the Barber standing beside me!  :)</li>
            <li>It is mug soap, pure and simple.  </li>
            <li>When I saw it on Amazon it was like finding an old friend.</li>
            <li>It looks and smells old fashion, based on my Grandpa, and I am 60 years old.</li>
            <li>I am sticking to the old fashioned brush and lather soap.  </li>
            <li>It reminds  me of the old fashioned barber shop shave.  </li>
            <li>It does not have much of a scent to it, but it definitely is what it says it is.  </li>
            <li>I admit I have an extremely sensitive nose, but the scent of it when I opened the box was overpowering.</li>
            <li>My hubby prefers Colonel Conk, but he&#x27;s sensitive.</li>
            <li>saw a number of reviews about it being difficult to work up a good lather.  </li>
            <li>Of course, the first cake is only about a third gone.  </li>
            <li>It works just fine and provides a comfortable shave with a brush and mug nearly as well as the expensive fancy similar products from the UK.  </li>
            <li>I use one of those small soup bowls with a handle for a mug, works better than a regular mug.</li>
            <li>There is not much to say about it except it is exactly what you would</li>
            <li>After washing your face to get the beard wet (or stepping out of the shower), you need to soak the brush thoroughly in hot water.</li>
            <li>my cheap little Van Der Hagen shave set, but I wanted to try something different.</li>
            <li>I have tried a few other soaps and creams since I switched over to a double-edge razor, but so far this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive, doesn&#x27;t dry skin, but also doesn&#x27;t lather that well.</li>
            <li>at least they&#x27;re cheap.</li>
            <li>And I remember the days that I was young enough to stand at his elbow and watch him in the mirror.  </li>
            <li>Take and old mug from the back of the kitchen cabinet.</li>
            <li>I purchased this soap over three months ago, and I&#x27;m maybe half way through the first bar.  </li>
            <li>I have just ordered a 6 pack that, was prime shipped, which was a less costly order than the first.  </li>
            <li>I have used this in the past and it works up a good lather as well as any other and for a lot less $$.  </li>
            <li>It smells heavenly and I have no problem getting rich thick lather out of it.</li>
            <li>Thick, rich and creamy.  </li>
            <li>It is difficult to create a lather in the first place and then it quickly disappears on my face.  </li>
            <li>The Williams shave soap stands up well and last much longer than other</li>
            <li>This is the only way that my father will shave - he&#x27;s very old school, doesn&#x27;t use the single blade tho.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and Williams shaving soap doesn&#x27;t leave me dry and irritated.</li>
            <li>You need a mug that&#x27;s wide enough to hold the cake at the bottom and high enough to contain the lather.</li>
            <li>I have tried other much more expensive soap but this wins hands down.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried scented soaps (sandalwood smells great), but they don&#x27;t lather as well (and they clash with my cologne).&lt;br /&gt;Williams has the best lather that I know of.  </li>

            <li> Great price, nice lather, and no overbearing smell!</li>
            <li> Great price and nice lather!</li>
            <li> This soap has not changed in 30 years and I am very happy with that! :)</li>
            <li> When using the shave brush it is a pleasant experience, again, compared to squirting something out of a can and rubbing onto your face.</li>
            <li> It also has a pleasant lemony scent.</li>
            <li> It is a good soap.</li>
            <li> Fit my mug perfectly.</li>
            <li> Good and inexpensive shaving cream</li>

            <li> Good price</li>
            <li> and you have plenty of room to work up a good lather.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the shave soap that came with</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-Get a good shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Williams soap has been around forever for a good reason.</li>
            <li> Smells good too.</li>
            <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;Dad&#x27;s favorite shaving soap since the 1940&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I&#x27;m very pleased with this.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t pass on this, it&#x27;s good, smells like a man, works like a charm, and leaves your face stubble free and feeling great.  </li>
            <li> First time use was great!</li>
            <li> My husband has always liked Williams soap.</li>
            <li> The residual coating on my face provides a nice shave</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product!!</li>
            <li> Lathers well, and has a nice manly smell.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shaving soap that lathers very well.  </li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t say I liked it though, and that was because of the scent...</li>
            <li> Gentle smell that doesn&#x27;t stick around, lathers well, and is a great find for a great price.</li>
            <li> Find your own ritual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not my favorite shaving soap but it will give you a good shave and it will make a nice lather.</li>
            <li> It also moisturizes the skin and beard nicely.</li>
            <li> Good clean shave with this soap and smells good too.</li>
            <li> Good shaving soap, like the smell of it and easily to apply with brush.</li>
            <li> Smells great and lathers quickly.</li>
            <li> Priced was good and shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and a good quality!</li>
            <li> shave soaps and the scent is mild and pleasant.</li>
            <li> Wms shv soap wprks good with the right kind of brush.</li>
            <li> exactly what i wanted great price and prime as well.</li>
            <li> Very cheap, cheapest I have ever bought for $1 at my grocery store.</li>
            <li> Very cheap product</li>
            <li> I use it all the time and will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Nothing sexy about it.</li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> Many soaps have come after it, but none come close to comparing with the close shave it gives.</li>
            <li> When this soap arrived I was quickly able to add water and generate what seemed like a never ending frothing mass of lather.  </li>
            <li> What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> They both like it better than canned shaving cream.</li>
            <li> My favorite shaving soap, and affordable.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.</li>
            <li> That shaving soap was ok.  </li>
            <li> It was more a hand soap lather than anything else.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the 3 pack of this soap and love it.  </li>
            <li> Glad to have these on hand.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love about shaving soap.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is a great, reasonably priced shaving soap for those of us who don&#x27;t care to use foam or spend a fortune on &amp;#34;designer&amp;#34; bars of it.</li>
            <li> love this, will buy more.  </li>
            <li> price is also a winner since it is one of the most inexpensive out there.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shaving soap.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get much better than that.</li>
            <li> Has a good fresh smell and reportedly minimizes irritation, he uses the product with a modern gillette razor and was really happy I was able to find it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I gave this a try.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, the soap is better.</li>
            <li> Love the old-timey smell of this soap and it performs excellently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A nice clean scent.</li>
            <li> My Face and the tubes from Pacific Shaving, for example, make better lather and are more &amp;#34;portable&amp;#34; (you can throw them into your workout bag or luggage much more easily than a mug soap).</li>
            <li> Nice clean smelling soap.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t mind having one cake of this around as a backup, but I find that I now much prefer those that have replaced the &amp;#34;mug&amp;#34; soap at most grocery stores (albeit costing a good deal more).  </li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t need to buy any soap for a long while as this is an EXCELLENT deal.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t super foamy like shaving cream from a can, however, it is nice and maintains its lather.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve tried this brand of soap and love it!  </li>
            <li> He says that it conditions his beard and his skin as well as making an easy efficient shave.</li>
            <li> Makes shaving easy.</li>
            <li> I also got a cut for the first and only time with Williams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price, and the fact that it is available at many drugstores are the best thing this soap has going for it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the cheap price but will pay a bit more for better quality.</li>
            <li> It lathers fine, and rinses well.</li>
            <li> You should use a fine bristle badger brush.</li>
            <li> Works fine.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-A coffee mug is fine for a shaving mug</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re going to use shaving soap, this Williams soap is fine.</li>
            <li> Great soap makes the skin super soft.</li>
            <li> Same beautiful lather, same lemony fragrance that you remember - if you loved it then, you will love it now.  </li>
            <li> Husband liked the smell and it lathers really well.</li>
            <li> The razor doesn&#x27;t glide as smoothly as with Col. Conk and the Proraso products I have used.  </li>
            <li> Williams feels chalky, like cheap motel soap.  </li>
            <li> Really enjoy this soap.</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s cheap sop</li>
            <li> My husband uses a mug filled with Williams soap.  </li>
            <li> Overall a great product, and I will be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> I have for decades used mug shaving soap, lathers well and the feel is comfortable,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to note that this item includes three cakes of soap.</li>
            <li> Four or so a year so cheap to use.</li>
            <li> yet it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li> Cheap and to the point</li>
            <li> Good stuff as far as my dad is concerned.  </li>
            <li> Works just like the original bar.</li>
            <li> That means, as I found out to my own embarrassment, that ordering a quantity of two means you&#x27;ll end up with SIX cakes, or enough soap for more than a year of close, comfortable shaves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wiliams for years, and I&#x27;m never disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s plenty rich and sudsy, and it&#x27;s wetter.</li>
            <li> The way I use this stuff is to add hot tap water to cup just covering soap, sit brush on top and let it stand for 3 minutes or so, this softens the soap and thickens the lather.  </li>
            <li> I used this stuff for over 40 years, and it was great, but with the new formula even a silvertip badger brush won&#x27;t work up a decent lather.   </li>
            <li> Some of the best shave soap I&#x27;ve found so far - especially for the money.</li>
            <li> It would be good, however, if it were available in a larger size.</li>
            <li> Always run clean water over brush and shake every time.</li>
            <li> It just smells like clean soap.</li>
            <li> I would rather have this clean smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> QUICK SHIPPING AND FREE</li>
            <li> but I love this stuff it lathers my face perfectly fine and has a nice light smell I have used other soap</li>
            <li> I enjoy the clean fresh, barber shop  scent.    </li>
            <li> , you don&#x27;t smell like a female after use and it does a good job of softening your whiskers.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face smooth and fresh feeling with out soapy residue.</li>
            <li> It produces a thick creamy lather that is perfect for a close shave.</li>
            <li> It will leave your face  smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve mixed this shaving soap with shaving creams to good effect.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t feel that is true at all.</li>
            <li> Smells great, nice enough lather, but dries up shortly after application, and doesn&#x27;t stay creamy.  </li>
            <li> Not bad</li>
            <li> shaving soap by Williams lathers up quickly.</li>
            <li> Quick background:&lt;br /&gt;-Shaving</li>
            <li> it was pretty inexpensive and was readily available at grocery stores (in the USA anyway).  </li>
            <li> Smells and works really well!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been shaving for many decades and prefer a blade (I&#x27;m now using a Harry&#x27;s razor -- another fine, basic product) with shaving soap to the alternatives.</li>
            <li> Thanks for having it available.</li>
            <li> It lathers very well and helps me get a close comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Based on my success</li>
            <li> If you enjoyed the old fashion barber shop ways, this  is the soap to use.  </li>
            <li> He has many allergies and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t afford a ten or twenty dollar shaving soap then buy Williams and you still get a nice a shave.</li>
            <li> I have used others, but the availability, price, and nice lather, bring me back to Williams.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several other soaps and find this to produce the best lather.</li>
            <li> When I first opened the package, the scent was overpowering, but became fairly mild after airing out in my cabinet for a couple of days.</li>
            <li> and it lathered right up.</li>
            <li> I like the soap because it is priced right</li>
            <li> I just want to get that out of the way right off</li>
            <li> soap is on the harder side so to get a good lather fill up your mug with HOT water and put your brush in the mug.</li>
            <li> praise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest, however, that you pay more attention to the quantity than I apparently did.</li>
            <li> You can pay more for other products, but given the fact that this shaving soap works very well, why pay more for fancy soaps?  </li>
            <li> It will not dry out on your face,  as most of the shaving soaps that, I have used.  </li>
            <li> Just like the old soap and smells the same and works up a good lather.</li>
            <li> Spend the extra money and get a good shaving soap from mama bear or Taylor of old bond Street.</li>
            <li> This soap is very much my favoriate.............</li>
            <li> They first thing he said was it smelled like his grandfather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different soaps and this is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I just soak it in warm water while showering and with my Whipped Dog synthetic brush(modestly wet) load it up  in about 30 seconds and finish lather on face.</li>
            <li> at first I picked up something affordable from CVS.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried the brush and soap approach</li>
            <li> Hot water, of course..</li>
            <li> but the lather is so much better than the pucks I bought at a local soap company.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t out from  the first order, I just didn&#x27;t want to run out of this product.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely but more.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite daily shaving soaps.</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> None better, and Amazon.com is the only source known to me</li>
            <li> My barber uses this, all day, every day, and when I asked him about it, all the pieces fell into place; the fragrance piqued my memory from the first.  </li>
            <li> does exactly what it claims not to do.</li>
            <li> Soak for a few minutes (or while you are showering), pour all the water out, give the brush a couple good shakes and lather away.</li>
            <li> He had trouble finding it anywhere &amp; was delighted when I dropped off this 3 pack.  </li>
            <li> Better lather than any other and rinses off clean.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much of a scent, and it lathers up quickly, and really helps the blade slide across my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lather isn&#x27;t as nice as other shaving soaps I have tried.</li>
            <li> Good product for a no frills wet shaver, meets all needs, nice everyday soap works well would highly recommend thx</li>
            <li> I very much reccomend this soap, to the straight razor shavers.  </li>
            <li> it smells great but not a good shaving soap.</li>
            <li> This is only my second shave soap purchase, but I love the lather, and it truly does give a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> On a side note, this is pretty much the oldest brand out there, being around since 1840.</li>
            <li> and I like the clean fresh smell that doesn&#x27;t make me smell like a flower, or the lady next door.</li>
            <li> Plus it doesn&#x27;t dry up while shaving like many soaps do today.</li>
            <li> The small wide ones from asparagus at the store are the best The bottom of the soup bowl is about the size of the soap</li>
            <li> Good, long lasting, non face drying lather!  </li>
            <li> This is a fine basic and inexpensive product.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m currently using a kitchen mug that works fine.)</li>
            <li> It lathers pretty well using my existing brush and allows a decent shave.</li>
            <li> Plus, it leaves my skin feeling very dry most of the time</li>
            <li> I went to 3 stores to find it and all they had was a cheap comparison that turned to mush after several uses.</li>
            <li> put in a shaving soap bowl, (You can use straight from the box)</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also quite gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift and the receiver really likes it.</li>
            <li> Williams soap is really in a class by itself because of the price.</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s up to your preference, really though - smells</li>
            <li> When ready to use, pour off excess water from cup and shake some of the water off brush as well, it is now ready to stir up a good thick lather.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is easy to get use to and doesn&#x27;t linger long.</li>
            <li> No added fragrance like a lot of other soaps but that is perfectly OK for me.</li>
            <li> This was a good value priced soap, in that it seems to lather &amp; last very well, &amp; is pretty slick.</li>
            <li> Will definetly be back for more in the future .</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE 24 February 2014: I knocked it down to three stars, because it doesn&#x27;t rinse very cleanly.</li>
            <li> Little more work but a lot healthier skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m I really turning into the old fashioned sort of guy.</li>
            <li> I will keep it in case I run out, but otherwise I&#x27;ll stick to paying a few bucks more for Col. Conk.</li>
            <li> Scent is ok but is a acquired smell once you put it on a few</li>
            <li> It makes a decent lather if you let the soap soften in hot water with your brush prior to using.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes a little practice to get the lather right, and it&#x27;s no secret that Williams loves hot water and lots of it.</li>
            <li> I do live in the Denver area and</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling very soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> When I first viewed the product description and the accompanying copy, I realized that I HAD all of those items except the actual soap and lather!  </li>
            <li> Put a touch of water in the bottom of the cup the first time and the puck with stick in place for future latherings.  </li>
            <li> The city water where I live is fairly soft.</li>
            <li> It is cheap and lasts a long time, not enough profit for chain stores.</li>
            <li> For some reason when I put this on, I see myself sitting in a black and white version of the Andy Griffith Show and Floyd the Barber standing beside me!  :)</li>
            <li> It is mug soap, pure and simple.  </li>
            <li> When I saw it on Amazon it was like finding an old friend.</li>
            <li> It looks and smells old fashion, based on my Grandpa, and I am 60 years old.</li>
            <li> I am sticking to the old fashioned brush and lather soap.  </li>
            <li> It reminds  me of the old fashioned barber shop shave.  </li>
            <li> It does not have much of a scent to it, but it definitely is what it says it is.  </li>
            <li> I admit I have an extremely sensitive nose, but the scent of it when I opened the box was overpowering.</li>
            <li> My hubby prefers Colonel Conk, but he&#x27;s sensitive.</li>
            <li> saw a number of reviews about it being difficult to work up a good lather.  </li>
            <li> Of course, the first cake is only about a third gone.  </li>
            <li> It works just fine and provides a comfortable shave with a brush and mug nearly as well as the expensive fancy similar products from the UK.  </li>
            <li> I use one of those small soup bowls with a handle for a mug, works better than a regular mug.</li>
            <li> There is not much to say about it except it is exactly what you would</li>
            <li> After washing your face to get the beard wet (or stepping out of the shower), you need to soak the brush thoroughly in hot water.</li>
            <li> my cheap little Van Der Hagen shave set, but I wanted to try something different.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few other soaps and creams since I switched over to a double-edge razor, but so far this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive, doesn&#x27;t dry skin, but also doesn&#x27;t lather that well.</li>
            <li> at least they&#x27;re cheap.</li>
            <li> And I remember the days that I was young enough to stand at his elbow and watch him in the mirror.  </li>
            <li> Take and old mug from the back of the kitchen cabinet.</li>
            <li> I purchased this soap over three months ago, and I&#x27;m maybe half way through the first bar.  </li>
            <li> I have just ordered a 6 pack that, was prime shipped, which was a less costly order than the first.  </li>
            <li> I have used this in the past and it works up a good lather as well as any other and for a lot less $$.  </li>
            <li> It smells heavenly and I have no problem getting rich thick lather out of it.</li>
            <li> Thick, rich and creamy.  </li>
            <li> It is difficult to create a lather in the first place and then it quickly disappears on my face.  </li>
            <li> The Williams shave soap stands up well and last much longer than other</li>
            <li> This is the only way that my father will shave - he&#x27;s very old school, doesn&#x27;t use the single blade tho.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and Williams shaving soap doesn&#x27;t leave me dry and irritated.</li>
            <li> You need a mug that&#x27;s wide enough to hold the cake at the bottom and high enough to contain the lather.</li>
            <li> I have tried other much more expensive soap but this wins hands down.</li>
            <li> No dry skin and bar lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> like many soaps, I can feel my skin beginning to tighten as the stuff started to dry, but nothing wrong with that necessarily.</li>
            <li> And if you are into the \\&quot;Green\\&quot; environmental thing, the soap slowly disappears and the little cardboard box can easily be recycled.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin due to allergies, and this doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out or leave me too dry.</li>
            <li> Very long lasting soap and does not over power your Cologne and does not leave a film on your skin</li>
            <li> I have had much better performance with other brands, just sorry it was a 3 pack.</li>
            <li> This soap performs really well with my badger brush and my hard tap water.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon as this is getting hard to find.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not bad and not too terribly expensive in this 3 pack bundle, but I would say that too much lather has passed down the drain, so to speak, and other products have caught up and surpassed this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to lather up</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It lasts for a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As with the other soap, I just put this puck into a big coffee mug from a dollar store.  </li>
            <li> I do only shave every other day.</li>
            <li> soapy).&lt;br /&gt;-It lasts for a long time!</li>
            <li> Dry skin&lt;br /&gt;-Hate(d)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my face dry or itchy.</li>
            <li> they say it wont dry on your skin while shaving</li>
            <li> So I consider this in a small way to be earth conscious product.</li>
            <li> it is very dry here</li>
            <li> Virtually impossible to find in CVS, Thrift, or Walgreens pharmacies, didn&#x27;t find it at Target or Giant Eagle or Shop and Save, but persistence pays off, and this is still available through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> You have to use a wet brush to lather it up</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a pity.</li>
            <li> after applying it to my face 30 seconds later it has dried up.</li>
            <li> It has a slight citronella scent which isn&#x27;t my favorite, but isn&#x27;t unpleasant either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a very strong smell, and it doesn&#x27;t linger for long, but it smells just like Lemon Pledge.</li>
            <li> Williams, Colgate, and maybe some other brands of shaving soap used to be on grocery store and drugstore shelves everywhere, but they&#x27;ve gotten harder to find.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a shaving soap with a long lasting thick lather, I would recommend Williams.</li>
            <li> I was swayed by a review left in all caps by a man who claimed he has used nothing but Williams Mug Shaving Soap for the past 83 years...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It doesn&#x27;t lather as well as other brands.&lt;br /&gt;-Boring</li>
            <li> but the lather is thin and very short lasting on the face.</li>
            <li> Once you get it down though you&#x27;ll have one of the slickest lathers around that takes to any brush, and can usually be found somewhere locally.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin with a tough beard, and this soap keeps razor burn, and ingrown hairs at bay.</li>
            <li> Sometimes hard to find in local shopping venues.  </li>
            <li> Had a hard time finding locally.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried varying amounts of water with no success.  </li>
            <li> Has been using it at least several decades.  </li>
            <li> Saves a few minutes compared to my other soaps.</li>
            <li> so I gave it 3 stars instead of less.  </li>
            <li> and it cost less than US$1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read someone else had said the smell is less than desirable</li>
            <li> This soap unfortunately does not produce a decent lather to shave with.  </li>
            <li> Takes a little getting use to lather</li>
            <li> I really hate super smelly soaps; this isn&#x27;t one of those - yay!</li>
            <li> I have used a shaving mug for years, but was having trouble finding Williams mug shaving soap.  </li>
            <li> Put the handle in the web of your hand for a firm hold.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not overwhelming at all.  </li>
            <li> The alcohol and fragrances in canned shaving cream tends to irritate my skin, and I hated the ecological impact of throwing away shaving cream cans.</li>
            <li> Fits any mug or small bowl.</li>
            <li> but then it&#x27;s not ten to twenty times as expensive like the others.</li>
            <li> A blast from the past for those of us who started out shaving with a Gillette and Williams soap in a shaving mug.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking that it might be a hard water issue.  </li>
            <li> This soap is hard to find so I ordered a couple of packs.  </li>
            <li> I prefer shaving cream but wanted to try this shaving soap because it was less expensive.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell bad to me - and it&#x27;s only on your face for a couple of minutes anyway!</li>
            <li> It lathers up real thick and foamy.  </li>
            <li> Give it a try you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> This stuff is crap.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My husband has used this off and on for years.  It is a good soap.</li>
            <li> First time use was great!</li>
            <li> Perfect lather. This is my shaving soap from now on.</li>
            <li> My husband has always liked Williams soap. I went to 3 stores to find it and all they had was a cheap comparison that turned to mush after several uses. The Williams shave soap stands up well and last much longer than other shave soaps and the scent is mild and pleasant.</li>
            <li> Use plenty of water to get a suds.</li>
            <li> This does not provide me a lasting lather.  It is difficult to create a lather in the first place and then it quickly disappears on my face.  The residual coating on my face provides a nice shave so I gave it 3 stars instead of less.  I do live in the Denver area and it is very dry here so perhaps that is part of the problem for me.</li>
            <li> Not bad but, it&#x27;s just soap</li>
            <li> Works just like the original bar.</li>
            <li> Hey it&#x27;s soap, but i like it</li>
            <li> Good shaving soap, like the smell of it and easily to apply with brush. Lets the razor glide with ease!</li>
            <li> I have used a shaving mug for years, but was having trouble finding Williams mug shaving soap.  When I saw it on Amazon it was like finding an old friend.</li>
            <li> Fit my mug perfectly. Very happy with the soap.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive, doesn&#x27;t dry skin, but also doesn&#x27;t lather that well. Does the trick tho.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaving soap.  I use it all the time and will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Started shaving the &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; way about 3 years ago.  First time I&#x27;ve tried this brand of soap and love it!  Great price, nice lather, and no overbearing smell!</li>
            <li> No bumps! I have used this soap for over 30 years. Nothing sexy about it. it just works for the best shave you&#x27;ll ever have.</li>
            <li> We bought for my son in law. They first thing he said was it smelled like his grandfather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We put in a shaving soap bowl, (You can use straight from the box) He used a badger bristled brush with it and it lathered right up. It isn&#x27;t super foamy like shaving cream from a can, however, it is nice and maintains its lather. We will buy again.</li>
            <li> Good and inexpensive shaving cream</li>
            <li> Best shave I have ever had! I have used shave cream, paste, soap... And nothing compares to this puck! Must try! Smells great and lathers quickly. I was very impressed. Very cheap, cheapest I have ever bought for $1 at my grocery store.</li>
            <li> If you like the smell and lather you get from Ivory Soap, this is for you. Stuff works ok but the lather is thin and very short lasting on the face. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the cheap price but will pay a bit more for better quality.</li>
            <li> Husband has always used this...</li>
            <li> I have tried several other soaps and find this to produce the best lather. I does not make a slimy film as others do.</li>
            <li> at least they&#x27;re cheap.</li>
            <li> Great soap &amp; timely shipment. I am happy!</li>
            <li> Good clean shave with this soap and smells good too.</li>
            <li> It looks and smells old fashion, based on my Grandpa, and I am 60 years old. When using the shave brush it is a pleasant experience, again, compared to squirting something out of a can and rubbing onto your face. And if you are into the \\&quot;Green\\&quot; environmental thing, the soap slowly disappears and the little cardboard box can easily be recycled.&lt;br /&gt;And yes I am Gail&#x27;s husband the soap was for me.</li>
            <li> Happy with purchase. Husband liked the smell and it lathers really well. Priced was good and shipped very quickly. Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap off and on for years - works well, not smelly. I&#x27;m not too picky so maybe not the best judge, but I&#x27;ve had no complaints and will continue to use it. I really hate super smelly soaps; this isn&#x27;t one of those - yay!</li>
            <li> Good product for a no frills wet shaver, meets all needs, nice everyday soap works well would highly recommend thx</li>
            <li> Oh yes...this is what I have been looking for! It&#x27;s the &amp;#34;true and original&amp;#34; barbershop shaving soap. Many soaps have come after it, but none come close to comparing with the close shave it gives. Plus it doesn&#x27;t dry up while shaving like many soaps do today. It has the &amp;#34;old timey&amp;#34; barbershop smell. A nice clean scent. For some reason when I put this on, I see myself sitting in a black and white version of the Andy Griffith Show and Floyd the Barber standing beside me!  :)</li>
            <li> Buy this soap while you still can.  Manufacturor has made the decision to stop future production of this product after 175 years.  Allow it to bloom while you are taking your shower.  Lathers up great for a perfect shave.</li>
            <li> Good price. I use to buy at CVS,  they discontinued it.</li>
            <li> When I first viewed the product description and the accompanying copy, I realized that I HAD all of those items except the actual soap and lather!  When this soap arrived I was quickly able to add water and generate what seemed like a never ending frothing mass of lather.  Good, long lasting, non face drying lather!  What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> I have used Willams shaving soap for years.  It continues to provide a great lather and I like the clean fresh smell that doesn&#x27;t make me smell like a flower, or the lady next door.</li>
            <li> I purchased this soap over three months ago, and I&#x27;m maybe half way through the first bar.  There isn&#x27;t much of a scent, and it lathers up quickly, and really helps the blade slide across my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw a number of reviews about it being difficult to work up a good lather.  Based on my success I&#x27;m thinking that it might be a hard water issue.  The city water where I live is fairly soft.</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband who loves his mug and brush. Says that the soap is great!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shaving soap!! Gives the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had and smells fantastic!!  Give it a try you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;Dad&#x27;s favorite shaving soap since the 1940&#x27;s. Now being used by both of his grandsons. They both like it better than canned shaving cream. Still smells good.</li>
            <li> Back in the day, when all &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; was what we now call &amp;#34;retro-wet-shaving-trend&amp;#34;, I used to use this soap b/c it was pretty inexpensive and was readily available at grocery stores (in the USA anyway).  You could get it anywhere and it cost less than US$1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this present era of the &amp;#34;retro-wet-shaving-trend&amp;#34; of course, you can&#x27;t get it any longer without resorting to amazon, so I thought I&#x27;d try it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not bad and not too terribly expensive in this 3 pack bundle, but I would say that too much lather has passed down the drain, so to speak, and other products have caught up and surpassed this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind having one cake of this around as a backup, but I find that I now much prefer those that have replaced the &amp;#34;mug&amp;#34; soap at most grocery stores (albeit costing a good deal more).  The pump bottle cream from Kiss My Face and the tubes from Pacific Shaving, for example, make better lather and are more &amp;#34;portable&amp;#34; (you can throw them into your workout bag or luggage much more easily than a mug soap).</li>
            <li> It lathers fine, and rinses well. The razor doesn&#x27;t glide as smoothly as with Col. Conk and the Proraso products I have used.  Williams feels chalky, like cheap motel soap.  I also got a cut for the first and only time with Williams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price, and the fact that it is available at many drugstores are the best thing this soap has going for it.  I will keep it in case I run out, but otherwise I&#x27;ll stick to paying a few bucks more for Col. Conk.</li>
            <li> This is the only way that my father will shave - he&#x27;s very old school, doesn&#x27;t use the single blade tho.  It&#x27;s an art.  And I remember the days that I was young enough to stand at his elbow and watch him in the mirror.  Williams is a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried scented soaps (sandalwood smells great), but they don&#x27;t lather as well (and they clash with my cologne).&lt;br /&gt;Williams has the best lather that I know of.  I&#x27;ll bet they use it for pie-in-the-face movies!</li>
            <li> My favorite shaving soap, and affordable.</li>
            <li> Some of the best shave soap I&#x27;ve found so far - especially for the money. Really enjoy this soap. It has a slight citronella scent which isn&#x27;t my favorite, but isn&#x27;t unpleasant either. Definitely gets the job done!</li>
            <li> I like the soap because it is priced right, you don&#x27;t smell like a female after use and it does a good job of softening your whiskers.</li>
            <li> Great! Everything I could want in a shaving soap. It would be good, however, if it were available in a larger size. It gets lost in my mug. Do you have a mug it fits?</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s cheap sop but I love this stuff it lathers my face perfectly fine and has a nice light smell I have used other soap but this is my comfort soap.</li>
            <li> exactly what i wanted great price and prime as well. Will definetly be back for more in the future .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different soaps and this is one of my favorites. It smells heavenly and I have no problem getting rich thick lather out of it. I just soak it in warm water while showering and with my Whipped Dog synthetic brush(modestly wet) load it up  in about 30 seconds and finish lather on face. It leaves my face smooth and fresh feeling with out soapy residue.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. This is only my second shave soap purchase, but I love the lather, and it truly does give a smooth shave. The smell is reminiscent of lemon or citronella, but it&#x27;s not overpowering, especially when shaving. Definitely recommend this. On a side note, this is pretty much the oldest brand out there, being around since 1840. That&#x27;s 175 years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding Pharmapacks, my shipment arrived in a timely manner, and well packaged. Good company.</li>
            <li> I just got into safety razor shaving and didn&#x27;t know what soap to get so at first I picked up something affordable from CVS.  That shaving soap was ok.  It would lather up but the suds wouldn&#x27;t stay.  It was more a hand soap lather than anything else.  I ordered the 3 pack of this soap and love it.  Yes there is a citronella smell but it&#x27;s not overwhelming at all.  It&#x27;s almost lemony so I wouldn&#x27;t even give that a second thought.  The smell doesn&#x27;t linger after shaving either.  Rinse your face and the scent is gone.  As for the lather, it&#x27;s great.  After loading up the brush and lathering on the face it has a similar consistency to canned shaving cream.  Thick, rich and creamy.  As with the other soap, I just put this puck into a big coffee mug from a dollar store.  Put a touch of water in the bottom of the cup the first time and the puck with stick in place for future latherings.  Happy shaving!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and a good quality!</li>
            <li> Great price and nice lather!</li>
            <li> My husband uses a mug filled with Williams soap.  He says that it conditions his beard and his skin as well as making an easy efficient shave.</li>
            <li> Sometimes hard to find in local shopping venues.  Glad to have these on hand.  I am sticking to the old fashioned brush and lather soap.  Over the years, have personally never used an aerosol for shaving.  So I consider this in a small way to be earth conscious product.</li>
            <li> I use it every day when shaving.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love about shaving soap.</li>
            <li> This soap is hard to find so I ordered a couple of packs.  Smells good, works well. Would order it again.</li>
            <li> Feels good to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> The alcohol and fragrances in canned shaving cream tends to irritate my skin, and I hated the ecological impact of throwing away shaving cream cans. This shave soap solves both of those problems. It produces a thick creamy lather that is perfect for a close shave. When I first opened the package, the scent was overpowering, but became fairly mild after airing out in my cabinet for a couple of days. Overall a great product, and I will be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried the brush and soap approach and I really like it.  A good close shave with no cuts.</li>
            <li> I have for decades used mug shaving soap, lathers well and the feel is comfortable, no further words to describe the richness.</li>
            <li> shaving soap by Williams lathers up quickly. Seems to penetrate stubble on face. No need for any thing in addition like shaving cream from an aerosol can. You should use a fine bristle badger brush. Wms shv soap wprks good with the right kind of brush. Hot water, of course..</li>
            <li> I was swayed by a review left in all caps by a man who claimed he has used nothing but Williams Mug Shaving Soap for the past 83 years... This stuff works good! You have to use a wet brush to lather it up but the lather is so much better than the pucks I bought at a local soap company. Doesn&#x27;t smell bad to me - and it&#x27;s only on your face for a couple of minutes anyway! Treat your face and pick up some of this.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Once you get the lather how you want it it works well. Smells awesome! My wife loves it</li>
            <li> Great soap makes the skin super soft. Takes a little getting use to lather but once you got the hang of its a great lather. Scent is ok but is a acquired smell once you put it on a few you get use to it.</li>
            <li> smells and feels good</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. Seems none of the the stores in this area want to carry this item. I&#x27;m I really turning into the old fashioned sort of guy. Thanks for having it available.</li>
            <li> I ordered a three pack of this soap about a month ago.  Of course, the first cake is only about a third gone.  It reminds  me of the old fashioned barber shop shave.  It lathers up real thick and foamy.  I enjoy the clean fresh, barber shop  scent.    I have just ordered a 6 pack that, was prime shipped, which was a less costly order than the first.  I wasn&#x27;t out from  the first order, I just didn&#x27;t want to run out of this product.  If you enjoyed the old fashion barber shop ways, this  is the soap to use.  I very much reccomend this soap, to the straight razor shavers.  It will not dry out on your face,  as most of the shaving soaps that, I have used.  This soap is very much my favoriate.............It will leave your face  smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li> Very long lasting soap and does not over power your Cologne and does not leave a film on your skin</li>
            <li> This is a great, reasonably priced shaving soap for those of us who don&#x27;t care to use foam or spend a fortune on &amp;#34;designer&amp;#34; bars of it. I&#x27;ve used it happily for years and have nothing but praise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest, however, that you pay more attention to the quantity than I apparently did. It&#x27;s important to note that this item includes three cakes of soap. That means, as I found out to my own embarrassment, that ordering a quantity of two means you&#x27;ll end up with SIX cakes, or enough soap for more than a year of close, comfortable shaves.</li>
            <li> Product as listed. Good price</li>
            <li> Excellent soap! Purchased for my husband. He has many allergies and sensitive skin. Not a problem with this soap! Will definitely but more. Thanks for a great product!!</li>
            <li> Very good product, does just what it says, and doesn&#x27;t harm the pocket !!!</li>
            <li> I used Willams shaving soap for a quite a while before I switched from multi-blades back to the double-edged razor I learned to shave with.  It works just fine and provides a comfortable shave with a brush and mug nearly as well as the expensive fancy similar products from the UK.  That&#x27;s probably why it&#x27;s been around a hundred years.  For value it can&#x27;t be beaten.  A 3-pack from Amazon for 6 bucks will give you a year of daily shaves for the price of a couple of months of canned shaving creams.  Take and old mug from the back of the kitchen cabinet. You don&#x27;t have to buy a fancy shaving mug.</li>
            <li> This soap performs really well with my badger brush and my hard tap water. Saves a few minutes compared to my other soaps.</li>
            <li> Nice clean smelling soap. It makes a decent lather if you let the soap soften in hot water with your brush prior to using.</li>
            <li> Makes shaving easy. Lathers well, and has a nice manly smell. The fragrance makes my wife want to get close ;~)</li>
            <li> love this, will buy more.  better than expensive canned creams.  lasts for ever.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shaving soap that lathers very well.  It does not have much of a scent to it, but it definitely is what it says it is.  There is not much to say about it except it is exactly what you would expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is also a winner since it is one of the most inexpensive out there.  If you are looking for a shaving soap with a long lasting thick lather, I would recommend Williams.</li>
            <li> Always have used it as I worry about what is in a aerosol can. Little more work but a lot healthier skin and I worry about cancer. I have tried other much more expensive soap but this wins hands down. Better lather than any other and rinses off clean. No dry skin and bar lasts a long time. Four or so a year so cheap to use. I do only shave every other day. Been using it for 50 years. I use one of those small soup bowls with a handle for a mug, works better than a regular mug. Put the handle in the web of your hand for a firm hold. Rubber bands on handle. The small wide ones from asparagus at the store are the best The bottom of the soup bowl is about the size of the soap and you have plenty of room to work up a good lather. Always run clean water over brush and shake every time. Thanks Amazon as this is getting hard to find. It is cheap and lasts a long time, not enough profit for chain stores.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the shaving soap.  It lathers very well and helps me get a close comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shaving soap. I have tried a few other soaps and creams since I switched over to a double-edge razor, but so far this is my favorite. I have very sensitive skin due to allergies, and this doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out or leave me too dry. No scent, either! Great lather, and inexpensive. Doesn&#x27;t get much better than that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a very strong smell, and it doesn&#x27;t linger for long, but it smells just like Lemon Pledge. I just want to get that out of the way right off the bat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I&#x27;m very pleased with this. Using the same brush, razor, and blades as before, I&#x27;m getting a smoother shave that&#x27;s every bit as close. It&#x27;s also quite gentle on my skin. And it&#x27;s cheap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 24 February 2014: I knocked it down to three stars, because it doesn&#x27;t rinse very cleanly. It took me a while to notice - my post-shave lotion hid the fact from my skin, but it&#x27;s definitely leaving a build-up on my razor and even my brush.</li>
            <li> Smells great and gives me a great shave.  I have sensitive skin and Williams shaving soap doesn&#x27;t leave me dry and irritated.</li>
            <li> This was a good value priced soap, in that it seems to lather &amp; last very well, &amp; is pretty slick. I&#x27;ve mixed this shaving soap with shaving creams to good effect. I just couldn&#x27;t say I liked it though, and that was because of the scent... I admit I have an extremely sensitive nose, but the scent of it when I opened the box was overpowering. I almost couldn&#x27;t make myself try a shave with it, but after mixing in a dab of Bigelow cream [proraso], it was manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say if the Bigelow menthol mellows it, or if I just get accustomed to it by the time I&#x27;ve got it mixed. I&#x27;ve asked a couple friends what they think, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to bother them. I would say definitely try it, &amp; I would still mix it with a cream product though... like many soaps, I can feel my skin beginning to tighten as the stuff started to dry, but nothing wrong with that necessarily.</li>
            <li> Very cheap product yet it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap. It leaves my skin feeling very soft and moisturized. I read someone else had said the smell is less than desirable but I don&#x27;t feel that is true at all. It just smells like clean soap. No added fragrance like a lot of other soaps but that is perfectly OK for me. I would rather have this clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is on the harder side so to get a good lather fill up your mug with HOT water and put your brush in the mug. Soak for a few minutes (or while you are showering), pour all the water out, give the brush a couple good shakes and lather away.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite daily shaving soaps. Everything is should be, great lather and great price!! Fits any mug or small bowl.</li>
            <li> Smells great, nice enough lather, but dries up shortly after application, and doesn&#x27;t stay creamy.  I&#x27;ve tried varying amounts of water with no success.  I now lather portions of my face at a time with this stuff.  Not as good as the shave soap that came with my cheap little Van Der Hagen shave set, but I wanted to try something different.</li>
            <li> I prefer shaving cream but wanted to try this shaving soap because it was less expensive. It lathers pretty well using my existing brush and allows a decent shave. It also has a pleasant lemony scent.</li>
            <li> Works great. On time delivery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wiliams for years, and I&#x27;m never disappointed.</li>
            <li> Just like the old soap and smells the same and works up a good lather.</li>
            <li> GREAT DEAL/QUICK SHIPPING AND FREE</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift and the receiver really likes it. Has a good fresh smell and reportedly minimizes irritation, he uses the product with a modern gillette razor and was really happy I was able to find it.</li>
            <li> Works fine.  Cheap and to the point</li>
            <li> Gentle smell that doesn&#x27;t stick around, lathers well, and is a great find for a great price. Won&#x27;t need to buy any soap for a long while as this is an EXCELLENT deal.</li>
            <li> The only shaving soap that i use</li>
            <li> Walgreens does not carry this anymore in store, and it was cheaper to buy the three pack on Amazon with prime shipping.  Good stuff as far as my dad is concerned.  My hubby prefers Colonel Conk, but he&#x27;s sensitive. ;-)</li>
            <li> Hubby loves the soap--good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> None better, and Amazon.com is the only source known to me</li>
            <li> Quick background:&lt;br /&gt;-Shaving for 15 years&lt;br /&gt;-Every day shaving&lt;br /&gt;-Sensitive/Dry skin&lt;br /&gt;-Hate(d) shaving&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap has replaced my shaving cream. After some instructions from online videos, I keep using the same soap bar for the last month or so. I think one bar will hold for a while. It doesn&#x27;t leave my face dry or itchy. It doesn&#x27;t have a noticeable smell. It just feels great during and after the shave. And for the price per soap? You can&#x27;t beat that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;-A coffee mug is fine for a shaving mug&lt;br /&gt;-Get a good shaving brush. It makes world difference.&lt;br /&gt;-Go online and look for some tutorial videos on using this soap. Find your own ritual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical at first but I&#x27;m glad I gave this a try. I am never going back to shaving cream.</li>
            <li> This stuff is crap.  The formula was reportedly changed in 2006, and it shows. I used this stuff for over 40 years, and it was great, but with the new formula even a silvertip badger brush won&#x27;t work up a decent lather.   It disappears as soon as you put it on.  Spend the extra money and get a good shaving soap from mama bear or Taylor of old bond Street.</li>
            <li> Williams soap has been around forever for a good reason. It&#x27;s affordable and it works. It may not be the best soap on the market but then it&#x27;s not ten to twenty times as expensive like the others. It&#x27;s not my favorite shaving soap but it will give you a good shave and it will make a nice lather. The fragrance is easy to get use to and doesn&#x27;t linger long. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this five stars is because there is room for improvement but improvement would also probably increase the cost. Williams soap is really in a class by itself because of the price. If you can&#x27;t afford a ten or twenty dollar shaving soap then buy Williams and you still get a nice a shave.</li>
            <li> This soap unfortunately does not produce a decent lather to shave with.  It takes a long time to lather up and then it fades on the face.  I would not recommend it because it is not a lasting lather</li>
            <li> Had a hard time finding locally.  Just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Smells and works really well!!</li>
            <li> This soap has not changed in 30 years and I am very happy with that! :)</li>
            <li> they say it wont dry on your skin while shaving but it does. I will not purchase again</li>
            <li> This is a fine basic and inexpensive product. Williams, Colgate, and maybe some other brands of shaving soap used to be on grocery store and drugstore shelves everywhere, but they&#x27;ve gotten harder to find. That&#x27;s a pity. I hope they&#x27;re always available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, the lather you get from a soap cake isn&#x27;t the same as what comes out of an aerosol can, either foam or gel. In my opinion, the soap is better. It&#x27;s plenty rich and sudsy, and it&#x27;s wetter. You also can get it hotter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do have to use it properly. You need a mug that&#x27;s wide enough to hold the cake at the bottom and high enough to contain the lather. (I&#x27;m currently using a kitchen mug that works fine.) And you need a proper shaving brush. After washing your face to get the beard wet (or stepping out of the shower), you need to soak the brush thoroughly in hot water. Then lather up the soap vigorously for several seconds and apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been shaving for many decades and prefer a blade (I&#x27;m now using a Harry&#x27;s razor -- another fine, basic product) with shaving soap to the alternatives. This Williams soap is perfect. I don&#x27;t understand why anyone would find any fault with it. Of course, different people have different preferences, and some just may not like using shaving soap at all. But if you&#x27;re going to use shaving soap, this Williams soap is fine.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-It is a functional shaving soap!&lt;br /&gt;-It lasts for a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-It doesn&#x27;t lather as well as other brands.&lt;br /&gt;-Boring smell (It&#x27;s up to your preference, really though - smells soapy).&lt;br /&gt;-It lasts for a long time! (Only a con if you want to justify purchasing another soap)</li>
            <li> A blast from the past for those of us who started out shaving with a Gillette and Williams soap in a shaving mug.  Same beautiful lather, same lemony fragrance that you remember - if you loved it then, you will love it now.  Virtually impossible to find in CVS, Thrift, or Walgreens pharmacies, didn&#x27;t find it at Target or Giant Eagle or Shop and Save, but persistence pays off, and this is still available through Amazon.  You can pay more for other products, but given the fact that this shaving soap works very well, why pay more for fancy soaps?  My barber uses this, all day, every day, and when I asked him about it, all the pieces fell into place; the fragrance piqued my memory from the first.  (He gets his from Amazon, I should have known.)  Don&#x27;t pass on this, it&#x27;s good, smells like a man, works like a charm, and leaves your face stubble free and feeling great.  What else do you want from a product that has been in use from two decades before the American Civil War?  Toss the can in the can and get a mug for your mug.</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past and it works up a good lather as well as any other and for a lot less $$.  The way I use this stuff is to add hot tap water to cup just covering soap, sit brush on top and let it stand for 3 minutes or so, this softens the soap and thickens the lather.  When ready to use, pour off excess water from cup and shake some of the water off brush as well, it is now ready to stir up a good thick lather.</li>
            <li> Love the old-timey smell of this soap and it performs excellently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a little practice to get the lather right, and it&#x27;s no secret that Williams loves hot water and lots of it. Once you get it down though you&#x27;ll have one of the slickest lathers around that takes to any brush, and can usually be found somewhere locally.</li>
            <li> My father swears by this stuff.  Has been using it at least several decades.  He had trouble finding it anywhere &amp; was delighted when I dropped off this 3 pack.  Should last him a while!  Smells good too.</li>
            <li> The value and smell of this product is great. Each bar lasts forever, but the quality of the shaving soap isn&#x27;t too great. The lather isn&#x27;t as nice as other shaving soaps I have tried. Plus, it leaves my skin feeling very dry most of the time</li>
            <li> My face deserves this.</li>
            <li> It is mug soap, pure and simple.  I have used others, but the availability, price, and nice lather, bring me back to Williams.  It also moisturizes the skin and beard nicely. I have sensitive skin with a tough beard, and this soap keeps razor burn, and ingrown hairs at bay. I have given up on the aerosol stuff!</li>
            <li> does exactly what it claims not to do. after applying it to my face 30 seconds later it has dried up. it smells great but not a good shaving soap.</li>
            <li> I have had much better performance with other brands, just sorry it was a 3 pack.</li>
    </ol>
