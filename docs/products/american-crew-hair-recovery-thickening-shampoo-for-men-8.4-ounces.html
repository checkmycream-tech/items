            <li>Great price happy with product.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>The product does a great job in cleaning the hair, adding volume and thickness, and helping the grooming process between hair washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found some Vivre Pro on Ebay on sale in bulk, so I am good for now.  </li>
            <li>Nice product.  </li>
            <li>Very good product arrived very fast</li>
            <li>Makes my thinning hair look much fuller and smalls great.</li>
            <li>Love the shampoo.</li>
            <li>American Crew Thickening Shampoo is an excellent product that I have use for years.  </li>
            <li>Besides the citrus style, this is my boyfriends favorite brand of shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Until then, I believe the demographic that liked the original will not be the one who likes this product and will be looking for something better.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to see it available at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I switched to this and noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>This is a great product that actually does what it promises.</li>
            <li>I got this when the original Thickening Shampoo became unavailable.</li>
            <li>The original formula was a 5 star product that I used for years.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t feel clean after washing.</li>
            <li>With all the thickening shampoos out there that can cost big bucks, here is an economical product that I believe works as good for me as any of them did.</li>
            <li>Fantastic Product - been using for a long time - my hair stylist recommended it for my hair thinning and it&#x27;s absolutely AMAZING</li>
            <li>Other than the fact that it didn&#x27;t thicken my hair it was a good shampoo.</li>
            <li>With luck, this will go the way of New Coke and return to the original.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that is prone to getting oily in the latter part of the day.  </li>
            <li>The crew shampoo is a solid thickening shampoo that thickens my fine hair without making it oily.</li>
            <li>but i haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>It works really well on his hair.  </li>
            <li>This is my new shampoo by far.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and as expected.</li>
            <li>I figured Id give this shampoo a try along with using my rogaine frequently.</li>
            <li>I do use the American Crew Boost Cream and that however does a decent job.  </li>
            <li>For a few hours after application its okay, but till evening the hair feels too dry.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t trust this seller I recently bought the same bottle from a different seller with a much better (the usual) smell and feel on your hair.</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t trust this seller I recently bought the same bottle from a different seller with a much better (the usual) smell and feel on your hair.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks i notice new hairs growing and my hair was getting a bit thicker.</li>
            <li> and I notices my hair is less greasy and it looks like it might be thickening my hair, but it might be too early to teel.</li>
            <li> I hate when companies will not leave good things alone.</li>
            <li> This new one leaves an oily film on my hair and makes it flat and dull.</li>
            <li> Then I read other reviews that stated the same thing that was occurring to me.</li>
            <li> Now I still have a lot of hair but its slowly start to thin at the top.</li>
            <li> I need some boost and this did nothing but mentally satisfy me.  </li>
            <li> Obviously if you are bald not much is going to help, but if you are starting to notice it get thin in areas this will help.</li>
            <li> I do not use conditioners and I found that this shampoo left my hair drier than usual.</li>
            <li> I was previously using the Head and Shoulders Thickening shampoo and this demolishes it.</li>
            <li> At first I thought I was going crazy since the shampoo&#x27;s smell was nothing like the usual smell.</li>
            <li> Not sure though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure to what extent it is &amp;#34;thickening&amp;#34;, but I do feel like it helps (placebo or not).</li>
            <li> I gave this a try as I never liked rogaine.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I didn&#x27;t notice a change in my hair volume and now that I think about it, it would be very difficult for a shampoo to add volume to your hair in general.</li>
            <li> IF YOUR HAIR IS THIN THAN YOU GOT TO TRY IT.  </li>
            <li> I have thin hair...</li>
            <li> This shampoo isn&#x27;t bad, but it&#x27;s no Vivre Pro, and it&#x27;s twice the price.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always hated it</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find it in the stores any longer so, once again, THANK YOU AMAZON!!!</li>

            <li> CAN&#x27;T IMAGINE A PRODUCT WORKING SO GREAT!  I ORDER TWO AT A TIME SO I&#x27;LL NEVER RUN OUT.  GUYS (and girls)  IF YOUR HAIR IS THIN THAN YOU GOT TO TRY IT.  AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li> I agree with Sully.  This is a great product that actually does what it promises.</li>
            <li> With all the thickening shampoos out there that can cost big bucks, here is an economical product that I believe works as good for me as any of them did. It is difficult to find it in the stores any longer so, once again, THANK YOU AMAZON!!!</li>
            <li> Very good product arrived very fast</li>
            <li> I have thin hair...I need some boost and this did nothing but mentally satisfy me.  If you&#x27;re going bald like me...you&#x27;re going bald.  No getting around it.  I do use the American Crew Boost Cream and that however does a decent job.  Boost cream YES, Thickening Shampoo NO.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I had this item for about 3 weeks and I notices my hair is less greasy and it looks like it might be thickening my hair, but it might be too early to teel.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my husband and he seems to like it. i bought it at the recommendation of my stylist because she said that it could help thicken his thinning hair. i wasn&#x27;t expecting this product to be a miracle worker but i haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that is prone to getting oily in the latter part of the day.  The crew shampoo is a solid thickening shampoo that thickens my fine hair without making it oily.</li>
            <li> Great price happy with product.</li>
            <li> Great product. Makes my thinning hair look much fuller and smalls great.</li>
            <li> Not working for me....</li>
            <li> Nice product.  Feel like it does something.  Not sure though.</li>
            <li> I gave this a try as I never liked rogaine. After a few weeks i notice new hairs growing and my hair was getting a bit thicker. It was not like I had the head of a hair of a child but this product has def. helped.</li>
            <li> At first I thought I was going crazy since the shampoo&#x27;s smell was nothing like the usual smell. Then I read other reviews that stated the same thing that was occurring to me. Don&#x27;t trust this seller I recently bought the same bottle from a different seller with a much better (the usual) smell and feel on your hair.</li>
            <li> This is my new shampoo by far. I was previously using the Head and Shoulders Thickening shampoo and this demolishes it. Now I still have a lot of hair but its slowly start to thin at the top. I switched to this and noticed a huge difference. It really works. Obviously if you are bald not much is going to help, but if you are starting to notice it get thin in areas this will help.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Product - been using for a long time - my hair stylist recommended it for my hair thinning and it&#x27;s absolutely AMAZING</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo. I&#x27;m not sure to what extent it is &amp;#34;thickening&amp;#34;, but I do feel like it helps (placebo or not). Regardless, quality shampoo at minimum</li>
            <li> Great service and price !</li>
            <li> American Crew Thickening Shampoo is an excellent product that I have use for years.  It has become more difficult to procure at local grooming salons.  I was pleased to see it available at Amazon.  The product does a great job in cleaning the hair, adding volume and thickness, and helping the grooming process between hair washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would hightly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have thin/fine hair and I&#x27;ve always hated it, I envy those with thicker hair! I figured Id give this shampoo a try along with using my rogaine frequently. Sadly, I didn&#x27;t notice a change in my hair volume and now that I think about it, it would be very difficult for a shampoo to add volume to your hair in general. Other than the fact that it didn&#x27;t thicken my hair it was a good shampoo. 3/5</li>
            <li> This product gave me bumps on the back of my head. They feel like pimples and I dont have acne.</li>
            <li> I tried the American Crew Thickening Shampoo as a replacement for the L&#x27;Oreal Vivre Pro For Men, which has been discontinued.  This shampoo isn&#x27;t bad, but it&#x27;s no Vivre Pro, and it&#x27;s twice the price.  I found some Vivre Pro on Ebay on sale in bulk, so I am good for now.  Once that runs out, I&#x27;ve got to find another replacement.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and as expected.</li>
            <li> I got this when the original Thickening Shampoo became unavailable. I hate when companies will not leave good things alone. The original formula was a 5 star product that I used for years. This new one leaves an oily film on my hair and makes it flat and dull. It also doesn&#x27;t feel clean after washing. With luck, this will go the way of New Coke and return to the original. Until then, I believe the demographic that liked the original will not be the one who likes this product and will be looking for something better.</li>
            <li> Besides the citrus style, this is my boyfriends favorite brand of shampoo.  It works really well on his hair.  great buy!</li>
            <li> I do not use conditioners and I found that this shampoo left my hair drier than usual. For a few hours after application its okay, but till evening the hair feels too dry.</li>
