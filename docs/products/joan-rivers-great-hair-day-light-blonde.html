    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Otherwise, the packaging, the brush, and the quality of the product is excellent.</li>
            <li>This hair powder is the best I have found and will fill in gaps -- not a substitute for a wig.</li>
            <li>My life would be perfect Miss Joan.</li>
            <li>BEST PRODUCT TO COVER GRAY ROOTS!</li>
            <li>Great product can&#x27;t leave home without it!</li>
            <li>Would be great</li>
            <li>Great product and</li>
            <li>Coverage is great and stays on till I wash it off.</li>
            <li>You would have to see for yourself as to how really great this product works.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Works better if you can get the best cut and color you can afford and then work with that.</li>
            <li>The product is good, works well and comes with a very nice brush.</li>

            <li>loved the coverage</li>
            <li>So as to your product, love it!</li>
            <li>Anyway, I don&#x27;t like wearing my Enchantop around the house, I like to be comfortable, but yet, I still want to look as attractive as I can.  </li>
            <li>and it is simply amazing how it matches my own hair color.</li>
            <li>It washes out very easily with shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love it  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li>I have used everything I have been able to get my hands on to try to thicken that part but to no avail.</li>
            <li>It arrived on time and she seems to be pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years now.  </li>
            <li>Works so much better than the spray that is available.</li>
            <li>Use it all the time .applys easy</li>
            <li>Easy To Apply.</li>
            <li>Covers the shiney scalp areas easily.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>However, Color was too light, might match if you are platinum.  </li>
            <li>but Joan Rivers organization sent me the color that seemed to be a light brown</li>
            <li>The light color did not work as well.</li>
            <li>I ordered too light a color.</li>
            <li>This Joan Rivers Great Hair Day in Blonde  does a great job hiding my thinning hair spots as well as covering up my grey roots.</li>
            <li>Thank you Joan Rivers -- this product is clearly a miracle for women who experience the embarrasment of thinning hair; its easy to apply and the result its mind-boggling!</li>
            <li>Most colors are pretty dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first time (not knowing any better)</li>
            <li>I am not ready to go with a full wig yet, however I do use an Enchantop, (ladies, try one, they are great.)</li>
            <li>I bought 3, since I really loved the product and the way it covered my scalp and occasional gray roots.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several other products to cover my thinning hairline and this is by far the best product out there, great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>First forget the cheap brush that comes with it.</li>
            <li>I have very light blonde hair, and this works fine for me.</li>
            <li>Really a fun thing&lt;</li>
            <li>After receiving this purchase, I now know that this is the right color</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply, looks natural, and I will order it again.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>but my hair was much lighter!</li>
            <li>This product really worksorks!</li>
            <li>These only have 3 colors, you have a better choice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to go an extra 1-2 weeks between coloring by using this plus my hair looks fuller at the scalp.</li>
            <li>If this was the same color as the eyebrow color it would have been better.</li>
            <li>This purchase was absolutely the right color.  </li>
            <li>I thought the light blonde would be light brown, but it is really light blonde.</li>
            <li>This grey regrowth makes my thinning areas even more noticeable.</li>
            <li>The light blonde blends better with my hair, but doesn&#x27;t cover as well as the blonde.</li>
            <li>Be advised that blond is a dark ashy color, for light color get light blond.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m certain she&#x27;ll order it again.</li>
            <li>really too light for my hair; I should have ordered the &amp;#34;blonde&#x27; which I subsequently did.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need much powder to cover.</li>
            <li>So I would suggest if you are in doubt to order the light blonde color as it runs darker.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping it would work.</li>
            <li>if your light yellow or platinum blond, this color wont work for you.</li>
            <li>You just need to offer a bit darker ash than your light blonde.</li>
            <li>The light blonde is just a shade too brown.</li>
            <li>thanks MM</li>
            <li>However, there are other products that work well that are more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Joan&#x27;s product is perfect for my needs, I fill in the thin areas and even use it to cover grey between colorings.  </li>
            <li>Use it especially on hairline above forehead, and the thinning area on top and my part.</li>
            <li>Had dark blonde Joan rivers great hair day and thought I might try one a little lighter, since my hair is light blonde</li>
            <li>I use a large fluffy powder brush that  dusts on both side of the part until the area is filled.</li>
            <li>A review on the medium blonde powder helped me to decide to order the light blonde</li>
            <li>I have to wear my hair a certain style, long on top, short in back.</li>
            <li>The hair dirt is long-lasting and blends well  and looks natural!</li>
            <li>The brush that comes with it will leave stipple marks on your scalp unless you are super careful.</li>
            <li>, Nice thick hair ain&#x27;t gonna happen to me!</li>
            <li>and I thought the root color could be a little lighter and the product in the light color was on sale.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised and plan to continue using it.  </li>
            <li>It does work well, looks natural but takes awhile to fill in the line of your part.</li>
            <li>I have the blonde, which is really brown.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t come off unless I take it off and looks completely natural.</li>
            <li>Also, this came with a gift of eyebrow powder, but it was completely crumbled.</li>
            <li>I found something in bare minerals that works just as well.</li>
            <li>The light blonde color was a little darker than I expected.</li>

            <li> The light blonde color was a little darker than I expected.</li>
            <li> However my hair is a golden blonde and is not the lightest blonde, and this shade is still a little dark.</li>
            <li> You need a dark ash blonde, something with a little more green (ash) color to it.</li>
            <li> Prior to that I&#x27;d be extremely self conscious about my thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very thin on top.</li>
            <li> Only con is that it takes me too long to apply</li>
            <li> I would buy the dark blonde which is more expensive.</li>
            <li> It did cover my grey and was&lt;br /&gt;easy</li>
            <li> I have ash blonde hair with very pale blonde highlights, there is always regrowth, plus very thin hair on top (pattern baldness).</li>
            <li> Spent lots of money, time and frustration.</li>
            <li> No one knows just how thin my hair really is unless I show them before and after pictures.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dark brown with a slight reddish tint so any regrowth of grey has a big contrast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overpowering or unpleasant, but I wish they would have made it fragrance free.</li>
            <li> I wash it every other day.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t run &amp; streak down my face when I sweat or swim.</li>
            <li> It looks like slightly darker hair regrowth.</li>
            <li> , I just wanted to mention that there is a slight perfumed odor to this powder.</li>
            <li> Not sure it makes a difference.</li>
            <li> This costs about $10 at Sallys so not sure why its so expensive via amazon.</li>
            <li> Way too expensive for what is basically eye shadow.</li>
            <li> It could be something I am doing wrong, but I could not get it to cover.  </li>
            <li> I did not want to go the route of plugs as I know people that have had very bad experience with that - plus the procedure is extremely expensive.</li>
            <li> terrible....</li>
    </ol>

            <li> really too light for my hair; I should have ordered the &amp;#34;blonde&#x27; which I subsequently did. Otherwise, the packaging, the brush, and the quality of the product is excellent.</li>
            <li> Love it  Use it all the time .applys easy</li>
            <li> This hair powder is the best I have found and will fill in gaps -- not a substitute for a wig. First forget the cheap brush that comes with it. I use a large fluffy powder brush that  dusts on both side of the part until the area is filled. The brush that comes with it will leave stipple marks on your scalp unless you are super careful. Doesn&#x27;t run with sweat. Be advised that blond is a dark ashy color, for light color get light blond. Most colors are pretty dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works better if you can get the best cut and color you can afford and then work with that. Ask the stylist for layers for volume.</li>
            <li> I had heard of this product but was hesitant not believing it could help.  I was pleasantly surprised and plan to continue using it.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this to me  and it is everything I was hoping for  You have a life time user  Thank You Jaon</li>
            <li> Easy To Apply. I use this in between coloring my hair. Good on eye-brows too.</li>
            <li> I gave it one star because I found the brush to be substantial. However, Color was too light, might match if you are platinum.  It took a LOT of time to get the color on my roots.  Way too expensive for what is basically eye shadow.</li>
            <li> Cover broke off within 2 days of purchase.  Brush ineffective (I use my finger).  Not sure it makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I find that this powder covers well and gives me the confidence not to worry about my thinning hair. It is easy to apply, looks natural, and I will order it again. It seems like this will last me a while too and you don&#x27;t need much powder to cover. However my hair is a golden blonde and is not the lightest blonde, and this shade is still a little dark. It looks like slightly darker hair regrowth. So I would suggest if you are in doubt to order the light blonde color as it runs darker. A review on the medium blonde powder helped me to decide to order the light blonde and I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I just wanted to mention that there is a slight perfumed odor to this powder. It&#x27;s not overpowering or unpleasant, but I wish they would have made it fragrance free.</li>

            <li> Thank you Joan Rivers -- this product is clearly a miracle for women who experience the embarrasment of thinning hair; its easy to apply and the result its mind-boggling!</li>
            <li> I am in my 50&#x27;s and have thinning hair on my crown.  I have thicker hair in the back and on the sides.  I am not ready to go with a full wig yet, however I do use an Enchantop, (ladies, try one, they are great.) Anyway, I don&#x27;t like wearing my Enchantop around the house, I like to be comfortable, but yet, I still want to look as attractive as I can.  Joan&#x27;s product is perfect for my needs, I fill in the thin areas and even use it to cover grey between colorings.  Thank you, joan Rivers!</li>
            <li> I have the blonde, which is really brown.  I thought the light blonde would be light brown, but it is really light blonde.</li>
            <li> Covers the shiney scalp areas easily.  You can use only when necessary.  I have very light blonde hair, and this works fine for me.</li>
            <li> terrible....color is not &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34;! It&#x27;s BROWN!!</li>
            <li> loved the coverage but my hair was much lighter! if your light yellow or platinum blond, this color wont work for you.</li>
            <li> Had seen this on TV and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It did cover my grey and was&lt;br /&gt;easy to use.  Will allow me to go longer between coloring. Would be great&lt;br /&gt;if they would start packaging two colors in same pallet. Really a fun thing&lt;br /&gt;to play with.</li>
            <li> Joan has a winner here! This product really worksorks! The hair dirt is long-lasting and blends well  and looks natural!</li>
            <li> You just need to offer a bit darker ash than your light blonde. I have ash blonde hair with very pale blonde highlights, there is always regrowth, plus very thin hair on top (pattern baldness). I have used everything I have been able to get my hands on to try to thicken that part but to no avail. Spent lots of money, time and frustration. I have to wear my hair a certain style, long on top, short in back. I&#x27;m 66 and have resigned myself to the facts, Nice thick hair ain&#x27;t gonna happen to me! So as to your product, love it! Works so much better than the spray that is available. These only have 3 colors, you have a better choice. Use it especially on hairline above forehead, and the thinning area on top and my part. The light blonde is just a shade too brown. You need a dark ash blonde, something with a little more green (ash) color to it. My life would be perfect Miss Joan.</li>
            <li> BEST PRODUCT TO COVER GRAY ROOTS!</li>
            <li> The light blonde color was a little darker than I expected.</li>
            <li> Great product and I use it often. Doesn&#x27;t come off unless I take it off and looks completely natural.</li>
            <li> this item was for my wife. It arrived on time and she seems to be pleased with it. I&#x27;m certain she&#x27;ll order it again. thanks MM</li>
            <li> This purchase was absolutely the right color.  The first time (not knowing any better) I thought I purchased a blonde color but Joan Rivers organization sent me the color that seemed to be a light brown and I was using it.  After receiving this purchase, I now know that this is the right color and it is simply amazing how it matches my own hair color.</li>
            <li> This Joan Rivers Great Hair Day in Blonde  does a great job hiding my thinning hair spots as well as covering up my grey roots. My hair is very dark brown with a slight reddish tint so any regrowth of grey has a big contrast. This grey regrowth makes my thinning areas even more noticeable. I&#x27;m able to go an extra 1-2 weeks between coloring by using this plus my hair looks fuller at the scalp. It doesn&#x27;t run &amp; streak down my face when I sweat or swim. It washes out very easily with shampoo. I would be lost without it.</li>
            <li> Try it!!  I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years now.  Its not what you think!! if you have thining hair try it..besides returns are ez if it&#x27;s not what you expect</li>
            <li> My hair is very thin on top. I apply this every time I wash my hair. I wash it every other day. No one knows just how thin my hair really is unless I show them before and after pictures. Great product can&#x27;t leave home without it!</li>
            <li> Coverage is great and stays on till I wash it off.</li>
            <li> I have tried several other products to cover my thinning hairline and this is by far the best product out there, great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Had dark blonde Joan rivers great hair day and thought I might try one a little lighter, since my hair is light blonde and I thought the root color could be a little lighter and the product in the light color was on sale. I bought 3, since I really loved the product and the way it covered my scalp and occasional gray roots.  The light color did not work as well. I would buy the dark blonde which is more expensive.</li>
            <li> What would I do without this product?  The light blonde blends better with my hair, but doesn&#x27;t cover as well as the blonde. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> You would have to see for yourself as to how really great this product works.  I&#x27;ve used it now for over five years.  Prior to that I&#x27;d be extremely self conscious about my thinning hair.  I did not want to go the route of plugs as I know people that have had very bad experience with that - plus the procedure is extremely expensive.</li>
            <li> If this was the same color as the eyebrow color it would have been better. Needs to be a bit darker</li>
            <li> The product is good, works well and comes with a very nice brush. However, there are other products that work well that are more reasonably priced. Also, this came with a gift of eyebrow powder, but it was completely crumbled. I ordered too light a color. Have not decided if I will order again. I found something in bare minerals that works just as well.</li>
