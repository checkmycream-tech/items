            <li>I have had more compliments than I can count.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite oils.</li>
            <li>Many years since I have used this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>The oil doesn&#x27;t seem to be as &amp;#34;rich&amp;#34; as it used to, but I&#x27;m just glad they still make this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Love it---always will.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Rich and warm musk scent that lingers.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad it is available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>but it is not so easy to find.</li>
            <li>not as strong as my others i had</li>
            <li>The shippment arrived quickly and packaged well, so I will be ording more.</li>
            <li>The Alyssa Musk is really a heavenly scent you will enjoy when you&#x27;re sitting close to your favorite girl!</li>
            <li>This has a trace of a scent but not such a great one.</li>
            <li>I should know by now that any time I&#x27;m looking for something I should just go to Amazon first!!</li>
            <li>Still not the original musk scent of my youth...</li>
            <li>This smelt like original</li>
            <li>This product mixes with your body chemistry, makes you feel and smell clean all day.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is so clean</li>
            <li>This is my friend&#x27;s favorite perfume (the ONLY kind she wears).</li>
            <li>soft sexy scent!  </li>
            <li>And the price was definitely right!</li>
            <li>I use to buy this in a drug store years back, and I LOVED it, put some on in the morning and lasted all day, even after showering.</li>
            <li>And yes, she agrees (as some have mentioned) that the scent is not as intense as it was many years ago.</li>
            <li>My mother wants me to get lots more</li>
            <li>It is light and fresh.</li>
            <li>and it was an excellent long lasting perfumed oil with a distinctive scent.  </li>
            <li>Only the spray kind.  </li>
            <li>It was such a nice surprise to see it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>but the scent is not strong; it is soft and delicious.</li>
            <li>The price was right too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The one people remember me by.&lt;br /&gt;Clean light classic</li>
            <li>It has been around since I was young, and still holding strong.  </li>
            <li>I love this perfume--it&#x27;s the only one I wear.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this Musk Oil, but it does not last like it did when I bought it years ago.</li>
            <li>Would love to purchase larger bottle in the furture.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to purchase this at local drug stores, but they had quit stocking it</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>This is my first time ordering the oil in this form</li>
            <li>So glad to have it back.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast!</li>
            <li>I ordered the Alyssa Ashley Musk Oil first in January</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Not overbearing but clean and soft.</li>
            <li>(years after my own Dad&#x27;s passing, I still keep Old Spice on a men&#x27;s hanky to bring back his smell and the memories now and then!)</li>
            <li>the fragrance used to be my very favorite----now</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I get alot of comments about how much people like the smell and want to know what</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Arrived earlier than expected good value for the price</li>
            <li>tried many other prefumes</li>
            <li>I have used many different musk oils over the years and I keep coming back to this one!  </li>
            <li>I am highly allergic to a lot of fragrances and this one does not make me break out.</li>
            <li>I bought my first Alyssa Ashley Musk OIL (OIL, not the spray) when I was 19 and have used no other fragrance since.  </li>
            <li>This is the best fragrance, I have used it for years and have never been disappointed.  </li>
            <li>Over the years it has gotten hard to find in the local drugstores and I was buying it online directly from Alyssa Ashley but was thrilled to find it on Amazon at a lower price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll soon be 64 years old.  </li>
            <li>used this since I was 18yrs old .</li>
            <li>Plenty of the spray, which doesn&#x27;t smell the same and has too much alcohol scent about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and feminine and always reminds me of mom.</li>
            <li>Since I am sensitive to perfumes that are not just of an oil base this is perfect for me!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll drift back to the days when you once wore this before, or you&#x27;ll create new memories if you&#x27;ve never worn Alyssa Ashley Musk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Barely any smell at all.  </li>
            <li>Naturally you still must bathe, but a few tiny drops on your body and you are fresh all day.</li>
            <li>It smells great and all, but it&#x27;s just so damn expensive for such a little thing without a stick to dip into the oil.</li>
            <li>It has become hard to find and for her, worth the effort.</li>

            <li> You&#x27;ll drift back to the days when you once wore this before, or you&#x27;ll create new memories if you&#x27;ve never worn Alyssa Ashley Musk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Barely any smell at all.  </li>
            <li> Naturally you still must bathe, but a few tiny drops on your body and you are fresh all day.</li>
            <li> It smells great and all, but it&#x27;s just so damn expensive for such a little thing without a stick to dip into the oil.</li>
            <li> It has become hard to find and for her, worth the effort.</li>
            <li> Upon My Death&#x27; box so my son and grandkids can keep me around in some small way after I&#x27;m gone haha</li>
            <li> The oil is extremely long lasting</li>
            <li> It was a waste of my money but live and learn.</li>
            <li> However, the next shipment was spilling all over inside the box because the bottle was not closed tightly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find in stores, thankfully its available through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I drop a few dabs in my palm and use coconut oil to turn into a complete body experience.  </li>
            <li> You can put this on under your other perfumes and it makes them last all day.</li>
            <li> What happened sure doesn&#x27;t last long, disappointed in the change.</li>
            <li> This is the only perfume I wear for the past 40 years, can only find the oil online.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I received the incorrect item (amount) but they quickly responded to the problem and corrected it.  </li>
            <li> my mom says the scent is a little different than what she remembers.</li>
            <li> The scent lasts all day and smells a little different on everyone.  </li>
            <li> Yeah, this is the same scent I remember from back in the late 70s/early 80s.</li>
            <li> But, I have found that it is getting harder and harder to find.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other scents but have never gotten compliments like I do when I wear Alyssa Ashley Musk.</li>
            <li> I worked for town offices, and there was one guy that would track me down because he smelled the musk.</li>
            <li> The scent was not very strong.  </li>
            <li> This is even less than 1 star.</li>
            <li> It is not worth the money!</li>
            <li> That being said, she still feels that the scent is still long-lasting and can often smell it the next morning (at least that&#x27;s what she tells me!)</li>
            <li> the fragrance seems to be less than half the strength of what it used to be----what a shame!  </li>
            <li> Very hard to find local.  </li>
            <li> I have used this oil for years, and lately, for some unknown reason it has not been in the stores where I used to buy it.</li>
            <li> and I wear it everyday.  </li>
            <li> It is not a strong overpowering perfume.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting, and subtle and doesn&#x27;t go stale.  </li>
            <li> Never liked that.  </li>
            <li> It is seductive and subtle.  </li>
            <li> A bit frustrating but all worked out</li>
            <li> I keep trying and so far I have been disappointed every time!</li>
            <li> would defiantly recommend this product, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> but either it has changed or my memory has failed me.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, and was terribly frustrated when it became difficult and later impossible to find it!</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s afraid they will stop making it or change it.</li>
            <li> I let Sam&#x27;s know about this disappointment and they issued me a Return Authorization.</li>
            <li> I cannot express in words how disappointed I am with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> Will be devastating if that ever happens.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this perfume--it&#x27;s the only one I wear. I get compliments all the time but the scent is not strong; it is soft and delicious.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, it&#x27;s my signature and I get nothing but compliments on the soft and wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll soon be 64 years old.  I bought my first Alyssa Ashley Musk OIL (OIL, not the spray) when I was 19 and have used no other fragrance since.  I love it!!!  Obviously it&#x27;s become my &#x27;signature smell&#x27;.  I keep 3 bottles in my &#x27;Upon My Death&#x27; box so my son and grandkids can keep me around in some small way after I&#x27;m gone haha (years after my own Dad&#x27;s passing, I still keep Old Spice on a men&#x27;s hanky to bring back his smell and the memories now and then!)</li>
            <li> Perfect I have ordered several times</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I received the incorrect item (amount) but they quickly responded to the problem and corrected it.  However, the next shipment was spilling all over inside the box because the bottle was not closed tightly.  They promptly sent a replacement.  A bit frustrating but all worked out okay.</li>
            <li> Been wearing this for over 40 years! It&#x27;s the BEST.</li>
            <li> This is the fragrance my wife used to lure me in 35 years ago.  Still does the job!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and plan on continuing to do so.</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected good value for the price</li>
            <li> Aylssa Ashley Musk is my favorite scent.  Long lasting, and subtle and doesn&#x27;t go stale.  Rich and warm musk scent that lingers.</li>
            <li> Just as I remember it from years ago; love it!</li>
            <li> Looked for years to find this, again!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years and I just love it. My order arrived in a timely matter and I was very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find it anywhere else.  Had been using it some years ago and went back to it.  Makes you feel sexy.</li>
            <li> I use to buy this in a drug store years back, and I LOVED it, put some on in the morning and lasted all day, even after showering. What happened sure doesn&#x27;t last long, disappointed in the change. Wish I could find what it use to be.</li>
            <li> soft sexy scent!  My husband loves this stuff.  Not overbearing but clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this Musk and can not find it in the stores any longer. It makes me feel sexy. I have worn it for over 20 years. I am highly allergic to a lot of fragrances and this one does not make me break out.</li>
            <li> this is one  that I like a lot. yes I do tell a lot of people about this  musk oil. they all like the smell</li>
            <li> It made my skin itch. It also had a smokey smell. It was a waste of my money but live and learn.</li>
            <li> Still not the original musk scent of my youth... I keep trying and so far I have been disappointed every time!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this and it makes the best present I could get for her. She has been using it for years and would not change</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a great product to give to your sweetheart on Valentine&#x27;s day or just any day.  The Alyssa Musk is really a heavenly scent you will enjoy when you&#x27;re sitting close to your favorite girl!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find the musk oil in the stores anymore.  Only the spray kind.  Never liked that.  I worked for town offices, and there was one guy that would track me down because he smelled the musk.</li>
            <li> Great musk, great price. Whats better than that!!&lt;br /&gt;Have used this since I was 18yrs old . I love it.</li>
            <li> This product mixes with your body chemistry, makes you feel and smell clean all day. Naturally you still must bathe, but a few tiny drops on your body and you are fresh all day.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this Musk Oil, but it does not last like it did when I bought it years ago. I will not purchase it again. It is not worth the money!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Arrived on time, I get so many compliments on this oil.</li>
            <li> I love it.  Been using it for 30 years&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t stop offering it. Can&#x27;t purchase it in any stores</li>
            <li> It is just what I wanted.  So glad I found it again. This musk oil is my all time favorite perfume.  The price was right too.&lt;br /&gt;I would defiantly recommend this product, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, and was terribly frustrated when it became difficult and later impossible to find it! Plenty of the spray, which doesn&#x27;t smell the same and has too much alcohol scent about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I was thrilled when I learned that I could purchase it from Amazon. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite scent for over thirty-five years. It has become hard to find and for her, worth the effort.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why but it is not so easy to find. My mom insisted she wanted this for christmas :)</li>
            <li> SMELLS GREAT.I LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I love this musk oil and I am so glad it is available on Amazon.  I have used this oil for years, and lately, for some unknown reason it has not been in the stores where I used to buy it.</li>
            <li> This is the only perfume I wear for the past 40 years, can only find the oil online.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this!  Have used it for years and have received many, many compliments on it.  Over the years it has gotten hard to find in the local drugstores and I was buying it online directly from Alyssa Ashley but was thrilled to find it on Amazon at a lower price.  I should know by now that any time I&#x27;m looking for something I should just go to Amazon first!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this fragrance and I guess always will.  I ALWAYS get compliments when wearing it..</li>
            <li> Nice..my mom loves it! :)</li>
            <li> I used to use this all the time. It was such a nice surprise to see it on Amazon. Would love to purchase larger bottle in the furture.</li>
            <li> Very hard to find local.  I love it.</li>
            <li> The scent was not very strong.  Could not tell I was wearing it.</li>
            <li> This has been my mom&#x27;s favorite since the 70s--it&#x27;s her signature fragrance!  It&#x27;s soft and feminine and always reminds me of mom. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s weaker than it was 20 years ago but my mom doesn&#x27;t seem to notice any difference. She&#x27;s just happy to still be able to find it.  --------  Update: my mom says the scent is a little different than what she remembers. And yes, she agrees (as some have mentioned) that the scent is not as intense as it was many years ago. That being said, she still feels that the scent is still long-lasting and can often smell it the next morning (at least that&#x27;s what she tells me!)</li>
            <li> It smells great and all, but it&#x27;s just so damn expensive for such a little thing without a stick to dip into the oil. Whatever, it&#x27;s great anyway!</li>
            <li> great item  good price</li>
            <li> This is just one of my favorites! Since I am sensitive to perfumes that are not just of an oil base this is perfect for me! I love the mellow sensuous smell it leaves on me!</li>
            <li> the fragrance used to be my very favorite----now i don&#x27;t use it at all.  the fragrance seems to be less than half the strength of what it used to be----what a shame!  what happened?  take it back to the strength that i remember in 1994!  then let me know by email.  thanks</li>
            <li> Musk by Alyessa Ashley is my wife&#x27;s favorite purfume and she was running out of it. AmericanWholesale saved the day by delivering it Two days sooner than the anticipated delivery date. My wife was pleased with me and with shopping at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I purchased this musk oil for my mom. She loves it and gets compliments all the time. It&#x27;s difficult to find in stores, thankfully its available through Amazon. My mother wants me to get lots more becasue she&#x27;s afraid they will stop making it or change it. The shippment arrived quickly and packaged well, so I will be ording more.</li>
            <li> I was expecting some smell.... This has a trace of a scent but not such a great one. I thought I had used this years ago and loved it but either it has changed or my memory has failed me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this fragrance for years.  The oil is extremely long lasting and I can&#x27;t begin to tell how many compliments I&#x27;ve gotten  from people saying, &amp;#34;You always smell so good!&amp;#34;  This after it has been hours of applying!  I used to be able to purchase this at local drug stores, but they had quit stocking it so I was very happy to find it on Amazon and at a lower price.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Musk and white Musk always in my collection&lt;br /&gt;since I can remember,,, And this one does not smell like musk or even close to at all</li>
            <li> My scent. The one people remember me by.&lt;br /&gt;Clean light classic</li>
            <li> This is the best fragrance, I have used it for years and have never been disappointed.  I have tried other scents but have never gotten compliments like I do when I wear Alyssa Ashley Musk.</li>
            <li> not as strong as my others i had</li>
            <li> I am always very happy with all products I buy</li>
            <li> I LOVE this fragrance! My only problem is that the bottle should be bigger. This is my first time ordering the oil in this form but I&#x27;d order it again.</li>
            <li> I wore Alyssa Ashley years ago, then could not find it in any store. So glad to have it back. Of course I would recommend it.  JP - Pennsylvania</li>
            <li> Love this perfume.  Have worn it for years and always receive compliments.  Will continue to buy it online, as it&#x27;s the only place you can find it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this since the 1970&#x27;s and I love it.I get alot of comments about how much people like the smell and want to know what&lt;br /&gt;it is I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li> Started wearing this about 35 yrs ago when I met my husband. He only likes this fragrance on me tried many other prefumes but no he dident like them . So glad i found this online .</li>
            <li> I used to wear this scent years ago but hadnt seen it in stores in awhile.  I drop a few dabs in my palm and use coconut oil to turn into a complete body experience.  The scent lasts all day and smells a little different on everyone.  My husband said &amp;#34;Wow, I missed that smell!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I also wear Skin Musk by Bonnie Bell, it&#x27;s a scent that gets a LOT of attention.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast! My grandma has loved this scent for years. Glad I found it so she can wear it again. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Received in the time frame indicated.</li>
            <li> Yeah, this is the same scent I remember from back in the late 70s/early 80s. It lasts through the day, has a wonderfully pleasant and memorable fragrance. You&#x27;ll drift back to the days when you once wore this before, or you&#x27;ll create new memories if you&#x27;ve never worn Alyssa Ashley Musk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a must have for women of an adventurous nature.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Alyssa Ashley Musk Oil first in January and it was an excellent long lasting perfumed oil with a distinctive scent.  This time it was totally not the same oil.  Barely any smell at all.  I let Sam&#x27;s know about this disappointment and they issued me a Return Authorization. From the tracking data Sam&#x27;s had received my return about the 18th of September.  Today is the 26th of September.  As of yet no word and no refund.  I cannot express in words how disappointed I am with this purchase.  Buyer, BEWARE. This is even less than 1 star.</li>
            <li> Best.  Perfume.  Ever.  I have worn this for years.  I have had more compliments than I can count.  It is not a strong overpowering perfume.  It is perfect.  My biggest fear is them quitting making it.  Will be devastating if that ever happens.  I would give it a hundred stars if it would let me.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite oils. You can put this on under your other perfumes and it makes them last all day.</li>
            <li> Many years since I have used this fragrance.  I find that it is still great on me.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> The oil doesn&#x27;t seem to be as &amp;#34;rich&amp;#34; as it used to, but I&#x27;m just glad they still make this fragrance.  Love it---always will.  It is seductive and subtle.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> I have worn this scent for over 30 years and I always get compliments on it. It is light and fresh.</li>
            <li> This smelt like original</li>
            <li> I have used many different musk oils over the years and I keep coming back to this one!  Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I get many compliments of the nice fragrance.  like the oil compared to the spray.</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling musk oil around.  It has been around since I was young, and still holding strong.  The fragrance is so clean and I wear it everyday.  But, I have found that it is getting harder and harder to find.  So I was very pleased when I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is my friend&#x27;s favorite perfume (the ONLY kind she wears). I&#x27;m saving it for Mother&#x27;s Day, but I&#x27;m sure the two perfumes will be perfect. And the price was definitely right! 30 years ago, you could buy this for about $9.00. Now it goes for more than $20, so this was a great find. If you like musk, this special oil version smells wonderful.</li>
