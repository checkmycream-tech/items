            <li> When I use this product, my hair gets tame and feels soft to touch after styling.</li>
            <li> After I shampoo and condition I towel dry my hair and put a quarter size dollop in the palm of my hand and rub it in through my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting harder to find it.:</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find.  </li>
            <li> I use this product every other day to make my hair manageable.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this based on other reviews.</li>
            <li> Fortunately it wasn&#x27;t too much but very annoying given the price.  </li>

            <li> Btw, my hair is coarse and thick and I style it everyday before going to work.</li>
            <li> Too bad I can only find it on Amazon at a high price, because it has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> This stuff is not cheap, but it works well.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS A BIT HEAVY</li>
            <li> Its really too bad.</li>
            <li> I was sad when they discontinued this product in stores in 2009.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sad that I can no longer find this product in stores.  </li>
            <li> But why so expensive now?</li>
            <li> This stuff is too expensive on line, but they have us by the shorts....</li>
            <li> This needs to return to the shelves at stores!:-(</li>

            <li> I was sad when they discontinued this product in stores in 2009. So happy to find it available online!!  This is the perfect hair product for dry damaged hair, and an amazing detangler. It actually makes my hair manageable. Smells Divine as well :)</li>
            <li> This is a MUST HAVE product for me. I am a water exercise instructor and so my hair gets stressed by chlorine 3-5 days a week. I find it hard to live without this wonderful creme leave in conditioner, just a little goes a long way to keep my hair from being all over the place after blow drying. I&#x27;m So glad I can still get it online. I pray they keep making it. I will stock up today because I am at the end of my bottle now.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is one version older than what us pictured.  A fair product but not what us shown.  It is the light faded pink bottle.</li>
            <li> Was so upset that I couldn&#x27;t find this in the store anymore! When I realized it was still available online I quickly took advantage of the opportunity to buy it! Have loved this product for years!!!!</li>
            <li> After a lot of searching, I finally found the Sunsilk Hydra TLC Cream for my hair.  It is the only one that tames my course wavy red hair.  I eaked out every drop I could possibly get from my old bottle and finally got on the internet and Amazon and found that which was lost.  Thanks Amazon for carrying everything.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the stuff I used to buy, maybe they changed their formulas over time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sad that I can no longer find this product in stores.  I loved using the Sunsilk Hydra TLC 24/7 Creme product.  Worked great on my hair when I used it. But why so expensive now?</li>
            <li> I would always use this instead of conditioning my hair in the shower. Works better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used. I was upset to see it leave the shelves of local stores and because it&#x27;s becoming rare the price is going up. I wish that this was in stores again.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to buy it at Walmart for less than$5.....why so expensive now?!?!?!?! Its a great product and smells amazing ! This needs to return to the shelves at stores!:-(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame they discontinued this product, I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything close to give my hair the same results.  It&#x27;s getting harder to find it.:(</li>
            <li> This stuff is not cheap, but it works well. It is great for dry, frizzy, curly hair. The smell is wonderful!</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS A BIT HEAVY FOR MY FINE HAIR ALTHOUGH I DIDN&#x27;T USE VERY&lt;br /&gt;MUCH AT ALL.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very long hair and counts on this product to help keep it in good condition.</li>
            <li> I use this product every other day to make my hair manageable.  I helps to get rid of the frizzys and my hair looks smooth, silky and nice!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I can&#x27;t find it locally anymore and this is much higher in price than I usually paid for it. But it works wonders!</li>
            <li> Sunsilk is my fav hair product and they don&#x27;t sell it in the us anymore so I&#x27;m so happy I can still buy it online. It came on time and I experienced no problems, yay:)</li>
            <li> I used to use this daily until it was no longer available locally. I&#x27;m delighted to have found it once again. It makes my frizzy hair smooth and sleek without being greasy or weighed down. The smell is great too.</li>
            <li> I have dry, frizzy, wavy hair and this stuff works amazingly when I straighten it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find.  I&#x27;m glad I could get it here.  I don&#x27;t know that they actually make it anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this in Big Lots and wondered if it will work well with my hair. Btw, my hair is coarse and thick and I style it everyday before going to work. When I use this product, my hair gets tame and feels soft to touch after styling. It goes well with my styling and that&#x27;s why I rate it with 5 stars. Definitely a must buy for frequesnt stylers. :)</li>
            <li> I use to get this stuff all the time when they sold it in stores. it was the best hair product the I have ever used, but was very upset and sad after finding out its not sold in stores anymore and I don&#x27;t ever remember having to pay almost $40 for it. why does it cost so much now?</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter as it is her absolute favorite. We can no longer find anywhere locally to purchase it. She was extremely excited to receive it.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff, but shame on every provider for gouging the price 300%.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe this product is off the market. It is almost worth every penny. The sender came through and I and my 7 year old daughter are grateful.</li>
            <li> After I shampoo and condition I towel dry my hair and put a quarter size dollop in the palm of my hand and rub it in through my hair. My hair is long and naturally curly. I can&#x27;t tell you how many times my friends and family members have asked me what shampoo do I use. I tell them about this stuff. Not only that it leaves my hair non frizzy and so soft. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Received very quickly.</li>
            <li> I did not buy from this vendor I dont think but wanted to write a review.&lt;br /&gt;I think this product is discontinued. It used to cost $4 and it was the only thing that ever worked for my frizzy hair. I tried buying it once from Amazon and once from ebay and got some kind of fake or a new version with different ingredients. Didn&#x27;t look or smell the same and did NOTHING for my hair so i know it wasnt the original stuff. Its really too bad. Can Sunsilk recommend a similar product that isnt discontinued???</li>
            <li> This stuff is too expensive on line, but they have us by the shorts....this is the very best creme I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Love to try their shampoo, but don&#x27;t want to have to take out a loan for it.  Somebody needs to put this stuff back in stores!!</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this product and absolutely loved it. I used it on my hair and my 2 year olds hair and it left both of our hair soft, smooth and smelling great! Will definitely be heading to the store to get some more!!</li>
            <li> This is the only leave-in conditioner I will use.  Highly recommend.  Have used for over a year now.  Too bad I can only find it on Amazon at a high price, because it has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair. This lotion make my hair look fabulous and natural without making it dry like other gels .</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on other reviews. It&#x27;s ok, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy again. I feel like it weighs my hair down.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that helps me with my daughters hair.  Her hair is fine and easily tangles, along with a very sensitive scalp, and this is the only thing that allows me to brush her hair without a lot of tears.</li>
            <li> &#x27;Unfortunately this arrived without tape across the top and so the material inside oozed out making the box have a &#x27;puddle&#x27; of cream.  Fortunately it wasn&#x27;t too much but very annoying given the price.  Otherwise, I love using this on my hair and this is the only place I am able to find it.</li>
