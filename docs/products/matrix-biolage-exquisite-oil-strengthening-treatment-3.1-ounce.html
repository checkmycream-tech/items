            <li> Would def recommend it to anyone looking for a long lasting shine oil.</li>
            <li> and now my hair is wet not dry</li>
            <li> I love the smell, but the base is very oily, to the point of having to wash your hands after application.</li>
            <li> Also, it made my fine, thick hair feel very heavy.</li>
            <li> well im in the military so for extreamly short hair was</li>
            <li> some grey and it is also permed.</li>

            <li> Okay, I officially love this oil blend. I have fine hair, some grey and it is also permed. I needed a much lighter oil than what most products are. I needed it not be heavy and weigh my hair down or worse, make it greasy.  This oil works beautifully. I rubbed some on the top of my hand and it soaked right in, no oily build up.  It soaks into my hair the same way. You don&#x27;t need much and it smells so amazing my husband walked by and said, &amp;#34;Hey, you smell really good&amp;#34; - it was the oil. Not a strong scent but is nice.  It helped my hair look soft and not brittle, and kept fly-aways down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked this oil so much, I promptly bought more so I can have one in each bathroom!</li>
