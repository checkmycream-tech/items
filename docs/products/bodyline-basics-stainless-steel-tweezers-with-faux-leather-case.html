            <li>I needed some good tweezers to remove ingrown hairs and whatnot.  </li>
            <li>Good quality tweezers.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve been using tweezers from the drug store or beauty counter, you do not know what good tweezers are.</li>
            <li>It would be good for plucking hairs</li>
            <li>that years ago were good.  </li>
            <li>I have been shopping for years for a good pair of tweezers and here they are.</li>
            <li>The accompanying case is good looking and conveniently stores all 3 tweezers.</li>
            <li>Stainless Steel Tweezers were excellent quality and great customer service</li>
            <li>While they are better than most tweezers, they are not the best ones I have used.  </li>
            <li>There are three pairs in a nice leatherette case, and each pair is great in its own way.  </li>
            <li>I am very glad I bought these.</li>
            <li>Great product, top quality</li>

            <li>Great tweezers, have never owned a better set.</li>

            <li>Great tweezers, strong grip and durable.  </li>
            <li>These tweezers are amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>These things grip amazingly too.</li>
            <li>two pointed tip ones are amazing for getting even the smallest hairs.</li>
            <li>My wife bought these for her own use.</li>
            <li>Nicely packaged, too</li>
            <li>Already used the pointy one to extricate a rose thorn</li>
            <li>They are very well made and the quality is superb.  </li>
            <li>Nice set of tweezers, I have bought two sets of them, one for home, one for travel.  </li>
            <li>Very well made and an excellent value.  </li>
            <li>Nice grip on each one.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own carrying case for ease of storage and mobility purposes.  </li>
            <li>I opened the leather case (which is a nice touch), took one of them, and immediately felt the build quality.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re well made and come in a handy case.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice set of tweezers.  </li>
            <li>These would make a nice gift.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of pot luck when you buy tweezers, as you cannot try them out before your purchase.  </li>
            <li>Really nice set.  </li>
            <li>The finish is good and easy to clean, the tips are ground very precise  and meet very good.</li>
            <li>These are the best set of high quality tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Excellent high quality product</li>
            <li>Great product, completely worth the price, I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product at a good price.</li>
            <li>Best of all, the price is really good for such a quality product.</li>
            <li>Removes hairs and splinters very easily.</li>
            <li>I thought these would be great but are not as useful as my Lancone tweezers that I thought I lost.  </li>
            <li>Gave my wife my old pair of tweezers which she says are the best she&#x27;s ever used.</li>
            <li>By far the best tweezers we have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Also love the nice compact pouch they come in.</li>
            <li>I liked another brand better.</li>
            <li>I have very fine eyebrow &amp;#34;strays&amp;#34;, and Mr Pointy gets them every time.  </li>
            <li>I bought these for the very fine tip tweezers.</li>
            <li>I can grasp those strays easily!  </li>
            <li>They shipped very quickly and were here in no time!</li>
            <li>Each of the 3 tweezers have a very strong gripping power, which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always happy when the product is of higher quality than the packaging, which isn&#x27;t always the case.  </li>
            <li>Happily purchased the whole set again!</li>
            <li>Top notch.</li>
            <li>Hopefully it&#x27;s to use the feedback for improvement and not to try and get more people to buy them based on &amp;#34;good&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I thought the one pair (non-colored) looked more like a surgical tool than tweezers.</li>
            <li>better then the rest...</li>
            <li>I have never used better tweezers.</li>
            <li>Very happy to have a carrying case with these as well, definitely something that&#x27;s an added bonus.</li>
            <li>Glad for the case because of the sharpness of the pointed ones.</li>
            <li>The company followed up with a phone call making sure I received it. :)</li>
            <li>I picked up this Body Line pair of tweezers at the Body Line Spa and I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li>I love that they have a lifetime warranty.</li>
            <li>I look forward to years of use from these tweezers, as well as learning which is best for each specific application.</li>
            <li>In fact buy more than 1 pair.</li>
            <li>Great product, very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Would rebuy though as these are the most uniform on the tip part that Ive been able to find.</li>
            <li>Love this set of tweezers.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>Much better than tweezerman.</li>
            <li>I have used them several times on my eyebrows and they work wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>Jus received them and used them to remove a splinter that I&#x27;ve had for more than two weeks.</li>
            <li>Definitely some of the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>eventually get one or two more for around the house.</li>
            <li>and I know they have been kept safe from damage.</li>
            <li>Now I love these tweezers.</li>
            <li>and I have to try 3 times or more to get out the finer hairs.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t been shopping wherever they do, but these are better than anything I&#x27;ve ever had before or seen for sale in a store.  </li>
            <li>Even better than the two pack.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite purchase yet.</li>
            <li>I like that I didn&#x27;t have to spend more than $50 for it.</li>
            <li>I thought I would make a grand purchase and never need another tweezer.  </li>
            <li>I love them.  </li>
            <li>This keeps them safe and sharpened.  </li>
            <li>This probably does not matter to most consumers (and I&#x27;m not saying it should), but I have a number of bones to pick with that nation and would not knowingly order a product manufactured there.</li>
            <li>So glad I bought them.</li>
            <li>able to grab the tiniest hairs.</li>
            <li>There is no doubt that this is a top of the line product.</li>
            <li>Way better than the crappy tweezer I had been using.  </li>
            <li>I find I mostly use the angled ones though.  </li>
            <li>I love these tweezers.</li>
            <li>I was searching for a better quality than what the drug stores sell, this is not it..  </li>
            <li>I love em.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Buy them, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;ve bought many in an attempt to replicate a pair which were dropped &amp; dulled, none came close until I found these.  </li>
            <li>They grasp and hold better than any set of tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>Love the fact, they are guaranteed for life.</li>
            <li>Think I&#x27;ll purchase a couple more sets for Christmas presents.</li>
            <li>These tweezers are fantastic and they are just what I needed!</li>
            <li>Solidly constructed and weighty (in the best way).</li>
            <li>Plans are to order 2 more sets for the cars.</li>
            <li>Also the company follows up with email to confirm receipt and if pleased with their product.</li>
            <li>The steel has good spring and seems to be tempered right.</li>
            <li>Very nice variety and seem very well made.  </li>
            <li>nice three piece set, handy case to keep the set together, very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>My life has become easier now that I have obtained these great high quality tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The pouch is nothing special but handy so you don&#x27;t stab yourself.</li>
            <li>But for the money, they are pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Get a set and you will see how good they really are!</li>
            <li>Great tweezers, a little pricey, but great quality.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The tweezers can grab very fine hair, I don&#x27;t know if this information is important.</li>
            <li>The anodizing is top quality, and makes for easy identification.</li>
            <li>This is a nice set of tweezers with a variety of shapes which make them useful for many things.  </li>
            <li>The case is a nice touch and the company who supplies them is very polite and enthusiastic.</li>
            <li>These are, as most of the other comments mention, the very best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>I have used them for very fine hair where most tweezers won&#x27;t work and these do a super job.  </li>
            <li>Great professional set of tweezers.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty amazing the hairs you&#x27;ll be able to tweeze with a combination of these tweezers.</li>
            <li>However, keep in mind that the sharper it is, the more precise it is as well.</li>
            <li>Much better than my cheap drugstore purchase.  </li>
            <li>The different designs of the the three tweezers enable me to pick the ideal tool for the job.</li>
            <li>I bought this Bodyline Stainless Steel Tweezers and honestly, it has been such a perfect tool for ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>I love that it really is precise.</li>
            <li>I bought a set for my husband for Christmas and he loved them so much I bought a set for myself.  </li>
            <li>They are very similiar to the one that i had for 10 years and are of good quality.</li>
            <li>Good product fast shipping</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and good warranty.</li>
            <li>Loved them so much</li>
            <li>Be sure you get the 20% off coupon off the internet, worth every penny!</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and work as intended.  </li>
            <li>The case makes it easy to carry them anywhere.</li>
            <li>Love that kind of fast shipment.  </li>
            <li>Now I have 2 others that will easily take out any splinters as well.  </li>
            <li>These tweezers are nothing you&#x27;d find easily in a store.</li>
            <li>They work perfect for people with fine hair that other tweezers will not touch or pluck.</li>
            <li>She noted that the whole set was well crafted and very stylish.  </li>
            <li>Items are sturdy, come with a nice pouch and do exactly as one would expect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Tweezerman, Revlon, and Sally and these are hands down the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>Best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used, hands down.</li>
            <li>These are awesome, high quality metal and build from what I&#x27;ve seen so far.</li>
            <li>This is a handy assortment of extremely sharp implements, securely packaged and attractive.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t grip fine hairs as well as I would like.  </li>
            <li>This set of 3 tweezers is almost like a fine surgeon&#x27;s toolset.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy and thank previous reviews.</li>
            <li>Fine tools.</li>
            <li>To me, that&#x27;s a chance for damage to the fine tips.</li>
            <li>Received the tweezer set quickly and so far it&#x27;s working out GREAT.</li>
            <li>best little tweezer set I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>They do indeed remove tiny fine hairs, and are great for removing splinters.</li>
            <li>They are cheaply made replicas of Tweezerman which is what I thought I was ordering (my mistake).</li>
            <li>The Bodyline pointed tweezers are great but there is not as big a difference between this item and the Tweezerman pointed tweezers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the blue ones, but they should work well and the tips look great.</li>
            <li>Each are very sturdy and arrive in a nice carrying case.  </li>
            <li>Nice tweezers, made very well, and do what you expect them to do.</li>
            <li>I only use the slanted tweezers, but they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li>I got these to keep in my day pack after I got a splinter and couldn&#x27;t get it out with cheap pair at work (granted they were not designed for that purpose, but all I had access to at the time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>These tweezers are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>free  and precise tweezing.</li>
            <li>(To that end it would be nice if this wasn&#x27;t so much paper.)</li>
            <li>I can never use another cheap pair of Tweezers again after handling these.</li>
            <li>The jaws come precisely together</li>
            <li>The tips are precisely aligned, and I expect they will stay that way.</li>
            <li>I pluck daily and this set of tweezers are great.</li>
            <li>These tweezers are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Destroy ingrown hairs in the best way.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do yourself a favor and save up for these instead of buying the cheap ones.</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>I love having the three options of what to use as I&#x27;m always plucking right after I spy something.</li>
            <li>They are not kidding, these are flat out the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever had in my whole life.  </li>
            <li>course, the true test will be if these last longer than the Tweezerman slanted tweezers but for now, I am quite happy I switched to this product.</li>
            <li>They are high quality and come in a handy case so I always know where they are.  </li>
            <li>Case is nice, but since I use the tweezers every day, I would have liked a case that was easier to secure closed.  </li>
            <li>Now, I am glad to have them for eyebrows, facial hair, splinters and more!</li>
            <li>Who would have thought I could have gotten excited over a tweezer (or tweezers in this case), but I did.</li>
            <li>Although they come nicely encased in their own container and there are three direct types of tweezers, none of them are very functional.</li>
            <li>and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>These tweezers are definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>And I love that they come in a little vinyl case to keep them in great shape.</li>
            <li>I have ordered several sets of tweezers, these are by FAR the best.</li>
            <li>Very nice -- precise and sharp.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed using the stainless steel tweezers set.  </li>
            <li>I had been used to a different brand, but these have been superior.  </li>
            <li>Tweezers have good weight and balance which are definite musts for pain</li>
            <li>Finally a good set, Use it daily.</li>
            <li>bothered only by the prominent &amp;#34;MADE IN PAKISTAN&amp;#34; label on the package, which fortunately I was able to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Case is great to keep them clean and sharp.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The blue, sharp tweezers included in this set have not been the best for the purposes of pulling eyebrow hairs (I have not been able to get a good enough grip on even the shortest hairs)</li>
            <li>The quality is really 9/10 compared to high end tweezers from scientific research companies that cost many times more than this set for just one tool.</li>
            <li>I first used these to remove an extremely fine metal sliver, thinner than a hair and</li>
            <li>I go through them fairly quick.</li>
            <li>Great reviews led me to order a set of three when I really was looking for only a slant-tip tweezer.</li>
            <li>It is not cheap, but you get what you pay for: great quality, precise, your hair will not break when pulling it.</li>
            <li>Super grip.</li>
            <li>These tweezers arrived quickly and as described.  </li>
            <li>Super tweezers set will fulfill all your tweezing needs.</li>
            <li>super precision...</li>
            <li>imagine I have finally found the 3 best tweezers I have ever purchased, and each one has made it simple to remove them.  </li>
            <li>I feel that they are worthy of 5 Stars.</li>
            <li>highly recommend, you will love it.</li>
            <li>and I have been looking for good tweezers for a long time.</li>
            <li>These were shipped very quickly and all 3 tweezers are of very high quality.  </li>
            <li>I love the new tweezers set I received.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I agree that they are easy to use and really grab.</li>
            <li>The sharp pair is perfect for splinters and the other pair - outstanding for eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product that you are willing to back with a lifetime guarantee!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already gotten so much use out of them.. from tweezing my eyebrows to getting out splinters!!</li>
            <li>Great quality and sharp tips really help get the job done!</li>
            <li>These tweezers really are not for fine hairs or hairs just emerging.  </li>
            <li>Great for plucking eyebrows  or those little hairs on your chin.</li>
            <li>I have received a few follow up emails from Bodyline and it&#x27;s great to hear from them about their products and that they stand by their guarentee.  </li>
            <li>So much nicer than the cheap, pot-metal tweezers that are sold in the drug stores.  </li>
            <li>I need any replacements but so far, these are fantastic!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>The splinter tweezers in this set have come in extremely useful for ingrown hairs and a splinter in the foot of one of my children.  </li>
            <li>but the others may be useful for splinter removal.</li>
            <li>the case is nice, and feels like it&#x27;ll last.</li>
            <li>Without ANY doubt in my military mind these are the BEST tweezers I have ever seen and not only do you get ONE pair of them, you get THREE pair which can be used for about every mission you can think of - from the tiniest ingrown hair or a tick on your dog!&lt;br /&gt;GREAT deal from this company and Amazon here folks.</li>
            <li>well worth the money....</li>
            <li>I can tell you that they are well worth it.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s pricy, but I feel quality is worth the price....  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Well worth the $30 price.</li>
            <li>Your search is over, these tweezers are worth every penny.</li>
            <li>They are completely worth the price that I paid for them.</li>
            <li>...he&#x27;s lost several of his own pairs...</li>
            <li>Looked really good to the naked eye, under an Optivisor, not so much.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Completely worth the prIce.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a nice extra.  </li>
            <li>WELL WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
            <li>Very nice little pluckers.</li>
            <li>On the first try with the first one I took from the pouch, success!  </li>
            <li>I have a pair of Rubis slanted tweezers and these appear to be equally good and for the price, it includes two other types of tweezers.  </li>
            <li>I dropped them once on the floor and either they landed just right</li>
            <li>First using these new Bodyline ones, which came in a day with Prime which is great, they seemed awkward and for $30 I was not too happy.</li>
            <li>though I relied more on the Tweezerman pointed tweezers to do the job, I find that the slanted tweezers can remove short hairs far better than the Tweezerman does.  </li>
            <li>Stainless steel tweezers are adequate.  </li>
            <li>I am happy to not only have 3 sets of tweezers in the house, but ones that actually work.</li>
            <li>I loved the tweezers when I first purchased them, but within 3 months the tips wore down and they no longer grasped.  </li>
            <li>and I know he was very gentle in getting out the splinter.</li>
            <li>Good quality and even the little pouch seems well made.</li>
            <li>I will say, though, that the slanted tweezers are acceptable (not exceptional, but ok) and the faux leather case is nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m happy with my go to tweezers for the hard to get stuff.</li>
            <li>The third pair she said were just okay.</li>
            <li>had bought many sets before and finally found one that works.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that you can grab even a very short hair and pull it out the first time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had issues with tweezers that will fully compress and still not have enough gripping torque.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>The middle pair of tweezers are phenomenal .</li>
            <li>Highly recommend !!</li>
            <li>This is a must have in your purse, makeup bag, and bathroom drawer, as well as your first aid kit for splinters.</li>
            <li>The product is exactly as promoted in the webpage.</li>
            <li>I had been using a local store type of tweezers and thought they were working well, but then I was tearing skin more than pulling out ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>My most recent pair was from Mac cosmetic.  </li>
            <li>So far they have been fantastic</li>
            <li>but you definitely get more for the money with this set.</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t you know that not a day after I received these in the mail, I got my first splinter in years?</li>
            <li>They are exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>These are exactly what i needed.</li>
            <li>These tweezers really work!  </li>
            <li>These grab hairs first time, every time.  </li>
            <li>The silver splinter remover is nearly perfect, only the last 0.2mm are not symmetrical, but I would need a heavy magnifying lens some fine abrasive to adjust that.  </li>
            <li>The tips seems to be better than similarly priced items, and after going through a couple Tweezerman sets who&#x27;s tips quickly stopped lining up, I feel that these will be my new brand.</li>
            <li>Set of three different types of tweezers for this price, with this high quality, is a definite great buy.  </li>
            <li>I never thought I&#x27;d pay so much for tweezers, but when I thought of how many l&#x27;ve bought that didn&#x27;t last or work, I thought I&#x27;d give these a try.</li>
            <li>The three different shapes are good for the different jobs.</li>
            <li>High qualilty set and worth the price.</li>
            <li>Very high quality, put this in my first aid kit</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t take long for me to receive my order, which I love.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind since it just means it will be 3 times as long until I might need to buy tweezers again :-)</li>
            <li>Works pretty good on hard to pull hairs and slivers</li>
            <li>Like the vendor says, you must clean the tips regularly with alcohol or something similar to make sure that they DO work.  </li>
            <li>I certainly didn&#x27;t buy it for the case.</li>
            <li>Tweezers are supposed to meet at the tip to grip splinters, hairs and other very fine things.</li>
            <li>I bought atleast 5 different pairs in the past two months and none of them were good!</li>
            <li>These tweezers are very high quality</li>
            <li>very high quality</li>
            <li>Very high quality.</li>
            <li>Handy little case to pack them up in so they don&#x27;t get lost in the drawer.</li>
            <li>, I suppose, it is a nice little set</li>
            <li>They are great for doing my eyebrows, pulling out splinters, and even for picking up tiny little beads for craft projects.</li>
            <li>They each grip really well and the little holder is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>They are very well made.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know what all women use tweezers for and honestly, don&#x27;t really want to know.</li>
            <li>Amazon Prime shipping is fast, but it&#x27;s not that fast.</li>
            <li>They are made from a quality stainless steel and do not have to worry about rust.</li>
            <li>So much better than I had expected</li>
            <li>Beyond fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my daughter and she loves them so much I decided to get them also</li>
            <li>Absolute garbage.</li>
            <li>They are very versatile.</li>
            <li>and they are beefy.  </li>
            <li>High quality and utilitarian!</li>
            <li>Very please with these tweezers.  </li>
            <li>like I said quality factor is high, and use factor, I like!</li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>think 3 tweezers is a bit much</li>
            <li>I expected more for the price.</li>
            <li>I had expected something better than the ubiquitous Tweezerman, but these tweezers just aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>These tweezers tweeze very well.</li>
            <li>Come on, really?  </li>
            <li>or they are really sturdy because the tip didn&#x27;t break on those ones.</li>
            <li>And that was straight out of the box.</li>
            <li>That is why these reviews are so very helpful for something like tweezers.  </li>
            <li>The pouch is cheaply made, but that&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li>However the company sent me a pair same day I talked to them free of all charges..</li>
            <li>Good for thick hairs and that is about it.</li>
            <li>It always pays to spend a little more for the right equipment.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t found a use for the other two tweezers, but I&#x27;m sure I will.</li>
            <li>Really expensive but really good!</li>
            <li>Along with other users I found the slat tweezers to be OK.</li>
            <li>I mostly use the sharp tipped ones as i have a lot of ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>These are very well made high quality stainless steel tweezers.</li>
            <li>I have been using Tweezerman tweezers for years, not thinking that any other brand could compare even though the efficacy of the slanted tweezers greatly diminished within a year (the pointed ones remain sharp for longer).  </li>
            <li>These tweezers are high quality and having them in a case is convenient and safe, because they&#x27;re sharp.</li>
            <li>They come in a very nice case and are very sharp so be careful when handling.  </li>
            <li>Top flap folds down and is secured by a leather band that goes across the front of the case.  </li>
            <li>I use my new tweezers to pluck them out!  </li>
            <li>Very sharp and precise!  </li>
            <li>What I like most about them is they are very sharp which makes it easier to get the precision you desire.  </li>
            <li>I got it out easily with the slender-tip tweezer, with minimal tissue damage to my skin.</li>
            <li>recently purchased the Bodyline product and am amazed at how much more I like the slanted tweezers, especially.  </li>
            <li>I spent far more on Tweezerman (even with a discount) than on this</li>
            <li>The faux leather can have a tendency to rub against the tweezers and may overtime wear the finish of the tweezers especially the blue but cant think of a better way to do it.</li>
            <li>As I get older hair grows from places</li>
            <li>If you are just using them for simple thick hairs, they are great.</li>
            <li>These suckers are perfect and very sharp and make it easy to grab anything slightly under the skin and pull it out.  </li>
            <li>High quality for the money.</li>
            <li>high quality product, enables precision work</li>
            <li>Highly recomended for whatever your needs.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Very high quality metal used.</li>
            <li>High precision tools that exceeded my expectation.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this set for anyone looking for precision and comfort in a tweezer set.</li>
            <li>If the rest of their products are of this high quality then they&#x27;ve got a customer for life.     </li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I have been putting up with cheap annoying tweezers that don’t even work correctly for years… I didn’t know Tweezers could work this good!</li>
            <li>A little more than I wanted to pay</li>
            <li>The main pouch is pretty basic and the drawstring external pouch is even more basic.  </li>
            <li>I am in love with the thick pointed tweezers and will use these as my go to until my Tweezerman tweezers get shipped back to me after my free sharpening.</li>
            <li>Grateful for the guaranteed for life part because so many times tweezers lose their spring and ability to grasp after a few years.</li>
            <li>Perhaps making them slightly more heavy on the crimped end would prevent this from happening.</li>
            <li>Also, I really like the little travel case they came with because I just throw them in my purse and can easily find them.</li>
            <li>Based on the description, I expected that the tweezers would be very precise and able to grab very fine or stubborn hairs that other tweezer brands are unable to handle.</li>
            <li>They arrived in box that wasn&#x27;t sealed, the &amp;#34;leather&amp;#34; case is cheap plastic, and the tips not at all sharp.</li>
            <li>Sharp and precise.</li>
            <li>We have had these six months and they still perform as new.</li>
            <li>We live in the boonies, or off the grid as I say, and at times we encounter splinters, ticks, etc...</li>
            <li>After trying to pull out a fine splinter with no success, I looked at these under a magnifying glass.</li>
            <li>I only ever really use the flat-tipped tweezers and they are unquestionably better than the brand-name version I previously used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve wasted a lot of money on crappy, poor quality tweezers in my life -- these are the BEST I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Quality equal to or greater than much more expensive tweezers I have purchased.</li>
            <li>Worth the investment, as long as you don&#x27;t go misplacing them.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how poorly my old tweezers worked until I got these!</li>
            <li>Precise and sharp!</li>
            <li>These are very high quality tweezers, a night and day difference from the cheap flimsy ones I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li>They are very sharp and precise.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a high quality and professional set of tweezers!!!</li>
            <li>The previous tweezers I had before this I got for free with a nail clipper.</li>
            <li>It grabs all the little fine hairs.</li>
            <li>Case means one is less likely to lose one or more.</li>
            <li>Super sharp.</li>
            <li>These are super precise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I have been ruined for using any other tweezers.</li>
            <li>I was surprised when she ordered these.</li>
            <li>Because THESE blow the old ones out of the water!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So far, this product exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>I had no trouble tweezing my brows.</li>
            <li>They work very well, but I only use the slanted tweezer.</li>
            <li>WOW...</li>
            <li>Must be a bit cautious as none of the tweezers has a blunt edge, so use caution against sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So far I like these tweezers.  </li>
            <li>I also really like the 3 different types in one case.  </li>
            <li>What a difference a professional quality tweezers make.</li>
            <li>If they last, then the price will have been worth it even though I only wanted the one pair.  </li>
            <li>you can get the shortest of hair even the hair under the top layer to achieve those thin high arched eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;fantastic</li>
            <li>But next day,(I use tweezers for eyewbrows and upper lip area everyday), using them again I fell in love with them.</li>
            <li>Only had them a few days, but they work just fine.  </li>
            <li>Paid more than Tweezerman for these and two of them I can only figure are medical in nature, and the normal ones won&#x27;t even grip relatively thick hairs well.</li>
            <li>I agree with another reviewer that they are far superior to Tweezerman (and those little baby sized Tweezermans are just ridiculously ineffective).</li>
            <li>I also used the same tweezers on ingrown hairs in a very sensitive area.</li>
            <li>All of them are rather bulky in design and the tips are not sharp.  </li>
            <li>These definitely have the wow factor going on!</li>
            <li>Nothing major in my book.</li>
            <li>$8 Revlons, because these all seem to last the exact same amount of time, the cost is just different.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an esthetician and wax professionally for a living and whether you are using these for personal or professional use the product should hold up to its professional grade standard.  </li>
            <li>A little pricey, but worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Perfectly aligned.&lt;br /&gt;Our</li>
            <li>Within the first week of using the slanted tweezers, they have already dulled and slide past fine and course hairs and take a few pulls to remove hairs.  </li>
            <li>actually showed up a day early.  </li>
            <li>grip, no slipping what so ever.....</li>
            <li>I actually have thrown all our old tweezers thrown away.  </li>
            <li>I have my old pair in the second bathroom and using them is like using chopsticks.  </li>
            <li>I love the pointy tweezers, but I have to say the slanted tweezers were not great when I started using them.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought the case would be frivolous, but these tweezers are very sharp, and the case is all but required.</li>
            <li>I can only say I like it because I don&#x27;t have any other tweezers to compare the quality - these are my first one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hope I don&#x27;t get a splinter anytime soon, but if I do I will go right for the very sharp and pointed tip tweezer!</li>
            <li>These are sharp, high quality tools!</li>
            <li>I love to have slim/high arch, but I have hard time tweeze it to the way I want it when I use other tweezers.</li>
            <li>Because of their precision and extremely sharp pointed tip, I was able to lift the ingrown hairs with minimal disturbance to the skin and much less pain.</li>
            <li>The only flaw, that I can see, is that when dropped onto a hard surface (bathroom tile floor), the silver (&amp;#34;splinter&amp;#34;) tweezers became bent, and are seemingly impossible to get back to original shape, for proper gripping.  </li>

            <li> Nicely packaged, too</li>
            <li> Already used the pointy one to extricate a rose thorn</li>
            <li> They are very well made and the quality is superb.  </li>
            <li> Nice set of tweezers, I have bought two sets of them, one for home, one for travel.  </li>

            <li> These would make a nice gift.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of pot luck when you buy tweezers, as you cannot try them out before your purchase.  </li>
            <li> Really nice set.  </li>
            <li> The finish is good and easy to clean, the tips are ground very precise  and meet very good.</li>
            <li> These are the best set of high quality tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>

            <li> Thanks for a great product at a good price.</li>

            <li> Removes hairs and splinters very easily.</li>
            <li> I thought these would be great but are not as useful as my Lancone tweezers that I thought I lost.  </li>
            <li> Gave my wife my old pair of tweezers which she says are the best she&#x27;s ever used.</li>
            <li> By far the best tweezers we have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Also love the nice compact pouch they come in.</li>
            <li> I liked another brand better.</li>
            <li> I have very fine eyebrow &amp;#34;strays&amp;#34;, and Mr Pointy gets them every time.  </li>
            <li> I bought these for the very fine tip tweezers.</li>
            <li> I can grasp those strays easily!  </li>
            <li> They shipped very quickly and were here in no time!</li>
            <li> Each of the 3 tweezers have a very strong gripping power, which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always happy when the product is of higher quality than the packaging, which isn&#x27;t always the case.  </li>
            <li> Happily purchased the whole set again!</li>
            <li> Top notch.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it&#x27;s to use the feedback for improvement and not to try and get more people to buy them based on &amp;#34;good&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I thought the one pair (non-colored) looked more like a surgical tool than tweezers.</li>
            <li> better then the rest...</li>
            <li> I have never used better tweezers.</li>
            <li> Very happy to have a carrying case with these as well, definitely something that&#x27;s an added bonus.</li>
            <li> Glad for the case because of the sharpness of the pointed ones.</li>
            <li> The company followed up with a phone call making sure I received it. :)</li>
            <li> I picked up this Body Line pair of tweezers at the Body Line Spa and I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> I love that they have a lifetime warranty.</li>
            <li> I look forward to years of use from these tweezers, as well as learning which is best for each specific application.</li>
            <li> In fact buy more than 1 pair.</li>
            <li> Great product, very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Would rebuy though as these are the most uniform on the tip part that Ive been able to find.</li>
            <li> Love this set of tweezers.</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> Much better than tweezerman.</li>
            <li> I have used them several times on my eyebrows and they work wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> Jus received them and used them to remove a splinter that I&#x27;ve had for more than two weeks.</li>
            <li> Definitely some of the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> eventually get one or two more for around the house.</li>
            <li> and I know they have been kept safe from damage.</li>
            <li> Now I love these tweezers.</li>
            <li> and I have to try 3 times or more to get out the finer hairs.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t been shopping wherever they do, but these are better than anything I&#x27;ve ever had before or seen for sale in a store.  </li>
            <li> Even better than the two pack.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite purchase yet.</li>
            <li> I like that I didn&#x27;t have to spend more than $50 for it.</li>
            <li> I thought I would make a grand purchase and never need another tweezer.  </li>
            <li> I love them.  </li>
            <li> This keeps them safe and sharpened.  </li>
            <li> This probably does not matter to most consumers (and I&#x27;m not saying it should), but I have a number of bones to pick with that nation and would not knowingly order a product manufactured there.</li>
            <li> So glad I bought them.</li>
            <li> able to grab the tiniest hairs.</li>
            <li> There is no doubt that this is a top of the line product.</li>
            <li> Way better than the crappy tweezer I had been using.  </li>
            <li> I find I mostly use the angled ones though.  </li>
            <li> I love these tweezers.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a better quality than what the drug stores sell, this is not it..  </li>
            <li> I love em.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Buy them, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve bought many in an attempt to replicate a pair which were dropped &amp; dulled, none came close until I found these.  </li>
            <li> They grasp and hold better than any set of tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> Love the fact, they are guaranteed for life.</li>
            <li> Think I&#x27;ll purchase a couple more sets for Christmas presents.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are fantastic and they are just what I needed!</li>
            <li> Solidly constructed and weighty (in the best way).</li>
            <li> Plans are to order 2 more sets for the cars.</li>
            <li> Also the company follows up with email to confirm receipt and if pleased with their product.</li>
            <li> The steel has good spring and seems to be tempered right.</li>
            <li> Very nice variety and seem very well made.  </li>
            <li> nice three piece set, handy case to keep the set together, very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> My life has become easier now that I have obtained these great high quality tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pouch is nothing special but handy so you don&#x27;t stab yourself.</li>
            <li> But for the money, they are pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Get a set and you will see how good they really are!</li>
            <li> Great tweezers, a little pricey, but great quality.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The tweezers can grab very fine hair, I don&#x27;t know if this information is important.</li>
            <li> The anodizing is top quality, and makes for easy identification.</li>
            <li> This is a nice set of tweezers with a variety of shapes which make them useful for many things.  </li>
            <li> The case is a nice touch and the company who supplies them is very polite and enthusiastic.</li>
            <li> These are, as most of the other comments mention, the very best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> I have used them for very fine hair where most tweezers won&#x27;t work and these do a super job.  </li>
            <li> Great professional set of tweezers.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty amazing the hairs you&#x27;ll be able to tweeze with a combination of these tweezers.</li>
            <li> However, keep in mind that the sharper it is, the more precise it is as well.</li>
            <li> Much better than my cheap drugstore purchase.  </li>
            <li> The different designs of the the three tweezers enable me to pick the ideal tool for the job.</li>
            <li> I bought this Bodyline Stainless Steel Tweezers and honestly, it has been such a perfect tool for ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> I love that it really is precise.</li>
            <li> I bought a set for my husband for Christmas and he loved them so much I bought a set for myself.  </li>
            <li> They are very similiar to the one that i had for 10 years and are of good quality.</li>
            <li> Good product fast shipping</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and good warranty.</li>
            <li> Loved them so much</li>
            <li> Be sure you get the 20% off coupon off the internet, worth every penny!</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and work as intended.  </li>
            <li> The case makes it easy to carry them anywhere.</li>
            <li> Love that kind of fast shipment.  </li>
            <li> Now I have 2 others that will easily take out any splinters as well.  </li>
            <li> These tweezers are nothing you&#x27;d find easily in a store.</li>
            <li> They work perfect for people with fine hair that other tweezers will not touch or pluck.</li>
            <li> She noted that the whole set was well crafted and very stylish.  </li>
            <li> Items are sturdy, come with a nice pouch and do exactly as one would expect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Tweezerman, Revlon, and Sally and these are hands down the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used, hands down.</li>
            <li> These are awesome, high quality metal and build from what I&#x27;ve seen so far.</li>
            <li> This is a handy assortment of extremely sharp implements, securely packaged and attractive.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t grip fine hairs as well as I would like.  </li>
            <li> This set of 3 tweezers is almost like a fine surgeon&#x27;s toolset.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy and thank previous reviews.</li>
            <li> Fine tools.</li>
            <li> To me, that&#x27;s a chance for damage to the fine tips.</li>
            <li> Received the tweezer set quickly and so far it&#x27;s working out GREAT.</li>
            <li> best little tweezer set I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> They do indeed remove tiny fine hairs, and are great for removing splinters.</li>
            <li> They are cheaply made replicas of Tweezerman which is what I thought I was ordering (my mistake).</li>
            <li> The Bodyline pointed tweezers are great but there is not as big a difference between this item and the Tweezerman pointed tweezers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the blue ones, but they should work well and the tips look great.</li>
            <li> Each are very sturdy and arrive in a nice carrying case.  </li>
            <li> Nice tweezers, made very well, and do what you expect them to do.</li>
            <li> I only use the slanted tweezers, but they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li> I got these to keep in my day pack after I got a splinter and couldn&#x27;t get it out with cheap pair at work (granted they were not designed for that purpose, but all I had access to at the time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> These tweezers are fantastic.  </li>
            <li> free  and precise tweezing.</li>
            <li> (To that end it would be nice if this wasn&#x27;t so much paper.)</li>
            <li> I can never use another cheap pair of Tweezers again after handling these.</li>
            <li> The jaws come precisely together</li>
            <li> The tips are precisely aligned, and I expect they will stay that way.</li>
            <li> I pluck daily and this set of tweezers are great.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Destroy ingrown hairs in the best way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do yourself a favor and save up for these instead of buying the cheap ones.</li>
            <li> Enjoy.</li>
            <li> I love having the three options of what to use as I&#x27;m always plucking right after I spy something.</li>
            <li> They are not kidding, these are flat out the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever had in my whole life.  </li>
            <li> course, the true test will be if these last longer than the Tweezerman slanted tweezers but for now, I am quite happy I switched to this product.</li>
            <li> They are high quality and come in a handy case so I always know where they are.  </li>
            <li> Case is nice, but since I use the tweezers every day, I would have liked a case that was easier to secure closed.  </li>
            <li> Now, I am glad to have them for eyebrows, facial hair, splinters and more!</li>
            <li> Who would have thought I could have gotten excited over a tweezer (or tweezers in this case), but I did.</li>
            <li> Although they come nicely encased in their own container and there are three direct types of tweezers, none of them are very functional.</li>
            <li> and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> And I love that they come in a little vinyl case to keep them in great shape.</li>
            <li> I have ordered several sets of tweezers, these are by FAR the best.</li>
            <li> Very nice -- precise and sharp.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using the stainless steel tweezers set.  </li>
            <li> I had been used to a different brand, but these have been superior.  </li>
            <li> Tweezers have good weight and balance which are definite musts for pain</li>
            <li> Finally a good set, Use it daily.</li>
            <li> bothered only by the prominent &amp;#34;MADE IN PAKISTAN&amp;#34; label on the package, which fortunately I was able to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Case is great to keep them clean and sharp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The blue, sharp tweezers included in this set have not been the best for the purposes of pulling eyebrow hairs (I have not been able to get a good enough grip on even the shortest hairs)</li>
            <li> The quality is really 9/10 compared to high end tweezers from scientific research companies that cost many times more than this set for just one tool.</li>
            <li> I first used these to remove an extremely fine metal sliver, thinner than a hair and</li>
            <li> I go through them fairly quick.</li>
            <li> Great reviews led me to order a set of three when I really was looking for only a slant-tip tweezer.</li>
            <li> It is not cheap, but you get what you pay for: great quality, precise, your hair will not break when pulling it.</li>
            <li> Super grip.</li>
            <li> These tweezers arrived quickly and as described.  </li>
            <li> Super tweezers set will fulfill all your tweezing needs.</li>
            <li> super precision...</li>
            <li> imagine I have finally found the 3 best tweezers I have ever purchased, and each one has made it simple to remove them.  </li>
            <li> I feel that they are worthy of 5 Stars.</li>
            <li> highly recommend, you will love it.</li>
            <li> and I have been looking for good tweezers for a long time.</li>
            <li> These were shipped very quickly and all 3 tweezers are of very high quality.  </li>
            <li> I love the new tweezers set I received.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I agree that they are easy to use and really grab.</li>
            <li> The sharp pair is perfect for splinters and the other pair - outstanding for eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product that you are willing to back with a lifetime guarantee!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already gotten so much use out of them.. from tweezing my eyebrows to getting out splinters!!</li>
            <li> Great quality and sharp tips really help get the job done!</li>
            <li> These tweezers really are not for fine hairs or hairs just emerging.  </li>
            <li> Great for plucking eyebrows  or those little hairs on your chin.</li>
            <li> I have received a few follow up emails from Bodyline and it&#x27;s great to hear from them about their products and that they stand by their guarentee.  </li>
            <li> So much nicer than the cheap, pot-metal tweezers that are sold in the drug stores.  </li>
            <li> I need any replacements but so far, these are fantastic!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> The splinter tweezers in this set have come in extremely useful for ingrown hairs and a splinter in the foot of one of my children.  </li>
            <li> but the others may be useful for splinter removal.</li>
            <li> the case is nice, and feels like it&#x27;ll last.</li>
            <li> Without ANY doubt in my military mind these are the BEST tweezers I have ever seen and not only do you get ONE pair of them, you get THREE pair which can be used for about every mission you can think of - from the tiniest ingrown hair or a tick on your dog!&lt;br /&gt;GREAT deal from this company and Amazon here folks.</li>
            <li> well worth the money....</li>
            <li> I can tell you that they are well worth it.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s pricy, but I feel quality is worth the price....  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Well worth the $30 price.</li>
            <li> Your search is over, these tweezers are worth every penny.</li>
            <li> They are completely worth the price that I paid for them.</li>
            <li> ...he&#x27;s lost several of his own pairs...</li>
            <li> Looked really good to the naked eye, under an Optivisor, not so much.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Completely worth the prIce.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a nice extra.  </li>
            <li> WELL WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
            <li> Very nice little pluckers.</li>
            <li> On the first try with the first one I took from the pouch, success!  </li>
            <li> I have a pair of Rubis slanted tweezers and these appear to be equally good and for the price, it includes two other types of tweezers.  </li>
            <li> I dropped them once on the floor and either they landed just right</li>
            <li> First using these new Bodyline ones, which came in a day with Prime which is great, they seemed awkward and for $30 I was not too happy.</li>
            <li> though I relied more on the Tweezerman pointed tweezers to do the job, I find that the slanted tweezers can remove short hairs far better than the Tweezerman does.  </li>
            <li> Stainless steel tweezers are adequate.  </li>
            <li> I am happy to not only have 3 sets of tweezers in the house, but ones that actually work.</li>
            <li> I loved the tweezers when I first purchased them, but within 3 months the tips wore down and they no longer grasped.  </li>
            <li> and I know he was very gentle in getting out the splinter.</li>
            <li> Good quality and even the little pouch seems well made.</li>
            <li> I will say, though, that the slanted tweezers are acceptable (not exceptional, but ok) and the faux leather case is nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with my go to tweezers for the hard to get stuff.</li>
            <li> The third pair she said were just okay.</li>
            <li> had bought many sets before and finally found one that works.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that you can grab even a very short hair and pull it out the first time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had issues with tweezers that will fully compress and still not have enough gripping torque.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> The middle pair of tweezers are phenomenal .</li>
            <li> Highly recommend !!</li>
            <li> This is a must have in your purse, makeup bag, and bathroom drawer, as well as your first aid kit for splinters.</li>
            <li> The product is exactly as promoted in the webpage.</li>
            <li> I had been using a local store type of tweezers and thought they were working well, but then I was tearing skin more than pulling out ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> My most recent pair was from Mac cosmetic.  </li>
            <li> So far they have been fantastic</li>
            <li> but you definitely get more for the money with this set.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t you know that not a day after I received these in the mail, I got my first splinter in years?</li>
            <li> They are exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> These are exactly what i needed.</li>
            <li> These tweezers really work!  </li>
            <li> These grab hairs first time, every time.  </li>
            <li> The silver splinter remover is nearly perfect, only the last 0.2mm are not symmetrical, but I would need a heavy magnifying lens some fine abrasive to adjust that.  </li>
            <li> The tips seems to be better than similarly priced items, and after going through a couple Tweezerman sets who&#x27;s tips quickly stopped lining up, I feel that these will be my new brand.</li>
            <li> Set of three different types of tweezers for this price, with this high quality, is a definite great buy.  </li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d pay so much for tweezers, but when I thought of how many l&#x27;ve bought that didn&#x27;t last or work, I thought I&#x27;d give these a try.</li>
            <li> The three different shapes are good for the different jobs.</li>
            <li> High qualilty set and worth the price.</li>
            <li> Very high quality, put this in my first aid kit</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take long for me to receive my order, which I love.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind since it just means it will be 3 times as long until I might need to buy tweezers again :-)</li>
            <li> Works pretty good on hard to pull hairs and slivers</li>
            <li> Like the vendor says, you must clean the tips regularly with alcohol or something similar to make sure that they DO work.  </li>
            <li> I certainly didn&#x27;t buy it for the case.</li>
            <li> Tweezers are supposed to meet at the tip to grip splinters, hairs and other very fine things.</li>
            <li> I bought atleast 5 different pairs in the past two months and none of them were good!</li>
            <li> These tweezers are very high quality</li>
            <li> very high quality</li>
            <li> Very high quality.</li>
            <li> Handy little case to pack them up in so they don&#x27;t get lost in the drawer.</li>
            <li> , I suppose, it is a nice little set</li>
            <li> They are great for doing my eyebrows, pulling out splinters, and even for picking up tiny little beads for craft projects.</li>
            <li> They each grip really well and the little holder is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> They are very well made.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know what all women use tweezers for and honestly, don&#x27;t really want to know.</li>
            <li> Amazon Prime shipping is fast, but it&#x27;s not that fast.</li>
            <li> They are made from a quality stainless steel and do not have to worry about rust.</li>
            <li> So much better than I had expected</li>
            <li> Beyond fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter and she loves them so much I decided to get them also</li>
            <li> Absolute garbage.</li>
            <li> They are very versatile.</li>
            <li> and they are beefy.  </li>
            <li> High quality and utilitarian!</li>
            <li> Very please with these tweezers.  </li>
            <li> like I said quality factor is high, and use factor, I like!</li>
            <li> highly recommend!</li>
            <li> think 3 tweezers is a bit much</li>
            <li> I expected more for the price.</li>
            <li> I had expected something better than the ubiquitous Tweezerman, but these tweezers just aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> These tweezers tweeze very well.</li>
            <li> Come on, really?  </li>
            <li> or they are really sturdy because the tip didn&#x27;t break on those ones.</li>
            <li> And that was straight out of the box.</li>
            <li> That is why these reviews are so very helpful for something like tweezers.  </li>
            <li> The pouch is cheaply made, but that&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> However the company sent me a pair same day I talked to them free of all charges..</li>
            <li> Good for thick hairs and that is about it.</li>
            <li> It always pays to spend a little more for the right equipment.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t found a use for the other two tweezers, but I&#x27;m sure I will.</li>
            <li> Really expensive but really good!</li>
            <li> Along with other users I found the slat tweezers to be OK.</li>
            <li> I mostly use the sharp tipped ones as i have a lot of ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> These are very well made high quality stainless steel tweezers.</li>
            <li> I have been using Tweezerman tweezers for years, not thinking that any other brand could compare even though the efficacy of the slanted tweezers greatly diminished within a year (the pointed ones remain sharp for longer).  </li>
            <li> These tweezers are high quality and having them in a case is convenient and safe, because they&#x27;re sharp.</li>
            <li> They come in a very nice case and are very sharp so be careful when handling.  </li>
            <li> Top flap folds down and is secured by a leather band that goes across the front of the case.  </li>
            <li> I use my new tweezers to pluck them out!  </li>
            <li> Very sharp and precise!  </li>
            <li> What I like most about them is they are very sharp which makes it easier to get the precision you desire.  </li>
            <li> I got it out easily with the slender-tip tweezer, with minimal tissue damage to my skin.</li>
            <li> recently purchased the Bodyline product and am amazed at how much more I like the slanted tweezers, especially.  </li>
            <li> I spent far more on Tweezerman (even with a discount) than on this</li>
            <li> The faux leather can have a tendency to rub against the tweezers and may overtime wear the finish of the tweezers especially the blue but cant think of a better way to do it.</li>
            <li> As I get older hair grows from places</li>
            <li> If you are just using them for simple thick hairs, they are great.</li>
            <li> These suckers are perfect and very sharp and make it easy to grab anything slightly under the skin and pull it out.  </li>
            <li> High quality for the money.</li>
            <li> high quality product, enables precision work</li>
            <li> Highly recomended for whatever your needs.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very high quality metal used.</li>
            <li> High precision tools that exceeded my expectation.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this set for anyone looking for precision and comfort in a tweezer set.</li>
            <li> If the rest of their products are of this high quality then they&#x27;ve got a customer for life.     </li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I have been putting up with cheap annoying tweezers that don’t even work correctly for years… I didn’t know Tweezers could work this good!</li>
            <li> A little more than I wanted to pay</li>
            <li> The main pouch is pretty basic and the drawstring external pouch is even more basic.  </li>
            <li> I am in love with the thick pointed tweezers and will use these as my go to until my Tweezerman tweezers get shipped back to me after my free sharpening.</li>
            <li> Grateful for the guaranteed for life part because so many times tweezers lose their spring and ability to grasp after a few years.</li>
            <li> Perhaps making them slightly more heavy on the crimped end would prevent this from happening.</li>
            <li> Also, I really like the little travel case they came with because I just throw them in my purse and can easily find them.</li>
            <li> Based on the description, I expected that the tweezers would be very precise and able to grab very fine or stubborn hairs that other tweezer brands are unable to handle.</li>
            <li> They arrived in box that wasn&#x27;t sealed, the &amp;#34;leather&amp;#34; case is cheap plastic, and the tips not at all sharp.</li>
            <li> Sharp and precise.</li>
            <li> We have had these six months and they still perform as new.</li>
            <li> We live in the boonies, or off the grid as I say, and at times we encounter splinters, ticks, etc...</li>
            <li> After trying to pull out a fine splinter with no success, I looked at these under a magnifying glass.</li>
            <li> I only ever really use the flat-tipped tweezers and they are unquestionably better than the brand-name version I previously used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wasted a lot of money on crappy, poor quality tweezers in my life -- these are the BEST I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Quality equal to or greater than much more expensive tweezers I have purchased.</li>
            <li> Worth the investment, as long as you don&#x27;t go misplacing them.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how poorly my old tweezers worked until I got these!</li>
            <li> Precise and sharp!</li>
            <li> These are very high quality tweezers, a night and day difference from the cheap flimsy ones I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp and precise.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a high quality and professional set of tweezers!!!</li>
            <li> The previous tweezers I had before this I got for free with a nail clipper.</li>
            <li> It grabs all the little fine hairs.</li>
            <li> Case means one is less likely to lose one or more.</li>
            <li> Super sharp.</li>
            <li> These are super precise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I have been ruined for using any other tweezers.</li>
            <li> I was surprised when she ordered these.</li>
            <li> Because THESE blow the old ones out of the water!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So far, this product exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I had no trouble tweezing my brows.</li>
            <li> They work very well, but I only use the slanted tweezer.</li>
            <li> WOW...</li>
            <li> Must be a bit cautious as none of the tweezers has a blunt edge, so use caution against sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So far I like these tweezers.  </li>
            <li> I also really like the 3 different types in one case.  </li>
            <li> What a difference a professional quality tweezers make.</li>
            <li> If they last, then the price will have been worth it even though I only wanted the one pair.  </li>
            <li> you can get the shortest of hair even the hair under the top layer to achieve those thin high arched eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;fantastic</li>
            <li> But next day,(I use tweezers for eyewbrows and upper lip area everyday), using them again I fell in love with them.</li>
            <li> Only had them a few days, but they work just fine.  </li>
            <li> Paid more than Tweezerman for these and two of them I can only figure are medical in nature, and the normal ones won&#x27;t even grip relatively thick hairs well.</li>
            <li> I agree with another reviewer that they are far superior to Tweezerman (and those little baby sized Tweezermans are just ridiculously ineffective).</li>
            <li> I also used the same tweezers on ingrown hairs in a very sensitive area.</li>
            <li> All of them are rather bulky in design and the tips are not sharp.  </li>
            <li> These definitely have the wow factor going on!</li>
            <li> Nothing major in my book.</li>
            <li> $8 Revlons, because these all seem to last the exact same amount of time, the cost is just different.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an esthetician and wax professionally for a living and whether you are using these for personal or professional use the product should hold up to its professional grade standard.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey, but worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Perfectly aligned.&lt;br /&gt;Our</li>
            <li> Within the first week of using the slanted tweezers, they have already dulled and slide past fine and course hairs and take a few pulls to remove hairs.  </li>
            <li> actually showed up a day early.  </li>
            <li> grip, no slipping what so ever.....</li>
            <li> I actually have thrown all our old tweezers thrown away.  </li>
            <li> I have my old pair in the second bathroom and using them is like using chopsticks.  </li>
            <li> I love the pointy tweezers, but I have to say the slanted tweezers were not great when I started using them.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought the case would be frivolous, but these tweezers are very sharp, and the case is all but required.</li>
            <li> I can only say I like it because I don&#x27;t have any other tweezers to compare the quality - these are my first one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hope I don&#x27;t get a splinter anytime soon, but if I do I will go right for the very sharp and pointed tip tweezer!</li>
            <li> These are sharp, high quality tools!</li>
            <li> I love to have slim/high arch, but I have hard time tweeze it to the way I want it when I use other tweezers.</li>
            <li> Because of their precision and extremely sharp pointed tip, I was able to lift the ingrown hairs with minimal disturbance to the skin and much less pain.</li>
            <li> The only flaw, that I can see, is that when dropped onto a hard surface (bathroom tile floor), the silver (&amp;#34;splinter&amp;#34;) tweezers became bent, and are seemingly impossible to get back to original shape, for proper gripping.  </li>
            <li> The slant nose tweezers have a very tight grip, but I haven&#x27;t had much use for the pointed tweezers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether I should return these through Amazon or work through Bodyline Skin Care to resolve the issue, so if either party wants to weigh in on this, please do.</li>
            <li> They are sharp enough to pull out tiny slivers or hairs, and sharp enough to cut if you are not careful.  </li>
            <li> The blue pointed tweezers are too thick and stubby to be of much use.</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with this set as it is made nice and has a few options for your tweezing needs.</li>
            <li> There seems to be a very, very small &amp;#34;sweet spot&amp;#34; along one edge that I occasionally find purely by accident.</li>
            <li> These can grab the finest hairs on the first go, there is some serious precision work here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m bringing this matter up here simply to inform other potential buyers, in case they feel as I do.</li>
            <li> Slant nose tweezers arrived grey instead of blue, but seller said this is due to a necessary change in production and did not affect the quality.</li>
            <li> Just received them, so I don&#x27;t know as yet how long and</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s why I spent extra for this kit</li>
            <li> we keep these gems hidden and make him deal with the generic drugstore pairs we keep in the open!</li>
            <li> The black pair is the general pair I use</li>
            <li> I kept the card tucked in the back of the pouch like other reviewers have mentioned just in case</li>
            <li> The main complaint she had was two of the pairs of tweezers don&#x27;t close all the way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought the same quality tweezers for much less in the stores.</li>
            <li> These are precision machined, not pressed or stamped, and the tweezer bodies are wide, meaning that there is extra stability that doesn&#x27;t let the business end of the tweezers get out of alignment even a little bit.</li>
            <li> Not Very Useful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must agree with the lower rated reviews.  </li>
            <li> Not much tor review.</li>
            <li> Money well spent.</li>
            <li> Hopefully that&#x27;ll make them harder to lose.</li>
            <li> Not only did I create quite a mark on my face, but I wasted a lot of time.  </li>
            <li> I was elated that these tweezers grabbed very short, stiff hairs.  </li>
            <li> Really sharp, so be careful.</li>
            <li> Expensive but high quality and a selection of blade widths for different purposes.</li>
            <li> She said that made them useless on very fine thin hairs.</li>
            <li> These tweezers (especially the black one, which is my work horse) are heavy.</li>
            <li> I can throw away all the other brands of tweezers I have accumulated.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re sharp and work so well.</li>
            <li> The extreme sharpness of these tweezers caught me off guard, so use with precaution.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to research how to use the other tweezers.</li>
            <li> Other brands I&#x27;ve used do not have the precision these tweezers do.</li>
            <li> I am still not sure why someone would need three styles as two are very similar.</li>
            <li> I tried and discarded each other set in the house.  </li>
            <li> The needle nose tweezers are alot thicker than any other needle nose tweezers ive used.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and aligned.  </li>
            <li> These are extremely well made tweezers.</li>
            <li> Be careful though, they&#x27;re a bit sharp!</li>
            <li> They are very sharp, so be careful.</li>
            <li> AND IN A POUCH THAT CAN BE HIDDEN FROM OTHER PICKING FAMILY MEMBERS</li>
            <li> I had a pair of tweezers that lasted about 10 years that recently went dull and no longer worked.</li>
            <li> no more than 1 or 2 mm long.</li>
            <li> My bigger complaint is that the company added me to their email list.</li>
            <li> They are also very sharp without any burrs.  </li>
            <li> The leather case allows me to keep these &amp;#34;weapons&amp;#34; in my purse -- they are VERY sharp.  </li>
            <li> They are very sharp and take care of all my tweezing needs.</li>
            <li> Breaks the hairs in half and can not grab the shorter ones.</li>
            <li> the finer point tweezers have served pointless for me, they make me want to give this 3 stars, however the conventional tweezers along with the case make up for them a bit, although they are starting to dull out, they have lasted a bit longer than the average pair of tweezers, Im not sure if that is due to the tweezers themselves or the case.</li>
            <li> could get the tiniest thinest little hairs.....and the little stubbies......and no breakage when pulling.....</li>
            <li> A suggestion: fold and insert the Amazon receipt in the little faux leather case for if/when you need them resharpened.</li>
            <li> but i was a little nervous about the price being that ive never heard of this brand before.</li>
            <li> This Tweezers set arrived in a few days after being ordered.</li>
            <li> Had my old one for about 10 years and it dropped on the floor and was useless.</li>
            <li> I have went through quite a few.  </li>
            <li> I plan to give a few sets of these as gifts.</li>
            <li> I keep waiting for it to fail - and so far it hasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that grabbed tough hairs, and unfortunately I did not find that these helped very much.</li>
            <li> But I am forced to buy 2 other tweezers I don&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li> No more breaking my skin or missing a stray hair.</li>
            <li> I threw out all my other tweezers!!!</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t bad quality, though I much prefer the tweezerman brand that I returned these to buy.  </li>
            <li> Not much more to say about tweezers...</li>
            <li> I can add my clippers and small scissors to the pack without loosing the items.  </li>
            <li> Until they were used gingerly by my husband to get out a small splinter in his hand.</li>
            <li> In the past I had to resort to an x-acto knife approach, which always tore up my skin quite a bit.</li>
            <li> But as it is, I&#x27;m not sure where it&#x27;s made; so I&#x27;ll assume it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> HEAVY!</li>
            <li> I have purchased too many tweezers that I care to mention in a battle for my chin growing trees,  and now I have 3 times the chances of getting those nasty tree stumps</li>
            <li> not sure how.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to get these out with my old tweezers</li>
            <li> Less broken skin means fewer scars/blemishes.</li>
            <li> They are hard to find so I would buy if you have been looking for quality tweezers.</li>
            <li> Got dull within 2 weeks. .disappointed</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re tired of dull tweezers that don&#x27;t get those small hairs, try these out.</li>
            <li> seriously</li>
            <li> These are not nearly as good as the Rubis.</li>
            <li> The worst part, the first one came the day after I ordered them.</li>
            <li> On a side note, as annoying as those emails can be (especially since they came to my account and not my wife&#x27;s, who was the one using them), I do respect the company for trying to get feedback on their products.</li>
            <li> I mean, one cannot go wrong with these guys.</li>
            <li> How wrong</li>
            <li> The silver pointed tweezers are virtually useless when trying to use the pointed tips to grab the hairs.</li>
            <li> How can you go wrong with a lifetime guarantee?  </li>
            <li> These tweezers have a terrible time picking up smaller and finer hairs.</li>
            <li> They are expensive, but there are 3 of them.  </li>
            <li> Not that the silver ones are bad, In fact they work</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t think anyone would be disappointed with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Disappointed...</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> others have said, the seller can be a bit annoying asking for reviews of these tweezers.</li>
            <li> - those tweezers are now made in China and are totally worthless.</li>
            <li> I will try to keep these bad boys forever!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this tweezer set.</li>
            <li> These are terrible tweezers.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> High quality for the money.</li>
            <li> Great product, completely worth the price, I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li> These are very high quality tweezers, a night and day difference from the cheap flimsy ones I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> The best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned.  It grabs all the little fine hairs. I threw out all my other tweezers!!!</li>
            <li> These are, as most of the other comments mention, the very best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever had.  It&#x27;s so obvious they are made to such exacting standards.  I would definitely recommend them to anybody looking for a tweezer set that will last years and years.</li>
            <li> These are very good quality twizzers. Precision precision precision</li>
            <li> Very good set.. Use these to remove splinters in my hands after a day of woodworking.</li>
            <li> Great tweezers! I bought them for ingrown hairs on my cheeks &amp; chin. They work great! Less broken skin means fewer scars/blemishes.</li>
            <li> Very nice little pluckers. The unibrow is gone!</li>
            <li> I thought these would be great but are not as useful as my Lancone tweezers that I thought I lost.  They don&#x27;t grip fine hairs as well as I would like.  Thankfully I found my Lancome tweezers.</li>
            <li> Great set of tweezers with a lifetime guarantee</li>
            <li> I am very glad I bought these. They are very well made. You get what you pay for. Top notch.</li>
            <li> Great, quality product. Haven&#x27;t found a use for the other two tweezers, but I&#x27;m sure I will.</li>
            <li> work&#x27;s good i, like them alot</li>
            <li> This Tweezers set arrived in a few days after being ordered. It is a Christmas gift for a family member.  The tweezers look great and I&#x27;m trusting that they will perform as advertized.</li>
            <li> These are terrible tweezers. They are cheaply made replicas of Tweezerman which is what I thought I was ordering (my mistake). They arrived in box that wasn&#x27;t sealed, the &amp;#34;leather&amp;#34; case is cheap plastic, and the tips not at all sharp.</li>
            <li> These are excellent tweezers and very well priced!</li>
            <li> high quality product, enables precision work</li>
            <li> My wife loves this set, I just used the splinter remover to get a tiny metal shaving out of my finger.</li>
            <li> the finer point tweezers have served pointless for me, they make me want to give this 3 stars, however the conventional tweezers along with the case make up for them a bit, although they are starting to dull out, they have lasted a bit longer than the average pair of tweezers, Im not sure if that is due to the tweezers themselves or the case. I go through them fairly quick.</li>
            <li> My wife bought these for her own use. She had a pair of Tweezerman tweezers that were lost. I really don&#x27;t know what all women use tweezers for and honestly, don&#x27;t really want to know. I use tweezers if I get a splinter. I was surprised when she ordered these. We have an Amazon system in our house. My wife, kids and mom all sign into my account when they are ordering something. They put the items in the cart then I check the next day. Look to see if there&#x27;s anything else we need and place the order. The last time I looked there were two pairs of Tweezerman tweezers in the cart, but my wife had sent a text telling me not to order them yet. She had found these Bodyline tweezers and wanted to read up on them when she got time. She of course decided to buy these. She wasn&#x27;t happy with them once they came. The main complaint she had was two of the pairs of tweezers don&#x27;t close all the way. She said that made them useless on very fine thin hairs. The third pair she said were just okay. So she returned them and bought two different pairs of Tweezerman tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have said, the seller can be a bit annoying asking for reviews of these tweezers. I received 5 emails asking for a review. The worst part, the first one came the day after I ordered them. Amazon Prime shipping is fast, but it&#x27;s not that fast. On a side note, as annoying as those emails can be (especially since they came to my account and not my wife&#x27;s, who was the one using them), I do respect the company for trying to get feedback on their products. Hopefully it&#x27;s to use the feedback for improvement and not to try and get more people to buy them based on &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I was fair in a 3 star rating. If it were me, the one working pair would have been enough, though that would make it overpriced for one pair. I thought the one pair (non-colored) looked more like a surgical tool than tweezers.</li>
            <li> better then the rest...seriously</li>
            <li> Very nice design and case.  I will try to keep these bad boys forever!</li>
            <li> Best tweezers EVER! I have never used better tweezers.</li>
            <li> I took a while after receiving these to write a review and I gotta say that these are some of the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever had. I love having the three options of what to use as I&#x27;m always plucking right after I spy something. Very happy to have a carrying case with these as well, definitely something that&#x27;s an added bonus. I kept the card tucked in the back of the pouch like other reviewers have mentioned just in case I need any replacements but so far, these are fantastic!</li>
            <li> These tweezers are great. They will grab and hold the tiniest hairs I can see. Nicely packaged, too</li>
            <li> Stainless Steel Tweezers were excellent quality and great customer service</li>
            <li> Set of three different types of tweezers for this price, with this high quality, is a definite great buy.  Just received them, so I don&#x27;t know as yet how long and well they will last, but after trying them, I am definitely hopeful.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using the stainless steel tweezers set.  These tweezers are very good to get at splenters or for any use that requires the use of tweezers</li>
            <li> I have ordered several sets of tweezers, these are by FAR the best.They do indeed remove tiny fine hairs, and are great for removing splinters.</li>
            <li> Received the tweezer set quickly and so far it&#x27;s working out GREAT. Glad for the case because of the sharpness of the pointed ones. The company followed up with a phone call making sure I received it. :)</li>
            <li> they are the best tweezers I&#x27;ve used. The finish is good and easy to clean, the tips are ground very precise  and meet very good. The steel has good spring and seems to be tempered right. The case is leather and keeps them together and protects them.</li>
            <li> Very high quality, put this in my first aid kit</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.  I have very fine eyebrow &amp;#34;strays&amp;#34;, and Mr Pointy gets them every time.  We have had these six months and they still perform as new.</li>
            <li> I love the new tweezers set I received.&lt;br /&gt;I had bought many sets before and finally found one that works.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
            <li> Perfect set going to buy another one for my husband!</li>
            <li> These are the best tweezers I have ever bought.  Very sharp and precise!  I love that you can grab even a very short hair and pull it out the first time.</li>
            <li> I picked up this Body Line pair of tweezers at the Body Line Spa and I absolutely love them. You can remove anything from the tiniest, finest hairs to the thickest, stubborn coarse hairs with one fell swoop. The nose is perfectly slanted to help you get the fine hairs out. Also, I really like the little travel case they came with because I just throw them in my purse and can easily find them. They are made from a quality stainless steel and do not have to worry about rust. Definitely a great investment!</li>
            <li> I have been using Tweezerman tweezers for years, not thinking that any other brand could compare even though the efficacy of the slanted tweezers greatly diminished within a year (the pointed ones remain sharp for longer).  How wrong I was!&lt;br /&gt;I recently purchased the Bodyline product and am amazed at how much more I like the slanted tweezers, especially.  I tweeze under my eyebrows every day and though I relied more on the Tweezerman pointed tweezers to do the job, I find that the slanted tweezers can remove short hairs far better than the Tweezerman does.  The Bodyline pointed tweezers are great but there is not as big a difference between this item and the Tweezerman pointed tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;The blue, sharp tweezers included in this set have not been the best for the purposes of pulling eyebrow hairs (I have not been able to get a good enough grip on even the shortest hairs) but I can see how they would be great for removing splinters.&lt;br /&gt;Besides the quality of these tweezers is the cost difference between Tweezerman and this product.  I spent far more on Tweezerman (even with a discount) than on this set.&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the true test will be if these last longer than the Tweezerman slanted tweezers but for now, I am quite happy I switched to this product.</li>
            <li> I love that they have a lifetime warranty.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price!</li>
            <li> I bought a set for my husband for Christmas and he loved them so much I bought a set for myself.  Excellent quality. I can throw away all the other brands of tweezers I have accumulated.</li>
            <li> These are the best tweezers I&#x27;ve used in many years and I appreciate the 4 different head types in this set.  I&#x27;ve bought all the high-end brands, but these work best for me. Thanks for a great product at a good price.</li>
            <li> This is a nice set of tweezers with a variety of shapes which make them useful for many things.  Handy little case to pack them up in so they don&#x27;t get lost in the drawer.</li>
            <li> These are the best tweezers I have had.  The needle-nose and slanted ones are especially good.  I&#x27;m getting another set for a gift.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always happy when the product is of higher quality than the packaging, which isn&#x27;t always the case.  This set of 3 tweezers is almost like a fine surgeon&#x27;s toolset.  The fit and finish is very impressive, just enough spring tension to hold the ends apart.  The main pouch is pretty basic and the drawstring external pouch is even more basic.  I look forward to years of use from these tweezers, as well as learning which is best for each specific application.</li>
            <li> Love these tweezers!  I&#x27;m thinking of getting another set to have in my travel case...they&#x27;re sharp and work so well.</li>
            <li> So much better than I had expected</li>
            <li> I like tweezers.  THese are good quality.</li>
            <li> Great reviews led me to order a set of three when I really was looking for only a slant-tip tweezer. I agree that they are easy to use and really grab. I hope I don&#x27;t get a splinter anytime soon, but if I do I will go right for the very sharp and pointed tip tweezer!</li>
            <li> Best tweezers I have ever seen or used. I don&#x27;t know why I have not found and purchased these earlier.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are high quality and having them in a case is convenient and safe, because they&#x27;re sharp.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for tweezers! In fact buy more than 1 pair. Would make a great gift!</li>
            <li> NO CONS ---- Great product, very sturdy. I&#x27;ve had issues with tweezers that will fully compress and still not have enough gripping torque. These are awesome, high quality metal and build from what I&#x27;ve seen so far. Been using them for about a month, and they&#x27;re perfect. Especially considering the price for the pack.</li>
            <li> These are not nearly as good as the Rubis.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are very high quality and I have been looking for good tweezers for a long time. They are hard to find so I would buy if you have been looking for quality tweezers.</li>
            <li> Works well but I wish the tweezers had &amp;#34;teeth grids&amp;#34; inside to a bit easier grabbing hairs. Would rebuy though as these are the most uniform on the tip part that Ive been able to find. Good product.</li>
            <li> Great professional set of tweezers.  High qualilty set and worth the price. Highly recomended for whatever your needs. convenient carrying case to keep them organized.</li>
            <li> great to deal with and they have a wonderful product to sell. well made, well presented</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take long for me to receive my order, which I love. I have received a few follow up emails from Bodyline and it&#x27;s great to hear from them about their products and that they stand by their guarentee.  I love the pointy tweezers, but I have to say the slanted tweezers were not great when I started using them.  I&#x27;m an esthetician and wax professionally for a living and whether you are using these for personal or professional use the product should hold up to its professional grade standard.  Within the first week of using the slanted tweezers, they have already dulled and slide past fine and course hairs and take a few pulls to remove hairs.  That&#x27;s why I give the 4 star rating on this product.  I am in love with the thick pointed tweezers and will use these as my go to until my Tweezerman tweezers get shipped back to me after my free sharpening.</li>
            <li> Excellent set and great price.  They work perfect for people with fine hair that other tweezers will not touch or pluck.</li>
            <li> Love this set of tweezers.</li>
            <li> Gave my wife my old pair of tweezers which she says are the best she&#x27;s ever used. Because THESE blow the old ones out of the water!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I get lots of slivers and these are great for getting those invisible ones under the skin dug out.</li>
            <li> The extreme sharpness of these tweezers caught me off guard, so use with precaution.  However, once you take their sharpness into account, they&#x27;re amazing and do the trick!</li>
            <li> Great tweezer set, excellent quality and nice price. The pouch is nothing special but handy so you don&#x27;t stab yourself. Great for splinters too!</li>
            <li> These tweezers are amazing. The quality is really 9/10 compared to high end tweezers from scientific research companies that cost many times more than this set for just one tool. And I love that they come in a little vinyl case to keep them in great shape. For hair removal they are perfect. The slant nose grips every hair, even the finest peach fuzz. The silver splinter remover is nearly perfect, only the last 0.2mm are not symmetrical, but I would need a heavy magnifying lens some fine abrasive to adjust that.  I haven&#x27;t used the blue ones, but they should work well and the tips look great. The anodizing is top quality, and makes for easy identification. Buy this kit, it will last for years; indeed this is heirloom quality to be passed on to your children.</li>
            <li> nice three piece set, handy case to keep the set together, very reasonable price.  i don&#x27;t think anyone would be disappointed with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Arrived when promised, well packaged, exactly as pictured and described, excellent quality.</li>
            <li> Love them. Great quality. Beyond fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The splinter tweezers in this set have come in extremely useful for ingrown hairs and a splinter in the foot of one of my children.  The slant nose tweezers have a very tight grip, but I haven&#x27;t had much use for the pointed tweezers.  Case is nice, but since I use the tweezers every day, I would have liked a case that was easier to secure closed.  Top flap folds down and is secured by a leather band that goes across the front of the case.  It&#x27;s a bit cumbersome to close.  Slant nose tweezers arrived grey instead of blue, but seller said this is due to a necessary change in production and did not affect the quality.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are great! I had been used to a different brand, but these have been superior.  I expect years of continued enjoyment. My brows have never looked better!</li>
            <li> This set is wonderful - I wish I had it when our five kids were growing up! Now, I am glad to have them for eyebrows, facial hair, splinters and more!</li>
            <li> I really only needed the slanted one, but gave it a shot and bought the set. It is not cheap, but you get what you pay for: great quality, precise, your hair will not break when pulling it. I would purchase again</li>
            <li> Over the years, I have never been content with the tweezers sold in big box stores.  The reviews gave me the confidence to give these a try.  Each are very sturdy and arrive in a nice carrying case.  Collectively, there is no plucking situation they cannot achieve.  They seem build to last.  I am very happy and thank previous reviews.</li>
            <li> The are the best tweezers I have ever owned.  They are very sharp and precise.  I would highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> great set.  Super sharp. Super grip. Happy with them. and they&#x27;re great for pulling out splinters!</li>
            <li> Ordered once and they left it out of the shipment. Gave refund without any hassle or problems. Ordered again, and my wife loves them. Great quality and sharp tips really help get the job done!</li>
            <li> These are top quality tweezers! These are well made, I&#x27;m impressed with the craftsmanship.The sharp pair is perfect for splinters and the other pair - outstanding for eyebrows. I would definitely recommend these tweezers!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  Very nice variety and seem very well made.  Not much more to say about tweezers...you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Stainless steel tweezers are adequate.  The case is very handy since when traveling I can add my clippers and small scissors to the pack without loosing the items.  I recommend the item to anyone.</li>
            <li> Good quality and even the little pouch seems well made. Already used the pointy one to extricate a rose thorn</li>
            <li> These tweezers arrived quickly and as described.  While they are better than most tweezers, they are not the best ones I have used.  But for the money, they are pretty good.  Much better than tweezerman.</li>
            <li> I have purchased virtually every type of  tweezers in CVS. The middle pair of tweezers are phenomenal . I recommend them thoroughly. They grab even the tiniest, thinnest of hairs and have a great recoil. Will be purchasing a second set.</li>
            <li> So far, this product exceeded my expectations. At first I thought the case would be frivolous, but these tweezers are very sharp, and the case is all but required. The tips seems to be better than similarly priced items, and after going through a couple Tweezerman sets who&#x27;s tips quickly stopped lining up, I feel that these will be my new brand.</li>
            <li> This is the best set of tweezers I have ever purchased.  They are very well made and the quality is superb.  I have used them several times on my eyebrows and they work wonderfully.  What I like most about them is they are very sharp which makes it easier to get the precision you desire.  I would definitely recommend these to a friend.</li>
            <li> These are well machined tweezers.  They are easy to use and work as intended.  So much nicer than the cheap, pot-metal tweezers that are sold in the drug stores.  The Bodyline Tweezers seem like they will last a lifetime if properly cared for and not abused.</li>
            <li> Jus received them and used them to remove a splinter that I&#x27;ve had for more than two weeks. They made short work of the task and while I hope I never have to use them for a splinter again , I find comfort in knowing they are waiting to perform the task.</li>
            <li> They work! Nice tweezers, made very well, and do what you expect them to do. I had no trouble tweezing my brows. I&#x27;m sold!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty amazing the hairs you&#x27;ll be able to tweeze with a combination of these tweezers. Definitely some of the best I&#x27;ve used. If you&#x27;re tired of dull tweezers that don&#x27;t get those small hairs, try these out. Be careful though, they&#x27;re a bit sharp!</li>
            <li> Wow! Really expensive but really good! I never thought I&#x27;d pay so much for tweezers, but when I thought of how many l&#x27;ve bought that didn&#x27;t last or work, I thought I&#x27;d give these a try. I only use the slanted tweezers, but they&#x27;re great. No more breaking my skin or missing a stray hair. I&#x27;ll have to research how to use the other tweezers. Really sharp, so be careful.</li>
            <li> The best quality product I&#x27;ve purchased in years. Great tools.</li>
            <li> Great product, top quality</li>
            <li> They are very sharp, so be careful. However, keep in mind that the sharper it is, the more precise it is as well. Overall, I like it!</li>
            <li> Nice set of tweezers, I have bought two sets of them, one for home, one for travel.  I have a pair of Rubis slanted tweezers and these appear to be equally good and for the price, it includes two other types of tweezers.  Have already used a couple of times and they work well.</li>
            <li> Who would have thought I could have gotten excited over a tweezer (or tweezers in this case), but I did. I got these to keep in my day pack after I got a splinter and couldn&#x27;t get it out with cheap pair at work (granted they were not designed for that purpose, but all I had access to at the time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will eventually get one or two more for around the house.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are fantastic.  Very well made and an excellent value.  There are three in the set - a tip for every need.  These will last you the rest of your life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Tweezerman, Revlon, and Sally and these are hands down the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter and she loves them so much I decided to get them also</li>
            <li> Probably the best you can get.</li>
            <li> The previous tweezers I had before this I got for free with a nail clipper. Suffice it to say they needed replacing this kit is premium set of tweezers that will probably last the rest of your life. The black pair is the general pair I use but the others may be useful for splinter removal. The faux leather can have a tendency to rub against the tweezers and may overtime wear the finish of the tweezers especially the blue but cant think of a better way to do it. Great tweezers, a little pricey, but great quality.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s why I spent extra for this kit, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Super tweezers set will fulfill all your tweezing needs. Tweezers have good weight and balance which are definite musts for pain free  and precise tweezing. Quality equal to or greater than much more expensive tweezers I have purchased. The very nice protective pouch is an added bonus too. Now I know where they all are when I need them and I know they have been kept safe from damage.</li>
            <li> Oh wow.....totally blown away....Could not wait to try them.....they worked wonderfully....could get the tiniest thinest little hairs.....and the little stubbies......and no breakage when pulling.....Wish I had found these years ago.....the best I ever used.  Good quality, comes in a really nice carrying case.....</li>
            <li> This is a handy assortment of extremely sharp implements, securely packaged and attractive. I agree with another reviewer that they are far superior to Tweezerman (and those little baby sized Tweezermans are just ridiculously ineffective). I also appreciate the lifetime guarantee (which Tweezerman used to offer but not any more...hummmm...wonder why?) and the discount when buying two sets. A suggestion: fold and insert the Amazon receipt in the little faux leather case for if/when you need them resharpened. (To that end it would be nice if this wasn&#x27;t so much paper.) This would make an EXCELLENT STOCKING STUFFER !! Highly recommend !!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. Perfect set.</li>
            <li> They are wonderful tweezers and i can grab even the finest of hairs.</li>
            <li> Only had them a few days, but they work just fine.  actually showed up a day early.  the case is nice, and feels like it&#x27;ll last.</li>
            <li> Without ANY doubt in my military mind these are the BEST tweezers I have ever seen and not only do you get ONE pair of them, you get THREE pair which can be used for about every mission you can think of - from the tiniest ingrown hair or a tick on your dog!&lt;br /&gt;GREAT deal from this company and Amazon here folks. THANK YOU!!</li>
            <li> They are not kidding, these are flat out the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever had in my whole life.  These can grab the finest hairs on the first go, there is some serious precision work here.</li>
            <li> Good product. Nice grip on each one. Case is great to keep them clean and sharp.</li>
            <li> I wish it were two tweezers, and one needle point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is two needle points and one tweezer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very high quality metal used.</li>
            <li> This set is a perfect combination of three differant tweezers that are good for all differant tasks. Removes hairs and splinters very easily.</li>
            <li> This is a great set of tweezers. Great for plucking eyebrows  or those little hairs on your chin. A good buy.</li>
            <li> best little tweezer set I&#x27;ve ever used. very high quality</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wasted a lot of money on crappy, poor quality tweezers in my life -- these are the BEST I have ever owned.  Very happy with this product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary</li>
            <li> Very nice -- precise and sharp.</li>
            <li> This is the nicest set of tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned.  There are three pairs in a nice leatherette case, and each pair is great in its own way.  They grip, grab, and do the job.  I recommend this product without hesitation.</li>
            <li> Not Very Useful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must agree with the lower rated reviews.  These tweezers really are not for fine hairs or hairs just emerging.  All of them are rather bulky in design and the tips are not sharp.  Although they come nicely encased in their own container and there are three direct types of tweezers, none of them are very functional.</li>
            <li> Finally a good set, Use it daily. Its the bomb.</li>
            <li> Expensive but high quality and a selection of blade widths for different purposes. Case means one is less likely to lose one or more.</li>
            <li> The tweezers are great.  They work very well, but I only use the slanted tweezer.</li>
            <li> Absolute garbage. Tweezers are supposed to meet at the tip to grip splinters, hairs and other very fine things. After trying to pull out a fine splinter with no success, I looked at these under a magnifying glass. The tips don&#x27;t even come close to meeting or being even. Look elsewhere for tweezers.</li>
            <li> WOW... super precision...you can get the shortest of hair even the hair under the top layer to achieve those thin high arched eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;fantastic grip, no slipping what so ever.....well worth the money....</li>
            <li> Got these because of the reviews. Had my old one for about 10 years and it dropped on the floor and was useless. First using these new Bodyline ones, which came in a day with Prime which is great, they seemed awkward and for $30 I was not too happy. But next day,(I use tweezers for eyewbrows and upper lip area everyday), using them again I fell in love with them. They do pull out the tiniest of hairs fantastically. Now I love these tweezers. I have given them 4 star because if I could only purchase the tweezers for eyebrows at 1/3 the cost since there are 3 of them in the case, they&#x27;d be a 10 star. But I am forced to buy 2 other tweezers I don&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li> Disappointed...I bought these for the very fine tip tweezers. They are very good at getting ingrown hairs. Until they were used gingerly by my husband to get out a small splinter in his hand. I say gingerly because it pained him just to touch the area and I know he was very gentle in getting out the splinter. Now the tweezers don&#x27;t seem to grip well and I have to try 3 times or more to get out the finer hairs. I&#x27;ve owned these about 3 months.</li>
            <li> I can never use another cheap pair of Tweezers again after handling these. Worth the investment, as long as you don&#x27;t go misplacing them.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are simply awesome! I found them at my local spa and use them all the time. They are very versatile. They are great for doing my eyebrows, pulling out splinters, and even for picking up tiny little beads for craft projects. The case makes it easy to carry them anywhere. Best of all, the price is really good for such a quality product. They will make great gifts for my friends and family.</li>
            <li> The best and easist tweezers I have ever used. I have ordered more tweezers than I can count and these are the best.</li>
            <li> These are the best I&#x27;ve ever seen.  I&#x27;m no pro and I haven&#x27;t been shopping wherever they do, but these are better than anything I&#x27;ve ever had before or seen for sale in a store.  The jaws come precisely together and they are beefy.  They are also very sharp without any burrs.  They are sharp enough to pull out tiny slivers or hairs, and sharp enough to cut if you are not careful.  Fine tools.</li>
            <li> These are truly the best tweezers I have ever owned in my life.</li>
            <li> I had a pair of tweezers that lasted about 10 years that recently went dull and no longer worked. I bought atleast 5 different pairs in the past two months and none of them were good! So i bought these from bodyline but i was a little nervous about the price being that ive never heard of this brand before. I can tell you that they are well worth it. They are very similiar to the one that i had for 10 years and are of good quality. A+ in my book.</li>
            <li> The fact that all 3 tweezers can be used for almost any situation makes this the perfect purchase.  I like how the tips are made to get precision accuracy.  Even better than the two pack.  This is my favorite purchase yet.</li>
            <li> Wow! Great set of tweezers!  Excellent quality.  This is a must have in your purse, makeup bag, and bathroom drawer, as well as your first aid kit for splinters.</li>
            <li> These Tweezers are great.  They require no tricks.&lt;br /&gt;I bought them and use them to tweeze my dogs&#x27; ticks.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my now ex-fiance.  She noted that the whole set was well crafted and very stylish.  She also likes that the set has it&#x27;s own carrying case for ease of storage and mobility purposes.  I like that I didn&#x27;t have to spend more than $50 for it.</li>
            <li> High quality and utilitarian!</li>
            <li> I have four daughters.  Can&#x27;t keep these on hand enough</li>
            <li> Excellent good quality</li>
            <li> Purchased two sets, one for myself and one for my husband.  We live in the boonies, or off the grid as I say, and at times we encounter splinters, ticks, etc... It&#x27;s not the city anymore.  I thought I would make a grand purchase and never need another tweezer.  I have went through quite a few.  This seemed to meet our needs.  I love them.  I have used the precision tweezer and amazed how great of a tool it is!  Much better than my cheap drugstore purchase.  I actually have thrown all our old tweezers thrown away.  I love that they come in their leather pouch too!  This keeps them safe and sharpened.  As for my husband, he can find them too easier!!  Perfect!  This is just what we needed but didn&#x27;t know it!  I will never go back to the cheaper tweezers either.  Perfect for me too with the eyebrows!  They have never looked so defined.  I can grasp those strays easily!  Yes, it&#x27;s pricy, but I feel quality is worth the price....  I may never need to purchase again!</li>
            <li> The product is exactly as promoted in the webpage. The tips are precisely aligned, and I expect they will stay that way. I&#x27;m very glad I decided to go with this multi-piece purchase. The different designs of the the three tweezers enable me to pick the ideal tool for the job. I first used these to remove an extremely fine metal sliver, thinner than a hair and no more than 1 or 2 mm long. I got it out easily with the slender-tip tweezer, with minimal tissue damage to my skin. In the past I had to resort to an x-acto knife approach, which always tore up my skin quite a bit. I also used the same tweezers on ingrown hairs in a very sensitive area. Because of their precision and extremely sharp pointed tip, I was able to lift the ingrown hairs with minimal disturbance to the skin and much less pain. It always pays to spend a little more for the right equipment.</li>
            <li> This set is a must for every house.</li>
            <li> I would have preferred not to have to rate this product, but Amazon insists on a star rating. For the record, the tweezers look perfectly serviceable and well-made, but they&#x27;re intended as a gift and so I haven&#x27;t used them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m bothered only by the prominent &amp;#34;MADE IN PAKISTAN&amp;#34; label on the package, which fortunately I was able to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered this product if I&#x27;d known its country of origin. This probably does not matter to most consumers (and I&#x27;m not saying it should), but I have a number of bones to pick with that nation and would not knowingly order a product manufactured there. I&#x27;m bringing this matter up here simply to inform other potential buyers, in case they feel as I do.</li>
            <li> These are just what I was looking for.  The leather case allows me to keep these &amp;#34;weapons&amp;#34; in my purse -- they are VERY sharp.  The quality of these tools are excellent.  Also they and the case are very nice looking.  I plan to give a few sets of these as gifts.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever had. So glad I bought them. Thinking about getting a set for a gift. Feel like they will last.</li>
            <li> I had been using a local store type of tweezers and thought they were working well, but then I was tearing skin more than pulling out ingrown hairs. The tips no longer touched together properly.  I bought this Bodyline Stainless Steel Tweezers and honestly, it has been such a perfect tool for ingrown hairs.  One grab, no skin tearing, no pain, and hair gone.  Excellent product and very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I can only say I like it because I don&#x27;t have any other tweezers to compare the quality - these are my first one.&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers can grab very fine hair, I don&#x27;t know if this information is important.</li>
            <li> I seen all the great reviews so I ordered this tweezers set and now understand the great reviews, these tweezers are awesome in all respects, no negatives to report!</li>
            <li> Excellent set of tweezers!  Two pinpoint tweezers and a one blade type.  All the ends match perfectly!  Very please with these tweezers.  Thank you for a great product.</li>
            <li> This item comes with a guarantee. I love that it really is precise. I keep waiting for it to fail - and so far it hasn&#x27;t. The case is very handy to keep them together in my purse. I had to use the splinter one recently and it worked like a charm!  Thanks for a great product that you are willing to back with a lifetime guarantee!</li>
            <li> Works pretty good on hard to pull hairs and slivers&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with my go to tweezers for the hard to get stuff.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a slanted tweezer to use to tweeze my eyebrows.  My most recent pair was from Mac cosmetic.  I loved the tweezers when I first purchased them, but within 3 months the tips wore down and they no longer grasped.  I have only used the slanted pair in this set.  If they last, then the price will have been worth it even though I only wanted the one pair.  So far they have been fantastic but I have only been using them a short time.</li>
            <li> Yep, I do, quality is it &amp; this set&#x27;s got it.  I was trying to see if it says Made in China anywhere but couldn&#x27;t find that anywhere &#x27;cause if it was, I&#x27;d have to say this is one thing made in China that I recommend.  But as it is, I&#x27;m not sure where it&#x27;s made; so I&#x27;ll assume it&#x27;s USA made &#x27;cause like I said quality factor is high, and use factor, I like!</li>
            <li> These definitely have the wow factor going on! This company has made precision instruments here. I didn&#x27;t realize how poorly my old tweezers worked until I got these! Be sure you get the 20% off coupon off the internet, worth every penny!</li>
            <li> great tweezers. able to grab the tiniest hairs. will buy again. highly recommend!</li>
            <li> By far the best tweezers we have ever used.  My wife had me order a set for travel.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> There is no doubt that this is a top of the line product. I only ever really use the flat-tipped tweezers and they are unquestionably better than the brand-name version I previously used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think 3 tweezers is a bit much, a 1 or 2 tweezer set would cover 95% of my tweezing-needs.</li>
            <li> Great set of tweezers!  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I pluck daily and this set of tweezers are great. Precise and sharp! Well worth the $30 price. I briefly considered getting a pair of Tweezerman Tweezers but you definitely get more for the money with this set.</li>
            <li> The Bodlyline tweezers are a must have!! These are very well made high quality stainless steel tweezers. They come in a very nice case and are very sharp so be careful when handling.  I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a high quality and professional set of tweezers!!!</li>
            <li> Way better than the crappy tweezer I had been using.  These are super precise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I have been ruined for using any other tweezers. I have my old pair in the second bathroom and using them is like using chopsticks.  I love my bodyline tweezer set!  I find I mostly use the angled ones though.  They work great for stray eyebrow hairs!</li>
            <li> Amazing. Wish I would have bought them earlier.</li>
            <li> I love these tweezers. I got it for awhile, but I just started to use them. I love to have slim/high arch, but I have hard time tweeze it to the way I want it when I use other tweezers. So when I started to use these tweezers, they give me perfect arch on my eyebrows and the shape that I like.</li>
            <li> These are the best set of high quality tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used. They shipped very quickly and were here in no time! I will never go back to my standard tweezers again after using these. I&#x27;ve already gotten so much use out of them.. from tweezing my eyebrows to getting out splinters!! They are a MUST!!</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t bad quality, though I much prefer the tweezerman brand that I returned these to buy.  My bigger complaint is that the company added me to their email list. Even after I unsubscribed myself, the emails continued asking me to review their product and offering tips for tweezing. Bodyline Skin Care,  I assure you, the vast majority of us know how to tweeze and don&#x27;t appreciate additional spam clogging up our inbox.</li>
            <li> Good set for the money.</li>
            <li> Good product fast shipping</li>
            <li> I expected more for the price.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing. I was searching for a better quality than what the drug stores sell, this is not it..  Breaks the hairs in half and can not grab the shorter ones. I&#x27;ve bought the same quality tweezers for much less in the stores.</li>
            <li> They are the best set of tweezers I have ever used.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this tweezer set. Based on the description, I expected that the tweezers would be very precise and able to grab very fine or stubborn hairs that other tweezer brands are unable to handle. They are not. The silver pointed tweezers are virtually useless when trying to use the pointed tips to grab the hairs. There seems to be a very, very small &amp;#34;sweet spot&amp;#34; along one edge that I occasionally find purely by accident. The blue pointed tweezers are too thick and stubby to be of much use. I will say, though, that the slanted tweezers are acceptable (not exceptional, but ok) and the faux leather case is nice. I&#x27;m not sure whether I should return these through Amazon or work through Bodyline Skin Care to resolve the issue, so if either party wants to weigh in on this, please do. I&#x27;m open to exchanging them or simply returning them, but either way they are going back. I had expected something better than the ubiquitous Tweezerman, but these tweezers just aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Received the set today. Got it in 2 days thru my Prime membership. Love that kind of fast shipment.  Each of the 3 tweezers have a very strong gripping power, which is what I was looking for. Other brands I&#x27;ve used do not have the precision these tweezers do. Also love the nice compact pouch they come in. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Best set of tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Very high quality.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality tweezers. They all have their purpose and was happy with each. Grateful for the guaranteed for life part because so many times tweezers lose their spring and ability to grasp after a few years.</li>
            <li> High precision tools that exceeded my expectation. Must be a bit cautious as none of the tweezers has a blunt edge, so use caution against sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Just got these as a gift for christmas.  Best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used, hands down. Love all 3 of them! ♡</li>
            <li> These tweezers are amazing! I opened the leather case (which is a nice touch), took one of them, and immediately felt the build quality. These tweezers (especially the black one, which is my work horse) are heavy. HEAVY! I love em.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can find the 2-for-1 deal, go for it. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> These tweezers tweeze very well.</li>
            <li> the best damn tweezers!</li>
            <li> Not much tor review. Items are sturdy, come with a nice pouch and do exactly as one would expect.</li>
            <li> Top quality, great customer service, wonderful set. How can you go wrong with a lifetime guarantee?  Money well spent. I highly recommend this set for anyone looking for precision and comfort in a tweezer set. Great design.</li>
            <li> Great tweezers, strong grip and durable.  The only flaw, that I can see, is that when dropped onto a hard surface (bathroom tile floor), the silver (&amp;#34;splinter&amp;#34;) tweezers became bent, and are seemingly impossible to get back to original shape, for proper gripping.  Perhaps making them slightly more heavy on the crimped end would prevent this from happening.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with these tweezers. They&#x27;re well made and come in a handy case. Hopefully that&#x27;ll make them harder to lose. If the rest of their products are of this high quality then they&#x27;ve got a customer for life.     Buy them, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> So far I like these tweezers.  I use them almost every day.  I would buy again.  Hopefully this will be the last pair I ever need.</li>
            <li> The leather case is faux leather...the tweezers are great. Perfect for engaging in artful plucking..or for the trichotillomaniac...I mean, one cannot go wrong with these guys.</li>
            <li> Great tweezers, have never owned a better set.</li>
            <li> I bought these because we never seem to have good tweezers in the house. Wouldn&#x27;t you know that not a day after I received these in the mail, I got my first splinter in years? These tweezers made it a cinch to fix! Thank goodness. I love them. They are exactly as advertised. The case is a nice touch and the company who supplies them is very polite and enthusiastic. I am happy to not only have 3 sets of tweezers in the house, but ones that actually work.</li>
            <li> I needed some good tweezers to remove ingrown hairs and whatnot.  These suckers are perfect and very sharp and make it easy to grab anything slightly under the skin and pull it out.  A little more than I wanted to pay but if they hold up then I will be happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for tweezers of this quality and precision for years.  While I&#x27;ve bought many in an attempt to replicate a pair which were dropped &amp; dulled, none came close until I found these.  I also really like the 3 different types in one case.  I&#x27;m hoping to have these for years to come.</li>
            <li> Great Tweezer Set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Online reviews led me to buy this tweezer set and I am not disappointed. The trio is well made with well defined edges which will grasp whatever you want whether it be an errant hair or a sliver in your finger. I don&#x27;t imagine I&#x27;ll need another set after this one unless my daughters get a hold of them.</li>
            <li> Excellent grip, nice selection of tips, love that there&#x27;s a storage case</li>
            <li> Seller provided an quality product at an excellent price.</li>
            <li> Just got a set of these tweezers and they are great!  They grasp and hold better than any set of tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned.  They are high quality and come in a handy case so I always know where they are.  As I get older hair grows from places I didn&#x27;t think hair was even supposed to grow, so I use my new tweezers to pluck them out!  Get a set and you will see how good they really are!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Best tweezers I have ever owned. Love the fact, they are guaranteed for life. I bought them for my ingrown hairs, they worked great. What a difference a professional quality tweezers make. Thank you Bodyline...&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> These tweezers are fantastic.  I get ingrown hairs around my lip area on occasion.  It is very difficult to get these out with my old tweezers-I had to dig and dig.  Not only did I create quite a mark on my face, but I wasted a lot of time.  I was elated that these tweezers grabbed very short, stiff hairs.  I even received follow up from Bodyline on how to care for the tweezers!</li>
            <li> These are wonderful--sharp and aligned perfectly.  Think I&#x27;ll purchase a couple more sets for Christmas presents.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice set of tweezers.  I have used them for very fine hair where most tweezers won&#x27;t work and these do a super job.  I think they would make a great gift too!</li>
            <li> Good quality tweezers. They each grip really well and the little holder is a nice bonus. I am still not sure why someone would need three styles as two are very similar. I don&#x27;t mind since it just means it will be 3 times as long until I might need to buy tweezers again :-)</li>
            <li> The slanted tweezers are the best I have ever used.  I have already purchased another set for the house.  I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Your search is over, these tweezers are worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have put up with grocery/dime store quality tweezers for years which couldn&#x27;t pull a hair or sliver.  These are exactly what i needed.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are fantastic and they are just what I needed! They are completely worth the price that I paid for them.</li>
            <li> the best product ever. highly recommend, you will love it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve been using tweezers from the drug store or beauty counter, you do not know what good tweezers are. These are precision machined, not pressed or stamped, and the tweezer bodies are wide, meaning that there is extra stability that doesn&#x27;t let the business end of the tweezers get out of alignment even a little bit. Get there and they will be the last tweezers you buy (unless your family &amp;#34;steals&amp;#34; them).</li>
            <li> I bought these for the one tweezer alone, (slanted tip) looking at the quality of the product.  Now I have 2 others that will easily take out any splinters as well.  I have purchased too many tweezers that I care to mention in a battle for my chin growing trees,  and now I have 3 times the chances of getting those nasty tree stumps out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I imagine I have finally found the 3 best tweezers I have ever purchased, and each one has made it simple to remove them.  I plan to purchase for Christmas gifts as well, who wouldn&#x27;t want precision like this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YES, I would totally recommend these to my friends and family.  5 stars.  FINALLY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only regret is the packaging.  It came to me in it&#x27;s quality pleather case, in a bubble wrap mailing envelope.  To me, that&#x27;s a chance for damage to the fine tips.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Perfectly aligned.&lt;br /&gt;Our son keeps stealing our tweezers (teenager)...he&#x27;s lost several of his own pairs...not sure how.&lt;br /&gt;So we keep these gems hidden and make him deal with the generic drugstore pairs we keep in the open!</li>
            <li> Along with other users I found the slat tweezers to be OK. Nothing major in my book. I do like the sharper blue and silver but in all honesty I wish the company had added a thinner sharper tweezers to the group.  Not that the silver ones are bad, In fact they work well it is my preference for a thinner style point.  Leather case..Come on, really?  Fast shipping and good warranty.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. Solidly constructed and weighty (in the best way). They grip virtually anything so for a tool that&#x27;s designed to do just that I&#x27;d say they earn 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The only tweezer set you will ever need! The three different shapes are good for the different jobs. These are sharp, high quality tools!</li>
            <li> These tweezers really work!  A tiny splinter in my left palm awaited delivery of these.  I tried and discarded each other set in the house.  On the first try with the first one I took from the pouch, success!  Then I went to work on my uni-brow.  These grab hairs first time, every time.  Plans are to order 2 more sets for the cars.</li>
            <li> Good for thick hairs and that is about it. The tips to these tweezers are actually quite bulky. The needle nose tweezers are alot thicker than any other needle nose tweezers ive used. These tweezers have a terrible time picking up smaller and finer hairs. I returned them to go back with Tweezermans for their ability to pick up the smaller hairs. If you are just using them for simple thick hairs, they are great. If you are using them for ingrown hairs/ finer hairs like me, they may not be the best for you.</li>
            <li> Looked really good to the naked eye, under an Optivisor, not so much. It would be good for plucking hairs, I suppose, it is a nice little set and I do use it sort of industrially. The case is Pleather, not beast.</li>
            <li> Finally tweezers that work. Like the vendor says, you must clean the tips regularly with alcohol or something similar to make sure that they DO work.  I have bought and thrown out dozens of name brand tweezers bought at the supermarket that years ago were good.  Back then they were made somewhere else - those tweezers are now made in China and are totally worthless. The tweezers being reviewed here are great.</li>
            <li> Worth the money. Very good quality</li>
            <li> I always used Tweezerman tweezers...&lt;br /&gt;But these are even better!! Will be using these from now on! Thank you bodyline!</li>
            <li> Definitely quality. I like that they have a lifetime warranty. I have only used the angle tipped one. I was looking for something that grabbed tough hairs, and unfortunately I did not find that these helped very much. I liked another brand better. There is nothing wrong with this set as it is made nice and has a few options for your tweezing needs.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are definitely worth the price! I have been shopping for years for a good pair of tweezers and here they are. I mostly use the sharp tipped ones as i have a lot of ingrown hairs. I dropped them once on the floor and either they landed just right or they are really sturdy because the tip didn&#x27;t break on those ones. I would by them again!</li>
            <li> Paid more than Tweezerman for these and two of them I can only figure are medical in nature, and the normal ones won&#x27;t even grip relatively thick hairs well. And that was straight out of the box. Guess I&#x27;ll stick to &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34; $8 Revlons, because these all seem to last the exact same amount of time, the cost is just different.</li>
            <li> Great tweezers. Destroy ingrown hairs in the best way. These things grip amazingly too.</li>
            <li> Amazing tweezers!  Completely worth the prIce.  Arrived promptly.  The leather case is surprising nice.  I certainly didn&#x27;t buy it for the case. .. but it&#x27;s a nice extra.  These would make a nice gift.</li>
            <li> My wife loves themost for digging hair out of her face!</li>
            <li> These tweezers are awesome!  They are sharp and aligned.  It&#x27;s kind of pot luck when you buy tweezers, as you cannot try them out before your purchase.  That is why these reviews are so very helpful for something like tweezers.  I like that they come in a carrying case to protect them.  They are expensive, but there are 3 of them.  I feel that they are worthy of 5 Stars.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality.  Ordered for home and one for the office.  Surgical quality</li>
            <li> These are extremely well made tweezers. I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll ever have to buy another crappy one from CVS or Walgreens again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two pointed tip ones are amazing for getting even the smallest hairs.</li>
            <li> These are the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used. I used to buy tweezerman brand, but not anymore .</li>
            <li> Sharp and precise. Great for removing slivers to plucking unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> WELL WORTH THE MONEY. AND IN A POUCH THAT CAN BE HIDDEN FROM OTHER PICKING FAMILY MEMBERS</li>
            <li> Loved them so much I just ordered a set as a gift!</li>
            <li> Excellent high quality product</li>
            <li> Really nice set.  Been using for a while and I have had no problems with them.  The case is great because it keeps the tips from getting banged up in a drawer which is the undoing of many a tweezer.</li>
            <li> I have been putting up with cheap annoying tweezers that don’t even work correctly for years… I didn’t know Tweezers could work this good! I decided to take a chance and get this expensive set; I am SO glad that I did. My life has become easier now that I have obtained these great high quality tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and save up for these instead of buying the cheap ones.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are great. They are very sharp and take care of all my tweezing needs. The pouch is cheaply made, but that&#x27;s not a big deal. Great value.</li>
            <li> Got dull within 2 weeks. .disappointed</li>
            <li> Very nice quality.  Also the company follows up with email to confirm receipt and if pleased with their product.</li>
            <li> I have bought 3 sets of these tweezers.  Great gift idea. These tweezers are nothing you&#x27;d find easily in a store. The quality is superior.&lt;br /&gt;I had an issue with only one pair out of all three sets. However the company sent me a pair same day I talked to them free of all charges.. Now I have another great set! They always grab any hair or splinter you tweeze. Enjoy.</li>
            <li> These were shipped very quickly and all 3 tweezers are of very high quality.  The accompanying case is good looking and conveniently stores all 3 tweezers.</li>
            <li> Love these tweezers! This is my second order because I lost one of them. Happily purchased the whole set again! Best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;They were even delivered on a Sunday!</li>
