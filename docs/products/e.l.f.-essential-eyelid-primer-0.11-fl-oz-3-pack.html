            <li>so I&#x27;m stocked for a good while! :</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve wore eye shadow for quite some time and have always experienced creasing, but using this product I don&#x27;t have to worry about that.</li>
            <li>These work great its like glue for your eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>Still, it is sold at a great price, and for others seems to work well.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>GREAT ON EYELIDS</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with it</li>
            <li>Lol</li>
            <li>This is a great primer.  </li>
            <li>Works great for a eye primer</li>
            <li>But the product works great underneath my Avon eye shadow.</li>
            <li>This product works very nicely.</li>
            <li>Amazing!  </li>
            <li>I tend to have oily eyelids, so I thought this was a good product to invest in, without spending too much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good beauty product.</li>
            <li>It lasts maybe 4 hours on a good day before the crease marks show and the eyeliner begins to smudge.</li>
            <li>but this is cheap and great stuff!</li>
            <li>This is especially true with concealers.</li>
            <li>It was cheap and works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>It a really good thing</li>
            <li>All said, it&#x27;s worth a try for the awesome price!!!</li>
            <li>Great lovely makeup thank you</li>
            <li>I bought more of it!</li>
            <li>Granted, it faded A LOT because of the rain, but I&#x27;m otherwise pretty impressed that it&#x27;s still</li>
            <li>Love it, have gone through three already!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>but this is voodoo magic!</li>
            <li>does I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li>Amazing eye primer</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was a nice evening, and we all decided to go take a walk.</li>
            <li>Also, I was kind of hesitant to order this because it wasn&#x27;t through prime</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for the price for sure and would recommend it to a friend looking for an inexpensive prime.</li>
            <li>By far the best one I have used.</li>
            <li>Of all the eye primer out there, this is by far the best!  </li>
            <li>Best thing I&#x27;ve ever discovered for keeping lipstick to last 8-10 hours:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1--Some kind of Chapstick for moisture&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love this stuff  --</li>
            <li>It does hold the color on lids for many hours.</li>
            <li>Okay, so here&#x27;s the deal:</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my order of the three-pack value, yesterday (Saturday, October 12, 2013), in addition to a Maybelline Eyeshadow palette that I was interesting in trying out.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>it might crease, just make sure</li>
            <li>Their line is awesomely priced and I actually love their brush cleaner and their liquid eyeliner, but the primer just falls a bit short.  </li>
            <li>I love e.l.f products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I bought the 3 pack so that I won&#x27;t run out anytime soon.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>So worth the money really good quality.</li>
            <li>Really does a great job.</li>
            <li>Great primer for the eyelid -- keeps your color in place all day at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noted that my eye shadow has been creasing more.  </li>
            <li>and it seemed to work much better, so  </li>
            <li>This is great because my eyelids get really oily.</li>
            <li>Love elf and all there products.</li>
            <li>LOVE ELF</li>
            <li>Much better, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I am definitely satisfied with this purchase...mainly because of the price.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The fact that it lasted *11 hours* through sweating, humidity, and a long day is VERY impressive to me.</li>
            <li>The fact that it lasted *11 hours* through sweating, humidity, and a long day is VERY impressive to me.</li>
            <li>Put some on at 8 in the morning and after a long day came home at 9pm to find the eyeshadow still sitting perfectly in place</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s pretty darn good at keeping my eyeshadow in place all day.</li>
            <li>: I decided to update this review, and nothing has changed: this stuff is still pretty amazing :).</li>
            <li>: I decided to update this review, and nothing has changed: this stuff is still pretty amazing :).</li>
            <li>Works as expected, perfect for those pesky shadows that aren&#x27;t as pigmented as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>It is cheap, and it is better than going without any primer at all</li>
            <li>/&gt;i get this on special offer 3 pack value, &amp; i love it</li>
            <li>For the price this is very good this product really helps keep eyeshadow on even the cheap brands i would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super glad I bought the three-pack value</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super glad I bought the three-pack value</li>
            <li>Please help i would like to find a cheap but good primer and have not had any luck thus far.</li>
            <li>But even at $5, it&#x27;s a great deal, as this is comparable to Urban Decay&#x27;s primer.</li>
            <li>The primer is comfortable and makes a noticeable difference in the wear of my eye shadow.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, light and helps my shadow stay on all day.  </li>
            <li>and I liked it so much, this time I bought the 3 pack.</li>
            <li>IT WORKS GREAT EASY TO APPLY ,AND OF COURSE THE PRICE IS SUPER CHEAP COMPARE TO PRODUCT LIKE URBAN DECAY</li>
            <li>It,s nice to use and cheaper than other shop,very good.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy and dries quick.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly, applies easily.</li>
            <li>I am NOT disappointed.</li>
            <li>I am NOT disappointed.</li>
            <li>The primer does a great job of keeping my eyeshadow on my lids all day long.  </li>
            <li>first time using a primer; love it.</li>
            <li>This primer is sooo worth the money!</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have much experience to compare; however, comparing the primer to no primer at all, ELF&#x27;s Eye Shadow Primer is fantastic!</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have much experience to compare; however, comparing the primer to no primer at all, ELF&#x27;s Eye Shadow Primer is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Makes my eyeshadow stay true all day and night.</li>
            <li>but then it not even seem full at all...</li>
            <li>Quick Shipping.</li>
            <li>they both work tremendously well</li>
            <li>While it seems like a great deal, but it really isn&#x27;t when a tube lasts a very short time.</li>
            <li>It works better when I&#x27;m not sweating or when the humidity isn&#x27;t so high.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re reading this review, and you&#x27;re interested in trying this, go and buy it!</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re reading this review, and you&#x27;re interested in trying this, go and buy it!</li>
            <li>Considering this product is so affordable, it works really well!!</li>
            <li>Okay, okay, it&#x27;s basically faded off by now, and all that&#x27;s left is a a hint of brown shadow; but, if I were to normally go without primer, the eye shadow would have been gone by now.</li>
            <li>and if you don&#x27;t apply it just right, it won&#x27;t work right.  </li>
            <li>,it is my right choice.</li>
            <li>Works great keeps color on your eye lid and doesn&#x27;t crease your make up last would definitely recommend and got here on time</li>
            <li>It makes such a huge difference with my eyeshadow staying on and in place during the day!  </li>
            <li>if pretty</li>
            <li>As I said before, I have not used any eye primers before, so this is my first one</li>
            <li>As I said before, I have not used any eye primers before, so this is my first one</li>
            <li>Unfortunately not.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>This is just an added touch for when doing your making, I love it and it makes your eyeshadow last longee</li>
            <li>This is a PERFECT dupe for a more urban and expensive item out there.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why this time it seems to be working not as well as before save to say again the weather and the hot environment I work in.  </li>
            <li>price is a lot better than Urban Decay as well.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It dries fast and doesn&#x27;t end up all messy in my crease, just goes on smooth and perfect with my uneven, oily pale-Alabaster skin.</li>
            <li>The liquid is not as good as some more expensive primer I have had, but it does the job.  </li>
            <li>and it would have gone smoother if I actually had makeup remover and not just warm water and a soft rag</li>
            <li>The Urban Decay primers are $20 and last forever (and work better too)!</li>
            <li>There tends to be only the smallest bit of transfer from my lip to brow bone--but I have huge eyes, ergo huge eyelids, eyelids so large that when my eyes are open the lids reach just below my eyebrow</li>
            <li>Fast forward, it&#x27;s about 11pm now.</li>
            <li>This stuff works really well.</li>
            <li>It really keeps your makeup on all day and night.</li>
            <li>They really did not even help the eyeshadow like primer is supposed to do</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It really does help the shadow to stay on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very watery compared to the thicker UD primers.</li>
            <li>This primer is very watery</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and my daughter  can&#x27;t do without this.</li>
            <li>This product really works as a primer on eyelids.</li>
            <li>It keeps all of your eye makeup on far better than any other product I&#x27;ve ever used, and it actually works better than my concealer to get rid of all sorts of imperfections under the eyes (found that out after I smudged it under my eye on accident).</li>
            <li>The only thing that you should be aware of in using this product is that it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>By the time I quickly put on my Bare Minerals foundation, it&#x27;s ready for shadow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first eyelid primer I&#x27;ve tried, so I can&#x27;t say how it compares to more expensive brands--but when it works so well, why would I spend more money?  </li>
            <li>Despite these issues, I will absolutely keep using this eye shadow primer as my main primer, because it does</li>
            <li>My eyeshadow lasted easily 16 hours without a single smudge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The doe foot applicator allows for easy application and once dry (about a minute or so) your shadow and liner will not budge!</li>
            <li>In comparison, the $20 brand lasts for about half a year and works much better, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Be sure to apply and blend back to back.</li>
            <li>and if you want your colors to pop a little more get the pearl one (although beware of shimmer which is covered by eyeshadow)</li>
            <li>Make up looks the same when I get home as it did freshly applied.</li>
            <li>If I were to normally apply eye shadow with no primer, it would have faded -- fast!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have normally oily eye lids and my shadow stays all day intact.</li>
            <li>The weather was about 80 degrees, with 40% humidity (I live in Maryland, to give you an idea...).</li>
            <li>The weather was about 80 degrees, with 40% humidity (I live in Maryland, to give you an idea...).</li>
            <li>This product works OK, but there is VERY little product in each tube.</li>
            <li>E.l.f is one of those brands that has some pretty good stuff, and some pretty bad throughout.</li>
            <li>wait 10-15 seconds for it to start drying first, then rub it over my entire lid.  </li>
            <li>I would give this primer 5 stars, because the actual product itself is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>My eyeshadow stays on all day and looks about the same as it did when I first put it on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sorry, just thought you guys may be interested in the multiple utilities of this product.</li>
            <li>The first time I only bought one</li>
            <li>I tend to get oily eye lids, and before I decided to get the ELF Eye Shadow Primer, the eye shadow would have faded off AND have developed a lot of creasing after about an hour or</li>
            <li>I tend to get oily eye lids, and before I decided to get the ELF Eye Shadow Primer, the eye shadow would have faded off AND have developed a lot of creasing after about an hour or</li>
            <li>I applied it early in the day and my eye shadow lasted all day without creasing.</li>
            <li>It does not cake on and does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>It makes my eyeshadow look much brighter, and it disguises the blue veins on my eyelids a bit</li>
            <li>it like half way full</li>
            <li>Not as good as other expensive primers, but okay product compared to other products.</li>
            <li>However, I removed one star because of this theme I&#x27;ve found with e.l.f. items, which no doubt is the reason their products are so good, but still affordable: The container is pretty bad.</li>
            <li>and I actually got it on the exact same day as my prime products that were two day shipping!</li>
            <li>A little tiny bit of that, applied with your finger, good to go... and it lasts for a few months!  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d rather pay a few dollars more for something easier to apply that helps my shadow stay creaseless all day without the risk that I didn&#x27;t let my eyelids dry before I opened them or didn&#x27;t apply it evenly enough.</li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t do makeup very often, it&#x27;s not much of a problem at all</li>
            <li>the tip of one of my applicators snapped off within a week(I&#x27;m not rough with them, it just popped right off), and one of the other applicator&#x27;s little plastic ring at the top won&#x27;t stay on, and usually just hangs out on the stick when I pull the applicator out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So perhaps sometimes there&#x27;s not quite as much in a container, or maybe it&#x27;s a little old?</li>
            <li>works pretty well, but sometimes stays a little sticky.</li>
            <li>The bottles are very light and smaller than I expected, but a little bit goes a long way, so they last quite a while.  </li>
            <li>I usually put it on right after doing my face primer.</li>
            <li>It may also be that I&#x27;m using too much, I don&#x27;t know, but will test it again using less and see if there is an improvement.  </li>
            <li>Lately where I live the humidity has been very high</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> but this is voodoo magic!</li>
            <li> does I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li> Amazing eye primer</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was a nice evening, and we all decided to go take a walk.</li>
            <li> Also, I was kind of hesitant to order this because it wasn&#x27;t through prime</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for the price for sure and would recommend it to a friend looking for an inexpensive prime.</li>
            <li> By far the best one I have used.</li>
            <li> Of all the eye primer out there, this is by far the best!  </li>
            <li> Best thing I&#x27;ve ever discovered for keeping lipstick to last 8-10 hours:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1--Some kind of Chapstick for moisture&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this stuff  --</li>
            <li> It does hold the color on lids for many hours.</li>
            <li> Okay, so here&#x27;s the deal:</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my order of the three-pack value, yesterday (Saturday, October 12, 2013), in addition to a Maybelline Eyeshadow palette that I was interesting in trying out.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> it might crease, just make sure</li>
            <li> Their line is awesomely priced and I actually love their brush cleaner and their liquid eyeliner, but the primer just falls a bit short.  </li>
            <li> I love e.l.f products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I bought the 3 pack so that I won&#x27;t run out anytime soon.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> So worth the money really good quality.</li>
            <li> Really does a great job.</li>
            <li> Great primer for the eyelid -- keeps your color in place all day at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noted that my eye shadow has been creasing more.  </li>
            <li> and it seemed to work much better, so  </li>
            <li> This is great because my eyelids get really oily.</li>
            <li> Love elf and all there products.</li>
            <li> LOVE ELF</li>
            <li> Much better, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> I am definitely satisfied with this purchase...mainly because of the price.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> The fact that it lasted *11 hours* through sweating, humidity, and a long day is VERY impressive to me.</li>
            <li> The fact that it lasted *11 hours* through sweating, humidity, and a long day is VERY impressive to me.</li>
            <li> Put some on at 8 in the morning and after a long day came home at 9pm to find the eyeshadow still sitting perfectly in place</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s pretty darn good at keeping my eyeshadow in place all day.</li>
            <li> : I decided to update this review, and nothing has changed: this stuff is still pretty amazing :).</li>
            <li> : I decided to update this review, and nothing has changed: this stuff is still pretty amazing :).</li>
            <li> Works as expected, perfect for those pesky shadows that aren&#x27;t as pigmented as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> It is cheap, and it is better than going without any primer at all</li>
            <li> /&gt;i get this on special offer 3 pack value, &amp; i love it</li>
            <li> For the price this is very good this product really helps keep eyeshadow on even the cheap brands i would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super glad I bought the three-pack value</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super glad I bought the three-pack value</li>
            <li> Please help i would like to find a cheap but good primer and have not had any luck thus far.</li>
            <li> But even at $5, it&#x27;s a great deal, as this is comparable to Urban Decay&#x27;s primer.</li>
            <li> The primer is comfortable and makes a noticeable difference in the wear of my eye shadow.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, light and helps my shadow stay on all day.  </li>
            <li> and I liked it so much, this time I bought the 3 pack.</li>
            <li> IT WORKS GREAT EASY TO APPLY ,AND OF COURSE THE PRICE IS SUPER CHEAP COMPARE TO PRODUCT LIKE URBAN DECAY</li>
            <li> It,s nice to use and cheaper than other shop,very good.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy and dries quick.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly, applies easily.</li>
            <li> I am NOT disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am NOT disappointed.</li>
            <li> The primer does a great job of keeping my eyeshadow on my lids all day long.  </li>
            <li> first time using a primer; love it.</li>
            <li> This primer is sooo worth the money!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have much experience to compare; however, comparing the primer to no primer at all, ELF&#x27;s Eye Shadow Primer is fantastic!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have much experience to compare; however, comparing the primer to no primer at all, ELF&#x27;s Eye Shadow Primer is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Makes my eyeshadow stay true all day and night.</li>
            <li> but then it not even seem full at all...</li>
            <li> Quick Shipping.</li>
            <li> they both work tremendously well</li>
            <li> While it seems like a great deal, but it really isn&#x27;t when a tube lasts a very short time.</li>
            <li> It works better when I&#x27;m not sweating or when the humidity isn&#x27;t so high.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re reading this review, and you&#x27;re interested in trying this, go and buy it!</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re reading this review, and you&#x27;re interested in trying this, go and buy it!</li>
            <li> Considering this product is so affordable, it works really well!!</li>
            <li> Okay, okay, it&#x27;s basically faded off by now, and all that&#x27;s left is a a hint of brown shadow; but, if I were to normally go without primer, the eye shadow would have been gone by now.</li>
            <li> and if you don&#x27;t apply it just right, it won&#x27;t work right.  </li>
            <li> ,it is my right choice.</li>
            <li> Works great keeps color on your eye lid and doesn&#x27;t crease your make up last would definitely recommend and got here on time</li>
            <li> It makes such a huge difference with my eyeshadow staying on and in place during the day!  </li>
            <li> if pretty</li>
            <li> As I said before, I have not used any eye primers before, so this is my first one</li>
            <li> As I said before, I have not used any eye primers before, so this is my first one</li>
            <li> Unfortunately not.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> This is just an added touch for when doing your making, I love it and it makes your eyeshadow last longee</li>
            <li> This is a PERFECT dupe for a more urban and expensive item out there.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this time it seems to be working not as well as before save to say again the weather and the hot environment I work in.  </li>
            <li> price is a lot better than Urban Decay as well.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> It dries fast and doesn&#x27;t end up all messy in my crease, just goes on smooth and perfect with my uneven, oily pale-Alabaster skin.</li>
            <li> The liquid is not as good as some more expensive primer I have had, but it does the job.  </li>
            <li> and it would have gone smoother if I actually had makeup remover and not just warm water and a soft rag</li>
            <li> The Urban Decay primers are $20 and last forever (and work better too)!</li>
            <li> There tends to be only the smallest bit of transfer from my lip to brow bone--but I have huge eyes, ergo huge eyelids, eyelids so large that when my eyes are open the lids reach just below my eyebrow</li>
            <li> Fast forward, it&#x27;s about 11pm now.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well.</li>
            <li> It really keeps your makeup on all day and night.</li>
            <li> They really did not even help the eyeshadow like primer is supposed to do</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It really does help the shadow to stay on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very watery compared to the thicker UD primers.</li>
            <li> This primer is very watery</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and my daughter  can&#x27;t do without this.</li>
            <li> This product really works as a primer on eyelids.</li>
            <li> It keeps all of your eye makeup on far better than any other product I&#x27;ve ever used, and it actually works better than my concealer to get rid of all sorts of imperfections under the eyes (found that out after I smudged it under my eye on accident).</li>
            <li> The only thing that you should be aware of in using this product is that it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> By the time I quickly put on my Bare Minerals foundation, it&#x27;s ready for shadow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first eyelid primer I&#x27;ve tried, so I can&#x27;t say how it compares to more expensive brands--but when it works so well, why would I spend more money?  </li>
            <li> Despite these issues, I will absolutely keep using this eye shadow primer as my main primer, because it does</li>
            <li> My eyeshadow lasted easily 16 hours without a single smudge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The doe foot applicator allows for easy application and once dry (about a minute or so) your shadow and liner will not budge!</li>
            <li> In comparison, the $20 brand lasts for about half a year and works much better, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Be sure to apply and blend back to back.</li>
            <li> and if you want your colors to pop a little more get the pearl one (although beware of shimmer which is covered by eyeshadow)</li>
            <li> Make up looks the same when I get home as it did freshly applied.</li>
            <li> If I were to normally apply eye shadow with no primer, it would have faded -- fast!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have normally oily eye lids and my shadow stays all day intact.</li>
            <li> The weather was about 80 degrees, with 40% humidity (I live in Maryland, to give you an idea...).</li>
            <li> The weather was about 80 degrees, with 40% humidity (I live in Maryland, to give you an idea...).</li>
            <li> This product works OK, but there is VERY little product in each tube.</li>
            <li> E.l.f is one of those brands that has some pretty good stuff, and some pretty bad throughout.</li>
            <li> wait 10-15 seconds for it to start drying first, then rub it over my entire lid.  </li>
            <li> I would give this primer 5 stars, because the actual product itself is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> My eyeshadow stays on all day and looks about the same as it did when I first put it on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry, just thought you guys may be interested in the multiple utilities of this product.</li>
            <li> The first time I only bought one</li>
            <li> I tend to get oily eye lids, and before I decided to get the ELF Eye Shadow Primer, the eye shadow would have faded off AND have developed a lot of creasing after about an hour or</li>
            <li> I tend to get oily eye lids, and before I decided to get the ELF Eye Shadow Primer, the eye shadow would have faded off AND have developed a lot of creasing after about an hour or</li>
            <li> I applied it early in the day and my eye shadow lasted all day without creasing.</li>
            <li> It does not cake on and does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and I have sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> It makes my eyeshadow look much brighter, and it disguises the blue veins on my eyelids a bit</li>
            <li> it like half way full</li>
            <li> Not as good as other expensive primers, but okay product compared to other products.</li>
            <li> However, I removed one star because of this theme I&#x27;ve found with e.l.f. items, which no doubt is the reason their products are so good, but still affordable: The container is pretty bad.</li>
            <li> and I actually got it on the exact same day as my prime products that were two day shipping!</li>
            <li> A little tiny bit of that, applied with your finger, good to go... and it lasts for a few months!  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d rather pay a few dollars more for something easier to apply that helps my shadow stay creaseless all day without the risk that I didn&#x27;t let my eyelids dry before I opened them or didn&#x27;t apply it evenly enough.</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t do makeup very often, it&#x27;s not much of a problem at all</li>
            <li> the tip of one of my applicators snapped off within a week(I&#x27;m not rough with them, it just popped right off), and one of the other applicator&#x27;s little plastic ring at the top won&#x27;t stay on, and usually just hangs out on the stick when I pull the applicator out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So perhaps sometimes there&#x27;s not quite as much in a container, or maybe it&#x27;s a little old?</li>
            <li> works pretty well, but sometimes stays a little sticky.</li>
            <li> The bottles are very light and smaller than I expected, but a little bit goes a long way, so they last quite a while.  </li>
            <li> I usually put it on right after doing my face primer.</li>
            <li> It may also be that I&#x27;m using too much, I don&#x27;t know, but will test it again using less and see if there is an improvement.  </li>
            <li> Lately where I live the humidity has been very high</li>
            <li> I did not sense any odd smells, and the consistency appeared normal.</li>
            <li> I was too tired to go take off what was left of my makeup, so I just went to right to bed.</li>
            <li> for everyone who likes the urban decay&#x27;s eyeshadow primer, this item is just the same only for less cost</li>
            <li> JUST AS LONG AS YOU ARE NOT ALLERGIC TO</li>
            <li> My eyeshadow stays in place all day long while I&#x27;m at work.  </li>
            <li> but the key here is, if you&#x27;re not allergic to sun cream/sun screen, then you may buy it, but having allergic reaction to these products its not pretty at all.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s completely dry.</li>
            <li> Just put a little on your eyelids, pat in place (don&#x27;t rub because it damages the fragile tissue) and then apply your eye shadow.  </li>
            <li> Last long past an 8 hour day.</li>
            <li> It was rather simple to apply: Dab the product on to the eyelid, blend, and let it set for a few minutes before applying the shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s still wet after you rub it in</li>
            <li> I received an empty bottle</li>
            <li> I learned my lesson when I applied the product to both eyes, but when I attempted to blend the second eye, the product had dried on.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way...</li>
            <li> product works the same (if not better) and a little bit goes a long way which makes them cost effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually buy the $30 Urban Decay but just thought I&#x27;d try this after reading another review.</li>
            <li> Based on the other reviews I had hoped tis would meet my needs.  </li>
            <li> Some other reviewer compared this brand favorably.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it under any other shadows.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to others as a less experience alternative to some other eye shadow primers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Those problems aren&#x27;t really a big deal since I can still just use my finger to apply it with the one with a broken stick, and the little ring doesn&#x27;t actually cause any issue at all.</li>
            <li> I also have dark circles under my eyes, so concealer is a must.</li>
            <li> I bought, in the past a single ELF eye primer</li>
            <li> Again, I will see if using less helps.</li>
            <li> it keeps on the eyeshadow all day but definately not a full coverage  primer.</li>
            <li> SO you cant mess it up</li>
            <li> Covers any discoloration or uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday</li>
            <li> I have never used eye shadow primer before, so I was not sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it started to rain while we were walking back to the house.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s usually creasing by the time I&#x27;m leaving work.</li>
            <li> but if you like wearing shadow but worry that it will be gone in a few hours you need to have this in your makeup bag!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I absolutely love this primer, but it&#x27;s not the worst I&#x27;ve used either.  </li>
            <li> I just hoped for the same results as before and unfortunately this isn&#x27;t the case.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll take a small amount of transfer, no problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually have a lot of creasing with my eye makeup.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s getting late, some friends leave, while others decide to stay the night (around 1am).</li>
            <li> I have terribly oily lids and would shy away from makeup other than mascara and a light shadow because it would be gone or creased within hours.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t look so tired all the time.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, in my case, it just doesn&#x27;t compare at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, I have to admit that.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, again, I have used much worse products, so I&#x27;m not saying this stuff is horrible.  </li>
            <li> It does crease after putting it, Now I&#x27;m using it when I want to practice on putting makeup just to hold the colors for a while :(</li>
            <li> Plus the applicator is just terrible.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this stuff  -- I bought more of it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product for the price. I usually buy the $30 Urban Decay but just thought I&#x27;d try this after reading another review. It does hold the color on lids for many hours. But after 5-6 hours it will crease a bit but a simple blending brush will fix in a jiff!!! All said, it&#x27;s worth a try for the awesome price!!!</li>
            <li> Te only eye shadow primer I use. Why change something that is perfect as is. No creases or lines. Make up looks the same when I get home as it did freshly applied.</li>
            <li> By far the best one I have used. Goes on easy and dries quick. Last long past an 8 hour day.</li>
            <li> Wonderful Product. Quick Shipping. Very pleased!!</li>
            <li> Okay, so here&#x27;s the deal: This stuff if pretty amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my order of the three-pack value, yesterday (Saturday, October 12, 2013), in addition to a Maybelline Eyeshadow palette that I was interesting in trying out. My boyfriend and I were planning on going out with some friends, so I wanted to use this chance to test out the primer! I tend to have oily eyelids, so I thought this was a good product to invest in, without spending too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit taken aback by the product. I have never used eye shadow primer before, so I was not sure what to expect. I did not sense any odd smells, and the consistency appeared normal. I applied ELF&#x27;s Eye Shadow primer and the Maybelline shadows around 5pm. It was rather simple to apply: Dab the product on to the eyelid, blend, and let it set for a few minutes before applying the shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, my friends and I went out, then later decided to come back to our house. At this point, it&#x27;s about 9pm and my eye shadow still looks like how I applied it! If I were to normally apply eye shadow with no primer, it would have faded -- fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a nice evening, and we all decided to go take a walk. Now, it&#x27;s about 10pm. Unfortunately, it started to rain while we were walking back to the house. Fast forward, it&#x27;s about 11pm now. I check on my eye makeup while I&#x27;m changing clothes in the bathroom, and it&#x27;s still there! Granted, it faded A LOT because of the rain, but I&#x27;m otherwise pretty impressed that it&#x27;s still there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s getting late, some friends leave, while others decide to stay the night (around 1am). I was too tired to go take off what was left of my makeup, so I just went to right to bed. Wake up at 10am, go to the bathroom, my eyeshadow is still there! Okay, okay, it&#x27;s basically faded off by now, and all that&#x27;s left is a a hint of brown shadow; but, if I were to normally go without primer, the eye shadow would have been gone by now. Hell, it would have been gone by the time I got home around 9, probably even an hour after I applied the eye shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re reading this review, and you&#x27;re interested in trying this, go and buy it! I am NOT disappointed. As I said before, I have not used any eye primers before, so this is my first one and I don&#x27;t have much experience to compare; however, comparing the primer to no primer at all, ELF&#x27;s Eye Shadow Primer is fantastic! I&#x27;m super glad I bought the three-pack value so I&#x27;m stocked for a good while! :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (4/12/14): I decided to update this review, and nothing has changed: this stuff is still pretty amazing :). Yesterday, I applied this and my eye shadow around  1pm. The weather was about 80 degrees, with 40% humidity (I live in Maryland, to give you an idea...). I was walking a lot outside, so of course, I begin to sweat. Around 4pm I checked my makeup, and the eye shadow looked as if I had just applied it; no creasing or fading, whatsoever. I went along with the rest of my day, and around 12:30am (so, end of the day for me), I noticed a bit of creasing, but otherwise nothing has, again, changed. While this may be a problem for some, this does not deter my opinion about this product. The fact that it lasted *11 hours* through sweating, humidity, and a long day is VERY impressive to me. I tend to get oily eye lids, and before I decided to get the ELF Eye Shadow Primer, the eye shadow would have faded off AND have developed a lot of creasing after about an hour or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I.e: BUY THIS!time I got home around 9, probably even an hour after I applied the eye shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re reading this review, and you&#x27;re interested in trying this, go and buy it!

            <li> I bought these for a &amp;#34;Favorite Things&amp;#34; party because it&#x27;s an essential!</li>
            <li> I never wore an eyelid primer until I tried elf&#x27;s brand and I love it.  I now can&#x27;t go without it!  It makes such a huge difference with my eyeshadow staying on and in place during the day!  Also, I was kind of hesitant to order this because it wasn&#x27;t through prime but I did anyway and I actually got it on the exact same day as my prime products that were two day shipping!</li>
            <li> For the price this is very good this product really helps keep eyeshadow on even the cheap brands i would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Overpriced online, can buy for $1 in stores or on their website. But even at $5, it&#x27;s a great deal, as this is comparable to Urban Decay&#x27;s primer. Love it, have gone through three already!</li>
            <li> I buy this primer 3 packs at a time so that I&#x27;ll never without it.  It&#x27;s a really awesome product.  One thing I do when applying it is (after I dab it on my eye lids) wait 10-15 seconds for it to start drying first, then rub it over my entire lid.  If it&#x27;s still wet after you rub it in it might crease, just make sure it&#x27;s completely dry.</li>
            <li> Very good coverage in the eyelid area! Covers any discoloration or uneven skin tone. Makes my eyeshadow stay true all day and night.</li>
            <li> E.l.f is one of those brands that has some pretty good stuff, and some pretty bad throughout. Their line is awesomely priced and I actually love their brush cleaner and their liquid eyeliner, but the primer just falls a bit short.  It lasts for a while bit with 8-9 hour retail shifts it&#x27;s usually creasing by the time I&#x27;m leaving work. It&#x27;s good for the price for sure and would recommend it to a friend looking for an inexpensive prime.</li>
            <li> This product works very nicely. I applied it early in the day and my eye shadow lasted all day without creasing. I am so very happy about that. I&#x27;ve wore eye shadow for quite some time and have always experienced creasing, but using this product I don&#x27;t have to worry about that. I would recommend this product to others as a less experience alternative to some other eye shadow primers. It definitely gets the job done without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li> This eyelid primer is wonderful. It does not cake on and does not irritate my sensitive skin. Works great! Definitely will purchase again.</li>
            <li> for everyone who likes the urban decay&#x27;s eyeshadow primer, this item is just the same only for less cost&lt;br /&gt;i get this on special offer 3 pack value, &amp; i love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good beauty product. JUST AS LONG AS YOU ARE NOT ALLERGIC TO SUN CREAMase pay attention to the details and what it contains. The item itself does wonders but unfortuantely i&#x27;m allergic to sun cream...i even sent images to the E.L.F corp about my allergic reactions to the cosmetics and no answer....but the key here is, if you&#x27;re not allergic to sun cream/sun screen, then you may buy it, but having allergic reaction to these products its not pretty at all.</li>
            <li> Based on the other reviews I had hoped tis would meet my needs.  Unfortunately not.  My eyes get oily and it cakes in the folds of my eyes.</li>
            <li> I would give this primer 5 stars, because the actual product itself is exactly what I needed. The primer is comfortable and makes a noticeable difference in the wear of my eye shadow. However, I removed one star because of this theme I&#x27;ve found with e.l.f. items, which no doubt is the reason their products are so good, but still affordable: The container is pretty bad. the tip of one of my applicators snapped off within a week(I&#x27;m not rough with them, it just popped right off), and one of the other applicator&#x27;s little plastic ring at the top won&#x27;t stay on, and usually just hangs out on the stick when I pull the applicator out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those problems aren&#x27;t really a big deal since I can still just use my finger to apply it with the one with a broken stick, and the little ring doesn&#x27;t actually cause any issue at all. Despite these issues, I will absolutely keep using this eye shadow primer as my main primer, because it does it&#x27;s job well!</li>
            <li> I love e.l.f products. This keeps my eye shadow in place all day. I&#x27;ve never tried the expensive brands and since this work beautifully ok dnt see trying them. It dries fast and doesn&#x27;t end up all messy in my crease, just goes on smooth and perfect with my uneven, oily pale-Alabaster skin. I use it everyday and I have sensitive eyes. I don&#x27;t have any problems with puffyness or waterying after applying this. Its prefect.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well. It makes my eyeshadow look much brighter, and it disguises the blue veins on my eyelids a bit so I don&#x27;t look so tired all the time. I&#x27;m glad that I bought the 3 pack so that I won&#x27;t run out anytime soon.</li>
            <li> Having oily skin is a blessing, but on the eyelids with shadow it is not.  I received a sample of a more expensive product and tried it on my eyelids before applying the shadow.  Amazing!  So I bought this product from Elf on Amazon as it advertised as doing the same - keep shadow in place without creasing.  It does exactly as advertised.  Just put a little on your eyelids, pat in place (don&#x27;t rub because it damages the fragile tissue) and then apply your eye shadow.  It will last all day until you remove it.  Love it!</li>
            <li> it keeps on the eyeshadow all day but definately not a full coverage  primer. Please help i would like to find a cheap but good primer and have not had any luck thus far.</li>
            <li> It does crease after putting it, Now I&#x27;m using it when I want to practice on putting makeup just to hold the colors for a while :(</li>
            <li> IT WORKS GREAT EASY TO APPLY ,AND OF COURSE THE PRICE IS SUPER CHEAP COMPARE TO PRODUCT LIKE URBAN DECAY</li>
            <li> This is just an added touch for when doing your making, I love it and it makes your eyeshadow last longee</li>
            <li> These work great its like glue for your eyeshadow. SO you cant mess it up or you&#x27;ll have to wash it off and try again.</li>
            <li> Of all the eye primer out there, this is by far the best!  It really keeps your makeup on all day and night.</li>
            <li> This primer is great!  It&#x27;s the first eyelid primer I&#x27;ve tried, so I can&#x27;t say how it compares to more expensive brands--but when it works so well, why would I spend more money?  The bottles are very light and smaller than I expected, but a little bit goes a long way, so they last quite a while.  The primer does a great job of keeping my eyeshadow on my lids all day long.  :)</li>
            <li> So worth the money really good quality.</li>
            <li> Really does a great job. Dries quickly, applies easily. Just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Amazing eye primer and if you want your colors to pop a little more get the pearl one (although beware of shimmer which is covered by eyeshadow) they both work tremendously well and you can get them for $1 at walmart or target.</li>
            <li> This is a PERFECT dupe for a more urban and expensive item out there. See what I did there? At a buck a pop you wouldn&#x27;t expect this to work but it does! I have terribly oily lids and would shy away from makeup other than mascara and a light shadow because it would be gone or creased within hours. This primer keeps everything put! The doe foot applicator allows for easy application and once dry (about a minute or so) your shadow and liner will not budge! Recommend purchasing this in store as it&#x27;s definitely cheaper but if you like wearing shadow but worry that it will be gone in a few hours you need to have this in your makeup bag!</li>
            <li> Great primer for the eyelid -- keeps your color in place all day at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I absolutely love this primer, but it&#x27;s not the worst I&#x27;ve used either.  Lately where I live the humidity has been very high and I&#x27;ve noted that my eye shadow has been creasing more.  It works better when I&#x27;m not sweating or when the humidity isn&#x27;t so high.  It may also be that I&#x27;m using too much, I don&#x27;t know, but will test it again using less and see if there is an improvement.  I bought, in the past a single ELF eye primer and it seemed to work much better, so  I don&#x27;t know why this time it seems to be working not as well as before save to say again the weather and the hot environment I work in.  On the plus side, again, I have used much worse products, so I&#x27;m not saying this stuff is horrible.  It&#x27;s not.  I just hoped for the same results as before and unfortunately this isn&#x27;t the case.  Still, it is sold at a great price, and for others seems to work well. Again, I will see if using less helps.</li>
            <li> This was reall a diapointment considering I got three. They really did not even help the eyeshadow like primer is supposed to do</li>
            <li> works pretty well, but sometimes stays a little sticky.</li>
            <li> The longest I have worn this eyeshadow primer. about 6 hours and I have never had my eyeshadow crease. This is great because my eyelids get really oily.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product 10+</li>
            <li> The only eyelid primer that works on my oily eyelids. I have droopy eyelids and my eyemake-up always end up collecting under the hood of my lids. This primer makes my eye make-up stay longer. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Me gusto mucho el producto estoy conforme y es de buena calidad, no tuve inconvenientes y fue rapido el envio</li>
            <li> Love elf and all there products.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. My eyeshadow stays on all day and looks about the same as it did when I first put it on. Definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> I received an empty bottle</li>
            <li> LOVE ELF THIS PRODUCT WORKS GREAT ON EYELIDS</li>
            <li> first time using a primer; love it. It really does help the shadow to stay on.</li>
            <li> I get about 8 hour stay-wear out of this, great for the price!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cheaper alternative to Urban Decay&#x27;s eyeshadow primer potion, which is about $20. Some other reviewer compared this brand favorably. Unfortunately, in my case, it just doesn&#x27;t compare at all. It lasts maybe 4 hours on a good day before the crease marks show and the eyeliner begins to smudge. The tube is also ridiculously tiny. I&#x27;ve gone through two tubes already and I just bought about a month ago. It&#x27;s a great price but it seems so wasteful. Plus the applicator is just terrible. In comparison, the $20 brand lasts for about half a year and works much better, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Works as expected, perfect for those pesky shadows that aren&#x27;t as pigmented as I&#x27;d like. I have normally oily eye lids and my shadow stays all day intact.</li>
            <li> Used all three and still look nothing like an elf.</li>
            <li> This primer is sooo worth the money! I have used many kinds before some expensive and some not... but this is cheap and great stuff!</li>
            <li> Put some on at 8 in the morning and after a long day came home at 9pm to find the eyeshadow still sitting perfectly in place</li>
            <li> This product works OK, but there is VERY little product in each tube. While it seems like a great deal, but it really isn&#x27;t when a tube lasts a very short time. It&#x27;s also very watery compared to the thicker UD primers. The Urban Decay primers are $20 and last forever (and work better too)!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, I have to admit that. However, it&#x27;s pretty darn good at keeping my eyeshadow in place all day. There tends to be only the smallest bit of transfer from my lip to brow bone--but I have huge eyes, ergo huge eyelids, eyelids so large that when my eyes are open the lids reach just below my eyebrow (so there&#x27;s a lot of area for possible transfer)--and I&#x27;ll take a small amount of transfer, no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part, though, it&#x27;s the fact that it can be used as a primer for lips as well! Best thing I&#x27;ve ever discovered for keeping lipstick to last 8-10 hours:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1--Some kind of Chapstick for moisture&lt;br /&gt;Step 2--Immediately! throw this stuff on top&lt;br /&gt;Step 3--Wait for it to dry&lt;br /&gt;Step 4--Apply color and blot&lt;br /&gt;Step 5--Use Cargo-HD lip primer overtop&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, just thought you guys may be interested in the multiple utilities of this product. You should definitely give it a try!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT! And The Price For 3 Is Unbeatable! This Is The Best Eye Primer Ever!</li>
            <li> Considering this product is so affordable, it works really well!! I usually have a lot of creasing with my eye makeup. This is especially true with concealers. I also have dark circles under my eyes, so concealer is a must. With this primer, I can apply concealer that lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t crease. The only thing that you should be aware of in using this product is that it dries quickly. Be sure to apply and blend back to back. I learned my lesson when I applied the product to both eyes, but when I attempted to blend the second eye, the product had dried on. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the product beside that.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE. TERRIBLE. TERRIBLE. Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I used to use the Urban Decay primer and when they changed the bottle design to not have an applicator it irritated me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works the same (if not better) and a little bit goes a long way which makes them cost effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is a lot better than Urban Decay as well. ;)</li>
            <li> This primer is very watery and if you don&#x27;t apply it just right, it won&#x27;t work right.  It is cheap, and it is better than going without any primer at all, I&#x27;ll give it that... but I&#x27;d rather pay a few dollars more for something easier to apply that helps my shadow stay creaseless all day without the risk that I didn&#x27;t let my eyelids dry before I opened them or didn&#x27;t apply it evenly enough. I don&#x27;t have an extra 5-10 minutes every morning to spend putting my face on, so I&#x27;m switching back to Milani Eyeshadow Primer, which is only 5 bucks at Walmart.  A little tiny bit of that, applied with your finger, good to go... and it lasts for a few months!  Much better, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It was cheap and works wonderfully.  My eyeshadow stays in place all day long while I&#x27;m at work.  I love this.</li>
            <li> I am definitely satisfied with this purchase...mainly because of the price.  The liquid is not as good as some more expensive primer I have had, but it does the job.  A little bit goes a long way...I dab some on my lids and then rub in with my finger.</li>
            <li> Great lovely makeup thank you I&#x27;m happy with it I got some for my family and friends as we&#x27;ll  thank again</li>
            <li> It,s nice to use and cheaper than other shop,very good.I will buy again after used it,it is my right choice.</li>
            <li> It a really good thing tat it comes in 3 but then it not even seem full at all... it like half way full... maybe not buying it again....</li>
            <li> I love this! I&#x27;ve always struggled with smeared eyeshadow because I&#x27;m an oily person but this is voodoo magic! My eyeshadow lasted easily 16 hours without a single smudge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downside, taking it off was a bit of a pain. Since I don&#x27;t do makeup very often, it&#x27;s not much of a problem at all and it would have gone smoother if I actually had makeup remover and not just warm water and a soft rag Lol</li>
            <li> I like the product. Not as good as other expensive primers, but okay product compared to other products. Since it gives you three primers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this for forever and it is the best stuff ever. It keeps all of your eye makeup on far better than any other product I&#x27;ve ever used, and it actually works better than my concealer to get rid of all sorts of imperfections under the eyes (found that out after I smudged it under my eye on accident).</li>
            <li> very good product!!!!</li>
            <li> Works great keeps color on your eye lid and doesn&#x27;t crease your make up last would definitely recommend and got here on time</li>
            <li> This is a great primer.  It goes on smooth, light and helps my shadow stay on all day.  Love it.</li>
            <li> The only eyelid primer I use I have tried others and nothing keeps my eyeshadow on like this does I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li> not caused a big differences with or without it, but you can still tell the colors of eye shadow are showier than before.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and my daughter  can&#x27;t do without this.</li>
            <li> Works great for a eye primer</li>
            <li> This product really works as a primer on eyelids.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought this eye primer. The first time I only bought one and I liked it so much, this time I bought the 3 pack. I&#x27;m finding this second time around, it seems my primer is running out faster. So perhaps sometimes there&#x27;s not quite as much in a container, or maybe it&#x27;s a little old? But the product works great underneath my Avon eye shadow. I haven&#x27;t tried it under any other shadows. Shadows are not all the same, so perhaps that could play some part in how well your shadow stays on with primer. This primer however doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. I usually put it on right after doing my face primer. By the time I quickly put on my Bare Minerals foundation, it&#x27;s ready for shadow.</li>
