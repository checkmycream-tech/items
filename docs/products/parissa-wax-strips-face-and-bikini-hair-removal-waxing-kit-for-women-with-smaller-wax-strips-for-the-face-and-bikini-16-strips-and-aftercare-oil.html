            <li>These work the best of all the wax strips I&#x27;ve tried.</li>

            <li>, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>For this, they work great.</li>
            <li>They work great.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use and a good value!</li>
            <li>My brows look just as good as when the &#x27;pros&#x27; do it.  </li>
            <li>The strips do the job for a fraction of the price and 99% as good as having the job done at a salon, without ever having to leave home.</li>
            <li>Just get a good mirror, and you are set.</li>
            <li>I had good expectations with this product because I thought that it was affordable &amp; would get the job done.</li>
            <li>Target also sells these strips for a bit more, so if you&#x27;re in a time crunch, these are great to use.</li>
            <li>Great product, will be buying more and recommending to others.</li>
            <li>I read a ton of great reviews about Gigi but opted for Parissa because they were cheaper and more \\&quot;natural\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I love these wax strips!</li>
            <li>Absolutely satisfied!</li>
            <li>They are effective and don&#x27;t bother my skin.</li>
            <li>Parissa is the best and works very well.</li>
            <li>I am sure they would be good to touch up eyebrows too, I just haven&#x27;t tried that yet.</li>
            <li>B008R799G4 Cirepil Escential Rose Wax Tin, 14.1 Ounce (Packaging May Vary)]])</li>
            <li>You rub the strips together to warm and soften, then peel them apart to expose the wax.  </li>
            <li>The kit comes with a nice soothing oil too, to remove wax residue after treatment.</li>
            <li>But these leave your skin smooth and the irritation is so miniscule(meaning that wonderful red color you get from waxing anyway) wonderful product.</li>
            <li>: you warm the strip up in your hands for a minute, plaster it on whatever you&#x27;re waxing --</li>
            <li>These are the best at-home strips I&#x27;ve been able to find, they work really well and at a good price.</li>
            <li>strips are great for maintenance after the first one, though!</li>
            <li>I bought this because it seemed to be the most popular brand</li>
            <li>I am thrilled to find a great product made of natural ingredients that works so good.</li>
            <li>It was easy to warm up the strips with just the heat of my hands (as instructed) and pull apart and start ripping.</li>
            <li>I think it is good for a quick job.</li>
            <li>You need to make sure you warm them up pretty good.</li>
            <li>I really thought these would be great to use for bikini</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in the US.</li>
            <li>probably get a better experience with duct tape though</li>
            <li>I think this warms up the &#x27;wax&#x27; so that it comes off cleaner and pulls more hair up.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these wax strips for my upper lip for years and am very happy with them.  </li>
            <li>and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Also, it comes with the lovely soothing oil which removes any excess wax.</li>
            <li>(it said they can be used more than once)</li>
            <li>These work well but are somewhat wasteful - better to just get a pot of wax and cloth strips and DIY</li>
            <li>They pull the most hair out</li>
            <li>They are cheapest and most easy to use wax strips I have yet to find.</li>
            <li>These strips remove hair without repeating, which is a good thing because they really stick and rip out all the hairs (ouch).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This was my first time ever attempting to wax my own bikini line, and I am very pleased with the ease, intuitiveness and effectiveness of this product right from the start.</li>
            <li>Yeah, they are easy since they are already prepared</li>
            <li>completely easy to use</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so easy.  </li>
            <li>They would probably be okay on fine facial hair but not so great on course hair.  </li>
            <li>great product and fast shipping, thanks!</li>
            <li>Not so many strips for the money, but they work adequately.</li>
            <li>This has been working great at removing upper lip hair.</li>
            <li>The oil is v. smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t quite as efficient as I would have hoped however the after wax oil was fantastic</li>
            <li>Warm with your hands, pull the strip apart and now you have two very sticky strips.  </li>
            <li>I use one for each side of my upper lip and they work great.  </li>
            <li>Super easy to use, works quite well.  </li>
            <li>These are quick and easy.</li>
            <li>I use it for my upper lip, and it works amazing!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not that excited about them.  </li>
            <li>I tried the bikini/face wax strips on a whim, and I was happily surprised by how easy it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are plenty of strips to do a bikini line pretty thoroughly once--depends on how good you get at it.</li>
            <li>Super quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>No adverse skin reactions or goopy wax to heat up and clean off.</li>
            <li>This product is very easy to use and no mess!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for a couple years now on my upper lip only, and they work great!</li>
            <li>Then you quickly place the strips on the desired area and pull against the direction of hair growth.  </li>
            <li>Better than the ones that you normally get in the pharmacy</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re supposed to be good for multiple passes, but there isn&#x27;t enough wax to do two effective passes, let alone</li>
            <li>Sometimes you have to use multiple strips to get more hair out, but the wax is fairly strong.</li>
            <li>Being able to finally do this relatively easily in the comfort of my own home was a big plus.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The azulene oil is a must to calm the skin.  </li>
            <li>One tip is to warm them up in your hands by running your hands back and forth.  </li>
            <li>obviously not too close but just close enough to get the wax nice and warm.</li>
            <li>But it does not remove hair as clean as real waxing</li>
            <li>I definitely prefer getting waxed by a professional, but since I didn&#x27;t want to spend over $100 I bought this because of the good ratings it already had.</li>
            <li>The great thing about this product is that it is not as messy and time consuming as real waxing.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, no mess.</li>
            <li>This was my first attempt at waxing myself and I can&#x27;t say that it has paid off ... yet.</li>
            <li>It was my first time waxing.</li>
            <li>great seller but the product sucks..</li>
            <li>i like their regular hot wax better.</li>
            <li>I expected more pain, but it was not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>did end up pre-trimming some areas to about 1/8\\&quot;-1/4\\&quot; in some areas to help with the effectiveness, but, considering this was my first time trying any product like this one</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure my technique will improve each time, and it only took five minutes.</li>
            <li>I also found that these weren&#x27;t able to pull out any of my coarse pubic hair.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going for a full Brazilian, take my advice: have your first wax professionally done!</li>
            <li>They are easy to use, effective, and although ripping hair out of your skin is never going to be painless, the ingredients at least, are gentle.</li>
            <li>Liked alot the first box I ordered, next box though, it did not pull off near as much hair.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to cut if you need a slightly smaller strip, and the oil included gets rid of an leftover wax-</li>
            <li>but I know for certain that it works:</li>
            <li>have worked fine for me for facial &amp;#34;fuzz&amp;#34;; would recommend</li>
            <li>Veet has thicker wax on its strips and works really well</li>
            <li>The bikini wax kit does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>Much happier with veet wax strips.</li>
            <li>After spending so much of money for waxing in the salons.. i always felt dissappointed.</li>
            <li>I could do it for myself and it was very neat.</li>
            <li>But they did not remove as much hair either.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t feel as much pain.</li>
            <li>mess, no fuss, quick and easy hair removal for your bikini area.</li>
            <li>It takes a little practice to find your technique, but once you do, these quick and easy strips work very well.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for a sweet lady I met in a nursing home who was very embarrassed about her facial hair.</li>
            <li>The directions say you can even re-use the strips and that is true - I used two strips to wax both brows and the upper lip.</li>
            <li>All turned out nice and slick, anyway.</li>
            <li>comes with only 12 strips, but you can use one strip more than twice, so I only used four of them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten salon waxing previously but paying $60 for full leg waxing gets expensive quickly and these are a great alternative.  </li>
            <li>recommend the Parissa Face &amp; Bikini Strips highly.</li>
            <li>I would recomend this highly</li>
            <li>You can easily cut them into any shape to suit the area you need waxed, but remember that you need enough strip to grab onto (and rip) for proper removal.</li>
            <li>I followed all the instructions perfectly and several tries and all 16 wasted strips later, not one hair was pulled from my body.</li>
            <li>Trust me when I say that the first time is the most painful because you have the most hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was not able to use the strips more than once.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different hair removal methods, and different products within the same method</li>
            <li>Hurts more than a professional wax, but who cares for a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often have to do it several times for it to get everything, but again, I don&#x27;t care because it&#x27;s such an enormous savings</li>
            <li>These work so much better than the brand I previously used- thoroughly removes all hair so you don&#x27;t have to do the same spot</li>
            <li>I have tried their hot wax product and it was a hot mess.</li>
            <li>I have been getting my brows waxed professionally for years.  </li>
            <li>but I often hold them near my hair straightener when I am about to use them-</li>
            <li>Coming from someone who works at a professional waxing clinic, I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and do not like products made with chemicals.</li>
            <li>I found the wax too thin to remove hair effectively.</li>
            <li>and the oil that comes with strips clean the after mess.</li>
            <li>eyebrows (and other light facial hair)</li>
            <li>One set of two strips is enough for both (not perfect on the bikini line, but the upper lip is more important for me).</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin, and after a few sessions with these my skin has grown used to them.</li>
            <li>This was my first time waxing myself and it was harder than I thought.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend these as these are both more painful than a professional wax and significantly less effective.</li>
            <li>the five or six the directions say you should get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not having been professionally waxed before using them, I didn&#x27;t know how ineffective they actually were until I did go in for a professional bikini wax.  </li>
            <li>The first strip I tried, I got a couple of hairs out (literally...a couple) and I tried to use the strip in other places on my face</li>
            <li>I would recommend these for light facial waxing and maybe the bikini LINE, but seriously, these are in no way hefty enough to try and tackle a partial or full brazilian.</li>
            <li>The wax strip is clear so you can see where you are placing it, what areas it will cover and such.</li>
            <li>Barely got any hair off.</li>
            <li>(A few minutes of lost dignity and leaving with a lighter wallet is still worth it to me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>, it takes longer because the strips are small, and the more difficult-to-reach or see regions are kind of tough to get to, but I will be using these when I just can&#x27;t get to the salon or am too lazy to.</li>
            <li>I noticed in other reviews that the people who complained about them were pretty much first time users.  </li>
            <li>These little strips do not contain as much wax on them as the leg ones.  </li>

            <li> Better than the ones that you normally get in the pharmacy</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re supposed to be good for multiple passes, but there isn&#x27;t enough wax to do two effective passes, let alone</li>
            <li> Sometimes you have to use multiple strips to get more hair out, but the wax is fairly strong.</li>
            <li> Being able to finally do this relatively easily in the comfort of my own home was a big plus.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The azulene oil is a must to calm the skin.  </li>
            <li> One tip is to warm them up in your hands by running your hands back and forth.  </li>
            <li> obviously not too close but just close enough to get the wax nice and warm.</li>
            <li> But it does not remove hair as clean as real waxing</li>
            <li> I definitely prefer getting waxed by a professional, but since I didn&#x27;t want to spend over $100 I bought this because of the good ratings it already had.</li>
            <li> The great thing about this product is that it is not as messy and time consuming as real waxing.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, no mess.</li>
            <li> This was my first attempt at waxing myself and I can&#x27;t say that it has paid off ... yet.</li>
            <li> It was my first time waxing.</li>
            <li> great seller but the product sucks..</li>
            <li> i like their regular hot wax better.</li>
            <li> I expected more pain, but it was not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> did end up pre-trimming some areas to about 1/8\\&quot;-1/4\\&quot; in some areas to help with the effectiveness, but, considering this was my first time trying any product like this one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure my technique will improve each time, and it only took five minutes.</li>
            <li> I also found that these weren&#x27;t able to pull out any of my coarse pubic hair.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going for a full Brazilian, take my advice: have your first wax professionally done!</li>
            <li> They are easy to use, effective, and although ripping hair out of your skin is never going to be painless, the ingredients at least, are gentle.</li>
            <li> Liked alot the first box I ordered, next box though, it did not pull off near as much hair.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re easy to cut if you need a slightly smaller strip, and the oil included gets rid of an leftover wax-</li>
            <li> but I know for certain that it works:</li>
            <li> have worked fine for me for facial &amp;#34;fuzz&amp;#34;; would recommend</li>
            <li> Veet has thicker wax on its strips and works really well</li>
            <li> The bikini wax kit does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> Much happier with veet wax strips.</li>
            <li> After spending so much of money for waxing in the salons.. i always felt dissappointed.</li>
            <li> I could do it for myself and it was very neat.</li>
            <li> But they did not remove as much hair either.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel as much pain.</li>
            <li> mess, no fuss, quick and easy hair removal for your bikini area.</li>
            <li> It takes a little practice to find your technique, but once you do, these quick and easy strips work very well.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for a sweet lady I met in a nursing home who was very embarrassed about her facial hair.</li>
            <li> The directions say you can even re-use the strips and that is true - I used two strips to wax both brows and the upper lip.</li>
            <li> All turned out nice and slick, anyway.</li>
            <li> comes with only 12 strips, but you can use one strip more than twice, so I only used four of them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten salon waxing previously but paying $60 for full leg waxing gets expensive quickly and these are a great alternative.  </li>
            <li> recommend the Parissa Face &amp; Bikini Strips highly.</li>
            <li> I would recomend this highly</li>
            <li> You can easily cut them into any shape to suit the area you need waxed, but remember that you need enough strip to grab onto (and rip) for proper removal.</li>
            <li> I followed all the instructions perfectly and several tries and all 16 wasted strips later, not one hair was pulled from my body.</li>
            <li> Trust me when I say that the first time is the most painful because you have the most hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was not able to use the strips more than once.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many different hair removal methods, and different products within the same method</li>
            <li> Hurts more than a professional wax, but who cares for a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often have to do it several times for it to get everything, but again, I don&#x27;t care because it&#x27;s such an enormous savings</li>
            <li> These work so much better than the brand I previously used- thoroughly removes all hair so you don&#x27;t have to do the same spot</li>
            <li> I have tried their hot wax product and it was a hot mess.</li>
            <li> I have been getting my brows waxed professionally for years.  </li>
            <li> but I often hold them near my hair straightener when I am about to use them-</li>
            <li> Coming from someone who works at a professional waxing clinic, I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and do not like products made with chemicals.</li>
            <li> I found the wax too thin to remove hair effectively.</li>
            <li> and the oil that comes with strips clean the after mess.</li>
            <li> eyebrows (and other light facial hair)</li>
            <li> One set of two strips is enough for both (not perfect on the bikini line, but the upper lip is more important for me).</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin, and after a few sessions with these my skin has grown used to them.</li>
            <li> This was my first time waxing myself and it was harder than I thought.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend these as these are both more painful than a professional wax and significantly less effective.</li>
            <li> the five or six the directions say you should get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not having been professionally waxed before using them, I didn&#x27;t know how ineffective they actually were until I did go in for a professional bikini wax.  </li>
            <li> The first strip I tried, I got a couple of hairs out (literally...a couple) and I tried to use the strip in other places on my face</li>
            <li> I would recommend these for light facial waxing and maybe the bikini LINE, but seriously, these are in no way hefty enough to try and tackle a partial or full brazilian.</li>
            <li> The wax strip is clear so you can see where you are placing it, what areas it will cover and such.</li>
            <li> Barely got any hair off.</li>
            <li> (A few minutes of lost dignity and leaving with a lighter wallet is still worth it to me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> , it takes longer because the strips are small, and the more difficult-to-reach or see regions are kind of tough to get to, but I will be using these when I just can&#x27;t get to the salon or am too lazy to.</li>
            <li> I noticed in other reviews that the people who complained about them were pretty much first time users.  </li>
            <li> These little strips do not contain as much wax on them as the leg ones.  </li>
            <li> After a while I got frustrated and pulled out my new tweezers (which are awesome!!) and went through the tedious process of pulling the remaining hairs on my neck and face.</li>
            <li> Although the directions include a tip to not to repeat on the same area of skin within one treatment, I do repeat several times over some spots until all hair is removed, using a single wax strip.</li>
            <li> I have not used for bikini area since I would think these could be too small, but for the face, they work very well.</li>
            <li> I HATED THESE...NOT QUICK OR EASY, VERY MESSY, DIDN&#x27;T REMOVE ALL HAIR ON THE FIRST TRY &amp;</li>
            <li> (And not to sound like an annoying salesperson, but if you&#x27;re serious about waxing, Cirepil Escential Rose Wax is what my employers use.</li>
            <li> No hair came off whatsoever and to try to clean up is difficult as nothing gets this wax off of your skin except the ENTIRE bottle of oil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are easy to use, reasonably-priced, and I found them to be much less painful than hot wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that they work EXTREMELY well if you only use each strip once.</li>
            <li> I used to use microwavable wax for facial waxing, which was messy, more difficult, and more painful than these.</li>
            <li> It comes with \\&quot;Azulene Oil,\\&quot; and the little bottle is PLENTY enough for the amount of strips you get (16).</li>
            <li> I tend to grow a little hair on my chin and cheeks and it tends to be curly and coarse.</li>
            <li> I continue to use this product as it sure is less expensive than going to the salon!</li>
            <li> I used them in a few different areas, warming them with my hands and even tried with the blow drier.</li>
            <li> Works with minimal pain or effort.</li>
            <li> The plastic strips that the wax comes on can get slippery and it was difficult to know if the wax was at the right temperature.</li>
            <li> The sticky just is not strong enough for coarser hair.</li>
            <li> I agree with a lot of the other reviews that said the strips don&#x27;t have enough wax to pull out all the hair and that these are a waste of money.</li>
            <li> i was afraid to wash first because I figured there was a reason this product said not to-like you might be more likely to have a bad reaction.</li>
            <li> Zipping off the strip is a little uncomfortable, but not bad at all.</li>
            <li> Not consistent.</li>
            <li> What other wax can do that?&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> These strips were not as messy and did not leave behind as much residue as other wax strips.</li>
            <li> I had previously tired the same brand, but larger strips for legs.  </li>
            <li> We spend a lot of time at the beach, so I am frequently in need of bikini waxing (I get a partial Brazilian).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find salon waxing to be expensive, time-consuming and painful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I thought the strips would be fabric strips, but the strips are actually a thin clear plastic with narrow areas of wax on them.</li>
            <li> (forget the brand name, Sallie something?) and feels less chemical.</li>
            <li> Instead it would rip out the weaker hairs &amp; leave the stronger, thicker hairs in place, thus leaving a patchy &amp; sticky mess.</li>
            <li> I decided to try these strips to try to save a little money vs. going to the salon.  </li>
            <li> her little eyes lit up after she seen her lip hair was gone.</li>
            <li> The strips worked well on my little mustache</li>
            <li> However, I did clean my skin before applying the strips, which they tell you not to do in the instructions :(  </li>
            <li> so once you&#x27;ve had your initial, painful visit to a professional waxing studio, try using these yourself.</li>
            <li> more than once, which is painful and irritating.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical, but these strips really work!  </li>
            <li> If you have trouble doing yourself, you can always take others help.</li>
            <li> This product was definitely a waste of money...</li>
            <li> I heat a strip up slightly with a hairdryer and rub it between my palms, cut the strip in half for ease of application, and rip the suckers out.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I could be doing wrong, and yet it simply just doesn&#x27;t get the hairs down there.</li>
            <li> Strips are too small and don&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> I am pretty disappointed</li>
            <li> Like me, you&#x27;ll probably also need to do random tweezing (so you don&#x27;t have to re-wax the same areas..</li>
            <li> The wax strips are too small for the bikini area.</li>
            <li> These also come with a small bottle of oil to remove any residue.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> Overoll, i think this wax is gread for anyone who hates to make mess doing wax!!</li>
            <li> and she said it was too hard for her to do.</li>
            <li> Oh well, at least it works for my face.</li>
            <li> Yeah, these strips are too small!</li>
            <li> I tried purchasing less expensive competitive products in the store that did not work.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a ton cheaper than a studio visit and actually not that bad.</li>
            <li> These strips worked poorly.  </li>
            <li> They were useless.</li>
            <li> The wax from the strip sticks to the skin (leaves a residue) and the remaining hair that the strip failed to pull out.</li>
            <li> Might just be me but using those waxing stripes are difficult and no hair removal happens.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive</li>
            <li> I got sick of paying $20 for waxes</li>
            <li> Doing so is painful!</li>
            <li> the worst does not remove hair at all</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Yeah, they are easy since they are already prepared but I&#x27;m not that excited about them.  I am a novice waxer and don&#x27;t trust them on my eyebrows since there is no definition on the strip and I worry about misplacing it.  They would probably be okay on fine facial hair but not so great on course hair.  I&#x27;ll use the ones I have left but won&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
            <li> This has been working great at removing upper lip hair. However it doesn&#x27;t get anything from my bikini. I don&#x27;t know what I could be doing wrong, and yet it simply just doesn&#x27;t get the hairs down there. Oh well, at least it works for my face.</li>
            <li> I really thought these would be great to use for bikini but they don&#x27;t. The wax doesn&#x27;t work well enough to pull out a lot of hair.. If I wanted to rid just one section it would take repeated attempts. Doing so is painful! I bled. If I&#x27;m going to wax my bikini I want it done only once in the same spot! Strips are too small and don&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a couple years now on my upper lip only, and they work great! I heat a strip up slightly with a hairdryer and rub it between my palms, cut the strip in half for ease of application, and rip the suckers out.  Target also sells these strips for a bit more, so if you&#x27;re in a time crunch, these are great to use. I have super sensitive skin, and after a few sessions with these my skin has grown used to them.</li>
            <li> I have been getting my brows waxed professionally for years.  I decided to try these strips to try to save a little money vs. going to the salon.  I was very skeptical, but these strips really work!  Just follow the instructions and they work as well as salon waxing.  My brows look just as good as when the &#x27;pros&#x27; do it.  The directions say you can even re-use the strips and that is true - I used two strips to wax both brows and the upper lip. Great product, will be buying more and recommending to others.</li>
            <li> These are great for in between visits to the salon! Very easy to use and a good value!</li>
            <li> I bought this because it seemed to be the most popular brand (although I stand to be corrected on this). I found the wax too thin to remove hair effectively. I am used to the brand Veet which is sold in Europe. Veet has thicker wax on its strips and works really well but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in the US. I won&#x27;t be buying this  Parissa brand again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a sweet lady I met in a nursing home who was very embarrassed about her facial hair. Well I told her about wax to get it off and she said it was too hard for her to do. So I came acrossed this product and gave it to her and she was very happy...her little eyes lit up after she seen her lip hair was gone.</li>
            <li> This was my first attempt at waxing myself and I can&#x27;t say that it has paid off ... yet. I read a ton of great reviews about Gigi but opted for Parissa because they were cheaper and more \\&quot;natural\\&quot;. The bikini wax kit does absolutely nothing. No hair came off whatsoever and to try to clean up is difficult as nothing gets this wax off of your skin except the ENTIRE bottle of oil. I am pretty disappointed... going to have to try a different brand or just give up altogether.</li>
            <li> I was not able to use the strips more than once.  Much happier with veet wax strips.</li>
            <li> After spending so much of money for waxing in the salons.. i always felt dissappointed. I got to see these in Amazon and gave a try. They are simply awesome. I could do it for myself and it was very neat. The oil is v. smooth and silky. If you have trouble doing yourself, you can always take others help. You would save money with these rather spending in the beauty salons... I have ordered for legs and body too and I feel great using them.</li>
            <li> This product was definitely a waste of money... I followed all the instructions perfectly and several tries and all 16 wasted strips later, not one hair was pulled from my body. I definitely would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These are the only wax strips I use. They are effective and don&#x27;t bother my skin.</li>
            <li> What a rip off.  Do not buy these unless you like throwing away your money.  They were useless.</li>
            <li> We spend a lot of time at the beach, so I am frequently in need of bikini waxing (I get a partial Brazilian).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find salon waxing to be expensive, time-consuming and painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read about the Parissa wax strips in a magazine, and ordered a kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are easy to use, reasonably-priced, and I found them to be much less painful than hot wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True, it takes longer because the strips are small, and the more difficult-to-reach or see regions are kind of tough to get to, but I will be using these when I just can&#x27;t get to the salon or am too lazy to. Being able to finally do this relatively easily in the comfort of my own home was a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the Parissa Face &amp; Bikini Strips highly.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me.  Left lots of hair and bumps.</li>
            <li> It was my first time waxing. And I thought the strips would be fabric strips, but the strips are actually a thin clear plastic with narrow areas of wax on them. Yeah, these strips are too small! The wax from the strip sticks to the skin (leaves a residue) and the remaining hair that the strip failed to pull out. I agree with a lot of the other reviews that said the strips don&#x27;t have enough wax to pull out all the hair and that these are a waste of money. Would definitely not buy these again!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going for a full Brazilian, take my advice: have your first wax professionally done! Trust me when I say that the first time is the most painful because you have the most hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These strips are great for maintenance after the first one, though! Hair grows in cycles.. so once you&#x27;ve had your initial, painful visit to a professional waxing studio, try using these yourself. Like me, you&#x27;ll probably also need to do random tweezing (so you don&#x27;t have to re-wax the same areas.. as some hairs just won&#x27;t stick.) But it&#x27;s a ton cheaper than a studio visit and actually not that bad.</li>
            <li> I used this product for years to keep my eyebrows touched up. They are easy to use, effective, and although ripping hair out of your skin is never going to be painless, the ingredients at least, are gentle. You can easily cut them into any shape to suit the area you need waxed, but remember that you need enough strip to grab onto (and rip) for proper removal. I would recommend these for light facial waxing and maybe the bikini LINE, but seriously, these are in no way hefty enough to try and tackle a partial or full brazilian. Go for the bigger size for all that, if you are the daring type. I prefer the salon for &amp;#34;industrial&amp;#34; work. (A few minutes of lost dignity and leaving with a lighter wallet is still worth it to me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For eyebrows (and other light facial hair), this is a great product.</li>
            <li> great seller but the product sucks.. just saying this stuff is the worst does not remove hair at all yep</li>
            <li> I use these all the time. Better than the ones that you normally get in the pharmacy (forget the brand name, Sallie something?) and feels less chemical. Sometimes you have to use multiple strips to get more hair out, but the wax is fairly strong. Super quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use, works quite well.  No adverse skin reactions or goopy wax to heat up and clean off.</li>
            <li> Liked alot the first box I ordered, next box though, it did not pull off near as much hair. Not consistent.</li>
            <li> I tried purchasing less expensive competitive products in the store that did not work. Parissa is the best and works very well.</li>
            <li> not a fan. made me feel sticky. i like their regular hot wax better. I feel like this product is similar to duct tape. probably get a better experience with duct tape though</li>
            <li> These wax strips are perfect for waxing at home, but don&#x27;t expect salon quality.  One tip is to warm them up in your hands by running your hands back and forth.  I think this warms up the &#x27;wax&#x27; so that it comes off cleaner and pulls more hair up.  I continue to use this product as it sure is less expensive than going to the salon!</li>
            <li> Might just be me but using those waxing stripes are difficult and no hair removal happens. Would not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I used to use microwavable wax for facial waxing, which was messy, more difficult, and more painful than these. These are quick and easy. I use them on my upper lip and bikini line. One set of two strips is enough for both (not perfect on the bikini line, but the upper lip is more important for me).</li>
            <li> The strips do the job for a fraction of the price and 99% as good as having the job done at a salon, without ever having to leave home. Just get a good mirror, and you are set.</li>
            <li> These strips were not as messy and did not leave behind as much residue as other wax strips. But they did not remove as much hair either. It says not to wash the skin before use so it seems if you have any oil on your skin they don&#x27;t work. i was afraid to wash first because I figured there was a reason this product said not to-like you might be more likely to have a bad reaction.</li>
            <li> I tried the bikini/face wax strips on a whim, and I was happily surprised by how easy it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are plenty of strips to do a bikini line pretty thoroughly once--depends on how good you get at it. It was easy to warm up the strips with just the heat of my hands (as instructed) and pull apart and start ripping. I expected more pain, but it was not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did end up pre-trimming some areas to about 1/8\\&quot;-1/4\\&quot; in some areas to help with the effectiveness, but, considering this was my first time trying any product like this one, it turned out great! I&#x27;m sure my technique will improve each time, and it only took five minutes. It comes with \\&quot;Azulene Oil,\\&quot; and the little bottle is PLENTY enough for the amount of strips you get (16). It does get rid of any left-over stickiness as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first time ever attempting to wax my own bikini line, and I am very pleased with the ease, intuitiveness and effectiveness of this product right from the start.</li>
            <li> I HATED THESE...NOT QUICK OR EASY, VERY MESSY, DIDN&#x27;T REMOVE ALL HAIR ON THE FIRST TRY &amp; DEFINATELY DID NOT GIVE ENOUGH TO REMOVE ANYTHING EXCEPT MAYBE THE UPPER LIP!  SAVE YOUR MONEY &amp; DON&#x27;T BUY THESES</li>
            <li> I love these wax strips! They work so well. The blue liquid they have with them works wonders after!</li>
            <li> have worked fine for me for facial &amp;#34;fuzz&amp;#34;; would recommend</li>
            <li> I read about these in a magazine years ago and have been using them ever since. However, I only use them on my upper lip. For this, they work great. You need to make sure you warm them up pretty good. The directions suggest warming them up in your hands but I often hold them near my hair straightener when I am about to use them- obviously not too close but just close enough to get the wax nice and warm. I am sure they would be good to touch up eyebrows too, I just haven&#x27;t tried that yet.</li>
            <li> Coming from someone who works at a professional waxing clinic, I would not recommend this product to anyone. The wax strips are too small for the bikini area. I also found that these weren&#x27;t able to pull out any of my coarse pubic hair. Instead it would rip out the weaker hairs &amp; leave the stronger, thicker hairs in place, thus leaving a patchy &amp; sticky mess. I had good expectations with this product because I thought that it was affordable &amp; would get the job done. All I can say is \\&quot;You get what you pay for\\&quot;. (And not to sound like an annoying salesperson, but if you&#x27;re serious about waxing, Cirepil Escential Rose Wax is what my employers use. It&#x27;s expensive but I know for certain that it works: [[ASIN:B008R799G4 Cirepil Escential Rose Wax Tin, 14.1 Ounce (Packaging May Vary)]])</li>
            <li> I had previously tired the same brand, but larger strips for legs.  These little strips do not contain as much wax on them as the leg ones.  So, I will go back to the leg ones and just cut them to use on my chin/lip.  Dissapointed, as the size is perfect.</li>
            <li> Absolutely satisfied! 5 Stars</li>
            <li> It only pulled out about one in ten hairs but it still irritated my skin.  The sticky just is not strong enough for coarser hair. May work on face.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely wonderful!  They are cheapest and most easy to use wax strips I have yet to find. I can&#x27;t seem to find them in stores anymore, so I&#x27;ve been just stocking up 4+ boxes at a time from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just rub between your hands, pull apart, apply, and remove.  I&#x27;ve found that they work EXTREMELY well if you only use each strip once. Which, considering the price, I have no problem doing.  They&#x27;re easy to cut if you need a slightly smaller strip, and the oil included gets rid of an leftover wax- no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing these for all future waxing!</li>
            <li> I use these on my legs and they work great!  I&#x27;ve gotten salon waxing previously but paying $60 for full leg waxing gets expensive quickly and these are a great alternative.  You have to get used to how to use them and, as with any wax, they don&#x27;t always get the finest hairs but I am a big fan!</li>
            <li> These strips worked poorly.  Strips are faced together with their plastic backs on the outside for your hands.  You rub the strips together to warm and soften, then peel them apart to expose the wax.  Then you quickly place the strips on the desired area and pull against the direction of hair growth.  They did not remove the hair as promised, and I&#x27;m not especially hairy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that these don&#x27;t separate evenly after warming so you get one strip that has enough wax and another that doesn&#x27;t.  They&#x27;re supposed to be good for multiple passes, but there isn&#x27;t enough wax to do two effective passes, let alone the five or six the directions say you should get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not having been professionally waxed before using them, I didn&#x27;t know how ineffective they actually were until I did go in for a professional bikini wax.  I would not recommend these as these are both more painful than a professional wax and significantly less effective.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t quite as efficient as I would have hoped however the after wax oil was fantastic</li>
            <li> I definitely prefer getting waxed by a professional, but since I didn&#x27;t want to spend over $100 I bought this because of the good ratings it already had. This was my first time waxing myself and it was harder than I thought. The plastic strips that the wax comes on can get slippery and it was difficult to know if the wax was at the right temperature. I guess it helps if you have experience.</li>
            <li> The great thing about this product is that it is not as messy and time consuming as real waxing. I think it is good for a quick job. But it does not remove hair as clean as real waxing</li>
            <li> These work so much better than the brand I previously used- thoroughly removes all hair so you don&#x27;t have to do the same spot more than once, which is painful and irritating. These also come with a small bottle of oil to remove any residue.&lt;br /&gt;No mess, no fuss, quick and easy hair removal for your bikini area.</li>
            <li> They work great.  Just as well as going to the salon.  No hassle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these wax strips for my upper lip for years and am very happy with them.  I noticed in other reviews that the people who complained about them were pretty much first time users.  It takes a little practice to find your technique, but once you do, these quick and easy strips work very well.  Warm with your hands, pull the strip apart and now you have two very sticky strips.  I use one for each side of my upper lip and they work great.  I have not used for bikini area since I would think these could be too small, but for the face, they work very well.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, no mess. I do my upper lip myself which has saved a lot of money over the years. These are the best wax strips I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and do not like products made with chemicals. The wax strips have only 3 ingredients: pine resin, castor oil, beeswax. I use it for my upper lip, and it works amazing! I am thrilled to find a great product made of natural ingredients that works so good. Zipping off the strip is a little uncomfortable, but not bad at all. Although the directions include a tip to not to repeat on the same area of skin within one treatment, I do repeat several times over some spots until all hair is removed, using a single wax strip. The kit comes with a nice soothing oil too, to remove wax residue after treatment. The oil ingredients are: isopropyl myristate (vegetable source), vitamin E, azulene, menthol</li>
            <li> I had never waxed before. But these leave your skin smooth and the irritation is so miniscule(meaning that wonderful red color you get from waxing anyway) wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different hair removal methods, and different products within the same method and this is my favorite. The wax strip is clear so you can see where you are placing it, what areas it will cover and such. Also, it comes with the lovely soothing oil which removes any excess wax. I would recomend this highly</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to use and no mess! and ripped my hair off soooo well! What other wax can do that?&lt;br /&gt;It comes with only 12 strips, but you can use one strip more than twice, so I only used four of them. and the oil that comes with strips clean the after mess. Overoll, i think this wax is gread for anyone who hates to make mess doing wax!!</li>
            <li> These strips remove hair without repeating, which is a good thing because they really stick and rip out all the hairs (ouch).  The azulene oil is a must to calm the skin.  However, I did clean my skin before applying the strips, which they tell you not to do in the instructions :(  All turned out nice and slick, anyway.</li>
            <li> Works the best of any in their waxing line.</li>
            <li> I got sick of paying $20 for waxes so I gave this product a try. It&#x27;s terrific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s completely easy to use: you warm the strip up in your hands for a minute, plaster it on whatever you&#x27;re waxing -- I use it on my face -- then rip away. Hurts more than a professional wax, but who cares for a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often have to do it several times for it to get everything, but again, I don&#x27;t care because it&#x27;s such an enormous savings and it&#x27;s so easy.  I have tried their hot wax product and it was a hot mess. Stick with the strips.</li>
            <li> These didnt work for me. I used them in a few different areas, warming them with my hands and even tried with the blow drier. Still almost no hair was removed.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of these strips. I tend to grow a little hair on my chin and cheeks and it tends to be curly and coarse. The strips are basically like...sticky glue on plastic film. The first strip I tried, I got a couple of hairs out (literally...a couple) and I tried to use the strip in other places on my face (it said they can be used more than once) but it wasn&#x27;t pulling hair and I was smearing wax all over my face. After a while I got frustrated and pulled out my new tweezers (which are awesome!!) and went through the tedious process of pulling the remaining hairs on my neck and face. The strips worked well on my little mustache so I&#x27;ll recommend it for that but I&#x27;m going to try and find another product for my chin and cheeks.</li>
            <li> Works with minimal pain or effort.</li>
            <li> Not so many strips for the money, but they work adequately.</li>
            <li> Only thing they do is leave sticky wax on your skin. I will not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> great product and fast shipping, thanks!</li>
            <li> Barely got any hair off. Not buying again.</li>
            <li> These are the best at-home strips I&#x27;ve been able to find, they work really well and at a good price.</li>
            <li> These work well but are somewhat wasteful - better to just get a pot of wax and cloth strips and DIY</li>
            <li> These work the best of all the wax strips I&#x27;ve tried. They pull the most hair out and I don&#x27;t feel as much pain.</li>
