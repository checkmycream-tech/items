            <li>I followed the instructions perfectly.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s the best thing on the market as fas as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>

            <li>Hope your results are as great as mine!</li>
            <li>These keratin products work best if you use shampoos/conditioners that DON&#x27;T have sulfates in them</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the results!  </li>
            <li>I was very happy with the results for $30!</li>
            <li>i also am very happy with how my hair falls with no straightening which i never would have done before.  </li>
            <li>I was impressed.  </li>
            <li>Best advice: don&#x27;t buy this product.    </li>
            <li>Liquid Keratin conditioning is an awesome product!</li>
            <li>and they always work excellently for me</li>
            <li>With this product I get the best  of both worlds.</li>
            <li>Do I think it&#x27;s the best thing since sliced bread?</li>
            <li>but if you want something cheaper but does a great job l&#x27;oreal has a very good shampoo and condition with out the salts in it, works great !</li>
            <li>I have used this system 3 times and it works brilliantly.</li>
            <li>My hair in now bright orange!</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner do not smell like the treatment and they work great for me as well.  </li>
            <li>During that time my hair looked great.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for what the price and what is claims to accomplish.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with this product and</li>
            <li>i decided to do my mothers hair as well, she also thinks this product is great.</li>
            <li>lol  </li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>I have stopped using the product as of one day and noticed a great reduction in breakage.    </li>
            <li>It worked great, but I was out $400...  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just not that great of a result for the price.</li>
            <li>I am really happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>This product works GREAT.  </li>
            <li>Works Great</li>
            <li>Regardless, the product works great for my wavy hair...</li>
            <li>My hair now looks amazing!</li>
            <li>but I do agree they aren&#x27;t pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I honestly use another brand of shampoo and conditioner used for the Brazilian treatment and it works great.  </li>
            <li>We tried it and it lasted for 6-8 weeks with good results.  </li>
            <li>After the treatment, I loved how my hair looked.  </li>
            <li>I want my hair to look good</li>
            <li>It has never looked this good.</li>
            <li>I loved it to death.  </li>
            <li>and my hair is still gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>loved it</li>
            <li>Unfortunatly, I didn&#x27;t keep my receipt, but this is good to know.</li>
            <li>But with this product the results of that routine are sleek and smooth and delightful.  </li>
            <li>It still had a fair amount of fullness in it.</li>
            <li>A good product</li>
            <li>Does not off gas but have good ventilation anyway.</li>
            <li>My hair look great and so healthy.</li>
            <li>and I was very satisfied with that product as well.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Works great on my hair and i love how my hair looks now.  </li>
            <li>and I love it!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I love this product and will be again in six weeks!  </li>
            <li>This is EXACTLY how it was done in the salon, and it has worked beautifully!  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the most pleasant odor</li>
            <li>i have found this poduct to be amazing,</li>
            <li>it is absolutley amazing.  </li>
            <li>This is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I am thrilled.</li>
            <li>Excellent product , to get the hair straight and no frizzy.</li>
            <li>My hair dries quickly and straightens beautifully.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got some really exciting news for keratin hair people!!!  </li>
            <li>I lighten my hair, but did not want it to be as light as it is now and kind of on the orange side!</li>
            <li>It has more fly aways and looks like a cheap wig.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to do and to keep in your hair for the required 48 hours.</li>
            <li>Much more cost effective than the salon treatment.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>If it sounds too good to be true, I guess it is.</li>
            <li>I put a very light styling product in to test.</li>
            <li>The product is very easy to use and it smells pretty good.  </li>
            <li>, I have two kids and have no time to style my hair elaborately, so I use Liquid Keratin, so when I do wash my hair</li>
            <li>I love this product and have been using it since Feb.</li>
            <li>you should be able to get 2-3 aplication out of that.</li>
            <li>When you blowdry or flatiron you hair it will become straight!(the more heat source used the better the results</li>
            <li>The one thing that I didn&#x27;t like was the fact that it changed my hair to a more reddish color.  </li>
            <li>My daughter liked the change  of color and it looked like a light henna.    </li>
            <li>To me it is worth the money to be able to have a good hair day every day.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, my hair looks great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now in love with this product.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve ever done a self tan, or colored your own hair, you&#x27;ll understand that this is just part of the quest to look fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last 3mos and I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I get tons of complements on how healthy my hair looks.</li>
            <li>Most of the time the humidity is well over 70%-80% if not in the 90&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It looks much better during the 48 hour waiting period.  </li>
            <li>I really love my results</li>
            <li>and I hope my comments help :)</li>
            <li>It feels so healthy.  </li>
            <li>I never kept it in more than 36 hours.</li>
            <li>I just bought more to do my daughters hair.</li>
            <li>, this is better then any of the others etc etc, so being her trusty \\&quot;try it on me before a client \\&quot; type we used this instead.  </li>
            <li>One thing I can say it is leaves more curl and body</li>
            <li>But if you love your bushy curls but just want a heck of a lot more manageability</li>
            <li>I love it and have recommended it to a lot of my curly friends.</li>
            <li>, this is better then any of the others etc etc, so being her trusty \\&quot;try it on me before a client \\&quot; type we used this instead.  </li>
            <li>One thing I can say it is leaves more curl and body</li>
            <li>I do ant to mention one more thing</li>
            <li>, the shampoo and conditioner are aweful , these come with the kit, the shampoo makes your hair tangled almost like you washed in bar soap and the conditioner isnt much better, my advice would be use the kit</li>
            <li>I would lend greater weight to these types of reviews when making your decision.</li>
            <li>Love it....</li>
            <li>Although advertisements and website for Liquid Keratin seems convincing, this product doesn&#x27;t do what it says it does.    </li>
            <li>I bought this product because I didn&#x27;t want to spend $300-$400 on the salon version that my friends have done (they all love it).  </li>
            <li>Also, the salon version seems to be much better.  </li>
            <li>I have had many keratin treatments done</li>
            <li>Love what it does for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Love the service received.</li>
            <li>Most of those are on the ends where my hair is colored.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It presses straighter and holds the press better.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was okay.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not awful.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE a Brazilian Blowout because it does make a substantial improvement in your hair texture, but it gets costly.  </li>
            <li>Having had 2 kids had also made the texture of my hair change (not for the better).</li>
            <li>so a product like keratin or the brazilian blowout, etc are appealing to me becasue</li>
            <li>I washed my hair (no conditioner) with my Coppola shampoo that I have  been using since April (and love).</li>
            <li>The directions look elaborate, but they&#x27;re not --</li>
            <li>Thanks DAVE at GBS in Boca Raton Florida!!!!</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews and was very excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>so I was very excited about the keratin hype.</li>
            <li>so I was very excited about the keratin hype.</li>
            <li>We have curl/kinky fine hair that was getting more and more damaged from relaxers.  </li>
            <li>My hair is so much more manageable and easy to style.  </li>
            <li>I think its best if this was for someone with extremely dry unruly curls.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed and excited that this might actually work.</li>
            <li>As for using a sulfate free shampoo there are many options out there, just read the label.  </li>
            <li>and I want to make sure I have the benefit of the frizz free results.  </li>
            <li>The most important point from the book:  stop using shampoo.  </li>
            <li>This product is as good as the Brazilian treatment that cost so much in salons.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your hair very greasy, and not in a good way.</li>
            <li>I wonder if some of the people who aren&#x27;t having the best results may be using shampoo and other products that have the sulphate in them...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to comb and style.  </li>
            <li>I have to say that I was pretty happy during the first two days.</li>
            <li>It was incredibly easy to use.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s really strong, it doesn&#x27;t go  away.   </li>
            <li>I have color-treated, baby fine hair that gets easily damaged.</li>
            <li>have fine wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>While it did do what the product details said it would do (make the hair less frizzy), I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed with the results for the price.  </li>
            <li>I had this treatment done at the hair dressers and it was fine.  </li>
            <li>I would do it about 2 times per year and thats fine, but</li>
            <li>Untreated, my curly hair ranges from super frizzy waves at the top to kinky curls underneath.</li>
            <li>STOP TRYING TO USE THE WHOLE BOTTLE AND STOP USING MORE THAN YOU NEED!</li>
            <li>When the product is in your hair for those few days it looks great but after washing it out the benefits aren&#x27;t that spectacular.  </li>
            <li>If your light haired I&#x27;d follow the recommendation and do a strand test for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use this if you have light hair.  </li>
            <li>For example, I had been using Pantene Smooth products, and used the Pantene detangler as an all-over light leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Once I did the second wash, condition, leave-in condition and serum, I am happy to say that my hair was softer, shinier and not as tangled.  </li>
            <li>Followed directions and my hair was nice and straight.</li>
            <li>I just did the treatment and so far it&#x27;s not too good.</li>
            <li>For the money and the time involved, you&#x27;d be better off buying a really good deep conditioner or consider a Brazilian Keratin treatment for a licensed hair stylist.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now on my 2nd Treatment bottle and my results are fabulous!!!</li>
            <li>what happened is that it darkened my hair by several shades from a  very nice blond to a kinda reddish gold...</li>
            <li>my hair dried real quick and straightened easily!!!</li>
            <li>for the first time, i have found something that gives me softer, more shiney curls.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Important: The treatment does make my color treated Level 6 light brown hair a bit brassy &amp; auburn, so I started using cool tone level 6 to counteract that.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m familiar), but I&#x27;m telling you</li>
            <li>There should be a warning at the top of instructions, not buried, to do strand test first.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to see an alternative to the high-priced salon treatments out there, too.</li>
            <li>I did notice a significant difference with this product.</li>
            <li>Well, having been a product junky most of my life, I was very excited to try this new LK system.</li>
            <li>this is only a safe alternative to chemical straightening therefore healthier BUT not as effective as a chemical treatment.</li>
            <li>The first step of the process using this product made my hair look gorgeous, shiny and very soft.</li>
            <li>This product made my hair smooth and shiny without the damage and dryness that I experienced with other treatments.  </li>
            <li>Boy was she right!  </li>
            <li>I happily purchased the kit and followed the instructions carefully.  </li>
            <li>When I first used this product my hair felt smooth and frizz free.</li>
            <li>Save the money and buy a good deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>had full results for about 2 and 1/2 months.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product because for the price and the time that I can do this myself at home, its a very practical solution for me</li>
            <li>The odor is not nearly as bad as I had read about.  </li>
            <li>It left my hair very smooth, shiny, and healthy looking and feeling.  </li>
            <li>, the price is great though, and you will get 20-25 days of \\&quot;better\\&quot; hair condition, I am going to try the coppola express kit next time and it very well could be the 30 day kits of both products just dont work as good as the longer lasting treatments.</li>
            <li>, the price is great though, and you will get 20-25 days of \\&quot;better\\&quot; hair condition, I am going to try the coppola express kit next time and it very well could be the 30 day kits of both products just dont work as good as the longer lasting treatments.</li>
            <li>During the flat iron process my hair looked absolutely gorgeous.</li>
            <li>I had looked into all the latest keratin treatments and was dismayed by the high cost, the process and the chemicals involved.&lt;br /&gt;While</li>
            <li>Aside from the fact that I had straightened it (which you have to do to seal in the keratin--supposedly), it looked shiny and was pretty smooth.</li>
            <li>The 5-6 weeks after my hair was in great condition and took half the process time.</li>
            <li>so, the first Treatment bottle I bought was good for 4 treatments (don&#x27;t use the entire bottle) with improved results each time.</li>
            <li>It was so easy to keep my hair straight.</li>
            <li>I thought it was worth a chance based on reviews from amazon.  </li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews about things but Liquid Keratin worked so well for me I felt compelled to share my results.  </li>
            <li>Its shiny, full of body and straight!</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a miracle product most of my adult years.    </li>
            <li>Still worth the price</li>
            <li>definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>I have golden brown color treated hair that the product manage to put in a orange tint to it (not that noticable).  </li>
            <li>There is no way this stuff is worth $70.</li>
            <li>Kind of like gross plastic.</li>
            <li>I have achieved these results using other products but what impressed me about Liquid Keratin is that my hair stayed that way all day even though it was humid outside.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and they are right.</li>
            <li>This product does work if you do it right.  </li>
            <li>no frizz after just free drying(no brush) straightened super fast and soft!!!</li>
            <li>True, they don&#x27;t give a large supply of shampoo and conditioners, and maybe that will change soon.  </li>
            <li>This product repaired major damage, gave me tons of shine and loosened my kinks &amp; curls to sexy waves.</li>
            <li>I have fine curly, frizzy hair and live in Florida.</li>
            <li>small price to pay for great hair.     </li>
            <li>I will likely need to reapply more often than recommended, but the results are well worth it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually kind of dry</li>
            <li>No frizz even when I went to Florida and hair was bouncy, soft and easy to keep straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very excited about the prospect of my hair taking less time to dry and not having fly aways.    </li>
            <li>Thicker and no frizz, very straight.  </li>
            <li>but yikes this stuff was very very kinky</li>
            <li>You should be able to use it next month.</li>
            <li>I apply this first, then spray with the leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>THATS WHY ITS LEAVING YOUR HAIR VERY GREASEY!</li>
            <li>I dont like the smell after you wash the first time AT ALL</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions exactly.  </li>
            <li>but they are soft and freeze free.</li>
            <li>Well, I paid the $80 for it (bought it at an Ulta store) and followed the directions exactly.  </li>
            <li>I agree with the comments about the higher heat and to leave the treatment in your hair longer than the recommended 48 hrs.</li>
            <li>My hair is very damaged now!</li>
            <li>I bought this product as a last ditch effort to have more versatility with my hair before I resorted to locking it up.</li>
            <li>my first experience was great..if you are thinking about this at home product save yourself the walk of shame to your stylist and strand test first.</li>
            <li>This product WILL NOT make your hair bone straight!  </li>
            <li>It simply loosened the my curl pattern and I am still rocking my twist outs and wash and goes with more length.  </li>
            <li>I did accidentally use a bit too much on my first try, and I could practially mold my hair into shapes with how greasy it was.     </li>
            <li>I guess my first shampoo will be the test.  </li>
            <li>did use a really hot ceramic blow dryer</li>
            <li>so I could be absolutely sure it was hot enough.  </li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s OK because I sometimes wear my hair in double strand twists.  </li>
            <li>I used natural sulfate free products from the Kinky Curly line.  </li>
            <li>I followed the instruction to the letter and did exactly what my hair dresser had done.  </li>
            <li>It did however make it much more manageable and over time will possibly straighten it.</li>
            <li>and I followed the instructions exactly.</li>
            <li>This product makes achieving that look so much easier!  </li>
            <li>When I first got it done</li>
            <li>hair is as smooth and sleek and soft as it was when i got the $300 treatment.</li>
            <li>Anyhow, this kit saved me the $400, it made my damaged, chemically-treated hair soft and manageable, and my hair is easy to style, curly or straight.    </li>
            <li>I have to do a major haircut afterward which is fine</li>
            <li>, I wont go into the amazing difference the other treatment gave me, will focus on this product.</li>
            <li>, I wont go into the amazing difference the other treatment gave me, will focus on this product.</li>
            <li>And made sure I used a flat iron with a temp of 450 degree&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>To sum up, I think to get the most out of this keratin product (which I&#x27;ve been using for 4 mo now and get salon-quality results from it) you need to nix shampoo, use salon-quality conditioners (ones with silk or keratin proteins in them) and use a high-quality high-heat flat iron when using the product.  </li>
            <li>The texture of my hair, once it was dry with the product on, was not that great, but once I did the flat iron step...</li>
            <li>Straight, smooth &amp; soft.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and as well as maintain and if you use the shampoo and conditioner in this product line the results will last you along time, just need to apply it to your new growth every 6 to 8 weeks.</li>
            <li>i think this product would have higher marks if was not marketed to people who want straight hair.  </li>
            <li>With extreme humidity though my hair did not remain as straight as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>First, this product absolutely does work.  </li>
            <li>just turned 40, I have more greys than I chose to admit to, I color/highlight my hair and over the last 3 years my normally straght &amp; sporadic wave to my hair has become wiry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off either going to the salon or spending your money on quality hair products that don&#x27;t dry out your hair.</li>
            <li>So, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend doing the treatment before a big event, but otherwise I would strongly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I have long, thick, wavy, color treated hair and this product works wonderfully for me.</li>
            <li>and don&#x27;t be deceived by the relatively large packaging.</li>
            <li>This is a much cheaper, less effective alternative.</li>
            <li>, ceramic flat irons at 450 degrees give the best straight hair results although you dont have to use a flat iron that high)Once your hair gets wet after straightening it, it will curl, but the keratin will just shorten your styling time when you try to straighten your hair out again, and it will stay smoother and straighter in humidity.</li>
            <li>It lasted great for about 8 weeks and then slowly started to fade away and the texture of my hair mostly returned to its previous state.</li>
            <li>First few days were great probably because of the flat ironing.</li>
            <li>This product really works if you follow the directions and have a strong flat iron.   </li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t see how this product was going to make my afro silky and straight.  </li>
            <li>You need to keep the keratin treatment in for two whole days.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper...  </li>
            <li>so you dont have to spray it too much because you will distribute the wetness throughout by combing it.</li>
            <li>if it worked really well</li>
            <li>I bought the Liquid Keratin because I  it was so much cheaper than salon Keratin</li>
            <li>This works very well for me.  </li>
            <li>A beautician suggested I try this product to gently relax my hair.  </li>
            <li>I used this on my daughter, who has very frizzy hair, but we did not see any improvements.</li>
            <li>; however, I found this product to be a much cheaper &amp; healthier approach to taming curls.</li>
            <li>No frizz on humid rainy days and the style holds much longer than without the treatment.     </li>
            <li>Her very curly damaged hair is straight and managable.</li>
            <li>I was very dissapointed in the product.</li>
            <li>Of course oil will control frizz and make your hair sleek and straight because of the WEIGHT.</li>
            <li>My hair felt really silky after I applied the product and staightened my hair.</li>
            <li>Really?  </li>
            <li>It looked really oily.  </li>
            <li>My hair was straight, but looked clumpy and still reaked like corn chips.    </li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>I have some very kinky hair at the ends courtesy of a pregnancy, I have curly hair</li>
            <li>, the liquid keratin has it looking straight and flowing.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li>and I gave it the real test...</li>
            <li>I could actually gently run my fingers through from the scalp.</li>
            <li>I used this product about 4 months ago and have medium curly hair that is very prone to frizz.</li>
            <li>it did take a lot of my curl out though because I used way too much product.  </li>
            <li>When you first put it in your hair and blow it out, it is soft and straight but after the first wash it&#x27;s like nothing was done to your hair....</li>
            <li>I had been using chemical ethnic relaxers and it was really damaging my hair, so I tried a salon keratin treatment.  </li>
            <li>I have very frizzy wavy/curly hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very greasy and I blowed</li>
            <li>Well, the front of my hair is almost to my shoulder and is much prettier and healthier than it was before I did my salon treatment.</li>
            <li>I ordered everything through Amazon and got it all REALLY fast.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t expect my hair to be straight when I wash it</li>
            <li>I was able, even with my pressed hair to do a \\&quot;wet set\\&quot; with liquid setting lotion.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line if you have the money and want bone straight hair like a relaxer without the damage get the Brazilian Blow</li>
            <li>you want your hair softer, easier to manage and easier to maintain straight styles,  try this.  </li>
            <li>This week, I&#x27;m doing the whole nine yards.</li>
            <li>my hair styled as curly is absolutely horrific!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions to absolute perfection.</li>
            <li>I run out of that first as my hair is long and the treatment/smoothing system do not seem to work as nicely with regular shampoos.  </li>
            <li>And it is also a known fact that people are putting false reviews of this product to make it seem like it is a great product.</li>
            <li>My coarse, frizzy, unmanageable hair is now a halo of soft, gorgeous wavy ringlets that I can actually run my fingers through (I could NEVER do that with my frizzy curls...)</li>
            <li>So far, the results from this product are even better than the salon treatment (I had lots of flyaway hairs for several days).  </li>
            <li>After the initial use, my hair felt so healthy and soft.</li>
            <li>During the first 3 weeks I loved the results but then my hair which was once down my back started breaking off and there was nothing I could do to get this treatment out of my hair to keep it from breaking.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft, very straight and very bouncy.</li>
            <li>I can sleep on it 3 nights and it looks nearly as good as the day I styled it, just a little flatter (which is fine since my hair is thick and full).  </li>
            <li>Super soft and shiny, no frizz, even my colored random gray hairs that usually stick up from the top are smooth!!!!</li>
            <li>You must follow the instructions to the t....and make sure that you do not use any other products that could take out the keratin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important that you follow the instructions and use a flat iron that reaches the recommended temperature.  </li>
            <li>So, this might be worth a try if you are going on vacation to a warm, humid place or just for the summer if your hair tends to get worse during hot, humid months.  </li>
            <li>I had my hair professionally straightened 8 weeks ago, and although I loved it, it didn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t live in the states currently and do not have salons and products readily available.  </li>
            <li>I also got a better haircut with more layers so my thick, dry, naturally curly hair was more manageable overall.</li>
            <li>The curls lasted a full week even though I combed through them!&lt;br /&gt;The final verdict?  </li>
            <li>I normally straighten it or add curls to it to even everything out depending on how much time I have.</li>
            <li>I live in a very humid climate; it&#x27;s not considered humid if the humidity is below like 50%.</li>
            <li>I can do it quickly and get back to Elmo.    </li>
            <li>This product has brought it back to life - soft, silky smooth, manageable.  </li>
            <li>based on what my friends who have done the salon treatment they had the same results i have had only for a lot more money.</li>
            <li>You have to be realistic with your expectations though.....</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s because the high temperature seals in the keratin.    </li>
            <li>Would highly reccomend to all.  </li>
            <li>For curly-haired girls out there, I highly recommend the book \\&quot;Curly Girl\\&quot; by Lorainne Massey.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product highly and I would buy again.</li>
            <li>dried super quick....</li>
            <li>The most important step in this process is to flat iron the hair in small sections with a very hot (450 degree) flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I still highly recommend this product as it is natural and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>I have very wavy, coarse, frizzy hair and live in the humidity capital of the world (Houston, TX) &amp; after using Liquid Keratin, following the directions exactly, I was able to blow dry my hair somewhat straight.</li>
            <li>(it has to stay PERFECTLY straight for 48 hrs) and ended up with soft hair that is just as wavy as ever.  </li>
            <li>(During this time, your hair will feel kinda gross and crispy, but it&#x27;s worth it.)</li>
            <li>I converted to semi permanent color for damage control, and it has not negatively affected the product.</li>
            <li>so I personally find it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>so I personally find it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I personally think it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>My dried out hair looks and feels healthy, silky and shiny again.</li>
            <li>Overall, this product did not straighten my hair like Professional Keratin; instead, it relaxed the curl without damaging effects, held the style when straighten, no frizz on rainy days, feels smooth and soft, and has lots of shine.</li>
            <li>Normally it takes FOREVER to blow my hair out.  </li>
            <li>The salon version lasts over 4 months, so the price turns out to be pretty much the same if you have to keep buying this.  </li>
            <li>I still had to use my normal de-frizz products.    </li>
            <li>But this doesn&#x27;t even come close to being worth your money for several reasons...     </li>
            <li>but if you count the money you&#x27;d same in NOT buying this product or ones like it, It may well be worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you, curiosity most definitely killed the cat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll just have to live with the frizz.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida and</li>
            <li>/&gt;That is why I only give it 3 stars, although it relaxed my hair the way it is intended and the way I expected, it colored my hair unintentially causing me to pay more re-color.</li>
            <li>You need to use the flat iron at the right temperature.</li>
            <li>And, it&#x27;s very soft and shiny.     </li>
            <li>the rinse and condition my hair was VERY soft.  </li>
            <li>I think a class action suit should be filed against them!</li>
            <li>On top of everything, the shampoo and conditioner that come with the kit are so tiny that will probably last for only a week.  </li>
            <li>wow!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve only done the first part.  </li>
            <li>have only used it once, but there was enough of each bottle left to do the treatment one more time when the 30 days is over.</li>
            <li>The first week, I only used the shampoo/conditioner/leave-in &#x27;cause</li>
            <li>I cannot speak to this treatment as it was designed to be used which is to do exactly as instructed, but I only wash my hair 2 days per week so meeting the 48 hour leave in timeframe is not a problem for me.</li>
            <li>It is important to use the right kind of shampoo and conditioner to keep the results (I use Burts Bees, which is less expensive).  </li>
            <li>MAJOR STANK!!!  </li>
            <li>beware of biast reviews (hmmm, some reviews I&#x27;ve read here and other websites seem rather fishy to me - such as the companies marketing dept.)I had the hightest hopes for this product and am a 32 yr old woman always looking for something better.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine w/ a medium curl and a little bit of frizz along the hairline.</li>
            <li>Dry your hair a little to make sure you have full product saturation, use a 450 degree flat iron and don&#x27;t wash for 3 days.  </li>
            <li>Since then I don&#x27;t use the flat iron as hot and I don&#x27;t have a problem.  </li>
            <li>After using my Chi flat iron my hair was exactly what I wanted it to be.</li>
            <li>this prodct is for people who enjoy their natural hair and just want it to be tamed and want it to take less effort to style/ heat straighten.</li>
            <li>The treatment turned my naturally very curly, dry and frizzy hair into straight, soft and manageable hair.  </li>
            <li>VERY LIGHT BLONDE HEAVY HIGHLIGHTED THAT I PAY A LOT OF MONEY FOR</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny, soft and doesn&#x27;t frizz when humid.    </li>
            <li>It will stay curly becase its your natural hair.</li>
            <li>I blamed this all on my 2yr old daughter of course.  </li>
            <li>Colored my roots before, then following the directions to the letter I had immediately straight hair, but it was greasy and it did have an odor.</li>
            <li>THEN I noticed a space in the front of my hairline near my part.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, but the highlights I got a few months ago made the lower layer pretty dry.</li>
            <li>I cannot use relaxers or any hair dye products because it breaks my hair after time, so I have gone completely natural.  </li>
            <li>I have lived with frizz my entire life whether it was curly or straight.  </li>
            <li>I have natural gray hair and this product turned it orange.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t read the directions completely and didn&#x27;t realize I could do the treatment once a month.</li>
            <li>tip for professional Keratin treatment at a salon</li>
            <li>Really, I can&#x27;t emphasize enough...</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions completely to the letter.</li>
            <li>I have been doing the coppola keratin complex treatments and absolutely love that product, my sis is a hair dresser</li>
            <li>it is so soft (did I mention SOFT) and pliable now...</li>
            <li>I have been doing the coppola keratin complex treatments and absolutely love that product, my sis is a hair dresser</li>
            <li>, I switched back to the coppola and am much happier</li>
            <li>Either have your hair straightened or relaxed professionally or go curly/wavy.</li>
            <li>THe key to this product is understanding you won&#x27;t have pin straight hair with no work</li>
            <li>Straight back to the store for this stuff!</li>
            <li>I had been completely natural for almost two years.  </li>
            <li>However, it absolutely wore off after about 5 or 6 weeks (the package says it only lasts a month).  </li>
            <li>The product did not reduce the frizz on my natural curly hair.  </li>
            <li>So there was some of my natural curl for this product to show my what it could do.      </li>
            <li>I split into sections and completely re-wet my hair with the product.  </li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and not a bit frizzy.  </li>
            <li>but I was busy.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair as mentioned</li>
            <li>and unfortunately my busy work/family schedule does not allow me to do this as instructed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in complete frustration every morning trying to do SOMETHING with my hair.</li>
            <li>then the keratin complex which is nice if you want big hair</li>
            <li>then the keratin complex which is nice if you want big hair</li>
            <li>I am African American with 3 distinct hair textures.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely thick hair that is curly on the bottom and wavy on the top layers.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this if you want to cut your styling time but please be awaare that you still have to straighten or blow dry it straight.</li>
            <li>The only thing the product will do is make your curls look more tamed and for some it will tame their curls to look like a soft wave instead.</li>
            <li>can switch between my natural and straight styles with the flip of a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But if you want to blow your curly hair straight and flat iron it, you can do so...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 6\\&quot; past my shoulders, baby fine, frizzy, dry and damaged from consistent coloring &amp; highlighting.</li>
            <li>I dont know how long the results will last, but I&#x27;m definitely willing to do it again and again!</li>
            <li>My hair looked very greasy after she finished flat ironing it.  </li>
            <li>But do not go into this thinking your hair will be straight without any blow drying or flat ironing.</li>
            <li>Maybe it would do better for white hair that is only wavy, but the picture of the Black girl on the box...</li>
            <li>But after the first shower it went back to looking and feeling the same way than before.   </li>
            <li>but it helps to show how much product your putting on and saturating all strands) Let it sit 30 minutes, blow dry straight then flat iron</li>
            <li>It will not magically straighten and remove all curl from your hair, but it does do a fantastic job of smoothing your hair and getting rid of frizz.  </li>
            <li>it was back to normal.</li>
            <li>My hair did not feel any different than it normally does.    </li>
            <li>I normally receive daily compliments on my hair but after I stated using this, nothing.</li>
            <li>The shampoo &amp; conditioner are a little expensive, but the shine you get is incredible</li>
            <li>The shampoo &amp; conditioner are a little expensive, but the shine you get is incredible</li>
            <li>It is not true that it makes your hair more manageable (at least I feel no difference at all, and my hair is pretty manageable already).  </li>
            <li>We live in FL (humidity central) and my hair stayed silky and not frizzy.    </li>
            <li>It did smooth my hair out after using a flat iron but after the 48 hour washing, it was back to the same old dry frizzy hair from hell.</li>
            <li>My hair is wavy, but after using the leave-in it looked very curly,havy, and dry.</li>
            <li>Since others said there was enough for several treatments and not to put too much on</li>
            <li>I tried the Japanese straightening system and while it worked the first time, the stylist who did it the second time was not trained properly</li>
            <li>I followed the steps exact and 48 hours later had essentially the same hair that I started with.</li>
            <li>As I was blow drying and flat ironing my hair, I was sweating and could not get it straight enough.  </li>
            <li>I was able to wear my hair down with little to no frizz.</li>
            <li>it will lessen your frizz and it will loosen up the curl of your hair but when you wet your hair dont think it will be straight.</li>
            <li>the complete kit, there is enough for me to do 3 treatments.</li>
            <li>When I untwisted it on the 3rd week, it was still soft, shiny and frizz-free.    </li>
            <li>you are expecting your hair to be bone, relaxer straight while wet FORGET IT.</li>
            <li>Brazilian Blowouts have helped but also left the bottom of my hair completely ragged.</li>
            <li>I can barely curl it (with and without product).</li>
            <li>I have used this on many occasions, the only complaint I have is that they never put enough shampoo/conditioner in the bottles...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the stink for a few days to have my hair in the softest condition it has ever been in since grade school.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had wavy hair that was difficult to straighten and if I did get it nice, it would never stay that way.  </li>
            <li>first off for the people who complain about it being to greasy during the 48 hour period need to use less of the prodct.</li>
            <li>But instead of doing a \\&quot;full flat iron\\&quot;, I do a few pieces here and there.  </li>
            <li>My stylist recommended 5 days before washing out Professional Kertin, so I followed that advice for the Liquid Keratin and touched up any kinks with the flat iron.     </li>
            <li>my hair, after flat ironing, is soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I have extremely curly hair, and after using this for about a week I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference.</li>
            <li>The makers of this product claim that \\&quot;sodium chloride, which is in a lot of other hair care products, will diminish the effects of Liquid Keratin treatment very quickly.\\</li>
            <li>Fortunately Ulta took it back, grudgingly, and said many other people have be returning it.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions from the kit and my hair is NOT straight or smooth, it left my hair dry, wavey and feels very dry.</li>
            <li>I live in the Northeast and in the summer the humidity can get pretty thick.  </li>
            <li>And I find that I get the same results in regard to shininess and softness with other, much cheaper products.  </li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d try this; I mean I spent $300 to get my hair straight, so what&#x27;s $69, right.</li>
            <li>The coolest thing about this product is now I can wear my hair straight or curly, but the curls are smoother, looser, silkier, and WAY less frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I am a \\&quot;mixed chick\\&quot; with curly hair that is only barely kinky...more frizzy than kinky.  </li>
            <li>I just did it a little differently, which is exactly how my stylist did it back in May for $360.  </li>
            <li>I think someone who has a lesser degree of frizziness and a less course hair texture would really like the product.</li>
            <li>I think someone who has a lesser degree of frizziness and a less course hair texture would really like the product.</li>
            <li>My thick, dry, frizzy hair is still the same, no decrease in the effort required to smooth it, nothing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once so can&#x27;t comment on the \\&quot;over time\\&quot; claims, but with one single, simple use I have soft, straighter, silky hair.  </li>
            <li>If your looking for straight hair for more than 30 days, even when you hair is wet, and when you let you hair air dry then this is the WRONG PRODUCT FOR YOU.</li>
            <li>I recommend doing the treatment over a long weekend where you don&#x27;t have any major plans.  </li>
            <li>It did make my hair very soft, but I wondered if that was due to the ph balance which may be why my hair is breaking off.    </li>

            <li> Regardless, the product works great for my wavy hair...</li>
            <li> My hair now looks amazing!</li>
            <li> but I do agree they aren&#x27;t pleasant.  </li>
            <li> I honestly use another brand of shampoo and conditioner used for the Brazilian treatment and it works great.  </li>
            <li> We tried it and it lasted for 6-8 weeks with good results.  </li>
            <li> After the treatment, I loved how my hair looked.  </li>
            <li> I want my hair to look good</li>
            <li> It has never looked this good.</li>
            <li> I loved it to death.  </li>
            <li> and my hair is still gorgeous.  </li>
            <li> loved it</li>
            <li> Unfortunatly, I didn&#x27;t keep my receipt, but this is good to know.</li>
            <li> But with this product the results of that routine are sleek and smooth and delightful.  </li>
            <li> It still had a fair amount of fullness in it.</li>
            <li> A good product</li>
            <li> Does not off gas but have good ventilation anyway.</li>
            <li> My hair look great and so healthy.</li>
            <li> and I was very satisfied with that product as well.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Works great on my hair and i love how my hair looks now.  </li>
            <li> and I love it!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I love this product and will be again in six weeks!  </li>
            <li> This is EXACTLY how it was done in the salon, and it has worked beautifully!  </li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the most pleasant odor</li>
            <li> i have found this poduct to be amazing,</li>
            <li> it is absolutley amazing.  </li>
            <li> This is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I am thrilled.</li>
            <li> Excellent product , to get the hair straight and no frizzy.</li>
            <li> My hair dries quickly and straightens beautifully.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got some really exciting news for keratin hair people!!!  </li>
            <li> I lighten my hair, but did not want it to be as light as it is now and kind of on the orange side!</li>
            <li> It has more fly aways and looks like a cheap wig.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to do and to keep in your hair for the required 48 hours.</li>
            <li> Much more cost effective than the salon treatment.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> If it sounds too good to be true, I guess it is.</li>
            <li> I put a very light styling product in to test.</li>
            <li> The product is very easy to use and it smells pretty good.  </li>
            <li> , I have two kids and have no time to style my hair elaborately, so I use Liquid Keratin, so when I do wash my hair</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it since Feb.</li>
            <li> you should be able to get 2-3 aplication out of that.</li>
            <li> When you blowdry or flatiron you hair it will become straight!(the more heat source used the better the results</li>
            <li> The one thing that I didn&#x27;t like was the fact that it changed my hair to a more reddish color.  </li>
            <li> My daughter liked the change  of color and it looked like a light henna.    </li>
            <li> To me it is worth the money to be able to have a good hair day every day.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, my hair looks great.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now in love with this product.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever done a self tan, or colored your own hair, you&#x27;ll understand that this is just part of the quest to look fabulous.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last 3mos and I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I get tons of complements on how healthy my hair looks.</li>
            <li> Most of the time the humidity is well over 70%-80% if not in the 90&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It looks much better during the 48 hour waiting period.  </li>
            <li> I really love my results</li>
            <li> and I hope my comments help :)</li>
            <li> It feels so healthy.  </li>
            <li> I never kept it in more than 36 hours.</li>
            <li> I just bought more to do my daughters hair.</li>
            <li> , this is better then any of the others etc etc, so being her trusty \\&quot;try it on me before a client \\&quot; type we used this instead.  </li>
            <li> One thing I can say it is leaves more curl and body</li>
            <li> But if you love your bushy curls but just want a heck of a lot more manageability</li>
            <li> I love it and have recommended it to a lot of my curly friends.</li>
            <li> , this is better then any of the others etc etc, so being her trusty \\&quot;try it on me before a client \\&quot; type we used this instead.  </li>
            <li> One thing I can say it is leaves more curl and body</li>
            <li> I do ant to mention one more thing</li>
            <li> , the shampoo and conditioner are aweful , these come with the kit, the shampoo makes your hair tangled almost like you washed in bar soap and the conditioner isnt much better, my advice would be use the kit</li>
            <li> I would lend greater weight to these types of reviews when making your decision.</li>
            <li> Love it....</li>
            <li> Although advertisements and website for Liquid Keratin seems convincing, this product doesn&#x27;t do what it says it does.    </li>
            <li> I bought this product because I didn&#x27;t want to spend $300-$400 on the salon version that my friends have done (they all love it).  </li>
            <li> Also, the salon version seems to be much better.  </li>
            <li> I have had many keratin treatments done</li>
            <li> Love what it does for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Love the service received.</li>
            <li> Most of those are on the ends where my hair is colored.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It presses straighter and holds the press better.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was okay.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not awful.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE a Brazilian Blowout because it does make a substantial improvement in your hair texture, but it gets costly.  </li>
            <li> Having had 2 kids had also made the texture of my hair change (not for the better).</li>
            <li> so a product like keratin or the brazilian blowout, etc are appealing to me becasue</li>
            <li> I washed my hair (no conditioner) with my Coppola shampoo that I have  been using since April (and love).</li>
            <li> The directions look elaborate, but they&#x27;re not --</li>
            <li> Thanks DAVE at GBS in Boca Raton Florida!!!!</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and was very excited to try this product.</li>
            <li> so I was very excited about the keratin hype.</li>
            <li> so I was very excited about the keratin hype.</li>
            <li> We have curl/kinky fine hair that was getting more and more damaged from relaxers.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so much more manageable and easy to style.  </li>
            <li> I think its best if this was for someone with extremely dry unruly curls.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed and excited that this might actually work.</li>
            <li> As for using a sulfate free shampoo there are many options out there, just read the label.  </li>
            <li> and I want to make sure I have the benefit of the frizz free results.  </li>
            <li> The most important point from the book:  stop using shampoo.  </li>
            <li> This product is as good as the Brazilian treatment that cost so much in salons.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your hair very greasy, and not in a good way.</li>
            <li> I wonder if some of the people who aren&#x27;t having the best results may be using shampoo and other products that have the sulphate in them...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to comb and style.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that I was pretty happy during the first two days.</li>
            <li> It was incredibly easy to use.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s really strong, it doesn&#x27;t go  away.   </li>
            <li> I have color-treated, baby fine hair that gets easily damaged.</li>
            <li> have fine wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> While it did do what the product details said it would do (make the hair less frizzy), I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed with the results for the price.  </li>
            <li> I had this treatment done at the hair dressers and it was fine.  </li>
            <li> I would do it about 2 times per year and thats fine, but</li>
            <li> Untreated, my curly hair ranges from super frizzy waves at the top to kinky curls underneath.</li>
            <li> STOP TRYING TO USE THE WHOLE BOTTLE AND STOP USING MORE THAN YOU NEED!</li>
            <li> When the product is in your hair for those few days it looks great but after washing it out the benefits aren&#x27;t that spectacular.  </li>
            <li> If your light haired I&#x27;d follow the recommendation and do a strand test for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use this if you have light hair.  </li>
            <li> For example, I had been using Pantene Smooth products, and used the Pantene detangler as an all-over light leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Once I did the second wash, condition, leave-in condition and serum, I am happy to say that my hair was softer, shinier and not as tangled.  </li>
            <li> Followed directions and my hair was nice and straight.</li>
            <li> I just did the treatment and so far it&#x27;s not too good.</li>
            <li> For the money and the time involved, you&#x27;d be better off buying a really good deep conditioner or consider a Brazilian Keratin treatment for a licensed hair stylist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now on my 2nd Treatment bottle and my results are fabulous!!!</li>
            <li> what happened is that it darkened my hair by several shades from a  very nice blond to a kinda reddish gold...</li>
            <li> my hair dried real quick and straightened easily!!!</li>
            <li> for the first time, i have found something that gives me softer, more shiney curls.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Important: The treatment does make my color treated Level 6 light brown hair a bit brassy &amp; auburn, so I started using cool tone level 6 to counteract that.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m familiar), but I&#x27;m telling you</li>
            <li> There should be a warning at the top of instructions, not buried, to do strand test first.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to see an alternative to the high-priced salon treatments out there, too.</li>
            <li> I did notice a significant difference with this product.</li>
            <li> Well, having been a product junky most of my life, I was very excited to try this new LK system.</li>
            <li> this is only a safe alternative to chemical straightening therefore healthier BUT not as effective as a chemical treatment.</li>
            <li> The first step of the process using this product made my hair look gorgeous, shiny and very soft.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair smooth and shiny without the damage and dryness that I experienced with other treatments.  </li>
            <li> Boy was she right!  </li>
            <li> I happily purchased the kit and followed the instructions carefully.  </li>
            <li> When I first used this product my hair felt smooth and frizz free.</li>
            <li> Save the money and buy a good deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> had full results for about 2 and 1/2 months.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product because for the price and the time that I can do this myself at home, its a very practical solution for me</li>
            <li> The odor is not nearly as bad as I had read about.  </li>
            <li> It left my hair very smooth, shiny, and healthy looking and feeling.  </li>
            <li> , the price is great though, and you will get 20-25 days of \\&quot;better\\&quot; hair condition, I am going to try the coppola express kit next time and it very well could be the 30 day kits of both products just dont work as good as the longer lasting treatments.</li>

            <li> During the flat iron process my hair looked absolutely gorgeous.</li>
            <li> I had looked into all the latest keratin treatments and was dismayed by the high cost, the process and the chemicals involved.&lt;br /&gt;While</li>
            <li> Aside from the fact that I had straightened it (which you have to do to seal in the keratin--supposedly), it looked shiny and was pretty smooth.</li>
            <li> The 5-6 weeks after my hair was in great condition and took half the process time.</li>
            <li> so, the first Treatment bottle I bought was good for 4 treatments (don&#x27;t use the entire bottle) with improved results each time.</li>
            <li> It was so easy to keep my hair straight.</li>
            <li> I thought it was worth a chance based on reviews from amazon.  </li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews about things but Liquid Keratin worked so well for me I felt compelled to share my results.  </li>
            <li> Its shiny, full of body and straight!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a miracle product most of my adult years.    </li>
            <li> Still worth the price</li>
            <li> definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> I have golden brown color treated hair that the product manage to put in a orange tint to it (not that noticable).  </li>
            <li> There is no way this stuff is worth $70.</li>
            <li> Kind of like gross plastic.</li>
            <li> I have achieved these results using other products but what impressed me about Liquid Keratin is that my hair stayed that way all day even though it was humid outside.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and they are right.</li>
            <li> This product does work if you do it right.  </li>
            <li> no frizz after just free drying(no brush) straightened super fast and soft!!!</li>
            <li> True, they don&#x27;t give a large supply of shampoo and conditioners, and maybe that will change soon.  </li>
            <li> This product repaired major damage, gave me tons of shine and loosened my kinks &amp; curls to sexy waves.</li>
            <li> I have fine curly, frizzy hair and live in Florida.</li>
            <li> small price to pay for great hair.     </li>
            <li> I will likely need to reapply more often than recommended, but the results are well worth it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually kind of dry</li>
            <li> No frizz even when I went to Florida and hair was bouncy, soft and easy to keep straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very excited about the prospect of my hair taking less time to dry and not having fly aways.    </li>
            <li> Thicker and no frizz, very straight.  </li>
            <li> but yikes this stuff was very very kinky</li>
            <li> You should be able to use it next month.</li>
            <li> I apply this first, then spray with the leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> THATS WHY ITS LEAVING YOUR HAIR VERY GREASEY!</li>
            <li> I dont like the smell after you wash the first time AT ALL</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions exactly.  </li>
            <li> but they are soft and freeze free.</li>
            <li> Well, I paid the $80 for it (bought it at an Ulta store) and followed the directions exactly.  </li>
            <li> I agree with the comments about the higher heat and to leave the treatment in your hair longer than the recommended 48 hrs.</li>
            <li> My hair is very damaged now!</li>
            <li> I bought this product as a last ditch effort to have more versatility with my hair before I resorted to locking it up.</li>
            <li> my first experience was great..if you are thinking about this at home product save yourself the walk of shame to your stylist and strand test first.</li>
            <li> This product WILL NOT make your hair bone straight!  </li>
            <li> It simply loosened the my curl pattern and I am still rocking my twist outs and wash and goes with more length.  </li>
            <li> I did accidentally use a bit too much on my first try, and I could practially mold my hair into shapes with how greasy it was.     </li>
            <li> I guess my first shampoo will be the test.  </li>
            <li> did use a really hot ceramic blow dryer</li>
            <li> so I could be absolutely sure it was hot enough.  </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s OK because I sometimes wear my hair in double strand twists.  </li>
            <li> I used natural sulfate free products from the Kinky Curly line.  </li>
            <li> I followed the instruction to the letter and did exactly what my hair dresser had done.  </li>
            <li> It did however make it much more manageable and over time will possibly straighten it.</li>
            <li> and I followed the instructions exactly.</li>
            <li> This product makes achieving that look so much easier!  </li>
            <li> When I first got it done</li>
            <li> hair is as smooth and sleek and soft as it was when i got the $300 treatment.</li>
            <li> Anyhow, this kit saved me the $400, it made my damaged, chemically-treated hair soft and manageable, and my hair is easy to style, curly or straight.    </li>
            <li> I have to do a major haircut afterward which is fine</li>
            <li> , I wont go into the amazing difference the other treatment gave me, will focus on this product.</li>
            <li> , I wont go into the amazing difference the other treatment gave me, will focus on this product.</li>
            <li> And made sure I used a flat iron with a temp of 450 degree&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> To sum up, I think to get the most out of this keratin product (which I&#x27;ve been using for 4 mo now and get salon-quality results from it) you need to nix shampoo, use salon-quality conditioners (ones with silk or keratin proteins in them) and use a high-quality high-heat flat iron when using the product.  </li>
            <li> The texture of my hair, once it was dry with the product on, was not that great, but once I did the flat iron step...</li>
            <li> Straight, smooth &amp; soft.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and as well as maintain and if you use the shampoo and conditioner in this product line the results will last you along time, just need to apply it to your new growth every 6 to 8 weeks.</li>
            <li> i think this product would have higher marks if was not marketed to people who want straight hair.  </li>
            <li> With extreme humidity though my hair did not remain as straight as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> First, this product absolutely does work.  </li>
            <li> just turned 40, I have more greys than I chose to admit to, I color/highlight my hair and over the last 3 years my normally straght &amp; sporadic wave to my hair has become wiry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off either going to the salon or spending your money on quality hair products that don&#x27;t dry out your hair.</li>
            <li> So, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend doing the treatment before a big event, but otherwise I would strongly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy, color treated hair and this product works wonderfully for me.</li>
            <li> and don&#x27;t be deceived by the relatively large packaging.</li>
            <li> This is a much cheaper, less effective alternative.</li>
            <li> , ceramic flat irons at 450 degrees give the best straight hair results although you dont have to use a flat iron that high)Once your hair gets wet after straightening it, it will curl, but the keratin will just shorten your styling time when you try to straighten your hair out again, and it will stay smoother and straighter in humidity.</li>
            <li> It lasted great for about 8 weeks and then slowly started to fade away and the texture of my hair mostly returned to its previous state.</li>
            <li> First few days were great probably because of the flat ironing.</li>
            <li> This product really works if you follow the directions and have a strong flat iron.   </li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t see how this product was going to make my afro silky and straight.  </li>
            <li> You need to keep the keratin treatment in for two whole days.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper...  </li>
            <li> so you dont have to spray it too much because you will distribute the wetness throughout by combing it.</li>
            <li> if it worked really well</li>
            <li> I bought the Liquid Keratin because I  it was so much cheaper than salon Keratin</li>
            <li> This works very well for me.  </li>
            <li> A beautician suggested I try this product to gently relax my hair.  </li>
            <li> I used this on my daughter, who has very frizzy hair, but we did not see any improvements.</li>
            <li> ; however, I found this product to be a much cheaper &amp; healthier approach to taming curls.</li>
            <li> No frizz on humid rainy days and the style holds much longer than without the treatment.     </li>
            <li> Her very curly damaged hair is straight and managable.</li>
            <li> I was very dissapointed in the product.</li>
            <li> Of course oil will control frizz and make your hair sleek and straight because of the WEIGHT.</li>
            <li> My hair felt really silky after I applied the product and staightened my hair.</li>
            <li> Really?  </li>
            <li> It looked really oily.  </li>
            <li> My hair was straight, but looked clumpy and still reaked like corn chips.    </li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> I have some very kinky hair at the ends courtesy of a pregnancy, I have curly hair</li>
            <li> , the liquid keratin has it looking straight and flowing.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li> and I gave it the real test...</li>
            <li> I could actually gently run my fingers through from the scalp.</li>
            <li> I used this product about 4 months ago and have medium curly hair that is very prone to frizz.</li>
            <li> it did take a lot of my curl out though because I used way too much product.  </li>
            <li> When you first put it in your hair and blow it out, it is soft and straight but after the first wash it&#x27;s like nothing was done to your hair....</li>
            <li> I had been using chemical ethnic relaxers and it was really damaging my hair, so I tried a salon keratin treatment.  </li>
            <li> I have very frizzy wavy/curly hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very greasy and I blowed</li>
            <li> Well, the front of my hair is almost to my shoulder and is much prettier and healthier than it was before I did my salon treatment.</li>
            <li> I ordered everything through Amazon and got it all REALLY fast.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t expect my hair to be straight when I wash it</li>
            <li> I was able, even with my pressed hair to do a \\&quot;wet set\\&quot; with liquid setting lotion.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line if you have the money and want bone straight hair like a relaxer without the damage get the Brazilian Blow</li>
            <li> you want your hair softer, easier to manage and easier to maintain straight styles,  try this.  </li>
            <li> This week, I&#x27;m doing the whole nine yards.</li>
            <li> my hair styled as curly is absolutely horrific!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions to absolute perfection.</li>
            <li> I run out of that first as my hair is long and the treatment/smoothing system do not seem to work as nicely with regular shampoos.  </li>
            <li> And it is also a known fact that people are putting false reviews of this product to make it seem like it is a great product.</li>
            <li> My coarse, frizzy, unmanageable hair is now a halo of soft, gorgeous wavy ringlets that I can actually run my fingers through (I could NEVER do that with my frizzy curls...)</li>
            <li> So far, the results from this product are even better than the salon treatment (I had lots of flyaway hairs for several days).  </li>
            <li> After the initial use, my hair felt so healthy and soft.</li>
            <li> During the first 3 weeks I loved the results but then my hair which was once down my back started breaking off and there was nothing I could do to get this treatment out of my hair to keep it from breaking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft, very straight and very bouncy.</li>
            <li> I can sleep on it 3 nights and it looks nearly as good as the day I styled it, just a little flatter (which is fine since my hair is thick and full).  </li>
            <li> Super soft and shiny, no frizz, even my colored random gray hairs that usually stick up from the top are smooth!!!!</li>
            <li> You must follow the instructions to the t....and make sure that you do not use any other products that could take out the keratin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important that you follow the instructions and use a flat iron that reaches the recommended temperature.  </li>
            <li> So, this might be worth a try if you are going on vacation to a warm, humid place or just for the summer if your hair tends to get worse during hot, humid months.  </li>
            <li> I had my hair professionally straightened 8 weeks ago, and although I loved it, it didn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t live in the states currently and do not have salons and products readily available.  </li>
            <li> I also got a better haircut with more layers so my thick, dry, naturally curly hair was more manageable overall.</li>
            <li> The curls lasted a full week even though I combed through them!&lt;br /&gt;The final verdict?  </li>
            <li> I normally straighten it or add curls to it to even everything out depending on how much time I have.</li>
            <li> I live in a very humid climate; it&#x27;s not considered humid if the humidity is below like 50%.</li>
            <li> I can do it quickly and get back to Elmo.    </li>
            <li> This product has brought it back to life - soft, silky smooth, manageable.  </li>
            <li> based on what my friends who have done the salon treatment they had the same results i have had only for a lot more money.</li>
            <li> You have to be realistic with your expectations though.....</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s because the high temperature seals in the keratin.    </li>
            <li> Would highly reccomend to all.  </li>
            <li> For curly-haired girls out there, I highly recommend the book \\&quot;Curly Girl\\&quot; by Lorainne Massey.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product highly and I would buy again.</li>
            <li> dried super quick....</li>
            <li> The most important step in this process is to flat iron the hair in small sections with a very hot (450 degree) flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I still highly recommend this product as it is natural and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I have very wavy, coarse, frizzy hair and live in the humidity capital of the world (Houston, TX) &amp; after using Liquid Keratin, following the directions exactly, I was able to blow dry my hair somewhat straight.</li>
            <li> (it has to stay PERFECTLY straight for 48 hrs) and ended up with soft hair that is just as wavy as ever.  </li>
            <li> (During this time, your hair will feel kinda gross and crispy, but it&#x27;s worth it.)</li>
            <li> I converted to semi permanent color for damage control, and it has not negatively affected the product.</li>
            <li> so I personally find it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> so I personally find it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I personally think it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> My dried out hair looks and feels healthy, silky and shiny again.</li>
            <li> Overall, this product did not straighten my hair like Professional Keratin; instead, it relaxed the curl without damaging effects, held the style when straighten, no frizz on rainy days, feels smooth and soft, and has lots of shine.</li>
            <li> Normally it takes FOREVER to blow my hair out.  </li>
            <li> The salon version lasts over 4 months, so the price turns out to be pretty much the same if you have to keep buying this.  </li>
            <li> I still had to use my normal de-frizz products.    </li>
            <li> But this doesn&#x27;t even come close to being worth your money for several reasons...     </li>
            <li> but if you count the money you&#x27;d same in NOT buying this product or ones like it, It may well be worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, curiosity most definitely killed the cat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just have to live with the frizz.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and</li>
            <li> /&gt;That is why I only give it 3 stars, although it relaxed my hair the way it is intended and the way I expected, it colored my hair unintentially causing me to pay more re-color.</li>
            <li> You need to use the flat iron at the right temperature.</li>
            <li> And, it&#x27;s very soft and shiny.     </li>
            <li> the rinse and condition my hair was VERY soft.  </li>
            <li> I think a class action suit should be filed against them!</li>
            <li> On top of everything, the shampoo and conditioner that come with the kit are so tiny that will probably last for only a week.  </li>
            <li> wow!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only done the first part.  </li>
            <li> have only used it once, but there was enough of each bottle left to do the treatment one more time when the 30 days is over.</li>
            <li> The first week, I only used the shampoo/conditioner/leave-in &#x27;cause</li>
            <li> I cannot speak to this treatment as it was designed to be used which is to do exactly as instructed, but I only wash my hair 2 days per week so meeting the 48 hour leave in timeframe is not a problem for me.</li>
            <li> It is important to use the right kind of shampoo and conditioner to keep the results (I use Burts Bees, which is less expensive).  </li>
            <li> MAJOR STANK!!!  </li>
            <li> beware of biast reviews (hmmm, some reviews I&#x27;ve read here and other websites seem rather fishy to me - such as the companies marketing dept.)I had the hightest hopes for this product and am a 32 yr old woman always looking for something better.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine w/ a medium curl and a little bit of frizz along the hairline.</li>
            <li> Dry your hair a little to make sure you have full product saturation, use a 450 degree flat iron and don&#x27;t wash for 3 days.  </li>
            <li> Since then I don&#x27;t use the flat iron as hot and I don&#x27;t have a problem.  </li>
            <li> After using my Chi flat iron my hair was exactly what I wanted it to be.</li>
            <li> this prodct is for people who enjoy their natural hair and just want it to be tamed and want it to take less effort to style/ heat straighten.</li>
            <li> The treatment turned my naturally very curly, dry and frizzy hair into straight, soft and manageable hair.  </li>
            <li> VERY LIGHT BLONDE HEAVY HIGHLIGHTED THAT I PAY A LOT OF MONEY FOR</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny, soft and doesn&#x27;t frizz when humid.    </li>
            <li> It will stay curly becase its your natural hair.</li>
            <li> I blamed this all on my 2yr old daughter of course.  </li>
            <li> Colored my roots before, then following the directions to the letter I had immediately straight hair, but it was greasy and it did have an odor.</li>
            <li> THEN I noticed a space in the front of my hairline near my part.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, but the highlights I got a few months ago made the lower layer pretty dry.</li>
            <li> I cannot use relaxers or any hair dye products because it breaks my hair after time, so I have gone completely natural.  </li>
            <li> I have lived with frizz my entire life whether it was curly or straight.  </li>
            <li> I have natural gray hair and this product turned it orange.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read the directions completely and didn&#x27;t realize I could do the treatment once a month.</li>
            <li> tip for professional Keratin treatment at a salon</li>
            <li> Really, I can&#x27;t emphasize enough...</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions completely to the letter.</li>
            <li> I have been doing the coppola keratin complex treatments and absolutely love that product, my sis is a hair dresser</li>
            <li> it is so soft (did I mention SOFT) and pliable now...</li>
            <li> I have been doing the coppola keratin complex treatments and absolutely love that product, my sis is a hair dresser</li>
            <li> , I switched back to the coppola and am much happier</li>
            <li> Either have your hair straightened or relaxed professionally or go curly/wavy.</li>
            <li> THe key to this product is understanding you won&#x27;t have pin straight hair with no work</li>
            <li> Straight back to the store for this stuff!</li>
            <li> I had been completely natural for almost two years.  </li>
            <li> However, it absolutely wore off after about 5 or 6 weeks (the package says it only lasts a month).  </li>
            <li> The product did not reduce the frizz on my natural curly hair.  </li>
            <li> So there was some of my natural curl for this product to show my what it could do.      </li>
            <li> I split into sections and completely re-wet my hair with the product.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and not a bit frizzy.  </li>
            <li> but I was busy.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair as mentioned</li>
            <li> and unfortunately my busy work/family schedule does not allow me to do this as instructed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in complete frustration every morning trying to do SOMETHING with my hair.</li>
            <li> then the keratin complex which is nice if you want big hair</li>
            <li> then the keratin complex which is nice if you want big hair</li>
            <li> I am African American with 3 distinct hair textures.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely thick hair that is curly on the bottom and wavy on the top layers.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this if you want to cut your styling time but please be awaare that you still have to straighten or blow dry it straight.</li>
            <li> The only thing the product will do is make your curls look more tamed and for some it will tame their curls to look like a soft wave instead.</li>
            <li> can switch between my natural and straight styles with the flip of a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But if you want to blow your curly hair straight and flat iron it, you can do so...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 6\\&quot; past my shoulders, baby fine, frizzy, dry and damaged from consistent coloring &amp; highlighting.</li>
            <li> I dont know how long the results will last, but I&#x27;m definitely willing to do it again and again!</li>
            <li> My hair looked very greasy after she finished flat ironing it.  </li>
            <li> But do not go into this thinking your hair will be straight without any blow drying or flat ironing.</li>
            <li> Maybe it would do better for white hair that is only wavy, but the picture of the Black girl on the box...</li>
            <li> But after the first shower it went back to looking and feeling the same way than before.   </li>
            <li> but it helps to show how much product your putting on and saturating all strands) Let it sit 30 minutes, blow dry straight then flat iron</li>
            <li> It will not magically straighten and remove all curl from your hair, but it does do a fantastic job of smoothing your hair and getting rid of frizz.  </li>
            <li> it was back to normal.</li>
            <li> My hair did not feel any different than it normally does.    </li>
            <li> I normally receive daily compliments on my hair but after I stated using this, nothing.</li>
            <li> The shampoo &amp; conditioner are a little expensive, but the shine you get is incredible</li>
            <li> The shampoo &amp; conditioner are a little expensive, but the shine you get is incredible</li>
            <li> It is not true that it makes your hair more manageable (at least I feel no difference at all, and my hair is pretty manageable already).  </li>
            <li> We live in FL (humidity central) and my hair stayed silky and not frizzy.    </li>
            <li> It did smooth my hair out after using a flat iron but after the 48 hour washing, it was back to the same old dry frizzy hair from hell.</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy, but after using the leave-in it looked very curly,havy, and dry.</li>
            <li> Since others said there was enough for several treatments and not to put too much on</li>
            <li> I tried the Japanese straightening system and while it worked the first time, the stylist who did it the second time was not trained properly</li>
            <li> I followed the steps exact and 48 hours later had essentially the same hair that I started with.</li>
            <li> As I was blow drying and flat ironing my hair, I was sweating and could not get it straight enough.  </li>
            <li> I was able to wear my hair down with little to no frizz.</li>
            <li> it will lessen your frizz and it will loosen up the curl of your hair but when you wet your hair dont think it will be straight.</li>
            <li> the complete kit, there is enough for me to do 3 treatments.</li>
            <li> When I untwisted it on the 3rd week, it was still soft, shiny and frizz-free.    </li>
            <li> you are expecting your hair to be bone, relaxer straight while wet FORGET IT.</li>
            <li> Brazilian Blowouts have helped but also left the bottom of my hair completely ragged.</li>
            <li> I can barely curl it (with and without product).</li>
            <li> I have used this on many occasions, the only complaint I have is that they never put enough shampoo/conditioner in the bottles...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the stink for a few days to have my hair in the softest condition it has ever been in since grade school.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had wavy hair that was difficult to straighten and if I did get it nice, it would never stay that way.  </li>
            <li> first off for the people who complain about it being to greasy during the 48 hour period need to use less of the prodct.</li>
            <li> But instead of doing a \\&quot;full flat iron\\&quot;, I do a few pieces here and there.  </li>
            <li> My stylist recommended 5 days before washing out Professional Kertin, so I followed that advice for the Liquid Keratin and touched up any kinks with the flat iron.     </li>
            <li> my hair, after flat ironing, is soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair, and after using this for about a week I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference.</li>
            <li> The makers of this product claim that \\&quot;sodium chloride, which is in a lot of other hair care products, will diminish the effects of Liquid Keratin treatment very quickly.\\</li>
            <li> Fortunately Ulta took it back, grudgingly, and said many other people have be returning it.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions from the kit and my hair is NOT straight or smooth, it left my hair dry, wavey and feels very dry.</li>
            <li> I live in the Northeast and in the summer the humidity can get pretty thick.  </li>
            <li> And I find that I get the same results in regard to shininess and softness with other, much cheaper products.  </li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try this; I mean I spent $300 to get my hair straight, so what&#x27;s $69, right.</li>
            <li> The coolest thing about this product is now I can wear my hair straight or curly, but the curls are smoother, looser, silkier, and WAY less frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I am a \\&quot;mixed chick\\&quot; with curly hair that is only barely kinky...more frizzy than kinky.  </li>
            <li> I just did it a little differently, which is exactly how my stylist did it back in May for $360.  </li>
            <li> I think someone who has a lesser degree of frizziness and a less course hair texture would really like the product.</li>
            <li> I think someone who has a lesser degree of frizziness and a less course hair texture would really like the product.</li>
            <li> My thick, dry, frizzy hair is still the same, no decrease in the effort required to smooth it, nothing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so can&#x27;t comment on the \\&quot;over time\\&quot; claims, but with one single, simple use I have soft, straighter, silky hair.  </li>
            <li> If your looking for straight hair for more than 30 days, even when you hair is wet, and when you let you hair air dry then this is the WRONG PRODUCT FOR YOU.</li>
            <li> I recommend doing the treatment over a long weekend where you don&#x27;t have any major plans.  </li>
            <li> It did make my hair very soft, but I wondered if that was due to the ph balance which may be why my hair is breaking off.    </li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair that is smooth but not straight like I prefer.  </li>
            <li> in half the time it would normally take.</li>
            <li> The only difference I noticed while using this product is that my hair straightend with a flat iron slightly faster than normal.      </li>
            <li> I did have a problem with my second use and my hair turning color after using the flat iron, but the label does warn about that.  </li>
            <li> it did not last long enough.</li>
            <li> First I have frizzy frizzy thick curly hair, I can manage it with a flat iron but the moment I step outside</li>
            <li> First I have frizzy frizzy thick curly hair, I can manage it with a flat iron but the moment I step outside</li>
            <li> I am not going to say it does not work because I can tell a difference between before and after, still frizz but less of it, not enough less though for me to give a higher rating though.</li>
            <li> I am not going to say it does not work because I can tell a difference between before and after, still frizz but less of it, not enough less though for me to give a higher rating though.</li>
            <li> (blow dry it straight with round brush) and touch up a bit with a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I saw no change in my hair except for heat damage from the flat iron process with the treatment.  </li>
            <li> Now I can just flat iron.)</li>
            <li> I now have some pieces of my hair that are only two inches long and others 15 inches.    </li>
            <li> but if you are looking for long lasting salon quality, this product is not it.</li>
            <li> My hair is softer and shinier and overall healthier than it has been in a long time.</li>
            <li> and I bought the BaByliss flat iron because it has a temperature dial</li>
            <li> I forgot my flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have frizzy hair and flat iron my hair every day to obtain the look I desire.  </li>
            <li> but I did not use my flat iron at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Re-blew it dry again, and finally straightened it with the 450 deg flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Left it in for 30 minutes, did the blow dry and flat iron.</li>
            <li> Overall I dont think it is a bad product it just didnt meet up with the degree of happiness I had from the other product</li>
            <li> Overall I dont think it is a bad product it just didnt meet up with the degree of happiness I had from the other product</li>
            <li> I have had 2 professional keratin treatments previously...</li>
            <li> (it won&#x27;t untangle otherwise since you cant use conditioner prior to treatment), Blow dry (not in the instruction</li>
            <li> If you only dry it wih a hair dryer, it will not fuze the product to your hair.  </li>
            <li> so I was extra careful to adhere to the instructions 100% the second time I tried this product/process.</li>
            <li> (I used to towel dry, then a pressing comb on the roots and ends, and then flat iron.</li>
            <li> I still blow dry and sometimes flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve blown it dry and flat ironed it.  </li>
            <li> It does stink, but only when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a weave, and clearly not her hair.  </li>
            <li> the directions exactly, endured an entire weekend of greasy hair that you can&#x27;t put up or tuck behind your ears</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair that I dry straight.</li>
            <li> &quot; So you must keep using their godawful expensive (and stinky) aftercare products, or your money will be completely wasted and the keratin treatment will be reversed, pretty much.     </li>
            <li> Blew dry my hair straigth with a paddle brush.  </li>
            <li> I use it every time I wash and blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> Liquid Kertin helps my hair to dry faster.</li>
            <li> In the end, after the 48 hr neutralization, I decided not to blow dry my hair but to wear it curly.</li>
            <li> allowing my hair to air dry without combing it.</li>
            <li> I blew my hair completely dry.  </li>
            <li> I notice only a very slight overall \\&quot;relaxation\\&quot; effect.</li>
            <li> What a complete waste of time &amp; money!</li>
            <li> I have dark course hair (greek hair) and have looked into getting the brazilian hair treatment at a salon.</li>
            <li> So, later down the line perhaps.     </li>
            <li> I had red streaks running down my face.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to live without it, at least during the summer months.</li>
            <li> , only get it to be less frizzy.  </li>
            <li> With that being said, the treatment although faded still continued to make my hair less frizzy and easier to mange overall.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this because I have thick natural african-american hair that is about 12 inches long.  </li>
            <li> My hair is VERY thick and coarse and I live in Okinawa, where the humidity rivals any in the states.  </li>
            <li> The next day I went to work and my hair was a frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> The initial treatment does have an odd smell and my hair was a little greasy the second day.  </li>
            <li> The process is expensive but worth every single dollar.  </li>
            <li> I had a very strange reaction, which may be due to the chemicals in my hair, but they boast \\&quot;can be used on relaxed hair.      </li>
            <li> have VERY thick, frizzy hair and knew going in to this that it would not miraculously make my hair straight.</li>
            <li> but you only have to use a little product so they last a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Also as a stylist I smelled alot of products that are used on textured hair that smell aweful and this product is not even close to smelling bad, infact many of my students like the way it smells.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m surprised at the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> It requires minimal maintenance between washes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before treatment, I shampoo with Neutrogena clarifying shampoo, rinse using a wide tooth comb</li>
            <li> (only takes a few pumps in your hand then work thru hair before drying &amp; styling).</li>
            <li> I have thin curly/frizzy hair of which I wear both straight and wavy or curly.</li>
            <li> , I did not notice any smell what so ever during the process, but the leave in conditioner that comes in the kit made my hair smell like a wet dog</li>
            <li> I spent 48 hours with my hair smelling like corn chips before I \\&quot;neutralized\\</li>
            <li> , I did not notice any smell what so ever during the process, but the leave in conditioner that comes in the kit made my hair smell like a wet dog</li>
            <li> but now my hair is just greasy and wet looking.</li>
            <li> I look like a wet cat.</li>
            <li> Snake oil, save yiur money, total waste.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and it frizzes fast in the humidity.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, kinky-curly red hair.  </li>
            <li> dryed it for at least a half hour what I normally would.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other recent reviews, this product is a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Just like with any straigtening system including Brazilian, it is only meant to tame the hair and get out the frizz making it easier to style your hair.  </li>
            <li> I dried it and followed with a flat iron per the instructions.</li>
            <li> Whenever I felt like running a flat iron over it, it straightened in less than half the time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The directions also state that my hair will dry faster and without frizz, this is not true either.  </li>
            <li> For the past 8 years I have had my hair processed via thermal reconditioning (Japanese hair straightening), but this summer I decided to take a break from it.  </li>
            <li> I wash every other day</li>
            <li> The next day was no better; however, one of my co-workers told me that after I washed it, I would notice a difference.</li>
            <li> Also the shampoo &amp; conditioner that comes in this pack are so small, I&#x27;ve been to hotels where the bathroom amenities are bigger!</li>
            <li> First off I thought the product smelled weird.</li>
            <li> I was due for a refresher of keratin and met up with my sis, she had picked this product up at a seminar she had went to, glowing reviews by the instructor</li>
            <li> I was due for a refresher of keratin and met up with my sis, she had picked this product up at a seminar she had went to, glowing reviews by the instructor</li>
            <li> As stated earlier, I am not sure if it is just the chemicals mixing in some way that is creating this, but if so, they should not recommend it for this type of hair.</li>
            <li> My hair has gotten increasingly frizzy and unruly due to greying, coloring, hormones, blow-drying, etc.  </li>
            <li> My hair had grown from the big chop to past shoulder length.  </li>
            <li> I had chemically straightened my extremely curly hair about 6 months ago, but it had grown out about 4-6 inches.  </li>
            <li> On a side note, I have never noticed a smell and it doesn&#x27;t change my hair color as I&#x27;ve seen in other reviews.</li>
            <li> when you aproach the step where you have to saturate your hair with the treatment you should gentely squeeze your hair with a towel so that you dry it a little before adding the treatment this way you can see if you are over saturating your hair with the treatment or undersaturating it.</li>
            <li> After sweating from a workout, I blow dry my hair  a little</li>
            <li> However I think some of the positive reviews are fake put on by marketers.  </li>
            <li> After the first shampoo and letting it air dry, the results were disappointing.    </li>
            <li> Specially, because I am tired of paying for chemical straightners that leave my hair weak and still frizzy.</li>
            <li> Maybe i spent a little longer blow drying</li>
            <li> I think what helped is that I tweaked the given directions a bit to follow the stricter directions for the expensive salon treatment (namely, comb a lot of the product through my hair in small sections, use a salon-style flat iron that heats up to 450 deg, don&#x27;t wash for 72 hours, and keep the hair flat and dry during the entire 72 hours).  </li>
            <li> I used the formula for dark hair.     </li>
            <li> That is the probably the only thing I have a complaint about.</li>
            <li> Finally, please keep in mind something that is commonly overlooked here.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, frizzy, color treated (brown) hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair that takes some time to manage but its totally doable.</li>
            <li> My hair did not take less time to dry and looked like dried out frizzy mess when done.</li>
            <li> I have very thick coarse hair that takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li> keeping 4 stars until some time passes...to see how long it lasts!!!!!</li>
            <li> After using this product my hair was weighed down to my head.</li>
            <li> so if that&#x27;s the result you&#x27;re expecting, you&#x27;ll be let down.</li>
            <li> I think maybe people were expecting a miracle in a bottle and were therefore, let down.</li>
            <li> not pretty!  </li>
            <li> Thank you Beauty Center!!</li>
            <li> wait 20 minutes, then dry as usual.  </li>
            <li> I used way less oils and conditioners on my hair now, and it also cut down my straightening time by 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I had low expectations because I rock a serious afro</li>
            <li> because the cost was half that of the Brazilian and 2.</li>
            <li> Less breakage and softer.</li>
            <li> I got it before there were any reviews and was skeptical but had really high hopes for it.</li>
            <li> As my hair grows longer, the weight of it makes my curls less tight, but still not the curl pattern I like.  </li>
            <li> It is not true, like some reviews say, that it will make your hair orange.</li>
            <li> However, everything that the product claims to do is also not true:  </li>
            <li> It is not true that the hair dries faster.  </li>
            <li> It is not true that it becomes quicker to style it.  </li>
            <li> The curls were so tight that it looked</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;ve come to find out that not only did this product make my hair flat to my head, it makes it incredibly difficult to even add a few curls despite what the label says.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and wavy and dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m biracial and have extremely dry thick hair with a lot of breakage on the ends.</li>
            <li> No smell, just a little greasyness.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money!</li>
            <li> But, my hair is a lot softer, the curl is a little relaxed and easier to comb.  </li>
            <li> A few things...</li>
            <li> each section a few times.</li>
            <li> and I wasted a couple hundred dollars.  </li>
            <li> The smell did go away after dried</li>
            <li> This product is a sham.</li>
            <li> I use their shampoo and conditioner about once every few weeks.     </li>
            <li> The smell did go away after dried</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> my 3-year old asked me why my hair looked so weird.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, don&#x27;t waste your time &amp; money.</li>
            <li> I think this package was a bit of a waste of money.</li>
            <li> All this product did was make my hair heavy</li>
            <li> Over the next few weeks, it became worse and the hair was thinning all over the head.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just the usual routine for thick, unmanageble hair: wash, condition (leave in conditioner provided), spray on treatment, dry with a round brush, flat-iron.  </li>
            <li> It is THE only shampoo I&#x27;ve ever found in the regular store, expensive or not, that has NONE in its ingredients!      </li>
            <li> But as others have noted, it seemed to change the color of my hair very slightly (auburnish).</li>
            <li> I towel dried and then used the spray in this kit and combed about 1/3 of the product into my hair and blow dried as usual.</li>
            <li> This might be hard to maintain due to cost but if you are like me spending lots of cash on products and processes, look no more.</li>
            <li> The shampoo &amp; conditioner are small bottles</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I am not sure how I can go to work, because I am supposed to keep it in for 48 hours.</li>
            <li> It is a bit expensive for only 1 month of treatment, but you can get 2 treatmens out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> With Wen, I was still considering the lengthy, expensive Japanese hair-straightening process but now?  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this, but I&#x27;ve been horribly let down.</li>
            <li> It has always had breakage and been hard to get to grow past my chin.  </li>
            <li> I have difficult hair - it has grey, it has been colored, it&#x27;s hormone-stressed, life-stressed, and ex-husband-stressed.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use hair spray and wonder if that may also affect the results negatively.</li>
            <li> If I could give this product negative stars, I would.</li>
            <li> I re-read every step at least four times before proceeding.</li>
            <li> Its even difficult to wear it straight because it looks dirty and flattened to my head.</li>
            <li> it is as thick and curly as it comes.</li>
            <li> I have relatively thick curly/wavy/frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I mean that literally.</li>
            <li> The comment regarding the smell of the product during the 72 hours is correct - it is a weird smell, almost like burnt cereal, and your hair is slightly greasy.  </li>
            <li> This product needs some serious re-considering on Liquid Keratin&#x27;s part.</li>
            <li> I have a bad hair every day since I moved here ten years ago.  </li>
            <li> No one ever told me that it was a bad idea to use Keratin treatments on blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that I HATE.  </li>
            <li> Since I couldn&#x27;t put it back in a pony tail, I was really disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I read all the reviews, the poor reviews basically said it didn&#x27;t work but hadn&#x27;t run into any that had this result.</li>
            <li> I am NOT happy about that.  </li>
            <li> very weird)and started breaking terribly.  </li>
            <li> My hair was frizzy and seemed unhealthy.  </li>
            <li> Turns it orange and it is not attractive.</li>
            <li> I have wavy frizzy hair, never a good hair day!</li>
            <li> I hated the second step.  </li>
            <li> As far as smell, I didn&#x27;t notice anything too horrible</li>
            <li> I also had difficulty with my damage ends splitting and breaking off, making it impossible for my hair to grow past my shoulders,but not anymore.</li>
            <li> I saw very little result from using this produce and was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> But, I was SO wrong.  </li>
            <li> People are using it wrong.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any weird smell or hair color change.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> TURNED MY BLONDE HAIR ORANGE!!! I FOLLOWED DIRECTIONS TO A T. I HAVE VERY LIGHT BLONDE HEAVY HIGHLIGHTED THAT I PAY A LOT OF MONEY FOR AND NOW IT&#x27;S TERRIBLY ORANGE. I TRIED MALIBU TREATMENT WITH A HEATING CAP AND EVEN SOAKED my hair in salt water and applied a heating cap. I called my salon and they said if those 2 things didn&#x27;t work I would need bleach with is going to ruin hair. I read all the reviews, the poor reviews basically said it didn&#x27;t work but hadn&#x27;t run into any that had this result. Now this is going to cost me lots of money and lots of hair damage!!! Beware!!</li>
            <li> i think this product would have higher marks if was not marketed to people who want straight hair.  i have curly hair and i have come to the conclusion that nothing will ever undo what God almighty has willed to be!!  this treatment works because i do not try to straighten my hair, only get it to be less frizzy.  for the first time, i have found something that gives me softer, more shiney curls.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions and don&#x27;t use the entire bottle. You should be able to use it next month. It does stink, but only when it&#x27;s wet. Know that if you have curly hair, your hair will still be curly, this is not a relaxer people! But if you want to blow your curly hair straight and flat iron it, you can do so...in half the time it would normally take. That is why I use it, I have two kids and have no time to style my hair elaborately, so I use Liquid Keratin, so when I do wash my hair I can do it quickly and get back to Elmo.    I have had 2 professional keratin treatments previously...one last winter and one last summer. I tried Liquid Keratin for the fall to offset costs.</li>
            <li> My mother told me about this product and I was very skeptical.  But, I agreed to give it a try. I had low expectations because I rock a serious afro and I couldn&#x27;t see how this product was going to make my afro silky and straight.  But, I was SO wrong.  The treatment turned my naturally very curly, dry and frizzy hair into straight, soft and manageable hair.  It&#x27;s been like this since Thanksgiving and I love it!  My hair is not breaking off like it used to.  It&#x27;s easy to comb and style.  It requires minimal maintenance between washes. And, it&#x27;s very soft and shiny.     A few things...You have to follow the directions for this to work.  1) You need to keep the keratin treatment in for two whole days. (During this time, your hair will feel kinda gross and crispy, but it&#x27;s worth it.) 2) You need to use the flat iron at the right temperature. I think it&#x27;s because the high temperature seals in the keratin.    If it worked on my hair, it should work on anyone&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> This product is as good as the Brazilian treatment that cost so much in salons.  You must follow the instructions to the t....and make sure that you do not use any other products that could take out the keratin.  As it is suggested, you can apply the treatment everytime you wash your hair.  I apply this first, then spray with the leave in conditioner.  My hair is shiny, soft and doesn&#x27;t frizz when humid.    True, they don&#x27;t give a large supply of shampoo and conditioners, and maybe that will change soon.  I honestly use another brand of shampoo and conditioner used for the Brazilian treatment and it works great.  Much cheaper...  I love this product and have been using it since Feb.</li>
            <li> the product works as well as it is supose to! People are using it wrong. first off for the people who complain about it being to greasy during the 48 hour period need to use less of the prodct. its only a 4 oz bottle and with that four 0z you should be able to get 2-3 aplication out of that. STOP TRYING TO USE THE WHOLE BOTTLE AND STOP USING MORE THAN YOU NEED! THATS WHY ITS LEAVING YOUR HAIR VERY GREASEY! when you aproach the step where you have to saturate your hair with the treatment you should gentely squeeze your hair with a towel so that you dry it a little before adding the treatment this way you can see if you are over saturating your hair with the treatment or undersaturating it. Also you have to comb from roots to tip for even distrabution so you dont have to spray it too much because you will distribute the wetness throughout by combing it. The next biggest mistake people make when buying this product is to think this is end all be all. this is only a safe alternative to chemical straightening therefore healthier BUT not as effective as a chemical treatment. it will lessen your frizz and it will loosen up the curl of your hair but when you wet your hair dont think it will be straight. It will stay curly becase its your natural hair. The only thing the product will do is make your curls look more tamed and for some it will tame their curls to look like a soft wave instead. When you blowdry or flatiron you hair it will become straight!(the more heat source used the better the results, ceramic flat irons at 450 degrees give the best straight hair results although you dont have to use a flat iron that high)Once your hair gets wet after straightening it, it will curl, but the keratin will just shorten your styling time when you try to straighten your hair out again, and it will stay smoother and straighter in humidity. If your looking for straight hair for more than 30 days, even when you hair is wet, and when you let you hair air dry then this is the WRONG PRODUCT FOR YOU. this prodct is for people who enjoy their natural hair and just want it to be tamed and want it to take less effort to style/ heat straighten.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair that is smooth but not straight like I prefer.  For the past 8 years I have had my hair processed via thermal reconditioning (Japanese hair straightening), but this summer I decided to take a break from it.  I got highlights, which are not reccommended with thermal reconditioning, so I chose to let my hair grow out for awhile.    I decided to try Liquid Keratin and was extremely disappointed.  I saw no change in my hair except for heat damage from the flat iron process with the treatment.  Supposedly there is a heat protectant in the treatment, but I still saw damage.  My hair does not appear stronger, healthier, or shinier as the product says it will.</li>
            <li> I have used this system 3 times and it works brilliantly. Untreated, my curly hair ranges from super frizzy waves at the top to kinky curls underneath. It&#x27;s 6\\&quot; past my shoulders, baby fine, frizzy, dry and damaged from consistent coloring &amp; highlighting. This product repaired major damage, gave me tons of shine and loosened my kinks &amp; curls to sexy waves. It does not \\&quot;puff up\\&quot; in humidity, nor looks like a mass of frizz anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Important: The treatment does make my color treated Level 6 light brown hair a bit brassy &amp; auburn, so I started using cool tone level 6 to counteract that. If your light haired I&#x27;d follow the recommendation and do a strand test for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before treatment, I shampoo with Neutrogena clarifying shampoo, rinse using a wide tooth comb (it won&#x27;t untangle otherwise since you cant use conditioner prior to treatment), Blow dry (not in the instruction but it helps to show how much product your putting on and saturating all strands) Let it sit 30 minutes, blow dry straight then flat iron each section a few times. Keep on 48 hours (I find using plastic or cloth headbands to keep hair off my face doesn&#x27;t leave permanent marks or bends so dont be afraid).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the complete kit, there is enough for me to do 3 treatments. The shampoo &amp; conditioner are small bottles but you only have to use a little product so they last a few weeks. I wash every other day so they lasted awhile. The leave in conditioner provided in the kit lasts me about 2 months (only takes a few pumps in your hand then work thru hair before drying &amp; styling). I dont like the smell after you wash the first time AT ALL, it literally smells like cat shampoo (my cat likes bath&#x27;s so I&#x27;m familiar), but I&#x27;m telling you it&#x27;s worth the stink for a few days to have my hair in the softest condition it has ever been in since grade school. I&#x27;m 42. I converted to semi permanent color for damage control, and it has not negatively affected the product. I color the day of, or a day before treatment. The shampoo &amp; conditioner are a little expensive, but the shine you get is incredible so I personally find it&#x27;s worth it. Again, I&#x27;m not fond of the scent, but I&#x27;m sold on the end result.ent.

            <li> I had looked into all the latest keratin treatments and was dismayed by the high cost, the process and the chemicals involved.&lt;br /&gt;While researching I found LIQUID KERATIN and thought it can&#x27;t hurt to try it, 1. because the cost was half that of the Brazilian and 2. if it worked really well maybe I would splurge for the more expensive treatment for longer lasting affect.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s hair story will be different. Here&#x27;s mine.&lt;br /&gt;I just turned 40, I have more greys than I chose to admit to, I color/highlight my hair and over the last 3 years my normally straght &amp; sporadic wave to my hair has become wiry and frizzy.  Frizz is something I have never had to deal with. I blamed this all on my 2yr old daughter of course.  I purchased the Liquid Keratin and did it Thanksgiving day weekend.  Colored my roots before, then following the directions to the letter I had immediately straight hair, but it was greasy and it did have an odor. The 5-6 weeks after my hair was in great condition and took half the process time. BUT, it did change my color to a reddish auburn.  NOWHERE in my research did this pro/con come up.  I just did the treatment again, thinking maybe it was operator error, by putting color on before it. So this time no color was involved.  NOPE, my color changed again.&lt;br /&gt;That is why I only give it 3 stars, although it relaxed my hair the way it is intended and the way I expected, it colored my hair unintentially causing me to pay more re-color.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for myself and my daughter and I was impressed with the results. We have curl/kinky fine hair that was getting more and more damaged from relaxers.  I bought the Liquid Keratin because I  it was so much cheaper than salon Keratin and I just couldn&#x27;t go back to relaxers.   We tried it and it lasted for 6-8 weeks with good results.  We live in FL (humidity central) and my hair stayed silky and not frizzy.    The one thing that I didn&#x27;t like was the fact that it changed my hair to a more reddish color.  Because my hair is color treated I didn&#x27;t like the effect.  But, I tried the QOD gold which salons use.  With that product I didn&#x27;t get the reddish tinge to my hair.  My daughter liked the change  of color and it looked like a light henna.    Overall I recommend this product, because it keeps your hair silky and I can go swimming without the damage to my hair from the chlorine.</li>
            <li> I used this product according to instructions.  I did the test strip test on my hair before using.  Also I left it in for 30 minutes.  Blew dry my hair straigth with a paddle brush.  And made sure I used a flat iron with a temp of 450 degree&#x27;s.  I ENDED UP WITH ORANGE HAIR.  I thought it was worth a chance based on reviews from amazon.  However I think some of the positive reviews are fake put on by marketers.  Google liquid keratin and you will see this is a known problem of this product turning people&#x27;s hair orange.  And it is also a known fact that people are putting false reviews of this product to make it seem like it is a great product.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, frizzy, color treated (brown) hair.  This works very well for me.  I followed the instructions exactly.  It left my hair very smooth, shiny, and healthy looking and feeling.  The initial treatment does have an odd smell and my hair was a little greasy the second day.  So, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend doing the treatment before a big event, but otherwise I would strongly recommend it.  The shampoo and conditioner do not smell like the treatment and they work great for me as well.  I have tried everything, including the $400 thermal straigthening, and  Living Proof no frizz.  This product made my hair smooth and shiny without the damage and dryness that I experienced with other treatments.  It had no effect on my hair color.  To me it is worth the money to be able to have a good hair day every day.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other recent reviews, this product is a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine wavy hair.  After the treatment, I loved how my hair looked.  Thicker and no frizz, very straight.  I followed the instructions perfectly.  When 48 hours passed and I washed my hair with the LK shampoo, my hair looked just as curly as it ever did.</li>
            <li> This product actually broke my hair... 3 weeks after I applied. During the first 3 weeks I loved the results but then my hair which was once down my back started breaking off and there was nothing I could do to get this treatment out of my hair to keep it from breaking. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, my hair looks great.  What I like about this product is that I still have my curls but they are soft and freeze free.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and used it three times over 6 months. (once every 6 weeks) THEN I noticed a space in the front of my hairline near my part. Over the next few weeks, it became worse and the hair was thinning all over the head. I called the 800 number to report it and the girl was so nasty. I called again and asked that someone from the company call me back about the thinning of my hair and noone did. I have called 5 times since then and have found that the company is in Canada and they do not respond to emails, mail or phone calls! I think a class action suit should be filed against them! DO NOT USE THIS UNLESS YOU WANT TO LOSE YOUR HAIR!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now in love with this product.  I don&#x27;t live in the states currently and do not have salons and products readily available.  My hair is VERY thick and coarse and I live in Okinawa, where the humidity rivals any in the states.  I wouldn&#x27;t say that it gave me the perfect hair, but for an at home treatment, I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  The odor is not nearly as bad as I had read about.  If you&#x27;ve ever done a self tan, or colored your own hair, you&#x27;ll understand that this is just part of the quest to look fabulous.  I will likely need to reapply more often than recommended, but the results are well worth it and I didn&#x27;t expect miracles.  I say give it a shot...I&#x27;ve now ordered the rest of the products and look forward to a fall of manageable hair!</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and was very excited to try this product. Since others said there was enough for several treatments and not to put too much on I was conservative. First few days were great probably because of the flat ironing. As soon as I washed my hair it was back to normal. Thought maybe I didn&#x27;t use enough product so I was extra careful to adhere to the instructions 100% the second time I tried this product/process. Same result - no results after washing hair several days after treatment. I wish I could get my money back.</li>
            <li> After thinking about it for months, and reading each of the reviews for Liquid Keratin, I finally decided to buy the product and give it a try.  I have to say that I was pretty happy during the first two days. I put the product on my hair and left it on for 48 hours. During that time my hair looked great. Aside from the fact that I had straightened it (which you have to do to seal in the keratin--supposedly), it looked shiny and was pretty smooth. But after the first shower it went back to looking and feeling the same way than before.   My hair is fine, but the highlights I got a few months ago made the lower layer pretty dry. And after applying Liquid Keratin it feels THE SAME.   It is not true, like some reviews say, that it will make your hair orange. However, everything that the product claims to do is also not true:  It is not true that it makes your hair more manageable (at least I feel no difference at all, and my hair is pretty manageable already).  It is not true that the hair dries faster.  It is not true that it becomes quicker to style it.  On top of everything, the shampoo and conditioner that come with the kit are so tiny that will probably last for only a week.  I hope this helps. Don&#x27;t spend money on this.</li>
            <li> I am a \\&quot;mixed chick\\&quot; with curly hair that is only barely kinky...more frizzy than kinky.  I cannot use relaxers or any hair dye products because it breaks my hair after time, so I have gone completely natural.  As my hair grows longer, the weight of it makes my curls less tight, but still not the curl pattern I like.  A beautician suggested I try this product to gently relax my hair.  Well, I paid the $80 for it (bought it at an Ulta store) and followed the directions exactly.  Three words:  DID NOT WORK.  Maybe it would do better for white hair that is only wavy, but the picture of the Black girl on the box...that&#x27;s a weave, and clearly not her hair.  Save your money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last 3mos and I am very happy with the results. I use it every time I wash and blow dry my hair. I get tons of complements on how healthy my hair looks. I also work out everyday and with this product my hair remains straight and shiny.  After sweating from a workout, I blow dry my hair  a little and it looks as though I just walked out of  a salon. It&#x27;s the best thing on the market as fas as I&#x27;m concerned. It truly defies your DNA. I have very thick coarse hair that takes forever to dry. Liquid Kertin helps my hair to dry faster. My hair look great and so healthy. I used Coppola before and I was very satisfied with that product as well. My concern was the formydahyde  in the product. I want my hair to look good I just don&#x27;t want to die in the process.  I mean that literally. Liquid Keratin doesn&#x27;t have formydahyde or any harmful chemicals. I plan to use this forever!!</li>
            <li> I have to agree w/ some others who wrote reviews.  This is a great product for what the price and what is claims to accomplish.  It will not magically straighten and remove all curl from your hair, but it does do a fantastic job of smoothing your hair and getting rid of frizz.  I have extremely thick hair that is curly on the bottom and wavy on the top layers.  I have lived with frizz my entire life whether it was curly or straight.  I live in the Northeast and in the summer the humidity can get pretty thick.  My hair used to double in size when I left the house.  Since I have used this, i have not had to worry about pulling my hair back halfway through the day or smothering it in serums and oils to keep away the frizz.  I am happy with this product and like that I am not treating it with chemicals or removing the option to wear it curly.  Follow the instructions and I think you will be very happy with it!</li>
            <li> I have natural gray hair and this product turned it orange.  There should be a warning at the top of instructions, not buried, to do strand test first.  Don&#x27;t use this if you have light hair.  There is no fixing gray.</li>
            <li> I used this on my daughter, who has very frizzy hair, but we did not see any improvements. It was just a lot of work for nothing...</li>
            <li> I saw very little result from using this produce and was disappointed.  I was so excited to see an alternative to the high-priced salon treatments out there, too.</li>
            <li> I have fine curly, frizzy hair and live in Florida. I have a bad hair every day since I moved here ten years ago.  I tried the Japanese straightening system and while it worked the first time, the stylist who did it the second time was not trained properly and I wasted a couple hundred dollars.  I thought I&#x27;d try this; I mean I spent $300 to get my hair straight, so what&#x27;s $69, right. I followed the directions and did the treatment. The next day I went to work and my hair was a frizzy mess. Since I couldn&#x27;t put it back in a pony tail, I was really disappointed.  The next day was no better; however, one of my co-workers told me that after I washed it, I would notice a difference. Boy was she right!  I live in a very humid climate; it&#x27;s not considered humid if the humidity is below like 50%. Most of the time the humidity is well over 70%-80% if not in the 90&#x27;s. I was able to wear my hair down with little to no frizz. The treatment lasted a couple of months. I wash my hair about once a week. I did use the shampoo and conditioner.  I didn&#x27;t notice any weird smell or hair color change. I did have a relaxer on the ends of my hair. I personally think it is well worth the price. I didn&#x27;t read the directions completely and didn&#x27;t realize I could do the treatment once a month. I just redid the treatment after almost six months.  It looks much better during the 48 hour waiting period.  I will continue to use the product.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy, color treated hair and this product works wonderfully for me. My dried out hair looks and feels healthy, silky and shiny again. I paid $300+ tip for professional Keratin treatment at a salon; however, I found this product to be a much cheaper &amp; healthier approach to taming curls. I&#x27;ve read comments about the cereal smell, well it&#x27;s only temporary and will wash out when you shampoo....small price to pay for great hair.     The website states that this product has a cumulative effect- so, the first Treatment bottle I bought was good for 4 treatments (don&#x27;t use the entire bottle) with improved results each time. I&#x27;m now on my 2nd Treatment bottle and my results are fabulous!!! No frizz on humid rainy days and the style holds much longer than without the treatment.     I agree with the comments about the higher heat and to leave the treatment in your hair longer than the recommended 48 hrs. My stylist recommended 5 days before washing out Professional Kertin, so I followed that advice for the Liquid Keratin and touched up any kinks with the flat iron.     Overall, this product did not straighten my hair like Professional Keratin; instead, it relaxed the curl without damaging effects, held the style when straighten, no frizz on rainy days, feels smooth and soft, and has lots of shine. I really love my results and I hope my comments help :)</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews about things but Liquid Keratin worked so well for me I felt compelled to share my results.  It worked GREAT for me!  My hair is so much more manageable and easy to style.  I get lots of compliments and people ask what I did to my hair.  I&#x27;ve always had wavy hair that was difficult to straighten and if I did get it nice, it would never stay that way.  After using LK, I style once (blow dry it straight with round brush) and touch up a bit with a flat iron.  I can sleep on it 3 nights and it looks nearly as good as the day I styled it, just a little flatter (which is fine since my hair is thick and full).  It feels so healthy.  And yes, I got 3 uses out of the bottle as well.  I did have a problem with my second use and my hair turning color after using the flat iron, but the label does warn about that.  Since then I don&#x27;t use the flat iron as hot and I don&#x27;t have a problem.  It is important to use the right kind of shampoo and conditioner to keep the results (I use Burts Bees, which is less expensive).  I wonder if some of the people who aren&#x27;t having the best results may be using shampoo and other products that have the sulphate in them...almost everything I looked at had sulphate.  I don&#x27;t use hair spray and wonder if that may also affect the results negatively.</li>
            <li> i have found this poduct to be amazing, my hair, after flat ironing, is soft and silky. I LOVE IT! i decided to do my mothers hair as well, she also thinks this product is great. Her very curly damaged hair is straight and managable. we both think this product iSSSS GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> I have wavy frizzy hair, never a good hair day! I have had my hair straightened with the Japanese straightening system, which did keep it staight with no frizz, and another keratin straightener with formaldehyde. You had to leave it in for three days and my hair was greasy and smelly. I never kept it in more than 36 hours. I tried the liquid keratin this weekend. It was very easy to do and to keep in your hair for the required 48 hours. No smell, just a little greasyness. My hair now looks amazing! Its shiny, full of body and straight! It has never looked this good. I dont know how long the results will last, but I&#x27;m definitely willing to do it again and again! I just bought more to do my daughters hair.</li>
            <li> What a complete waste of time &amp; money! My hair is fine w/ a medium curl and a little bit of frizz along the hairline. I didn&#x27;t see any difference after using this product and I followed the instructions to the letter. Also the shampoo &amp; conditioner that comes in this pack are so small, I&#x27;ve been to hotels where the bathroom amenities are bigger! Really, I can&#x27;t emphasize enough...don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Well, having been a product junky most of my life, I was very excited to try this new LK system. I got it before there were any reviews and was skeptical but had really high hopes for it. I have thin curly/frizzy hair of which I wear both straight and wavy or curly. I have been looking for a miracle product most of my adult years.    I followed the instructions completely to the letter. During the flat iron process my hair looked absolutely gorgeous. I looked almost like I had Brazilian hair. I was very impressed and excited that this might actually work. The treatment itself smells like the DHA chemical reaction when you get a spray tan. I didn&#x27;t let that bother me though. In the end, after the 48 hr neutralization, I decided not to blow dry my hair but to wear it curly. I had hoped the frizz would dissapait and it be wavy - not curly. I put a very light styling product in to test. Guess what - FRIZZ central. It did not improve the frizz nor make blow drying any easier. I was very dissapointed in the product. Claiming you have to use their products to make it last is a croc to me too.     The only thing I can say is that I can try it again. It does say cumulative affect so perhaps that is the problem. But as others have noted, it seemed to change the color of my hair very slightly (auburnish). I just colored and wouldn&#x27;t want to risk it. So, later down the line perhaps.     I wouldn&#x27;t spend the money on this product. I wish I could send it back. BTW. beware of biast reviews (hmmm, some reviews I&#x27;ve read here and other websites seem rather fishy to me - such as the companies marketing dept.)I had the hightest hopes for this product and am a 32 yr old woman always looking for something better.</li>
            <li> The first step of the process using this product made my hair look gorgeous, shiny and very soft. I loved it to death.  Then, the second step when we can use the leave-in product made may hair look awful.  My hair is wavy, but after using the leave-in it looked very curly,havy, and dry. I hated the second step.  Now I will only buy shampoo, conditioner and serum of LK products.  I do not recommend the leave-in at all!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> First off I thought the product smelled weird. I have thick wavy hair that takes some time to manage but its totally doable. This product I believe is aimed at people with unruly hair. My hair looked like an oil tank spilled on it after using this product. I believe that the ONLY ingredient in he entire product is oil. Of course oil will control frizz and make your hair sleek and straight because of the WEIGHT. After using this product my hair was weighed down to my head. It was a nightmare trying to get it out. I think its best if this was for someone with extremely dry unruly curls.</li>
            <li> I have been doing the coppola keratin complex treatments and absolutely love that product, my sis is a hair dresser so she does the treatments for me, I wont go into the amazing difference the other treatment gave me, will focus on this product. First I have frizzy frizzy thick curly hair, I can manage it with a flat iron but the moment I step outside it looks like beyonce in goldmember  remember the afro lol  so I was very excited about the keratin hype. I was due for a refresher of keratin and met up with my sis, she had picked this product up at a seminar she had went to, glowing reviews by the instructor, this is better then any of the others etc etc, so being her trusty \\&quot;try it on me before a client \\&quot; type we used this instead.  I am not going to say it does not work because I can tell a difference between before and after, still frizz but less of it, not enough less though for me to give a higher rating though. One thing I can say it is leaves more curl and body then the keratin complex which is nice if you want big hair, I did not notice any smell what so ever during the process, but the leave in conditioner that comes in the kit made my hair smell like a wet dog, thats the closest I can get to the actual smell. The smell did go away after dried so it doesnt stick around. I think someone who has a lesser degree of frizziness and a less course hair texture would really like the product. Overall I dont think it is a bad product it just didnt meet up with the degree of happiness I had from the other product, the price is great though, and you will get 20-25 days of \\&quot;better\\&quot; hair condition, I am going to try the coppola express kit next time and it very well could be the 30 day kits of both products just dont work as good as the longer lasting treatments. I still give it 3 stars and think it is just a try it and if you like it then you like it on you type thing.</li>
            <li> After reading the mixed reviews I decided to take a chance and try this treatment. My hair felt really silky after I applied the product and staightened my hair. I washed my hair two day later...   and OMG! My hair is very damaged now! My hair looks and feels thinner, it turned a weird color, and the end are destroyed. If you care about your hair do not use this product. I called the company that makes this and they told me it must have been my Chi that caused the damage. Really?  melismini6@aol.com</li>
            <li> I actually had my beautician do this for me.  My hair looked very greasy after she finished flat ironing it.  So greasy that I didn&#x27;t wait the 48 hours to wash it that you&#x27;re supposed to wait.  It looked really oily.  Also, it totally changed the color of my hair.  I am NOT happy about that.  I lighten my hair, but did not want it to be as light as it is now and kind of on the orange side! I will not use this product again.  I&#x27;ll just have to live with the frizz.</li>
            <li> If I could give this product negative stars, I would. I have thick, wavy hair that I dry straight. I was very excited about the prospect of my hair taking less time to dry and not having fly aways.    I followed the instructions and washed my hair with the shampoo then doused it with the 30 day straightening solution. The product reaked, like corn chips. I dried it and followed with a flat iron per the instructions. My hair was straight, but looked clumpy and still reaked like corn chips.    I spent 48 hours with my hair smelling like corn chips before I \\&quot;neutralized\\&quot; the solution by washing my hair, conditioning it, and then spraying on the fill-in conditioner.     My hair did not take less time to dry and looked like dried out frizzy mess when done. It has more fly aways and looks like a cheap wig. I plan on deep conditioning my hair and getting my money back.     This product is a sham. If it sounds too good to be true, I guess it is. You&#x27;re better off either going to the salon or spending your money on quality hair products that don&#x27;t dry out your hair.</li>
            <li> I tried the Liquid Keratin treatment started kit. I followed the directions from the kit and my hair is NOT straight or smooth, it left my hair dry, wavey and feels very dry. The directions also state that my hair will dry faster and without frizz, this is not true either.  Please save your money and try the Aveeno brands.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. I have some very kinky hair at the ends courtesy of a pregnancy, I have curly hair but yikes this stuff was very very kinky, the liquid keratin has it looking straight and flowing. Bonus plus is that it does not stink at all. I have had chem relaxers before, at salons and at home and both just stink horribly, this stuff has no noxious smell at all. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the real deal. I am African American with a combination 4b/4c...it is as thick and curly as it comes. I bought this product as a last ditch effort to have more versatility with my hair before I resorted to locking it up. If you are like me your biggest issue is shrinkage...mine would shrink so compactly that I could not even put my fingers through it. This product has definitely changed the texture of my hair...it is so soft (did I mention SOFT) and pliable now...and I gave it the real test...allowing my hair to air dry without combing it. I could actually gently run my fingers through from the scalp. I used way less oils and conditioners on my hair now, and it also cut down my straightening time by 30 minutes. (I used to towel dry, then a pressing comb on the roots and ends, and then flat iron. Now I can just flat iron.) If you are looking for a miracle keep-me-straight -forever type product this is not it. But if you love your bushy curls but just want a heck of a lot more manageability this is what you are looking for. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the price and the amount of synthetic chemicals.</li>
            <li> I am shocked by seeing all the negative reviews!  I used this product about 4 months ago and have medium curly hair that is very prone to frizz. I love it and have recommended it to a lot of my curly friends. My hair dries quickly and straightens beautifully. it did take a lot of my curl out though because I used way too much product.  As for using a sulfate free shampoo there are many options out there, just read the label.  I use their shampoo and conditioner about once every few weeks.     I am now going to my second treatment as we are going into warmer weather and I want to make sure I have the benefit of the frizz free results.  I used the formula for dark hair.     I suggest you try it.  Dry your hair a little to make sure you have full product saturation, use a 450 degree flat iron and don&#x27;t wash for 3 days.  Hope your results are as great as mine!</li>
            <li> Hey Eveyone,    Although I didn&#x27;t try this product I do have to say the overall the keratin protein thermal straightening product from the salon works like a charm.  The process is similar to this although the product must stay in your hair for 4 days.  it is absolutley amazing.  I have naturally curly hair that I HATE.  It is frizzy, kinky, curly in the humidity and rain.  Well I had the process done in April and my hair is still gorgeous.  The process is expensive but worth every single dollar.  I have chemically straightened my hair for years but never again will I do that.  This might be hard to maintain due to cost but if you are like me spending lots of cash on products and processes, look no more. My hair salon uses the Marcia Texteira product line, just as an fyi.</li>
            <li> this is just a word of caution to anyone with color treated hair: do a stand test before using LK.  since I&#x27;d had a keratin treatment done before...but at a salon I didn&#x27;t.  I went ahead with it thinking what could go wrong.  what happened is that it darkened my hair by several shades from a  very nice blond to a kinda reddish gold...not pretty!  so while I do believe in keratin ...my first experience was great..if you are thinking about this at home product save yourself the walk of shame to your stylist and strand test first.</li>
            <li> I did not think this treatment worked at all.  When you first put it in your hair and blow it out, it is soft and straight but after the first wash it&#x27;s like nothing was done to your hair....save your money.</li>
            <li> I have been doing the coppola keratin complex treatments and absolutely love that product, my sis is a hair dresser so she does the treatments for me, I wont go into the amazing difference the other treatment gave me, will focus on this product. First I have frizzy frizzy thick curly hair, I can manage it with a flat iron but the moment I step outside it looks like beyonce in goldmember remember the afro lol so I was very excited about the keratin hype.

I am not going to say it does not work because I can tell a difference between before and after, still frizz but less of it, not enough less though for me to give a higher rating though. One thing I can say it is leaves more curl and body then the keratin complex which is nice if you want big hair, I did not notice any smell what so ever during the process, but the leave in conditioner that comes in the kit made my hair smell like a wet dog, thats the closest I can get to the actual smell. The smell did go away after dried so it doesnt stick around. I think someone who has a lesser degree of frizziness and a less course hair texture would really like the product.

I still give it 3 stars and think it is just a try it and if you like it then you like it on you type thing.  I do ant to mention one more thing, the shampoo and conditioner are aweful , these come with the kit, the shampoo makes your hair tangled almost like you washed in bar soap and the conditioner isnt much better, my advice would be use the kit but then dont use their shampoo and conditioner, I switched back to the coppola and am much happier but if you want something cheaper but does a great job l&#x27;oreal has a very good shampoo and condition with out the salts in it, works great !</li>
            <li> I bought this product about 3 weeks ago and I must warn you.  If you chemically relax your hair, DO NOT use this product.  I had a very strange reaction, which may be due to the chemicals in my hair, but they boast \\&quot;can be used on relaxed hair.      My hair became lighter (almost blonde in some areas...very weird)and started breaking terribly.  I now have some pieces of my hair that are only two inches long and others 15 inches.    This product does not get rid of frizz AT ALL. It did make my hair very soft, but I wondered if that was due to the ph balance which may be why my hair is breaking off.    I have stopped using the product as of one day and noticed a great reduction in breakage.    As stated earlier, I am not sure if it is just the chemicals mixing in some way that is creating this, but if so, they should not recommend it for this type of hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that people seem to be having such different experiences with this product.  My hair has gotten increasingly frizzy and unruly due to greying, coloring, hormones, blow-drying, etc.  This product has brought it back to life - soft, silky smooth, manageable.  I am thrilled. My hairdresser couldn&#x27;t believe that a home-use product could make such a difference.  It was incredibly easy to use. I would- and do -recommend this to family and friends.</li>
            <li> This product had no, I repeat no, effect on my daughter&#x27;s hair  We followed the instructions to a tee and no change happened  We even tried twice using an enitre botle of the spray.  Please note that since I purchased this through Amazon the company will not in fact refund any money.  Either have your hair straightened or relaxed professionally or go curly/wavy.</li>
            <li> This product does not leave your hair the way the salon does.  When the product is in your hair for those few days it looks great but after washing it out the benefits aren&#x27;t that spectacular.  Although my hair isn&#x27;t a frizz ball, it isn&#x27;t smoothe like the salon does it.  Still worth the price but if you are looking for long lasting salon quality, this product is not it.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to do the in salon treatment but again hesitant because of price.  This product really works if you follow the directions and have a strong flat iron.   Would highly reccomend to all.  Some people post reviews without actually buying the product but I can guarantee my review is based on actual purchase and use. I would lend greater weight to these types of reviews when making your decision.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, kinky-curly red hair.  I had been using chemical ethnic relaxers and it was really damaging my hair, so I tried a salon keratin treatment.  It worked great, but I was out $400...  then I found this product.  I think what helped is that I tweaked the given directions a bit to follow the stricter directions for the expensive salon treatment (namely, comb a lot of the product through my hair in small sections, use a salon-style flat iron that heats up to 450 deg, don&#x27;t wash for 72 hours, and keep the hair flat and dry during the entire 72 hours).  The comment regarding the smell of the product during the 72 hours is correct - it is a weird smell, almost like burnt cereal, and your hair is slightly greasy.  I recommend doing the treatment over a long weekend where you don&#x27;t have any major plans.  Anyhow, this kit saved me the $400, it made my damaged, chemically-treated hair soft and manageable, and my hair is easy to style, curly or straight.    For curly-haired girls out there, I highly recommend the book \\&quot;Curly Girl\\&quot; by Lorainne Massey.  The most important point from the book:  stop using shampoo.  It dries your hair out and makes it frizzy.  Only use conditioner.  These keratin products work best if you use shampoos/conditioners that DON&#x27;T have sulfates in them (this strips the keratin off the hair shaft, making it frizzy).  I promise if you only use conditioner and not shampoo, your hair will not stink from not being properly \\&quot;cleansed\\&quot;.    To sum up, I think to get the most out of this keratin product (which I&#x27;ve been using for 4 mo now and get salon-quality results from it) you need to nix shampoo, use salon-quality conditioners (ones with silk or keratin proteins in them) and use a high-quality high-heat flat iron when using the product.  My coarse, frizzy, unmanageable hair is now a halo of soft, gorgeous wavy ringlets that I can actually run my fingers through (I could NEVER do that with my frizzy curls...)</li>
            <li> I have dark course hair (greek hair) and have looked into getting the brazilian hair treatment at a salon. I decided to try this based on some of the reviews. I am very happy with the results!  THe key to this product is understanding you won&#x27;t have pin straight hair with no work BUT it cut the time required to straighten my hair dramatically.  The smell of the products isnt as bad as some say it is but I do agree they aren&#x27;t pleasant.  That is the probably the only thing I have a complaint about. I was very happy with the results for $30! I highly recommend this if you want to cut your styling time but please be awaare that you still have to straighten or blow dry it straight. i also am very happy with how my hair falls with no straightening which i never would have done before.  definitely worth a try. based on what my friends who have done the salon treatment they had the same results i have had only for a lot more money.</li>
            <li> Just finished activating.....not greasy....the smell isn&#x27;t that bad....my hair dried real quick and straightened easily!!! Will update after the 48 hours......UPDATE....after 48 hours still not greasy or that foul smelling....washed, conditioned and treated with leave-in....dried super quick....no frizz after just free drying(no brush) straightened super fast and soft!!! Super soft and shiny, no frizz, even my colored random gray hairs that usually stick up from the top are smooth!!!! Love it....keeping 4 stars until some time passes...to see how long it lasts!!!!! Still need to test the curls!!!!!</li>
            <li> If you are blonde, DON&#x27;T use this stuff.  It turned my hair an awful shade of pumpkin!  Straight back to the store for this stuff!</li>
            <li> I had been completely natural for almost two years.  My hair had grown from the big chop to past shoulder length.  The curls were so tight that it looked like I only had 3 inches of hair (SEVERE SHRINKAGE).  My stylist convinced me to try this just to loosen up the curl patter a bit.  IT WORKED!  My stylist washed my hair, applied the liquid keratin in sections while combing through.  Normally it takes FOREVER to blow my hair out.  It took maybe 15 minutes!!! I was impressed.  This product WILL NOT make your hair bone straight!  It simply loosened the my curl pattern and I am still rocking my twist outs and wash and goes with more length.  I love this product and will be again in six weeks!  Thanks DAVE at GBS in Boca Raton Florida!!!!</li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t buy this because of some the reviews. I purchased it and just used it.  Some of the reviews arent&#x27; wrong.  I have golden brown color treated hair that the product manage to put in a orange tint to it (not that noticable).  The smell of the stuff is horendous! Stinks!  Even the shampoo!  However, it did take the frizz out of my hair and has made styling it easier.  Just like with any straigtening system including Brazilian, it is only meant to tame the hair and get out the frizz making it easier to style your hair.  I still blow dry and sometimes flat iron.  But instead of doing a \\&quot;full flat iron\\&quot;, I do a few pieces here and there.  Definatly like it.  But do not go into this thinking your hair will be straight without any blow drying or flat ironing.</li>
            <li> Best advice: don&#x27;t buy this product.    I wish i could give this ZERO stars.    Although advertisements and website for Liquid Keratin seems convincing, this product doesn&#x27;t do what it says it does.    I happily purchased the kit and followed the instructions carefully.  After the first shampoo and letting it air dry, the results were disappointing.    My hair was frizzy and seemed unhealthy.  There was no change.  I repacked this s**t and returned it.  I got my money back.    It&#x27;s just a waste of time and money. This company is making some money.  How sad.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I didn&#x27;t want to spend $300-$400 on the salon version that my friends have done (they all love it).  It definitely HELPED, although when I tried to airdry my hair my 3-year old asked me why my hair looked so weird.  It was still frizzy, but not as curly, and definitely easier for me to blow out.  However, it absolutely wore off after about 5 or 6 weeks (the package says it only lasts a month).  The salon version lasts over 4 months, so the price turns out to be pretty much the same if you have to keep buying this.  Also, the salon version seems to be much better.  So, this might be worth a try if you are going on vacation to a warm, humid place or just for the summer if your hair tends to get worse during hot, humid months.  Otherwise, don&#x27;t waste your time &amp; money.</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy wavy/curly hair.  This product reduced the frizz by 75%.  My hair is softer and shinier and overall healthier than it has been in a long time. I plan on doing this treatment every 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> The only difference I noticed while using this product is that my hair straightend with a flat iron slightly faster than normal.      The product did not reduce the frizz on my natural curly hair.  I still had to use my normal de-frizz products.    My hair did not feel any different than it normally does.    Not worth the money!</li>
            <li> I just did the treatment and so far it&#x27;s not too good. My hair is very greasy and I blowed dryed it for at least a half hour what I normally would. I think the water is out but now my hair is just greasy and wet looking. I am not sure how I can go to work, because I am supposed to keep it in for 48 hours. I look like a wet cat.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. I followed the steps exact and 48 hours later had essentially the same hair that I started with. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing it advertised in a magazine.  I followed the directions exactly, endured an entire weekend of greasy hair that you can&#x27;t put up or tuck behind your ears (it has to stay PERFECTLY straight for 48 hrs) and ended up with soft hair that is just as wavy as ever.  Save the money and buy a good deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> I was so psyched for this product, followed instructions to a tee, and nothing. My thick, dry, frizzy hair is still the same, no decrease in the effort required to smooth it, nothing. Fortunately Ulta took it back, grudgingly, and said many other people have be returning it. Snake oil, save yiur money, total waste.</li>
            <li> Excellent product , to get the hair straight and no frizzy. I had use for my daughter curly hair .I loved it</li>
            <li> No one ever told me that it was a bad idea to use Keratin treatments on blonde hair.  It is.  Turns it orange and it is not attractive.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this, but I&#x27;ve been horribly let down. I have extremely curly hair, and after using this for about a week I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference. I notice only a very slight overall \\&quot;relaxation\\&quot; effect. But this doesn&#x27;t even come close to being worth your money for several reasons...     1.) There is no way this stuff is worth $70. Don&#x27;t pay it! Just don&#x27;t... and don&#x27;t be deceived by the relatively large packaging. The sizes of bottles they give you for the money are practically insulting. They are no larger than travel size.   2.) This stuff STINKS! It&#x27;s unlike anything I&#x27;ve ever smelled before. Kind of like gross plastic. And it&#x27;s really strong, it doesn&#x27;t go  away.   3.) It leaves your hair very greasy, and not in a good way. I did accidentally use a bit too much on my first try, and I could practially mold my hair into shapes with how greasy it was.     Finally, please keep in mind something that is commonly overlooked here. The makers of this product claim that \\&quot;sodium chloride, which is in a lot of other hair care products, will diminish the effects of Liquid Keratin treatment very quickly.\\&quot; So you must keep using their godawful expensive (and stinky) aftercare products, or your money will be completely wasted and the keratin treatment will be reversed, pretty much.     I cannot recommend this to you.    UPDATE: It turns out that Liquid Keratin will refund your money if you provide them with a receipt and tell them what it&#x27;s done to your hair. Unfortunatly, I didn&#x27;t keep my receipt, but this is good to know.</li>
            <li> When I first used this product my hair felt smooth and frizz free. It was so easy to keep my hair straight. My hair is thick and wavy and dry. Liquid Keratin conditioning is an awesome product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after seeing an ad in a magazine. I had just had my hair bleached and thought this would help improve my hair and repair any damage it had from the bleaching. Boy was I wrong!!!! After using this, my hair was in worse shape than what I started off with!! It was literally FRIED by following their instructions! I had to cut off about 3 inches after using this as it was damaged beyond repair. I would recommend that you stay away from this product at all costs!!</li>
            <li> This product does not work.  I have had many keratin treatments done and they always work excellently for me but this product did nothing.</li>
            <li> I had chemically straightened my extremely curly hair about 6 months ago, but it had grown out about 4-6 inches.  So there was some of my natural curl for this product to show my what it could do.      While it did do what the product details said it would do (make the hair less frizzy), I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed with the results for the price.  It did NOT make the curly portion of my hair straighter at all.  And I find that I get the same results in regard to shininess and softness with other, much cheaper products.  For example, I had been using Pantene Smooth products, and used the Pantene detangler as an all-over light leave-in conditioner.  These $5-$7 products produced the same results as the $69 starter kit.     I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.  It&#x27;s just not that great of a result for the price.</li>
            <li> I am a liscensed Cosmetologist as well as a Cosmetology instructor. I have been using this product for over a year and I would recommend this product to anyone who is unhappy with the texture of their hair. I HAD cousre, curly, kinky hair. I have tried all the proffessional products out there and damaged my hair in the process, but not with this product. Also as a stylist I smelled alot of products that are used on textured hair that smell aweful and this product is not even close to smelling bad, infact many of my students like the way it smells. Before I started using this product I would have to choose between having the haircolor that I want or having smoothe hair. With this product I get the best  of both worlds. I also had difficulty with my damage ends splitting and breaking off, making it impossible for my hair to grow past my shoulders,but not anymore. It is very easy to use and as well as maintain and if you use the shampoo and conditioner in this product line the results will last you along time, just need to apply it to your new growth every 6 to 8 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product multiple times from the same vendor.  Love what it does for my hair.  Love the service received.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions.  I am really happy with the results.  It is a bit expensive for only 1 month of treatment, but you can get 2 treatmens out of the bottle.  I will buy it again.  Specially, because I am tired of paying for chemical straightners that leave my hair weak and still frizzy.</li>
            <li> I did notice a significant difference with this product. My hair was definitely softer and not as frizzy. With extreme humidity though my hair did not remain as straight as I would have liked. I still highly recommend this product as it is natural and the price is reasonable. It does not come with enough conditioner or shampoo though for a 30 supply.</li>
            <li> First, this product absolutely does work.  I just did it a little differently, which is exactly how my stylist did it back in May for $360.  I tweaked the directions as follows:  Washed my hair with clarifying shampoo.  I used NO conditioner, and NO product.  I blew my hair completely dry.  I split into sections and completely re-wet my hair with the product.  Re-blew it dry again, and finally straightened it with the 450 deg flat iron.  This is EXACTLY how it was done in the salon, and it has worked beautifully!  The coolest thing about this product is now I can wear my hair straight or curly, but the curls are smoother, looser, silkier, and WAY less frizzy.  The only reason I give it 4 stars, is the stink.  I didn&#x27;t notice it being quite as obnoxious as some people, but when I went to wash it 48 hours later, WTH?????   MAJOR STANK!!!  I washed it with their shampoo twice and used herbal essence conditioner and mousse, and the smell went away.      NEWS FLASH!!!  I&#x27;ve got some really exciting news for keratin hair people!!!  Suave&#x27;s clarifying shampoo has NO sodium!!!!  It is THE only shampoo I&#x27;ve ever found in the regular store, expensive or not, that has NONE in its ingredients!      It helped my frizz and the health of the front of my hair, which is my problem area.  It has always had breakage and been hard to get to grow past my chin.  Well, the front of my hair is almost to my shoulder and is much prettier and healthier than it was before I did my salon treatment.</li>
            <li> The most important step in this process is to flat iron the hair in small sections with a very hot (450 degree) flat iron.  If you only dry it wih a hair dryer, it will not fuze the product to your hair.  The texture of my hair, once it was dry with the product on, was not that great, but once I did the flat iron step...wow!  I had my hair professionally straightened 8 weeks ago, and although I loved it, it didn&#x27;t last very long and it was very expensive.  So far, the results from this product are even better than the salon treatment (I had lots of flyaway hairs for several days).  There is no smell at all, and it&#x27;s not sticky.  I probably only used 1/4 of the spray bottle (was nervous after reading some comments).  I think it was plenty...I guess my first shampoo will be the test.  My hair is so soft and not a bit frizzy.  From my last treatment, I know this does not eliminate all curls (I would say 30-40 percent) but the frizz is gone.  Can&#x27;t wait to see the post wash results!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this because I have thick natural african-american hair that is about 12 inches long.  I currently wear it in 2 strand twists.  It takes 2 hours to do my hair AFTER I wash and condition it.  I thought this would make it easier to style.     The product is very easy to use and it smells pretty good.  There was not enough product in the kit to do all of my hair so I had to buy two kits.  As I was blow drying and flat ironing my hair, I was sweating and could not get it straight enough.  Then you have to wash your hair again 48 hours later to neutralize the product.  Once I did the second wash, condition, leave-in condition and serum, I am happy to say that my hair was softer, shinier and not as tangled.  My twists stayed shiny and frizz-free for 2 weeks.  When I untwisted it on the 3rd week, it was still soft, shiny and frizz-free.    I would probably not purchase it again because it&#x27;s $120-$140 for me to do it at home with 2 kits. I can get it done at Ulta for $189.  I think I will purchase the shampoo and conditioners and see how they work alone.</li>
            <li> I am African American with 3 distinct hair textures.  This is why I cant have a chemical relaxer.  One portion of my hair was always over or under processed.  This product works GREAT.  You have to be realistic with your expectations though.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only done the first part.  I&#x27;ve blown it dry and flat ironed it.  It&#x27;s very soft, very straight and very bouncy. It&#x27;s not greasy or smelly. It&#x27;s actually kind of dry and I have some fly-aways.  Most of those are on the ends where my hair is colored.  My husband loves it and can&#x27;t keep his hands out of my hair.  I can&#x27;t wait to do the rinse and condition part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did use a really hot ceramic blow dryer and I bought the BaByliss flat iron because it has a temperature dial so I could be absolutely sure it was hot enough.  I ordered everything through Amazon and got it all REALLY fast. I read the reviews and they are right. Follow the directions to the letter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t expect my hair to be straight when I wash it and that&#x27;s OK because I sometimes wear my hair in double strand twists.  But, I can already tell it will be easier to style and manage my \\&quot;mop\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll check back in later to update on how it goes after I do the rinse and condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a week now...&lt;br /&gt;After the rinse and condition my hair was VERY soft.  I was able, even with my pressed hair to do a \\&quot;wet set\\&quot; with liquid setting lotion.  The curls lasted a full week even though I combed through them!&lt;br /&gt;The final verdict?  I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;If you are expecting your hair to be bone, relaxer straight while wet FORGET IT. But, my hair is a lot softer, the curl is a little relaxed and easier to comb.  It presses straighter and holds the press better.  I don&#x27;t go POOF in humidity anymore either.&lt;br /&gt;I can switch between my natural and straight styles with the flip of a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line if you have the money and want bone straight hair like a relaxer without the damage get the Brazilian Blow out.&lt;br /&gt;If you want your hair softer, easier to manage and easier to maintain straight styles,  try this.  If you don&#x27;t have a clue how to do your hair take it to your stylist and let them do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE..&lt;br /&gt;I had full results for about 2 and 1/2 months.  I should have done another treatment about 2 weeks ago but I was busy.  I used natural sulfate free products from the Kinky Curly line.  No frizz even when I went to Florida and hair was bouncy, soft and easy to keep straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED UPDATE....&lt;br /&gt;3 years later and I still swear by it.  My hair is actually longer and stronger now.</li>
            <li> I had this treatment done at the hair dressers and it was fine.  I decided to try it at home.  I followed the instruction to the letter and did exactly what my hair dresser had done.  My hair in now bright orange!</li>
            <li> I read tons of reviews and researched several similar products before settling on Liquid Keratin.&lt;br /&gt;I have VERY thick, frizzy hair and knew going in to this that it would not miraculously make my hair straight. It did however make it much more manageable and over time will possibly straighten it. After the initial use, my hair felt so healthy and soft. Whenever I felt like running a flat iron over it, it straightened in less than half the time.&lt;br /&gt;I have only used it once, but there was enough of each bottle left to do the treatment one more time when the 30 days is over. As far as smell, I didn&#x27;t notice anything too horrible but my mom said it did smell like perm solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it and am going to buy the bigger bottles from Ulta online (way cheaper than in the store)</li>
            <li> Shipping was okay. I enjoyed this product. Followed directions and my hair was nice and straight. Much more cost effective than the salon treatment. I would recommend this product highly and I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I have difficult hair - it has grey, it has been colored, it&#x27;s hormone-stressed, life-stressed, and ex-husband-stressed.  I have used it for two weeks. The first week, I only used the shampoo/conditioner/leave-in &#x27;cause I forgot my flat iron. Less breakage and softer. This week, I&#x27;m doing the whole nine yards. Left it in for 30 minutes, did the blow dry and flat iron. So.... I was stopped ON THE STREET 5 times today plus 6 TIMES in the office with a comment \\&quot;your hair looks fabulous\\&quot;. I am sold!</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would work on my hair from hell but was I ever wrong. I&#x27;m biracial and have extremely dry thick hair with a lot of breakage on the ends. I followed the directions to the letter and it stripped the color. I had red streaks running down my face. It did smooth my hair out after using a flat iron but after the 48 hour washing, it was back to the same old dry frizzy hair from hell. For the money and the time involved, you&#x27;d be better off buying a really good deep conditioner or consider a Brazilian Keratin treatment for a licensed hair stylist. It may be a bit more expensive but if you count the money you&#x27;d same in NOT buying this product or ones like it, It may well be worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I think this package was a bit of a waste of money. The treatment didn&#x27;t do anything to straighten or even relax my curls at all and I followed the instructions exactly. I&#x27;m still using the shampoos and conditioners just because I bought it so I may as well, but as a straightening treatment it just doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> This product does work if you do it right.  It&#x27;s important that you follow the instructions and use a flat iron that reaches the recommended temperature.  It doesn&#x27;t have the most pleasant odor but it&#x27;s not awful.  I have frizzy hair and flat iron my hair every day to obtain the look I desire.  This product makes achieving that look so much easier!  Especially in the summer months when the humidity hits.  I have purchased this product 2x from this seller after I received it as a Christmas gift.  It&#x27;s on my wish list every spring!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a Brazilian Blowout so if that&#x27;s the result you&#x27;re expecting, you&#x27;ll be let down. I&#x27;ve used this product a couple of times and it&#x27;s made my hair softer and silkier. I have color-treated, baby fine hair that gets easily damaged. Brazilian Blowouts have helped but also left the bottom of my hair completely ragged. I have to do a major haircut afterward which is fine but I lose a couple of inches off the length. I LOVE a Brazilian Blowout because it does make a substantial improvement in your hair texture, but it gets costly.  This is a much cheaper, less effective alternative. It also doesn&#x27;t ravage the ends of my hair. Do I think it&#x27;s the best thing since sliced bread? No. But I do think it helps and I&#x27;m surprised at the negative reviews. I think maybe people were expecting a miracle in a bottle and were therefore, let down.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Works great on my hair and i love how my hair looks now.  Thank you Beauty Center!!</li>
            <li> I had the $300 keratin treatment from Coppola done at my salon in April. It lasted great for about 8 weeks and then slowly started to fade away and the texture of my hair mostly returned to its previous state. With that being said, the treatment although faded still continued to make my hair less frizzy and easier to mange overall.I also got a better haircut with more layers so my thick, dry, naturally curly hair was more manageable overall. Having had 2 kids had also made the texture of my hair change (not for the better). I have naturally curly hair as mentioned and I NEVER EVER wear it curly so a product like keratin or the brazilian blowout, etc are appealing to me becasue my hair styled as curly is absolutely horrific!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, around July I saw this product on Amazon and thought for the price - what the heck. I spoke to my stylist and said I am considering not doing the $300 treatment again becasue it did not last long enough. When I first got it done I said to myself that if it lasted till Aug/Sept (from April) I would do it about 2 times per year and thats fine, but thats wasnt the case. So i bought this to try. It took a month for me to find the time to use it and unfortunately my busy work/family schedule does not allow me to do this as instructed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;basically I washed my hair (no conditioner) with my Coppola shampoo that I have  been using since April (and love). I towel dried and then used the spray in this kit and combed about 1/3 of the product into my hair and blow dried as usual.Maybe i spent a little longer blow drying but I did not use my flat iron at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is as smooth and sleek and soft as it was when i got the $300 treatment. My goal now is to get 3 treatments out of each of spray bottle and just do this once per month. I cannot speak to this treatment as it was designed to be used which is to do exactly as instructed, but I only wash my hair 2 days per week so meeting the 48 hour leave in timeframe is not a problem for me. I have not used the shampoo/conditioner or leave in treatment yet but can update this review when I do. I am pleased with this product because for the price and the time that I can do this myself at home, its a very practical solution for me</li>
            <li> This is amazing.  I&#x27;ve only used it once so can&#x27;t comment on the \\&quot;over time\\&quot; claims, but with one single, simple use I have soft, straighter, silky hair.  The directions look elaborate, but they&#x27;re not -- it&#x27;s just the usual routine for thick, unmanageble hair: wash, condition (leave in conditioner provided), spray on treatment, dry with a round brush, flat-iron.  But with this product the results of that routine are sleek and smooth and delightful.  I&#x27;ve been using the Wen by Chaz Dean line which is somewhat helpful, but not like this.  With Wen, I was still considering the lengthy, expensive Japanese hair-straightening process but now?  Why bother?  Great stuff, well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> This product delivers on it&#x27;s promise. I have very wavy, coarse, frizzy hair and live in the humidity capital of the world (Houston, TX) &amp; after using Liquid Keratin, following the directions exactly, I was able to blow dry my hair somewhat straight. It still had a fair amount of fullness in it. After using my Chi flat iron my hair was exactly what I wanted it to be. Straight, smooth &amp; soft. I have achieved these results using other products but what impressed me about Liquid Keratin is that my hair stayed that way all day even though it was humid outside. The shampoo does not lather a lot which tells me it is low in detergent which is safer for color treated hair. A good product but it is pricey and difficult to find.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reordering this for about the sixth time.  I live in Florida and boy is it humid here.  I&#x27;ve had the salon straightening done, but I can&#x27;t keep sitting in the house for three days hiding out.  I have to work.  So, I use this product. I have thin hair and it frizzes fast in the humidity. If I feel it&#x27;s going to be extra humid out, I&#x27;ll reapply as needed during the 30 days.  I spray on after my shower, wait 20 minutes, then dry as usual.  I can&#x27;t seem to live without it, at least during the summer months. On a side note, I have never noticed a smell and it doesn&#x27;t change my hair color as I&#x27;ve seen in other reviews.</li>
            <li> I would have given this formula -1 star if I had the option. I have relatively thick curly/wavy/frizzy hair. I normally straighten it or add curls to it to even everything out depending on how much time I have. I picked this product up out of curiosity and part desperation. Let me tell you, curiosity most definitely killed the cat. I followed the instructions to absolute perfection. I re-read every step at least four times before proceeding. I didn&#x27;t skip out on anything from the blow drying to the straightening or even the towel drying. All this product did was make my hair heavy and it took away all the volume. I didn&#x27;t use up all of the leave-in conditioner and it made my hair overly shiny in a greasy way. Now I&#x27;ve come to find out that not only did this product make my hair flat to my head, it makes it incredibly difficult to even add a few curls despite what the label says. The ones I did add fell out within an hour. I cannot wait for the product to wash out. I&#x27;m in complete frustration every morning trying to do SOMETHING with my hair. If I put it in a pony tail it looks oily and slicked back. I can barely curl it (with and without product). Its even difficult to wear it straight because it looks dirty and flattened to my head. I know what you&#x27;re thinking, maybe this girl just can&#x27;t do hair. I can tell you that hair is my thing! I normally receive daily compliments on my hair but after I stated using this, nothing. This product needs some serious re-considering on Liquid Keratin&#x27;s part.</li>
            <li> Works Great it  actually works. Does not off gas but have good ventilation anyway.</li>
            <li> I have used this on many occasions, the only complaint I have is that they never put enough shampoo/conditioner in the bottles... I run out of that first as my hair is long and the treatment/smoothing system do not seem to work as nicely with regular shampoos.  Regardless, the product works great for my wavy hair... It even makes my hair feel healthier!</li>
