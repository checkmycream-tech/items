            <li>I love these tubes for their quality, but I wish they included shrink wrap sleeves.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t like leaving un-shrunk tubes at the store that carries them, because customers can&#x27;t be sure no one else has opened and stuck them up their noses.  </li>

            <li>they are a great medical quality!</li>
            <li>I have made a few already and they have had excellent results.</li>
            <li>Great blank inhalers.</li>
            <li>Great for using with doTERRA essential oils.  </li>
            <li>I had to hammer them into place with a mallet which provided a snug fit.</li>
            <li>but so far, so good.</li>
            <li>The only thing that could make these better is if I could buy them in BULK!?!</li>

            <li>I would like to see if they offer large quanitities per pack. :)</li>
            <li>He loved the doTerra Breathe essential oil that I used in it.</li>
            <li>They were packaged in an easy to open zip lock bag which was nice.</li>
            <li>I doubt I&#x27;d buy these again just because of the shape, mostly because I thought they&#x27;d be good to send with a little peppermint oil with kids to school on test days.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and in gift giving condition</li>
            <li>These are wonderful for essential oil blends that need to be inhaled, such as my migraine headache blend.  </li>
            <li>It took some playing around with them before I figured out exactly how all the pieces were supposed to fit together.</li>
            <li>These inhalers fit the purpose very well!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t push the button all the way into the bottom to facilitate refreshing the wick or replacing with a new one.</li>
            <li>My new favorite thing.</li>
            <li>great little tubes for making inhalers</li>
            <li>I plan on using the Lavender to keep me calm for some upcoming surgery.</li>
            <li>Besides looking like tampons these are pretty cool</li>
            <li>The only problem I have had with these sticks is that they didn&#x27;t come to me in nice official wrapping.</li>
            <li>Nice, solid quality product.  </li>
            <li>Nice and sturdy, These will last a while!</li>
            <li>Bought these to make my own essential oil inhalers.  </li>
            <li>Got quickly and exactly as stated.  </li>
            <li>I received the aroma stick inhalers and began using them right away after I learned about this additional way ti diffuse the.</li>
            <li>These are very easy to fill and use, and no bigger than a chapstick tube</li>
            <li>I am THRILLED to be able to use my essential oils to create that same, useful, effect / technique.</li>
            <li>I made one with Calming synergy blend (Eden&#x27;s Garden) for my son whose nervous system can get the best of him sometimes, one with Alert synergy blend to help both my sons get through our home school day, I made all of them one with Breath Easy ... allergy / cold season.</li>
            <li>I still have some sleeves from the earlier good ones I got, because I don&#x27;t shrink the ones I sell directly,</li>
            <li>I added an essential oil and dried my clothes with awesome results.  </li>
            <li>Just exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>THanks!</li>
            <li>Wish I had purchased more or that they came in a larger amount.</li>
            <li>But, as I said, you might love the ease of which you can open and close the bottom.</li>
            <li>Seriously, my first inhaler (peppermint) can be used from across the room.</li>
            <li>Was much nicer!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>it is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>Definitely will reorder once I am running out :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read that there are types of blank inhalers that you can re-open to add more oil to the wick.</li>
            <li>This was my first order</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s ready to go wherever!</li>
            <li>essential oil inhalers of some of my favorite blends.</li>

            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>My favorite is my peppermint inhaler that help keep me awake since I have to get up earlier for my job.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Only one flaw, the stopper is such a good seal that it cannot be removed once it is plugged so it cannot be refilled.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I prefer ones with an easier to open area for the replacement wick, but these seem to be a little more durable than some others I have purchased.</li>
            <li>Fast service, exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and the lids fit tightly.  </li>
            <li>so I can make several to easily carry my oils without worrying about them leaking.</li>
            <li>Easy to make essential oil inhalers.</li>
            <li>These are really solidly constructed and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It lasts a good, long time if properly taken care of.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re much easier to replace the refill quick than the old ones were.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t require the whole pad to be soaked in order to smell the scent.</li>
            <li>My grandson loves it so much he carries one around everywhere to smell it.  </li>
            <li>These inhalers work very well</li>
            <li>Fast service</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get the caps to fit in these properly.</li>
            <li>Seems very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Giving it 3 stars because they really are just &amp;#34;okay.&amp;#34;  My friend is an aromatherapist</li>
            <li>expected!&lt;br /&gt;Arrived when they said they would and fast.</li>
            <li>They are compact enough to fit in a pocket, like a chapstick.</li>
            <li>These absolutely do the job for which they are intended.</li>
            <li>I also used a sterile needle to puncture a few more holes in the internal cartridge so more oil would absorb.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>Cost is reasonable.</li>
            <li>AND SHIPPING WAS FAST.</li>

            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and will order more in near future.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using them to make my own decongestant inhalers by combining several drops of DoTerra&#x27;s Breathe formula and several drops of Respir-Aid</li>
            <li>I know now to pull it back and not waste precious oil.</li>
            <li>strong, single use aroma therapy breathers.</li>
            <li>The tip has a round hole so you can add more oil through the top if you are careful.</li>
            <li>Just open it up when you need a quick pick me up.</li>
            <li>I love my blank Essential Oil inhalers.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these and will buy again</li>
            <li>As expected,  very useful</li>
            <li>I used too much essential oil my first at bat.</li>
            <li>Much more durable than ones I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li>It seems as tho you can put as much or as little as you like depending on how strong you want it.</li>
            <li>and so far seem to hold the scent for quite awhile.</li>
            <li>I experience much relief from my seasonal allergies using my Essential Oils in the inhaler.</li>
            <li>and I wanted this for a natural way to help my family during colds and allergy season.&lt;br /&gt;all</li>
            <li>They work very well with essential oils.</li>
            <li>The end piece that holds the cotton in place is easy to snap into place when you place on a flat surace and press down.  </li>
            <li>the actual product is fine, and works like it&#x27;s suppose to, but the packaging was odd.&lt;br /&gt;everything was in a off brand ziplock baggie and the baggie was severely scratched up and had odd stains on it.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li>I especially like it with peppermint to help clear the sinuses and start helping headaches.</li>
            <li>I use these for my 5 year old son too and he loves smelling his Native American Nutritionals Attention Assist blend from it.  </li>
            <li>My son has asthma and I fixed one up for him with doTERRA essential oils.</li>
            <li>but I have found several of them that have gone thru the washer and come out completely sealed still.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, and packaged carefully.</li>
            <li>These are pretty cool, but it&#x27;s almost impossible to get the wicks back out after using them, so if you want to refill or change one, it&#x27;s kind of hard to do.</li>
            <li>, you can either slightly unscrew the end and inhale from the vent holes on the bottom, or take the whole thing out and hold the tip to your nose as suggested.  </li>

            <li> I love these tubes for their quality, but I wish they included shrink wrap sleeves.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t like leaving un-shrunk tubes at the store that carries them, because customers can&#x27;t be sure no one else has opened and stuck them up their noses.  </li>

            <li> they are a great medical quality!</li>
            <li> I have made a few already and they have had excellent results.</li>
            <li> Great blank inhalers.</li>
            <li> Great for using with doTERRA essential oils.  </li>
            <li> I had to hammer them into place with a mallet which provided a snug fit.</li>
            <li> but so far, so good.</li>
            <li> The only thing that could make these better is if I could buy them in BULK!?!</li>

            <li> I would like to see if they offer large quanitities per pack. :)</li>
            <li> He loved the doTerra Breathe essential oil that I used in it.</li>
            <li> They were packaged in an easy to open zip lock bag which was nice.</li>
            <li> I doubt I&#x27;d buy these again just because of the shape, mostly because I thought they&#x27;d be good to send with a little peppermint oil with kids to school on test days.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and in gift giving condition</li>
            <li> These are wonderful for essential oil blends that need to be inhaled, such as my migraine headache blend.  </li>
            <li> It took some playing around with them before I figured out exactly how all the pieces were supposed to fit together.</li>
            <li> These inhalers fit the purpose very well!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t push the button all the way into the bottom to facilitate refreshing the wick or replacing with a new one.</li>
            <li> My new favorite thing.</li>
            <li> great little tubes for making inhalers</li>
            <li> I plan on using the Lavender to keep me calm for some upcoming surgery.</li>
            <li> Besides looking like tampons these are pretty cool</li>
            <li> The only problem I have had with these sticks is that they didn&#x27;t come to me in nice official wrapping.</li>
            <li> Nice, solid quality product.  </li>
            <li> Nice and sturdy, These will last a while!</li>
            <li> Bought these to make my own essential oil inhalers.  </li>
            <li> Got quickly and exactly as stated.  </li>
            <li> I received the aroma stick inhalers and began using them right away after I learned about this additional way ti diffuse the.</li>
            <li> These are very easy to fill and use, and no bigger than a chapstick tube</li>
            <li> I am THRILLED to be able to use my essential oils to create that same, useful, effect / technique.</li>
            <li> I made one with Calming synergy blend (Eden&#x27;s Garden) for my son whose nervous system can get the best of him sometimes, one with Alert synergy blend to help both my sons get through our home school day, I made all of them one with Breath Easy ... allergy / cold season.</li>
            <li> I still have some sleeves from the earlier good ones I got, because I don&#x27;t shrink the ones I sell directly,</li>
            <li> I added an essential oil and dried my clothes with awesome results.  </li>
            <li> Just exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> THanks!</li>
            <li> Wish I had purchased more or that they came in a larger amount.</li>
            <li> But, as I said, you might love the ease of which you can open and close the bottom.</li>
            <li> Seriously, my first inhaler (peppermint) can be used from across the room.</li>
            <li> Was much nicer!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> it is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> Definitely will reorder once I am running out :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that there are types of blank inhalers that you can re-open to add more oil to the wick.</li>
            <li> This was my first order</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s ready to go wherever!</li>
            <li> essential oil inhalers of some of my favorite blends.</li>
            <li> I love the fact they are made in the USA and medical grade !!  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> My favorite is my peppermint inhaler that help keep me awake since I have to get up earlier for my job.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Only one flaw, the stopper is such a good seal that it cannot be removed once it is plugged so it cannot be refilled.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I prefer ones with an easier to open area for the replacement wick, but these seem to be a little more durable than some others I have purchased.</li>
            <li> Fast service, exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and the lids fit tightly.  </li>
            <li> so I can make several to easily carry my oils without worrying about them leaking.</li>
            <li> Easy to make essential oil inhalers.</li>
            <li> These are really solidly constructed and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It lasts a good, long time if properly taken care of.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re much easier to replace the refill quick than the old ones were.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t require the whole pad to be soaked in order to smell the scent.</li>
            <li> My grandson loves it so much he carries one around everywhere to smell it.  </li>
            <li> These inhalers work very well</li>
            <li> Fast service</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get the caps to fit in these properly.</li>
            <li> Seems very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Giving it 3 stars because they really are just &amp;#34;okay.&amp;#34;  My friend is an aromatherapist</li>

            <li> They are compact enough to fit in a pocket, like a chapstick.</li>
            <li> These absolutely do the job for which they are intended.</li>
            <li> I also used a sterile needle to puncture a few more holes in the internal cartridge so more oil would absorb.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> Cost is reasonable.</li>
            <li> AND SHIPPING WAS FAST.</li>

            <li> Arrived on time and will order more in near future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using them to make my own decongestant inhalers by combining several drops of DoTerra&#x27;s Breathe formula and several drops of Respir-Aid</li>
            <li> I know now to pull it back and not waste precious oil.</li>
            <li> strong, single use aroma therapy breathers.</li>
            <li> The tip has a round hole so you can add more oil through the top if you are careful.</li>
            <li> Just open it up when you need a quick pick me up.</li>
            <li> I love my blank Essential Oil inhalers.</li>

            <li> I used too much essential oil my first at bat.</li>
            <li> Much more durable than ones I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> It seems as tho you can put as much or as little as you like depending on how strong you want it.</li>
            <li> and so far seem to hold the scent for quite awhile.</li>
            <li> I experience much relief from my seasonal allergies using my Essential Oils in the inhaler.</li>
            <li> and I wanted this for a natural way to help my family during colds and allergy season.&lt;br /&gt;all</li>
            <li> They work very well with essential oils.</li>
            <li> The end piece that holds the cotton in place is easy to snap into place when you place on a flat surace and press down.  </li>
            <li> the actual product is fine, and works like it&#x27;s suppose to, but the packaging was odd.&lt;br /&gt;everything was in a off brand ziplock baggie and the baggie was severely scratched up and had odd stains on it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> I especially like it with peppermint to help clear the sinuses and start helping headaches.</li>
            <li> I use these for my 5 year old son too and he loves smelling his Native American Nutritionals Attention Assist blend from it.  </li>
            <li> My son has asthma and I fixed one up for him with doTERRA essential oils.</li>
            <li> but I have found several of them that have gone thru the washer and come out completely sealed still.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, and packaged carefully.</li>
            <li> These are pretty cool, but it&#x27;s almost impossible to get the wicks back out after using them, so if you want to refill or change one, it&#x27;s kind of hard to do.</li>
            <li> , you can either slightly unscrew the end and inhale from the vent holes on the bottom, or take the whole thing out and hold the tip to your nose as suggested.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any problems closing the ones I have used so far like some other people have mentioned.</li>
            <li> The scent seems to last quite long as well in these.  </li>
            <li> I have not had them long enough to see how long the scent will last.</li>
            <li> and I bought these because they were slightly cheaper than the ones she offers.  </li>
            <li> If I had known about these sooner I would have gotten them long ago.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the ones that are flush when inserted and are harder to get back off.</li>
            <li> We have used these for quite some time now and not one cap had come loose.</li>
            <li> I put several together in less than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> And it only came with half the order 6 instead of 12.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long they&#x27;ll last yet (since I have no idea how to replace the wicks)</li>
            <li> Just a few drops of essential oils on the cotton inside</li>
            <li> Inhalers are as expected.  </li>
            <li> These work as expected.</li>
            <li> It makes it slightly harder to refill</li>
            <li> Before using these I&#x27;d either have to open up the oils for inhalation usage (which is not good as constant exposure to oxygen degrades the oils) or drip a few drops onto tissue which does not last very long as the oil will evaporate.</li>
            <li> Money well spent!</li>
            <li> The cotton is bigger then the ones I&#x27;ve purchased in the past</li>
            <li> My lemon oil slightly warped the thing the wick sits in too.</li>
            <li> Almost as if it had been previously used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if you can re-use the plastic tube because the plug that goes into the bottom is in there tight.</li>
            <li> The plug for these is at the bottom and presses in tightly.</li>
            <li> Made an inhaler for the little grandson who had a stuffy nose.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint is that it appears these would be extremely hard to take apart to refill.</li>
            <li> Then you can get it out without destroying the container.</li>
            <li> There are quite a few in the bag</li>
            <li> A little difficult to get them saturated and put together but overall work as stated.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the small sz of the wick</li>
            <li> Hard to reuse these.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too hard to remove because it doesn&#x27;t screw on, just pushes in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to reopen to refill.</li>
            <li> the bottoms do not seal flat to the piece and are almost impossible to remove and refill and reuse.</li>
            <li> Not happy with these.</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness came in a dirty zip lock bag that had a hole it.  </li>
            <li> The bad news is, I have had it fall out along with the inside wick.</li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s not all bad.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed..</li>

            <li> Just exactly what I needed. Arrived on time and will order more in near future.</li>
            <li> If I had known about these sooner I would have gotten them long ago.  So handy for taking oils with you  where ever you go.  Great idea and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love that I can make my own inhalers! So easy to use!</li>
            <li> Arrived just as reviewed....satisfied!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> Besides looking like tampons these are pretty cool and so far seem to hold the scent for quite awhile. They don&#x27;t require the whole pad to be soaked in order to smell the scent. It seems as tho you can put as much or as little as you like depending on how strong you want it. I doubt I&#x27;d buy these again just because of the shape, mostly because I thought they&#x27;d be good to send with a little peppermint oil with kids to school on test days. No my my preteen is pulling and sniffing something that looks like a tampon lol Also some basic instructions would have been nice</li>
            <li> I have ordered these several times. Works great with essential oils to address allergy and afternoon fogginess. Peppermint is awesome in these!&lt;br /&gt;They are nice and heavy plastic-no breaking or leaking!</li>
            <li> Just what i needed for essential oil inhalers!!</li>
            <li> I received the aroma stick inhalers and began using them right away after I learned about this additional way ti diffuse the. Oils on a personal level.  They work great.</li>
            <li> I love these, they are great- easy to use.  I love to  buy from a USA company.</li>
            <li> These were perfect for my winter blend!</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used them yet but they are what I wanted.  I am having a event this weekend so will make a couple!</li>
            <li> At this moment I am happy with the item. However You have to know that I have only made one inhaler at this point. I don&#x27;t believe that my thought will change.</li>
            <li> These are great. I keep peppermint and also Now brand&#x27;s Get Happy in these inhalers.</li>
            <li> These &amp;#34;sniffies&amp;#34; as we call them, are wonderful for carrying the &amp;#34;breathing oils&amp;#34; to use as needed!  And for sharing with others!  Kids really love them!!</li>
            <li> These are just perfect.  I can make different blends and keep them on hand.  Love the product.</li>
            <li> Very happy with item.</li>
            <li> These are great.  Just a few drops of essential oils on the cotton inside and you are good to go.  Just open it up when you need a quick pick me up.</li>
            <li> Quick and Easy to assemble. I don&#x27;t know if you can re-use the plastic tube because the plug that goes into the bottom is in there tight. I put several together in less than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> Just what the doctor ordered:)</li>
            <li> I used these with essential oil for trips in the car.  My grandson loves it so much he carries one around everywhere to smell it.  Works great.  Great price.</li>
            <li> I love these...they are great!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for and VERY easy to fill!  THanks!</li>
            <li> Made my recipe for allergies with essential oils, saturated the thing which goes inside and use daily. These work great.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted.  Wish I had purchased more or that they came in a larger amount.</li>
            <li> These work. What I don&#x27;t like that you might love. The bottom plug does not go all the way in. It is like a cork in a bottle. The good news about that is that you can easily get it out to refresh/recharge your inhaler. The bad news is, I have had it fall out along with the inside wick. I would not buy them again. But, as I said, you might love the ease of which you can open and close the bottom. I prefer the ones that are flush when inserted and are harder to get back off.</li>
            <li> They work great - but instructions for how to use them might have been helpful.  It took some playing around with them before I figured out exactly how all the pieces were supposed to fit together.</li>
            <li> These are not truly refillable in the sense that you can replace the wicks  at the time of purchase the listing that is not for prime members states that  they are.  With that understood they work perfectly fine</li>
            <li> Easy to order  Come in hand to take scent with you. I plan on using the Lavender to keep me calm for some upcoming surgery.</li>
            <li> These were super easy to use!  the parts of the inhaler all fit together nicely.  The end piece that holds the cotton in place is easy to snap into place when you place on a flat surace and press down.  I have had others that didn&#x27;t work as well. The caps come of easily for use but do not come apart in my bags. I was able to place labels onto the plastic without any issues.  I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great for making your own essential oil inhalers.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have had with these sticks is that they didn&#x27;t come to me in nice official wrapping. They were just thrown in a simple ziplock sandwich bag. Meaning they were probablu handled.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried them out yet for the purpose I bought them for.</li>
            <li> I love these inhalers!! they are a great medical quality! Arrived quickly and in gift giving condition</li>
            <li> Great value. These work well.</li>
            <li> These inhalers work very well, you can either slightly unscrew the end and inhale from the vent holes on the bottom, or take the whole thing out and hold the tip to your nose as suggested.  I use these for my 5 year old son too and he loves smelling his Native American Nutritionals Attention Assist blend from it.  The scent seems to last quite long as well in these.  Before using these I&#x27;d either have to open up the oils for inhalation usage (which is not good as constant exposure to oxygen degrades the oils) or drip a few drops onto tissue which does not last very long as the oil will evaporate.</li>
            <li> As expected,  very useful</li>
            <li> These inhalers are just what I needed for salt tubes and aroma therapy. The quality is very good and they are easy to put together for use. I am very pleased with my purchase and will order again when I run out of these.</li>
            <li> great price, product and shipping!</li>
            <li> Perfect for all my oils, I love the ease of using this product.  Will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Fast service and they are just what I needed.</li>
            <li> perfect - arrived on time ( early)  and exactly as shown on the advertising!</li>
            <li> So much fun! I didn&#x27;t have any problems closing the ones I have used so far like some other people have mentioned. My kids and sisters love these!</li>
            <li> these are very simple to use. With a cursory knowledge of essential oils, access to google and YouTube you can be making your own aromatherapy inhalers in no time. I have made a few already and they have had excellent results.</li>
            <li> Nice, solid quality product.  Listed as medical grade plastic.</li>
            <li> Great Item for price and quick delivery</li>
            <li> Inhalers are as expected.  Pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> love these, so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to work with, clients love them. Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Great blank inhalers. I&#x27;m using them to make my own decongestant inhalers by combining several drops of DoTerra&#x27;s Breathe formula and several drops of Respir-Aid (both are essential oil blends sold on Amazon) These inhalers fit the purpose very well!</li>
            <li> The inhalers are easy to fill and easy to use. I experience much relief from my seasonal allergies using my Essential Oils in the inhaler.</li>
            <li> I had no IDEA these could be purchased. I grew up with everybody having a Vicks inhaler in their possession. I am THRILLED to be able to use my essential oils to create that same, useful, effect / technique. I do wish there had been instructions. I used too much essential oil my first at bat. I know now to pull it back and not waste precious oil. Seriously, my first inhaler (peppermint) can be used from across the room. Maybe that&#x27;s not all bad. Too soon to tell and too close to call. Thank you.</li>
            <li> A little difficult to get them saturated and put together but overall work as stated.</li>
            <li> Very good quality and service.</li>
            <li> Not happy with these. I boughtr another type as well and like them so much better.  I can&#x27;t get the caps to fit in these properly.</li>
            <li> Fast service, great product</li>
            <li> I love my blank Essential Oil inhalers. They were packaged in an easy to open zip lock bag which was nice.</li>
            <li> Great for using with doTERRA essential oils.  Easy to fill, easy to use. I put colored labels on these to have some color on the outside.</li>
            <li> These are pretty cool, but it&#x27;s almost impossible to get the wicks back out after using them, so if you want to refill or change one, it&#x27;s kind of hard to do. My lemon oil slightly warped the thing the wick sits in too.</li>
            <li> Good product, quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Works well. Seems very sturdy. Only complaint is that it appears these would be extremely hard to take apart to refill.</li>
            <li> Hard to reuse these. To get the bottom to stay in you have to push it in until it snaps. Then you can get it out without destroying the container. I have others that the bottom screwed on. Was much nicer! Doesnt even tell you how many drops to put on the wick.</li>
            <li> the bottoms do not seal flat to the piece and are almost impossible to remove and refill and reuse.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> They work great with Young Living oils!! I am sure I will order again. Thank you</li>
            <li> great little tubes for making inhalers</li>
            <li> Excellent.  I have used these before from MEessentials.  Good to have them on hand!</li>
            <li> Easy to assemble. Plastic, so no citrus oils used in here.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product. Easy to assemble. Perfect for essential oil use.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I prefer ones with an easier to open area for the replacement wick, but these seem to be a little more durable than some others I have purchased.</li>
            <li> The inhalers arrived on time with all of the wicks and caps. I am especially impressed with the caps. I had to hammer them into place with a mallet which provided a snug fit. We have used these for quite some time now and not one cap had come loose. The wicks took a bit of time to thoroughly soak up the essential oils but maintained their quality fragrance for weeks. I definitely plan to purchase this item again in the future.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping good product</li>
            <li> Fast service, exactly as described.</li>
            <li> So easy to add Germfighter oil and keep in purse, pocket, desk or car. I highly recommend these and will buy again</li>
            <li> works perfectly. it is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I love these tubes for their quality, but I wish they included shrink wrap sleeves.  I am selling my own blends and I don&#x27;t like leaving un-shrunk tubes at the store that carries them, because customers can&#x27;t be sure no one else has opened and stuck them up their noses.  The place I used to get these included the shrink wrap, but they switched to a really cheap tube and an even worse brand of shrink wrap.  I take pride in the quality of my blends and the labels I make myself.  I want the tubes to be good quality AND shrink wrapped.  I still have some sleeves from the earlier good ones I got, because I don&#x27;t shrink the ones I sell directly, just the ones I leave at a store.  But when they&#x27;re gone, I&#x27;ll be looking for tubes WITH shrink wrap.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this item, they arrived packed in a sealed plastic bag all together and all parts were there too. These arrived two days after I ordered, top quality. I will be reordering from seller again.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with the quality. Will purchase from here always! Money well spent! I would like to see if they offer large quanitities per pack. :)</li>
            <li> Love these. Good quality! Nice and sturdy, These will last a while! Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> These are of excellent quality! Much more durable than ones I&#x27;ve purchased in the past. These will be the ones I buy from now on. Good job! And a BIG bonus....they&#x27;re made in the good ol&#x27; USA .... YAY :D</li>
            <li> Love using these for making my own inhaler for stress; headaches etc....</li>
            <li> Giving it 3 stars because they really are just &amp;#34;okay.&amp;#34;  My friend is an aromatherapist and I bought these because they were slightly cheaper than the ones she offers.  I don&#x27;t like the caps on these when the wicks needs to be refilled they are more difficult to get off.</li>
            <li> Made an inhaler for the little grandson who had a stuffy nose.  He loved the doTerra Breathe essential oil that I used in it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for essential oil aromatherapy! I didn&#x27;t push the button all the way into the bottom to facilitate refreshing the wick or replacing with a new one. They should last a ling time!</li>
            <li> Perfect, exactly what they said they were, exactly what I needed and expected!&lt;br /&gt;Arrived when they said they would and fast.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and packaged very nicely. Thank you, I can&#x27;t wait to make my own inhalers.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery,  seem to be good quality.</li>
            <li> Great experience. Received very quickly. Very good product. The cotton is bigger then the ones I&#x27;ve purchased in the past and I didn&#x27;t receive any that already had the butt locked in, yay... But over all a very successful purchase and very good quality. Definitely will reorder once I am running out :)</li>
            <li> These work as expected. I use a combination of essential oils as apposed to using medication like Flonase.</li>
            <li> Perfect for what I am using them for - essential oil inhalation. Cotton wick holds plenty of essential oil. Only downfall, I can never get the bottom part open again. I&#x27;ve read that there are types of blank inhalers that you can re-open to add more oil to the wick. I, however, cannot get this to work on this brand. So this is a one-time use item for me (which is okay).</li>
            <li> I have been using essential oils for a while now and have only just discovered inhalers. This was my first order but I super love these things! They are compact enough to fit in a pocket, like a chapstick. I just slap on a label and it&#x27;s ready to go wherever! I gave one you my daughter to use at school and I carry one around with me. I think there pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> Excellent purchase and delivery.</li>
            <li> Incomplete, only got 4 filters and 3 end caps yet 10 sticks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased withmy orders.</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I was looking for &amp; needing---you filled that need 100%!!! Many thanks!!</li>
            <li> Fast ship and great item!!</li>
            <li> These absolutely do the job for which they are intended. My son has asthma and I fixed one up for him with doTERRA essential oils. We&#x27;re both pleased.</li>
            <li> excellent inhaler sticks to fill with your own EOs.  Very economical</li>
            <li> PERFECT for custom made inhalers for my family. Easy as pie to make and use. I made one with Calming synergy blend (Eden&#x27;s Garden) for my son whose nervous system can get the best of him sometimes, one with Alert synergy blend to help both my sons get through our home school day, I made all of them one with Breath Easy ... allergy / cold season. I have one with Peppermint to help me with headaches. Great great product! THANK YOU!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the small sz of the wick &amp; I don&#x27;t like the end cap. It&#x27;s too hard to remove because it doesn&#x27;t screw on, just pushes in. It&#x27;s hard to reopen to refill.</li>
            <li> quick delivery, great product</li>
            <li> Just started to created custom inhalers for family and friends. These are perfect for the job!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly and the inhalers are so easy to use.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the product.  Easy to use and the lids fit tightly.  I also used a sterile needle to puncture a few more holes in the internal cartridge so more oil would absorb.</li>
            <li> These are very easy to fill and use, and no bigger than a chapstick tube so they&#x27;re easy to take along anywhere.</li>
            <li> Great reasonable inhaler sticks. Easy to put oil on wick. I plan on having one for each of my favorite oil to get a quick shot when needed. Some for calming, some for colds, etc.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for on the go and not traveling with the glass bottles that essential oils come in. The tip has a round hole so you can add more oil through the top if you are careful. Someone also told me you could use a skewer to pop out the bottom plug to change the filter inside.  I am very pleased with the quality of these.</li>
            <li> Love these. Will definitely order again. Super value!</li>
            <li> Great product. Does the trick for what I need.</li>
            <li> This is my second order for inhalers. The quality is excellent. Delivery was fast. Cost is reasonable. Will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Product arrived as described and in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> These were great. I&#x27;ve already been using my essential oils in them. I&#x27;m not sure how long they&#x27;ll last yet (since I have no idea how to replace the wicks) but so far, so good.</li>
            <li> I put my aromatherapy scents in the inhaler sticks and it works great!  I have not had them long enough to see how long the scent will last. But 2 weeks and going strong.</li>
            <li> Always good to have and make your self...</li>
            <li> Medical Grade Plastic! Made in the USA! The only thing that could make these better is if I could buy them in BULK!?! Please mEssentials? Please?  I will be purchasing more and using often! These are wonderful. My new favorite thing.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what I wanted and delivery time was excellent.</li>
            <li> Perfect for making aromasticks!  I&#x27;ve used these to make &amp;#34;on-the-go&amp;#34; essential oil inhalers of some of my favorite blends.</li>
            <li> IT IS WHAT I WANTED AND SHIPPING WAS FAST.</li>
            <li> These work great and are reuseable if you don&#x27;t force the cap on flush. I leave cap about 1/8 inch out, stays on great, and have no problem removing cap with pliers to refill.</li>
            <li> These work perfectly for our essential oils.</li>
            <li> I love these inhalers. They&#x27;re much easier to replace the refill quick than the old ones were. I&#x27;ll definitely buy these again!</li>
            <li> Does the job and the price was good. I will order these again</li>
            <li> Just what I was hoping for to make some inhalers with essential oils.  They all look great.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality! Cotton inserts fit properly. I would oder this product again.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful for making personal aromatherapy products to carry with you. They fit perfectly in a pocket.</li>
            <li> These are a big hit in classes! #elementsherbalapothecary</li>
            <li> Got quickly and exactly as stated.  These are nice, sturdy pieces - not flimsy.</li>
            <li> The product is just as described and just what I was looking for.  Excellent</li>
            <li> I love the fact they are made in the USA and medical grade !!  Easy to use and amazing results !</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness came in a dirty zip lock bag that had a hole it.  The contents were spilled out of the bag and in the box.  And it only came with half the order 6 instead of 12.  Plus there was no hole of any type on the top of the inhaler - wonder how you could smell anything? I am so disappointed..</li>
            <li> The plug for these is at the bottom and presses in tightly. It makes it slightly harder to refill but I have found several of them that have gone thru the washer and come out completely sealed still. If you are using the same oil each time you can refill each one several times. My family and I use these for everything! We add peppermint oil and keep one in the car at all times. It&#x27;s perfect for motion sickness. My husband even used one to quit smoking!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using these to make my own inhalers.  There are so many of them in this set that I was able to make many different smelling inhalers!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping great product</li>
            <li> Bought these to make my own essential oil inhalers.  They work absolutely great!</li>
            <li> the actual product is fine, and works like it&#x27;s suppose to, but the packaging was odd.&lt;br /&gt;everything was in a off brand ziplock baggie and the baggie was severely scratched up and had odd stains on it. Almost as if it had been previously used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did buy some organic cotton swabs to replace the ones in the packaging because most cotton has lots of pesticides and I wanted this for a natural way to help my family during colds and allergy season.&lt;br /&gt;all those pesticides aren&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the quality of these inhaling sticks! They work very well with essential oils. I especially like it with peppermint to help clear the sinuses and start helping headaches.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> perfect for essential oils</li>
            <li> Great product; quick delivery!</li>
            <li> These are wonderful for essential oil blends that need to be inhaled, such as my migraine headache blend.  It lasts a good, long time if properly taken care of.  Good purchase and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I liked this item a lot. Packaged well too. Only one flaw, the stopper is such a good seal that it cannot be removed once it is plugged so it cannot be refilled. Otherwise it is a good quality item.</li>
            <li> I love being able to make my own nasal inhaler to take my oils with me. My favorite is my peppermint inhaler that help keep me awake since I have to get up earlier for my job. There are quite a few in the bag so I can make several to easily carry my oils without worrying about them leaking.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Easy to make essential oil inhalers. Great quality.</li>
            <li> I received only 12 inhalers.  I ordered 2 packs so should I have received 24</li>
            <li> Great inhalers.  As described.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Not as good as Vic&#x27;s vapor inhaler on the quality.  They work well. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> strong, single use aroma therapy breathers.</li>
            <li> Just what I&#x27;d been looking for.</li>
            <li> These are really solidly constructed and easy to use. I make sure not to over-saturate the wick so leaking doesn&#x27;t become a problem (I used 10-15 drops depending on the oil). My son and I love being able to take a whiff of our favorite oils whenever we like.</li>
            <li> These are just great. Very good buy for the price. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality for my essential oil blends. Fast shipping, and packaged carefully. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Simple, sanity and inexpensive!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, well made in the USA.  Have ordered 2x and will continue to order. Fast delivery</li>
            <li> I just received it this morning and I&#x27;ve already used one.  I added an essential oil and dried my clothes with awesome results.  Great product!!!</li>
            <li> Love being able to make inhalers!!!</li>
            <li> I never ordered these.</li>
