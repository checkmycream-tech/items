            <li>The color of the bronzer in the light/ med stick is nice but the product is so creamy...too creamy!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good if you&#x27;re always on the go.</li>

            <li>I love this stick.</li>
            <li>I bought this very excited to find an affordable contouring stick.</li>
            <li>I love how easy it is to carry this around...</li>
            <li>The highlighter side doesn&#x27;t look as as smooth as the contour side once blended into the skin, but it does the job just fine!</li>
            <li>My wife says it is very cool</li>
            <li>Buuut I still use it because it&#x27;s just so easy.</li>
            <li>With the Wonderstick, you can basically use any brush (I use the flat top contour brush from Real Techniques) and it just blends flawlessly.</li>
            <li>It works great, this is my first time using the stick method to contour and this made it so much easier.</li>
            <li>The color of the bronzer and highlighter are great and it does last</li>
            <li>You have to use a light hand when blending this or else</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking and looking for the perfect product to get that movie star contour, and who knew it was this Nyx product for less than $15?!</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the product overall, and the contour was nice.</li>
            <li>In her words &amp;#34;It&#x27;s not greasy, it&#x27;s easy to apply and it blends really well&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>when I first got this product I was extremely excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>I broke out on my cheek and side of my forehead, where I mostly highlighted and contoured, and I usually never break out in those places.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple, easy and quick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely buying her more stuff from NYX.</li>
            <li>Overall I love the idea,  but the lighter color leaves my skin looking a bit chalky and both ends</li>
            <li>plus it is very waxy!</li>
            <li>Definitely will buy more and have recommended it to all my friends.</li>
            <li>I guess the contouring color looked OK, but the highlight left a lot to be desired...</li>
            <li>I love this stick til the second time I used it it broke!</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of NYX and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>It really goes on smoothly, makes skin look even-toned and natural.</li>
            <li>Pretty much everything you DON&#x27;T want in a product.</li>
            <li>When I put it on, and started blending, it pretty much just smeared away or disappeared.</li>
            <li>For such a reasonably priced product this is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Not so much a review on the product but the way it arrived....</li>
            <li>Rip off much this retails for $11 just a warning people</li>
            <li>Even after all the blending the contrast was too much, my fianc&amp;eacute; said my face looked like a skeleton.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and my skin actually feels better while wearing it than not.</li>
            <li>It seems like a dark color, but when you put it on and blend it out, you realize you have to put a lot more.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t look natural at all!</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this little contour stick.</li>
            <li>My skin tone is beige, I wear bare minerals natural 05 complexion rescue.</li>
            <li>I opened it and the dark end of the stick fell right out of the tube.</li>
            <li>The dark isn&#x27;t too dark and the light doesn&#x27;t make you look too shiny.</li>

            <li> Never seemed to set and rubbed off my face all day long.</li>
            <li> Which didn&#x27;t really let me use this properly since it was broken..</li>
            <li> The contour tip is a bit too wide to use for the nose</li>
            <li> And I got it sooner than I expected!</li>
            <li> Buy in store instead because processing a whole return for just one small item is ridiculous...</li>
            <li> They appear dark but do not show up well at all.</li>
            <li> Even if you layer it just becomes a goopy mess on your face.</li>
            <li> It was just a little oily based when it goes on.</li>
            <li> but it did make my face a little oily where it was applied.</li>
            <li> But the next day, I found out I had broken out from the wonder stick.</li>
            <li> I disliked it as much as I disliked my smash box.</li>
            <li> She saw it at an Instagram tutorial account and she was really anxious to try it.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of my money!</li>
            <li> Satisfied, The highlighter doesn&#x27;t come on well and the Contour side comes on well but blends terribly, washes off when you blend.</li>
            <li> so you may need to use a small brush to apply for contouring the nose.</li>
            <li> The smash box kit was powder and really hard to blend.</li>
            <li> I usually use Nars or Mac bronzing powder to contour but despite spending hundreds (unfortunately) in brushes, I just could not get it to blend.</li>
            <li> but it was broken when I received it !</li>
            <li> I picked this up at Target after my Smashbox contour set disappointed me.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed...</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with the pigmentation of the colors.</li>
            <li> Broken!!!!</li>

            <li> I opened it and the dark end of the stick fell right out of the tube. The process of returning shipments from my country is a hassle. I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this highlight and contour for my girlfriend. She saw it at an Instagram tutorial account and she was really anxious to try it. In her words &amp;#34;It&#x27;s not greasy, it&#x27;s easy to apply and it blends really well&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m definitely buying her more stuff from NYX.</li>
            <li> Overall I love the idea,  but the lighter color leaves my skin looking a bit chalky and both ends make your face feel oily. Buuut I still use it because it&#x27;s just so easy.</li>
            <li> Not so much a review on the product but the way it arrived.... Broken!!!! Which didn&#x27;t really let me use this properly since it was broken.. Very disappointed... Buy in store instead because processing a whole return for just one small item is ridiculous...</li>
            <li> So blendable... Simple to apply and use.</li>
            <li> Contouring coverage was not the best.</li>
            <li> i just buy for my freind</li>
            <li> My wife says it is very cool</li>
            <li> Wow! This stuff blends like a dream! I&#x27;ve been looking and looking for the perfect product to get that movie star contour, and who knew it was this Nyx product for less than $15?! I usually use Nars or Mac bronzing powder to contour but despite spending hundreds (unfortunately) in brushes, I just could not get it to blend. With the Wonderstick, you can basically use any brush (I use the flat top contour brush from Real Techniques) and it just blends flawlessly. I wish I would have known about this sooner. Just try it, worst case scenario you&#x27;re out $15, but I promise you&#x27;ll love it :)</li>
            <li> I have an olive skin tone and this was to close to my skin tone to work plus it is very waxy! Doesn&#x27;t look natural at all!</li>
            <li> This was a great product for my 1st time trying contouring. Definitely will buy more and have recommended it to all my friends. Very easy to use and affordable.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for tan people! I bought this very excited to find an affordable contouring stick. I was very disappointed with the pigmentation of the colors. They appear dark but do not show up well at all. This was a waste of my money! If you have any sort of olive skin this will not work. Even if you layer it just becomes a goopy mess on your face.</li>
            <li> Pretty much everything you DON&#x27;T want in a product. Never seemed to set and rubbed off my face all day long. I guess the contouring color looked OK, but the highlight left a lot to be desired... Like actual highlighting.</li>
            <li> The highlighter was fallin off. It&#x27;s was smeared on the lid .</li>
            <li> when I first got this product I was extremely excited to try it out. When I put it on, and started blending, it pretty much just smeared away or disappeared. It seems like a dark color, but when you put it on and blend it out, you realize you have to put a lot more. But the next day, I found out I had broken out from the wonder stick. I broke out on my cheek and side of my forehead, where I mostly highlighted and contoured, and I usually never break out in those places. I would have given it 1 star, but because I liked the end result, I would give it a 2.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my friend who is a beauty blogger had purchased it and gave great reviews. I though I would try it out and it actually has worked well for me too.</li>
            <li> It works great, this is my first time using the stick method to contour and this made it so much easier. Great results as well. It was just a little oily based when it goes on.</li>
            <li> I love this stick til the second time I used it it broke! Won&#x27;t buy again! out $15.00 for nothing! Made cheap!</li>
            <li> great product but it was broken when I received it !</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and works great. Does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> Rip off much this retails for $11 just a warning people the product itself is great</li>
            <li> This is good but not that great. I love how easy it is to carry this around... It&#x27;s good if you&#x27;re always on the go. Would I repurchase? Yeah but I&#x27;m still searching for the perfect contour stick/palette.</li>
            <li> I LOVE my contour stick! It goes on like a cream. Great for a beginner like me!</li>
            <li> Satisfied, The highlighter doesn&#x27;t come on well and the Contour side comes on well but blends terribly, washes off when you blend.</li>
            <li> Good Product , I would recommend .&lt;br /&gt;Came in on time .&lt;br /&gt;No defects .</li>
            <li> For such a reasonably priced product this is fabulous.  I have sensitive skin and my skin actually feels better while wearing it than not. It really goes on smoothly, makes skin look even-toned and natural. The fact that you can also highlight and contour with this is just the icing on the cake. I am a big fan of NYX and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> The color of the bronzer and highlighter are great and it does last but it did make my face a little oily where it was applied. Would definitely keep powder on hand when wearing this. But overall a great product for a good price! And I got it sooner than I expected! It shipped the day I ordered it!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, I would recommend for beginner contour-ers.</li>
            <li> The highlighter side doesn&#x27;t look as as smooth as the contour side once blended into the skin, but it does the job just fine! The contour tip is a bit too wide to use for the nose so you may need to use a small brush to apply for contouring the nose.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this on amazon, I did find it at target however. I really enjoyed the product overall, and the contour was nice. I would buy it at your local target however, as I saved a lot of money on the product.</li>
            <li> This product is like contour on a stick and is so portable. I loved this xxx</li>
            <li> I picked this up at Target after my Smashbox contour set disappointed me. I really enjoy this little contour stick. It&#x27;s simple, easy and quick. It has the two basic colors you need to contour. One thing that I love about it is that it is a cream. The smash box kit was powder and really hard to blend. Even after all the blending the contrast was too much, my fianc&amp;eacute; said my face looked like a skeleton. I decided to go with cream instead of powder but didn&#x27;t want to get one of the pricy ones in case I disliked it as much as I disliked my smash box. I love this stick. I have the WS04 Universal Color. My skin tone is beige, I wear bare minerals natural 05 complexion rescue. The dark isn&#x27;t too dark and the light doesn&#x27;t make you look too shiny. If you do want shine go over the highlight with pop of champagne highlighter. I blend this with a concealer brush, not my fingers.  Just a tip I&#x27;ve been a contour research junkie and Jaclyn Hill is the best YouTube tutorial I have found.</li>
            <li> The color of the bronzer in the light/ med stick is nice but the product is so creamy...too creamy! You have to use a light hand when blending this or else it blends away into nothing. It also needs to be set with a powder because I noticed it never fully dries its stays the texture of a moisturizer.</li>
