            <li>The product arrived promptly, neatly packaged, and it&#x27;s a great shaving foam.</li>
            <li>and so great to get it at this great price.  </li>
            <li>Great shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizing on the face and neck.  </li>
            <li>Gillette Foamy Shaving Cream is reliable and amazing!  </li>
            <li>Good value on a great product.</li>
            <li>The price of the 12 pack was too good to pass up.</li>
            <li>Provides good shave without irritation.</li>
            <li>This is a good buy.</li>
            <li>Gillette foam is particularly good.</li>
            <li>and it comes at a good price.</li>
            <li>Great price for so many.</li>
            <li>Lather holds up and blade slides over face nicely.  </li>
            <li>so I bought a greater quantity here for a good price.</li>
            <li>This is my kind of shaving cream.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, this shaving cream is an excellent shaving cream and is a good price here at Amazon.com</li>
            <li>Great, rich shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>so if you want a good Quick Shave with a blade then this may be a good way to go.  </li>
            <li>, Sensitive is the best shaving cream out there.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, really a very fine product.</li>
            <li>Makes for a very comfortable and close shave.</li>
            <li>Very smooth shave</li>
            <li>Glad to see this as a Prime item.</li>
            <li>So, indeed, I love it, but I&#x27;m biased.     </li>
            <li>I still love it though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this shave cream for many years.  </li>
            <li>I love this and have been using it for years to shave my legs.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>If you can get passed that, its a great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>This is simply the best shaving cream on the market!</li>
            <li>Thanks go to Amazon for a great bulk purchase&lt;br /&gt;price.</li>
            <li>and my wife loves it touching my chin</li>
            <li>I just love it and use it all the time.  </li>
            <li>and it works pretty good</li>
            <li>I just used a razor for the first time today along with this cream, and it keeps my face well hydrated for a very comfortable shave!</li>
            <li>No to tell the truth it DOESNT shave as good or as close as Musgo Real or Proraso</li>
            <li>This stuff hands down is the best chaving cream I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I use this shaving cream on my entire body with the Gillette Fusion Manual Men&#x27;s Razor Blades and they work great together for smooth shave with no irritation or bleeding.  </li>
            <li>Tons of shaving cream, worked out to between $3 and $4 a can with free shipping.  </li>
            <li>B0013L7GP2 Gillette Foamy Regular]] to great satisfaction.</li>
            <li>The scent went nicely with my Every Man Jack aftershave cooling gel (you can really get the Christmas scents going).     </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and foamy and helps my razor glide along my legs and body to prevent nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li>Clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>I prefer the cream instead of gel because I find the gel clogs my mach 3 blades &amp; either need a brush or a lot of water to clean it.</li>
            <li>Gillette foamy solves the problem saves water no need for a brush to clean the razor.</li>
            <li>The hair just comes right off!</li>
            <li>As far as it goes for arts, crafts, and kid stuff, it&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li>The shave that it helps achieve is just as good as the regular cream.  </li>
            <li>It lubricates well, washes off easily, and doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel funny.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s really awesome is that if you were to buy a 12-pack of this stuff, it quite possibly could last you literally *years</li>
            <li>I can say for me personally, owning 12 bottles of shaving cream would probably last me over 15 years, seriously (especially a top notch brand like Gillette).  </li>
            <li>I used Old Spice Shave Creams for many years because they gave me a clean cool aromatic shave.</li>
            <li>It is great for when you need a quick shave and don&#x27;t have the time to mess with soaps or creams.</li>
            <li>Works great - less nicks.</li>
            <li>Not sure what I can say, it&#x27;s good shaving cream!</li>
            <li>So much easier to apply that the gel stuff and the bottle seems to last a good while.  </li>
            <li>I bought a case of this stuff (about a years worth) for myself.</li>
            <li>Still, I kept using it because the price was right</li>
            <li>That smell punched me right in the face; it was the smell that used to waft up from the sink when my dad would shave</li>
            <li>Gets the job done right.</li>
            <li>Price was right on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This works fine, doesn&#x27;t smell and rinses off completely.  </li>
            <li>The hot water steaming upwards, carrying with it the scent of his shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say the same about razor blades, that&#x27;s for sure.  </li>
            <li>This cream is the best; I buy it by the dozen here because it&#x27;s hard to find locally now; everybody seems to be going for that fragrant garbage.</li>
            <li>The ONLY decent shaving cream I have been able to find that doesn&#x27;t have so much added fragrance it makes me choke.</li>
            <li>although i dont shave every single day, more like once every 2 or 3 days.</li>
            <li>Bought in large quantity</li>
            <li>now I have a can ready for whenever I need it.</li>
            <li>I believe the moisturizers in this shave cream really do work.</li>
            <li>I really like quantity of sh ha aveing cream</li>
            <li>Its thick and lathery and smells good too.</li>
            <li>I use a blade comfortably for twice as long.</li>
            <li>but i got lucky getting mine at the local Dollar Store on sale tho</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s the best so far of all the Foams I&#x27;ve tried and while it&#x27;s not barber shop quality its not far behind</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>On a whim, I bought this twelve pack for &#x27;sensitive&#x27; skin purely based on the price.  </li>
            <li>but i shave my face and my chest with this, less cuts, less irritation, great product.</li>
            <li>Gillette for sensitive skin really works well.</li>
            <li>Trying to find an alternate shave cream proved enlightening.</li>
            <li>was sitting right next to it.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it I had white blister like bumps  on my face and neck.</li>
            <li>The kids were thrilled; I was overwhelmed by the scent - but that was an ENTIRE can dispensed in a small room over the course of two 15-minute baths.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even sure if shaving cream would last 15 years, but hey, it&#x27;d at least mean I&#x27;m secure for a long stretch without having to worry about buying more.  </li>
            <li>Let me be clear: we use this 99% of the time as a sensory-activity material.  </li>
            <li>i have sensitive skin and this shave gel works wonders.</li>
            <li>I got to the store and this Sensitive formulation foam</li>
            <li>Its for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have been using this Gillette Foamy Shave Cream for years because I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Then Old Spice stopped making shave cream.</li>
            <li>It actually gave me a few more shaves out of my razors.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the foamy shaving cream for my face but find it works for cleaning up other areas of the body, such as the back of the neck.</li>
            <li>As expected, order came properly and quickly.</li>
            <li>Worth the money and use less.</li>
            <li>The old routine of shaving will be your momentary escape from the present.  </li>
            <li>I use double edge safety razors rather than cartridges and I still frequently use this product.</li>
            <li>My personal choice of shave creams is now Gillette for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My last can of the regular was running out, so I was going to pick up a new can.     </li>
            <li>In fact, I used older razors that I had used and were dull on my first shave to try out this cream.</li>
            <li>I read other reviews and those that give this high marks were correct, assuming that it keeps!  </li>
            <li>Leaves fsce feeling smooth without little cuts other shaving creams can leave you with.</li>
            <li>The smell, no matter how fantastic it is to me, is fairly faint but lingers, and it could be judged by some younger people as smelling too much like something their grandpa would wear.</li>
            <li>So close the bathroom door, stream some 50&#x27;s music on your iPhone, lather up your face with this thick, rich, and fragrant cream, and let your bathroom become a time machine that brings back memories you didn&#x27;t know existed.  </li>

            <li> So close the bathroom door, stream some 50&#x27;s music on your iPhone, lather up your face with this thick, rich, and fragrant cream, and let your bathroom become a time machine that brings back memories you didn&#x27;t know existed.  </li>
            <li> It works every single time I use it.  </li>
            <li> im only half way through my container and its been 2.5 months.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t need or want expensive shaving creams.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it has a slightly odd smell.  </li>
            <li> It lubricated well, though that manly stubble I always dreamed of is, in reality, about half as dense as I&#x27;d wished it to be.    </li>
            <li> I ordered this for I tire of purchasing a can every few months.</li>
            <li> It never &amp;#34;goes bad&amp;#34; so I&#x27;ll just store it and use it for oh a few years or so!  </li>
            <li> I shave approximately every 4-5 days and use very little each time.  </li>
            <li> I got tired of repeatedly purchasing this</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this shaving cream for its nostalgic value, but every time I shave with this cream, I think of Dad.  </li>
            <li> That was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Very dangerous product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> my hubby loves this cream so i bought the case so he never runs out!</li>
            <li> I read other reviews and those that give this high marks were correct, assuming that it keeps!  Only drawback is having to purchase a dozen at a time.  Otherwise, really a very fine product.</li>
            <li> Great, rich shaving cream.  Glad to see this as a Prime item.</li>
            <li> I just used a razor for the first time today along with this cream, and it keeps my face well hydrated for a very comfortable shave! The hair just comes right off! And the smell is awesome, almost like an aftershave smell! Didn&#x27;t get any cuts or nicks or anything!</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this Item to make a craft project.  It was a great price, and came on time.</li>
            <li> Tons of shaving cream, worked out to between $3 and $4 a can with free shipping.  Excellent as always.</li>
            <li> i have sensitive skin and this shave gel works wonders. each container lasts forever to. im only half way through my container and its been 2.5 months. although i dont shave every single day, more like once every 2 or 3 days. but i shave my face and my chest with this, less cuts, less irritation, great product. would recommend.</li>
            <li> Everything came as advertised and on time.</li>
            <li> Great Deal! I prefer the cream instead of gel because I find the gel clogs my mach 3 blades &amp; either need a brush or a lot of water to clean it. Gillette foamy solves the problem saves water no need for a brush to clean the razor.</li>
            <li> Ah, the days of boyhood. Looking up at your dad or grandpa, admiring the skill with which he wields the razor. The hot water steaming upwards, carrying with it the scent of his shaving cream. Brings back memories, huh?    Well, for over a year now I&#x27;d been using [[ASIN:B0013L7GP2 Gillette Foamy Regular]] to great satisfaction. It smells spicy--think Christmas--and lubricates the blade well. The scent went nicely with my Every Man Jack aftershave cooling gel (you can really get the Christmas scents going).     But I always had one gripe about the Regular formula Gillette Foam: the burn.    I haven&#x27;t figured out why, but it burned my skin. I have eczema, so shaving burns anyways, but phew. Still, I kept using it because the price was right and I don&#x27;t like the gels. My last can of the regular was running out, so I was going to pick up a new can.     I got to the store and this Sensitive formulation foam was sitting right next to it. I figure \\&quot;what the heck, I&#x27;ll give it a shot.\\&quot;    Well, I just got back from using it and holy tacos, Batman. That smell punched me right in the face; it was the smell that used to waft up from the sink when my dad would shave and I&#x27;d look on, wishing I had some manly stubble to demolish with a miniature axe.     So, indeed, I love it, but I&#x27;m biased.     Impartially I can say that it goes on smoother and seems thicker overall than the regular formulation, and instead of burning my skin it cooled it. It lubricated well, though that manly stubble I always dreamed of is, in reality, about half as dense as I&#x27;d wished it to be.    All in all I can definitely recommend this.     One thought though. The smell, no matter how fantastic it is to me, is fairly faint but lingers, and it could be judged by some younger people as smelling too much like something their grandpa would wear. I still love it though.</li>
            <li> The ONLY decent shaving cream I have been able to find that doesn&#x27;t have so much added fragrance it makes me choke. I prefer creams to gels because gels gum up my razor. This cream is the best; I buy it by the dozen here because it&#x27;s hard to find locally now; everybody seems to be going for that fragrant garbage.</li>
            <li> Just what my underarms needed!  This is a great product and have reordered from this company before.  Rapid delivery!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love the foamy shaving cream for my face but find it works for cleaning up other areas of the body, such as the back of the neck.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t be out for years!!</li>
            <li> The price of the 12 pack was too good to pass up. I won&#x27;t need shaving foam for a couple years. The product arrived promptly, neatly packaged, and it&#x27;s a great shaving foam.</li>
            <li> Yeah I just tried a can and it works pretty good but i got lucky getting mine at the local Dollar Store on sale tho I prefer to buy from Amazon when i can.  No to tell the truth it DOESNT shave as good or as close as Musgo Real or Proraso but it&#x27;s the best so far of all the Foams I&#x27;ve tried and while it&#x27;s not barber shop quality its not far behind so if you want a good Quick Shave with a blade then this may be a good way to go.  OH yeah to the guys who griped about the price.  Either buy the 12 packs from Amazon or wait for a sale at your local Dollar Store!.  Yeah I used to gripe too until I learned to watch for the discount sales and from then on I became a power buyer.  Believe me it works.....</li>
            <li> Lather holds up and blade slides over face nicely.  My wife also loves it for her legs.  Bought in large quantity so I won&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shave cream for many years.  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Oh yeah, this is the best stuff... and so great to get it at this great price.  It never &amp;#34;goes bad&amp;#34; so I&#x27;ll just store it and use it for oh a few years or so!  Yay!</li>
            <li> This product can cause skin conditins that cause bumps on face and neck. I have a deformation under my left nostril as a result of using this product. The first time I tried it I had white blister like bumps  on my face and neck. I thought it was a fluke. The second. time the blisters were so severe that it left an indentation under my left nostril. I thiught of having plastic surgery. Thank God I had treated it correctly (by drying out the blister) so that when the blister popped the undentatioon it left was just a step ,below having surgery. Very dangerous product. Please try something else. Don&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Provides good shave without irritation. Leaves fsce feeling smooth without little cuts other shaving creams can leave you with. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this and have been using it for years to shave my legs. Its for sensitive skin so you won&#x27;t feel the stinging as with some of them. I got tired of repeatedly purchasing this so I bought a greater quantity here for a good price.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this shaving cream for its nostalgic value, but every time I shave with this cream, I think of Dad.  This is what guys used for shaving before all the fancy gels with newfangled smells.  So close the bathroom door, stream some 50&#x27;s music on your iPhone, lather up your face with this thick, rich, and fragrant cream, and let your bathroom become a time machine that brings back memories you didn&#x27;t know existed.  The old routine of shaving will be your momentary escape from the present.  It&#x27;s like aromatherapy, man style.  Then go about your day, knowing that you get to do it all over again tomorrow.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of creams and gels and foams and this is the best.  I use a blade comfortably for twice as long.</li>
            <li> I am used to Gillette Foamy Shave Cream.  I have used it for three years now and I love it.  On a whim, I bought this twelve pack for &#x27;sensitive&#x27; skin purely based on the price.  The shave that it helps achieve is just as good as the regular cream.  My only complaint is that it has a slightly odd smell.  If you can get passed that, its a great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> As expected, order came properly and quickly.</li>
            <li> This is simply the best shaving cream on the market! Thanks go to Amazon for a great bulk purchase&lt;br /&gt;price.</li>
            <li> Great shaving cream. Great price for so many. Works great - less nicks.</li>
            <li> This stuff hands down is the best chaving cream I have ever used.  So much easier to apply that the gel stuff and the bottle seems to last a good while.  This comibed with the mach 3 turbo is the best shave you can get.  It never leaves me with razor burn.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent. It lubricates well, washes off easily, and doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel funny. I use double edge safety razors rather than cartridges and I still frequently use this product. It is great for when you need a quick shave and don&#x27;t have the time to mess with soaps or creams.</li>
            <li> Good value on a great product.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizing on the face and neck.  Makes for a very comfortable and close shave.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for I tire of purchasing a can every few months. now I have a can ready for whenever I need it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful item. Clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> Golly Suzam. This is my kind of shaving cream. Very smooth shave and my wife loves it touching my chin</li>
            <li> I have been using this Gillette Foamy Shave Cream for years because I have sensitive skin.  It goes on smooth and foamy and helps my razor glide along my legs and body to prevent nicks and cuts.  I use this shaving cream on my entire body with the Gillette Fusion Manual Men&#x27;s Razor Blades and they work great together for smooth shave with no irritation or bleeding.  If you have sensitive skin, this shaving cream is an excellent shaving cream and is a good price here at Amazon.com</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised</li>
            <li> This is a good buy. If you were to buy this at the store, they would charge you $5 a can.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a foam shaver. Not a fan of the gels at all. Gillette foam is particularly good. Its thick and lathery and smells good too. I bought a case of this stuff (about a years worth) for myself. For the price on amazon with.free shipping, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> like buying by the case</li>
            <li> Let me be clear: we use this 99% of the time as a sensory-activity material.  As far as it goes for arts, crafts, and kid stuff, it&#x27;s amazing.  As for shaving, my husband says &amp;#34;he can&#x27;t think of a thing shaving cream is supposed to do that it doesn&#x27;t do&amp;#34;.  We did use it once as a bath-time-fun material when we were out of bubble bath.  The kids were thrilled; I was overwhelmed by the scent - but that was an ENTIRE can dispensed in a small room over the course of two 15-minute baths.</li>
            <li> My personal choice of shave creams is now Gillette for sensitive skin. I used Old Spice Shave Creams for many years because they gave me a clean cool aromatic shave. Then Old Spice stopped making shave cream. That was a disappointment. Trying to find an alternate shave cream proved enlightening. Some of the shave creams on the market did not moisten my beard enough. I was dumbfounded by that. It has taken me quite a while to find a shave cream that I like and gets the job done. Gillette for sensitive skin really works well. In fact, I used older razors that I had used and were dull on my first shave to try out this cream. It actually gave me a few more shaves out of my razors. I believe the moisturizers in this shave cream really do work. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I really like quantity of sh ha aveing cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to use this for...SHAVING CREAM BATTLE!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Not sure what I can say, it&#x27;s good shaving cream! Gets the job done right. Price was right on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t need or want expensive shaving creams.  This works fine, doesn&#x27;t smell and rinses off completely.  All I needed and it comes at a good price.</li>
            <li> Gillette Foamy Shaving Cream is reliable and amazing!  It works every single time I use it.  I can&#x27;t say the same about razor blades, that&#x27;s for sure.  What&#x27;s really awesome is that if you were to buy a 12-pack of this stuff, it quite possibly could last you literally *years* (assuming you use all 12 bottles on yourself).  I can say for me personally, owning 12 bottles of shaving cream would probably last me over 15 years, seriously (especially a top notch brand like Gillette).  I shave approximately every 4-5 days and use very little each time.  I&#x27;m not even sure if shaving cream would last 15 years, but hey, it&#x27;d at least mean I&#x27;m secure for a long stretch without having to worry about buying more.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Gillette Foamy shave cream, Sensitive is the best shaving cream out there.  I just love it and use it all the time.  You don&#x27;t need to use a lot to make the lather work.  Worth the money and use less.</li>
