            <li>I also love the refreshing scent.</li>

            <li>This stuff sure looks fancy in the washroom.</li>
            <li>Does anyone know how many ounces are in this jar?</li>
            <li>I would love to continue using this, but there&#x27;s no way I can afford it.  </li>
            <li>I chose this product because I was looking for a moisturizer and when I received it wasn&#x27;t too sure</li>
            <li>The packaging is alluring and I&#x27;m feeling beckoned to use just a tad more throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Often touching my face in disbelief.</li>
            <li>I refused to deal with more and more wrinkles over the years and started trying products.</li>
            <li>Thank you for making such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels after applying</li>
            <li>It makes my skin more even and youthful looking.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>So when I was offered this Anti-Aging Skin Whitening Glutathione Cream from Omiera Labs for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered one.</li>
            <li>(if anyone out there can suggest something more economical I&#x27;d appreciate it!)</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in my skin very quickly.  </li>
            <li>From the very first time that I used it I could see and FEEL a difference in my skin!</li>
            <li>A light amber colored serum, it glides on your face smoothly.</li>
            <li>the cream is light</li>
            <li>The ingredients are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I use it twice a day and it leaves my skin feeling smooth, non oily and radiant.  </li>
            <li>This is SO light on my face</li>
            <li>I have instantly fallen in love with this product!!</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE would highly recommend</li>
            <li>My skin felt bright, 20 years younger and softer than a babies bottom.</li>
            <li>just  it makes my mom&#x27;s face look fresh and smooth</li>
            <li>i have used several different face creams and this one works best for me.  </li>
            <li>But the product is extraordinary.  </li>
            <li>Because I  am a tester means I love new product I love to try new things..</li>
            <li>Worth buying</li>
            <li>cream is well worth the investment.  </li>
            <li>the cream is a bit pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>I have only used it for a couple of days and so far my skin looks and feels great</li>
            <li>It is better whitening cream I have been using so far.</li>
            <li>I caved into purchasing Glocione and it was worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Like most people, I was completely overwhelmed with the amount of anti-wrinkle stuff out there when I decided it was time to start looking.  </li>
            <li>This is really Great for Facial Moisturizer helped my skin healthy and fading the dark spots</li>
            <li>it just makes my skin feel smooth and super soft</li>
            <li>Me and my mother are in love with this product and what it is doing to mak us feel and look younger.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I can actually feel it working when I put it on.</li>
            <li>After using first jar I saw a difference.  </li>
            <li>This cream does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>I always wear foundation &amp; after  the first jar of Glocione</li>
            <li>I really could go without!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much cheaper than botox!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now dedicated to this business as much as I&#x27;m dedicated to being a Wonder Mom!</li>
            <li>I saw a difference in my skin within the first week.  </li>
            <li>As I am aging I am becoming very self conscious of my wrinkles.</li>
            <li>the first, one thing I noticed since I started using this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>Once I started using it, I instantly fell in love.</li>
            <li>Fine lines look better, dark spots have nearly disappeared, and large pores have been hugely reduced or even disappeared.  </li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t even used one fourth of this cream so it will definitely last me a good while.</li>
            <li>Working perfect so far after only a few days.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to anyone else struggling to find the right cream, as I was.</li>
            <li>I had given up on drugstore and department store products, and finally decided one more time, to try a new product, but this time something higher end.</li>
            <li>First it has a light smell I do not entirely care for but would rather have that than a chemical scent to mask it.</li>
            <li>Decided to try Glocione, expecting it to be only mildly successful like a lot of other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>so it definitely helps out with my fine lines.  </li>
            <li>My face is so much brighter and</li>
            <li>Glocione cream is lightening the discolorations in an even and gentle way.  </li>
            <li>I have tried every product from target to nordstrom , nothing really works.</li>
            <li>Sincerely, Very suspicious.</li>
            <li>I decided to just go with the trial and error method of doing things, because really, what works for my friend&#x27;s skin might not for mine.  </li>
            <li>Because I don&#x27;t have that kind of money to waste &amp; 2)</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m just saying this as a honest effect on me base on my experienced.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that this is anti-wrinkle because I&#x27;m getting to the age where I&#x27;m starting to look worn and old.</li>
            <li>but if they can find a way to thicken this stuff up naturally and ease up on the high price, it would be a five star and worth buying over and over.</li>
            <li>It is everything it claims ,I have never seen such positive results with any other lotion,I love it!</li>
            <li>I have lived in Hawaii in the sun for more than half my life.</li>
            <li>I really was surprised by this product!</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>There are nice organics out there with claims to do the same and cost far less.</li>
            <li>However, the second jar was cheaper in price that the first and there was no&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product actually works I have tried many others and this is the only one i found to actually give results.</li>
            <li>Was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>Smoother more even skin tone within a week, plumps up lines within a few weeks!</li>
            <li>Its not bad to try differents kinds of products but read carefully before applying it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much smoother and the fine lines and dark spots have definitely been reduced.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is kind of small and combined with the runny consistency of the product itself, I could only give it four stars.</li>
            <li>so I have been putting this Filler directly on those areas.</li>
            <li>So far I like this cream.</li>
            <li>and I can really see the youth coming back to my face.  </li>
            <li>I have tried SO many anti-aging products over the last few years, and I have wasted a lot of money that could have been better spent elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I love my skin tone, but I recently noticed that with age, the skin on my face was getting dull and darker than the rest of my body.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a difference after 2 weeks my dark circles, acne scars and freckles aren&#x27;t as noticeable as they use to be and it brighten my skin right away</li>
            <li>I bought another, but a little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t worry if you can&#x27;t afford a second bottle anytime soon. :)</li>
            <li>It helps lift my dark circle from night feeding as well ;)</li>
            <li>Honestly I&#x27;m kind of sad.  </li>
            <li>It also felt slightly greasy when first applying but that does not remain once rubbed in like the cheaper stuff from mainstream products.</li>
            <li>Had read all the kudos from other buyers and haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference in lines disappearing or any whitening.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d tried a couple of other products with limited degrees of success.  </li>
            <li>Upon first use, I noticed it seemed a little runny for a cream</li>
            <li>my acne dark spot not whitening the whole face where you apply</li>
            <li>Initially, I never expected to purchase it regularly because it was a tad pricey for a teacher.  </li>
            <li>I have had trouble in the past finding a product because there are so many.</li>

            <li> Decided to try Glocione, expecting it to be only mildly successful like a lot of other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> so it definitely helps out with my fine lines.  </li>
            <li> My face is so much brighter and</li>
            <li> Glocione cream is lightening the discolorations in an even and gentle way.  </li>
            <li> I have tried every product from target to nordstrom , nothing really works.</li>
            <li> Sincerely, Very suspicious.</li>
            <li> I decided to just go with the trial and error method of doing things, because really, what works for my friend&#x27;s skin might not for mine.  </li>
            <li> Because I don&#x27;t have that kind of money to waste &amp; 2)</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m just saying this as a honest effect on me base on my experienced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that this is anti-wrinkle because I&#x27;m getting to the age where I&#x27;m starting to look worn and old.</li>
            <li> but if they can find a way to thicken this stuff up naturally and ease up on the high price, it would be a five star and worth buying over and over.</li>
            <li> It is everything it claims ,I have never seen such positive results with any other lotion,I love it!</li>
            <li> I have lived in Hawaii in the sun for more than half my life.</li>
            <li> I really was surprised by this product!</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> There are nice organics out there with claims to do the same and cost far less.</li>
            <li> However, the second jar was cheaper in price that the first and there was no&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product actually works I have tried many others and this is the only one i found to actually give results.</li>
            <li> Was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> Smoother more even skin tone within a week, plumps up lines within a few weeks!</li>
            <li> Its not bad to try differents kinds of products but read carefully before applying it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much smoother and the fine lines and dark spots have definitely been reduced.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is kind of small and combined with the runny consistency of the product itself, I could only give it four stars.</li>
            <li> so I have been putting this Filler directly on those areas.</li>
            <li> So far I like this cream.</li>
            <li> and I can really see the youth coming back to my face.  </li>
            <li> I have tried SO many anti-aging products over the last few years, and I have wasted a lot of money that could have been better spent elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I love my skin tone, but I recently noticed that with age, the skin on my face was getting dull and darker than the rest of my body.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after 2 weeks my dark circles, acne scars and freckles aren&#x27;t as noticeable as they use to be and it brighten my skin right away</li>
            <li> I bought another, but a little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t worry if you can&#x27;t afford a second bottle anytime soon. :)</li>
            <li> It helps lift my dark circle from night feeding as well ;)</li>
            <li> Honestly I&#x27;m kind of sad.  </li>
            <li> It also felt slightly greasy when first applying but that does not remain once rubbed in like the cheaper stuff from mainstream products.</li>
            <li> Had read all the kudos from other buyers and haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference in lines disappearing or any whitening.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried a couple of other products with limited degrees of success.  </li>
            <li> Upon first use, I noticed it seemed a little runny for a cream</li>
            <li> my acne dark spot not whitening the whole face where you apply</li>
            <li> Initially, I never expected to purchase it regularly because it was a tad pricey for a teacher.  </li>
            <li> I have had trouble in the past finding a product because there are so many.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying this cream for as long as I can!</li>
            <li> goes a long way I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks</li>
            <li> My dark spots are definitely fading and my chest wrinkles are also less apparent.</li>
            <li> My skin looked much younger and softer,with less wrinkles.</li>
            <li> My intent for this was to take the face back in time a little</li>
            <li> I have a very greasy face and it&#x27;s hard for me to find a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
            <li> I wish it came in a larger size, so I wouldn&#x27;t have to buy so often, but that&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> After a month of use, my face is now only one shade darker, which means that I should be fully evened out within a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> It has only been a few days, but I feel like I already notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I used generic products hoping to save money, but it was almost a waste of money because they did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> But so far everything I&#x27;ve tried only makes my skin worse.  </li>
            <li> I hesitated for quite a while due to the price for 1 oz.  </li>
            <li> I have combo skin to the extreme - oily areas and scaly areas...</li>
            <li> Check out their other products at omieralabs.com</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t have a bad or strong smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of products to help fade dark spots on my face, and have spent a little to a lot on those products.</li>
            <li> It is tightening and making my skin look and feel 10 years younger at least.</li>
            <li> I got this cream because I have hyperpigmentation ,dark circles, acne scars and freckles</li>
            <li> I do not have any spots or dark circles</li>
            <li> Will look for another product to correct the Dark Spots.</li>
            <li> My oily spots have toned down and my scaly spots are moisturized.  </li>
            <li> have dark caramel brown skin, and I am typically scared of using bleaching creams.  </li>
            <li> but the content is only enough for 2 wks.  too expensive.</li>
            <li> While waiting for mine to come in the mail (about a month and a half after I bought it for her, I purchased it for myself)</li>
            <li> No light and dark blotches--just evenly brightening of the skin</li>
            <li> I have a few dark spots on my face that annoy me</li>
            <li> Maybe only just the part where dark cause by unhealthy part on the skin.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t like creams that make my skin look or feel oily a little bit of this cream</li>
            <li> but I can say it does help a little with the skin itself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a few days now and noticed a few things.</li>
            <li> However, after buying the trial size and realized that I could see small results in as little as 7 days, I decided to take the plunge and buy the full-size 1 oz jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> In as little as a week&#x27;s time I was already noticing a difference!</li>
            <li> ; prior to my period (sorry TMI).  </li>
            <li> This has an overpowering smell and way too expensive for me based on having no results in three days.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical when told about this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying this to bragging the product or saying bad thing..</li>
            <li> Well..not bad atleast</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Did not work for me!  Disappointed!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical when told about this but now I am a convert! It is everything it claims ,I have never seen such positive results with any other lotion,I love it!</li>
            <li> I like this product, it worked well on my skin, the only problem is costly</li>
            <li> Product just as described! Working perfect so far after only a few days. Me and my mother are in love with this product and what it is doing to mak us feel and look younger. It is tightening and making my skin look and feel 10 years younger at least. LOVE LOVE would highly recommend</li>
            <li> I have instantly fallen in love with this product!! From the very first time that I used it I could see and FEEL a difference in my skin! A light amber colored serum, it glides on your face smoothly. It only takes 2 pumps to cover my entire face and neck, so this bottle will last a while! I love the fact that I can actually feel it working when I put it on. In addition, it has a very pleasant scent, not chemically like many of the super effective moisturizers have. What a great promotion to have been a part of. Omiera Labs have definitely gained a lifetime user in me!</li>
            <li> I really was surprised by this product! I have tried SO many anti-aging products over the last few years, and I have wasted a lot of money that could have been better spent elsewhere. I had given up on drugstore and department store products, and finally decided one more time, to try a new product, but this time something higher end. I am really glad I chose Glocione! My fine lines have dramatically improved, and my age spots are fading nicely, my skin just looks so much better over all. I am really pleased with this product, and would recommend it to anyone fighting aging!</li>
            <li> After using first jar I saw a difference.  However, the second jar was cheaper in price that the first and there was no&lt;br /&gt;noticeable difference on my face.  Maybe the price mattered!!!!</li>
            <li> The best anti going ever. Worth buying just  it makes my mom&#x27;s face look fresh and smooth she&#x27;s loving it a lot.</li>
            <li> I am very happy I purchased this cream.  I hesitated for quite a while due to the price for 1 oz.  However, after buying the trial size and realized that I could see small results in as little as 7 days, I decided to take the plunge and buy the full-size 1 oz jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dark caramel brown skin, and I am typically scared of using bleaching creams.  I love my skin tone, but I recently noticed that with age, the skin on my face was getting dull and darker than the rest of my body.  Before I started using this cream, my face was two shades darker than my neck and chest.  After a month of use, my face is now only one shade darker, which means that I should be fully evened out within a few weeks.  I am happy with the results.  My face is so much brighter and the texture of my skin is smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Glocione cream is lightening the discolorations in an even and gentle way.  No light and dark blotches--just evenly brightening of the skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is well worth the investment.  I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works amazingly and I am very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this cream again.</li>
            <li> I got this cream because I have hyperpigmentation ,dark circles, acne scars and freckles the cream is a bit pricey but worth it. This cream does exactly what it says it does. I just loves it! The container this cream comes in is very nice the cream is light it doesn&#x27;t have a bad or strong smell and it&#x27;s not oily at all I have combination skin so I don&#x27;t like creams that make my skin look or feel oily a little bit of this cream goes a long way I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks and I haven&#x27;t even used one fourth of this cream so it will definitely last me a good while. I noticed a difference after 2 weeks my dark circles, acne scars and freckles aren&#x27;t as noticeable as they use to be and it brighten my skin right away it just makes my skin feel smooth and super soft it&#x27;s great I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is another Omiera Labs product that I am in the process of trying. I have a few dark spots on my face that annoy me and I am looking forward to focusing on those and lightening them so I have been putting this Filler directly on those areas. I have only used it for a couple of days and so far my skin looks and feels great but I haven&#x27;t noticed any color changes or lightening but I will update this review after using it longer so that I have time to see the results!</li>
            <li> I have lived in Hawaii in the sun for more than half my life. This has led to wrinkles and sun spots on my face and chest. So when I was offered this Anti-Aging Skin Whitening Glutathione Cream from Omiera Labs for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered one. Thes Epidermal Hyaluronic Filler is a whitening system that is supposed to even out skin tone and reduse the appearance of lines. Well that is what is starting to happen. My dark spots are definitely fading and my chest wrinkles are also less apparent. I also love the refreshing scent. Great Filler Cream and worth the try.</li>
            <li> This product actually works I have tried many others and this is the only one i found to actually give results.</li>
            <li> The years have not been kind to me. Decided to try Glocione, expecting it to be only mildly successful like a lot of other products I&#x27;ve tried. Was pleasantly surprised! My wrinkles have been reduced and my face seems all together brighter and more radiant. I&#x27;m ecstatic!</li>
            <li> So far I like this cream. It has only been a few days, but I feel like I already notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I have tried every product from target to nordstrom , nothing really works. I have been using a bioglycolic line from a doctor but when I used Glocione I could not believe the results. Smoother more even skin tone within a week, plumps up lines within a few weeks! I always wear foundation &amp; after  the first jar of Glocione I really could go without! I have never written a review before but I can&#x27;t say enough about Glocione ! The only drawback is it lasted about 6 weeks and you can&#x27;t tell how much is left with the pump design of the container so I need to reorder sooner. If you can&#x27;t decide if you want to try because of the price, try it you will love it and it&#x27;s much cheaper than botox!</li>
            <li> You can tell that all these reviews are written by the same person.  What a bunch of baloney.  Sincerely, Very suspicious.</li>
            <li> This stuff sure looks fancy in the washroom. Upon first use, I noticed it seemed a little runny for a cream but it felt nice to rub into the face. I uploaded a pic to show the consistency. I&#x27;ve used it for a few days now and noticed a few things. First it has a light smell I do not entirely care for but would rather have that than a chemical scent to mask it. It also felt slightly greasy when first applying but that does not remain once rubbed in like the cheaper stuff from mainstream products. My intent for this was to take the face back in time a little and this appeared to have helped. I do not have any spots or dark circles so I cannot comment on that but I can say it does help a little with the skin itself. The bottle is kind of small and combined with the runny consistency of the product itself, I could only give it four stars. Overall I would have to say I got the results I needed but if they can find a way to thicken this stuff up naturally and ease up on the high price, it would be a five star and worth buying over and over. There are nice organics out there with claims to do the same and cost far less. I received this item at a discount for an honest review and so you have it. I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I liked the cream but  it lasted only 2 weeks. Does anyone know how many ounces are in this jar?</li>
            <li> I never would have purchased this item for myself 1) Because I don&#x27;t have that kind of money to waste &amp; 2) I&#x27;ve given up.  I look how I look. Done.  I got this as a gift and tried it.  I have combo skin to the extreme - oily areas and scaly areas... nothing pleases both.  This cream surprisingly corrected that problem.  My oily spots have toned down and my scaly spots are moisturized.  Even more impressive was I didn&#x27;t have my &amp;#34;adult acne flare-up&amp;#34; prior to my period (sorry TMI).  I&#x27;ve used it for a month (sparingly, every evening OVER my regular moisturizer), so it might last me another month but that&#x27;s it.  Honestly I&#x27;m kind of sad.  I would love to continue using this, but there&#x27;s no way I can afford it.  If I could find a comparable  drug store version I&#x27;d be thrilled.  But so far everything I&#x27;ve tried only makes my skin worse.  Suffice to say - this product does what it says it does, and then some.  But only if you can afford it.  (if anyone out there can suggest something more economical I&#x27;d appreciate it!)</li>
            <li> so far so good, feels great, works well, love it!</li>
            <li> It is better whitening cream I have been using so far. It works great.</li>
            <li> Have used this several nights and I am starting to see changes. I just hit a milestone birthday so this year I am taking extra care of myself!</li>
            <li> This has an overpowering smell and way too expensive for me based on having no results in three days.  Will look for another product to correct the Dark Spots.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because I was looking for a moisturizer and when I received it wasn&#x27;t too sure that&#x27;s what it was. Had read all the kudos from other buyers and haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference in lines disappearing or any whitening.  So I probably won&#x27;t be purchasing this item again.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging does not allow you to use every last drop unless you break the entire unit apart which I will probably do at this price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ve been using for two weeks or so.</li>
            <li> I Like it but the content is only enough for 2 wks.  too expensive.</li>
            <li> Quite a noticeable difference!  Will buy again</li>
            <li> In just two days I felt like a glowing queen of subduction. My skin felt bright, 20 years younger and softer than a babies bottom. The packaging is alluring and I&#x27;m feeling beckoned to use just a tad more throughout the day. Yet, I fight the temptation and admire my glow. Often touching my face in disbelief. I&#x27;m extremely proud to be a chosen one to review this product steeply discounted. I&#x27;m now dedicated to this business as much as I&#x27;m dedicated to being a Wonder Mom!</li>
            <li> I refused to deal with more and more wrinkles over the years and started trying products. I used generic products hoping to save money, but it was almost a waste of money because they did nothing for me. I caved into purchasing Glocione and it was worth every penny. My skin is smoothing up and making me look youthful again!</li>
            <li> Great Product!!  I saw a noticeable change in the texture and color of my skin within two weeks.  My skin is very light and brown spots appeared on my cheeks, chin and nose areas.  Using the cream made the spots fade away; I was so delighted with the results as I don&#x27;t like to use a lot of makeup.  Thank you for making such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Like most people, I was completely overwhelmed with the amount of anti-wrinkle stuff out there when I decided it was time to start looking.  I decided to just go with the trial and error method of doing things, because really, what works for my friend&#x27;s skin might not for mine.  I&#x27;d tried a couple of other products with limited degrees of success.  So far, Glocione has worked the best for me.  I&#x27;ve noticed differences in my skin after a week or so.  It&#x27;s much smoother and the fine lines and dark spots have definitely been reduced.  So far so good!</li>
            <li> i have used several different face creams and this one works best for me.  I love the way my skin feels after applying and I can really see the youth coming back to my face.  It&#x27;s wonderful and while one review said there was an odor, I didn&#x27;t find that at all. Best product ever!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Glocione for seven months now.  It is by far the best moisturizer that I have ever used.  I saw a difference in my skin within the first week.  The ingredients are fantastic.  I use it twice a day and it leaves my skin feeling smooth, non oily and radiant.  I&#x27;m 49 so it definitely helps out with my fine lines.  It has improved the texture and overall tone of my skin.  My make up looks flawless too.  I can&#x27;t say enough about this product and this company.  Check out their other products at omieralabs.com</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of products to help fade dark spots on my face, and have spent a little to a lot on those products. This is the only one that I&#x27;ve gotten results with. I only use it on my face and neck, but I could see the difference after only one bottle. I wish it came in a larger size, so I wouldn&#x27;t have to buy so often, but that&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> I began using this product about four or five months ago.  Initially, I never expected to purchase it regularly because it was a tad pricey for a teacher.  But the product is extraordinary.  I noticed a difference in my skin very quickly.  Now, after five months, my skin tone is has improved enormously.  Fine lines look better, dark spots have nearly disappeared, and large pores have been hugely reduced or even disappeared.  I would highly recommend this product.  I can also recommend the company: I tried a different product with this company which didn&#x27;t react so well with my skin and when I wrote them about my experience they refunded the cost immediately.  The company has been responsive to every question and concern.</li>
            <li> As I am aging I am becoming very self conscious of my wrinkles. I have had trouble in the past finding a product because there are so many. My friend has beautiful skin and told me she used Glocione. In as little as a week&#x27;s time I was already noticing a difference! Even putting on makeup was going on smoother. I highly recommend to anyone else struggling to find the right cream, as I was.</li>
            <li> This is really Great for Facial Moisturizer helped my skin healthy and fading the dark spots cause by acne in the past.&lt;br /&gt;I think this is really good treatment for the acne because this it the first, one thing I noticed since I started using this one.&lt;br /&gt;Fading my acne dark spot not whitening the whole face where you apply on.&lt;br /&gt;Because its says Skin Whitening  too, but for me didn&#x27;t make my skin white I&#x27;m not saying this to bragging the product or saying bad thing.. But I&#x27;m just saying this as a honest effect on me base on my experienced. Maybe only just the part where dark cause by unhealthy part on the skin. You know why I&#x27;m saying this  ? Because I  am a tester means I love new product I love to try new things..I buy a lot until I know it if its really good for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe depends on the skin type or who knows but 1 thing i can advice to anyone ..Its not bad to try differents kinds of products but read carefully before applying it. Work&#x27;s or Not,Well..not bad atleast you know the Answer! It&#x27;s in your experience.</li>
            <li> I was looking online for a gift for my mom \\&quot;just because\\&quot; and I came across this. She loves face creams, so I decided to buy this for her. She absolutely loves it! She told me a lot of good things about it, so I bought some for myself! While waiting for mine to come in the mail (about a month and a half after I bought it for her, I purchased it for myself) I started noticing that her crow&#x27;s feet were diminishing a lot. Once I started using it, I instantly fell in love. I have a very greasy face and it&#x27;s hard for me to find a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t feel heavy. This is SO light on my face and I don&#x27;t get greasy. I&#x27;m glad that this is anti-wrinkle because I&#x27;m getting to the age where I&#x27;m starting to look worn and old. I will definitely be buying this cream for as long as I can! There&#x27;s the no-risk money-back guarantee, but you won&#x27;t need it!! This is an amazing cream and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Glocione is an amazing product. After about a week of using this product I noticed my age spots disappearing before my eyes. My skin looked much younger and softer,with less wrinkles. I would recommend this product to anyone who is thinking about buying it.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Overall it moisturize my face yet not so oily. It helps lift my dark circle from night feeding as well ;)</li>
            <li> Results are visibly noticeable within two weeks. I like this product and use it on my face as well as the back of my hands and fingers. It makes my skin more even and youthful looking. I bought another, but a little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t worry if you can&#x27;t afford a second bottle anytime soon. :)</li>
