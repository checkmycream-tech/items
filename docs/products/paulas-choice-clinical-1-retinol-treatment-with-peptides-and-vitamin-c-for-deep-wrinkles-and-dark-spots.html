            <li>I&#x27;ve used the samples of this recently &amp; it&#x27;s amazing!!!  </li>

            <li>The great thing is, I don&#x27;t use foundation and so had nothing on my skin!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure you follow directions or your face may peel off!!</li>
            <li>Ive been using this along with the BHA9 treatment, and my skin has never looked or felt so good.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a good product, just use it sensibly.</li>
            <li>but i love it !</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I usually buy the Skinmedica Retinol, which is also wonderful, but this is great.</li>
            <li>My skin tone is definitely more even.  </li>
            <li>Even better they give you all of the dermatological research.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the Acne line as much as I LOVE this and the BHA9 products.</li>

            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>This is the most potent Retinol treatment I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Outstanding product.</li>
            <li>Much better than most well known brands out there.</li>
            <li>:) :)</li>
            <li>I buy directly from PC, but it seems as though they sell on Amazon as well, which is great and convenient.</li>
            <li>Holy cow this stuff works great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sticking to my older, more effective routine.</li>
            <li>If you follow the instructions, using 2-3 times/week and gradually go up in use, you should be fine.</li>
            <li>It makes a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 46 and have been using retinol creams at night for several years for my oily/normal skin, but this one has been the best so far.  </li>
            <li>On the off nights I use the Resist Super Light Anti Oxidant Serum.  </li>
            <li>I was using my teenage son&#x27;s retinol cream with great success.  </li>
            <li>Saw a huge difference after using paulas:) will definitely purchase again:)</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the good news, and would earn the product a solid 5 stars.</li>
            <li>This is probably the single most  effective skin product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li>Any more frequently</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the money</li>
            <li>It looks clear, brighter, more moisturized and smoother.</li>
            <li>is right up there with them.</li>
            <li>Here is a link you can click on to get $10 off your first order on their site.</li>
            <li>I just got $10 off my first order.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product if you have dark spots and acne .</li>
            <li>And this is strong enough to do the trick.</li>
            <li>She told me I should just keep using the foundation I&#x27;m using because my skin tone is very even.  </li>
            <li>every one thats complaining about the packing dont know much about retinol.</li>
            <li>If you are getting the real PC products here, then, it is equivalent to approx .2%, AGAIN:</li>
            <li>It really does all it claims it can do.</li>
            <li>Get Paula&#x27;s Choice and you&#x27;ll get the results you want and save the high price.</li>
            <li>Yes, it works great, but it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li>I just ordered the full size pump today and can&#x27;t wait to use it long term.</li>
            <li>you are a new customer buying from the Paula&#x27;s Choice website, and use my referral code, we both get $10.</li>
            <li>However, PC products used to be very reasonably priced and in simple containers.</li>
            <li>After using either I use the Resist Anti Aging Clear Skin Hydrator.  </li>
            <li>I am in my 30&#x27;s and suffer from breakouts with combination to oily, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin, however, I did find this product to cause peeling</li>
            <li>I like the treatment so far and expect it to do what Paula said it will do.</li>
            <li>While this product might be useful for the less mature skin, it did not measure up to what I had been using.  </li>
            <li>It is considerably stronger for half the price, and has lots of positive reviews...</li>
            <li>It did cause a bit of redness around the orbital bone and temple area the first few times I used it in February 2015</li>
            <li>Make certain to wear sunscreen during the day if you go in the sun because these products create an excelled cellular turn over, wherever you use them, that is why you will peel a little.</li>
            <li>Retinol has to be in air tight packaging to protect it from sun and too much air, the retinol particles will separate and the product becomes deffective.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Holy cow this stuff works great! Make sure you follow directions or your face may peel off!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks to try to decrease the visibility of some scaring I had from Moh&#x27;s surgery.  It makes a huge difference.  I would recommend following the instructions on the packaging and slowly introduce your skin to this.  I&#x27;m using it 2 nights a week now.  Any more frequently and I get flaking.  It&#x27;s well worth the money and I&#x27;ll purchase again.</li>
            <li> My wife buys this stuff all the time so I assume she is happy with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 46 and have been using retinol creams at night for several years for my oily/normal skin, but this one has been the best so far.  It did cause a bit of redness around the orbital bone and temple area the first few times I used it in February 2015 (I do not put it under the eye), so I used it every two nights for the first few weeks  I am now using it every other night and it is working well.  On the off nights I use the Resist Super Light Anti Oxidant Serum.  After using either I use the Resist Anti Aging Clear Skin Hydrator.  My skin tone is definitely more even.  (Last week I went to buy a pan of Bobby Brown eye shadow and asked the sales lady about foundation.  She told me I should just keep using the foundation I&#x27;m using because my skin tone is very even.  The great thing is, I don&#x27;t use foundation and so had nothing on my skin!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a new customer buying from the Paula&#x27;s Choice website, and use my referral code, we both get $10. http://goo.gl/ZBGQF4.</li>
            <li> Did not notice any difference after using the entire bottle</li>
            <li> every one thats complaining about the packing dont know much about retinol. Retinol has to be in air tight packaging to protect it from sun and too much air, the retinol particles will separate and the product becomes deffective. This is an amazing product if you have dark spots and acne . I would tell anyone to get the sample and try it but i love it !</li>
            <li> I saw some negative reviews and questioning about the authenticity of PC 1% Retinol Treatment. If you are getting the real PC products here, then, it is equivalent to approx .2%, AGAIN: .2%  trenitonin/perscription Retin-A. If you go to the Paula&#x27;s Choice website, they give you every fact you need to know about ALL of their products and ingredients. Even better they give you all of the dermatological research. I believe in science, and it is all there for you to read. Ive been using this along with the BHA9 treatment, and my skin has never looked or felt so good. I am in my 30&#x27;s and suffer from breakouts with combination to oily, sensitive skin. These two products saved my skin, literally. I wash with Dove unscented, followed by spot treating with BHA9 and the Clinical Retinol Treatment at night. Make certain to wear sunscreen during the day if you go in the sun because these products create an excelled cellular turn over, wherever you use them, that is why you will peel a little. If you follow the instructions, using 2-3 times/week and gradually go up in use, you should be fine. But like all PC product directions, she always says to &amp;#34;pay attention to how your skin reacts&amp;#34;. I buy directly from PC, but it seems as though they sell on Amazon as well, which is great and convenient. I didn&#x27;t like the Acne line as much as I LOVE this and the BHA9 products.</li>
            <li> What a surprise! I LOVE this product. I have used Skinmedica, Neocutis, Obagi and this is right up there with them. I usually buy the Skinmedica Retinol, which is also wonderful, but this is great. I will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I was using my teenage son&#x27;s retinol cream with great success.  He did not use it, loved how it made my skin look and feel.  I went searching for products that would be similar without the cost and this is it.  This helps your face look about 10 years younger.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> This is the most potent Retinol treatment I have ever used. If you have sensitive skin, use it just a few times a week.  I do not have sensitive skin, however, I did find this product to cause peeling so I had to pull back on how often I use it.  Also, be careful not to apply it after you wash with a product that contains AHA and BHA exfoliants as it will sting.  It&#x27;s a good product, just use it sensibly.</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time and I was grateful.  I like the treatment so far and expect it to do what Paula said it will do.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product. Much better than most well known brands out there.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t seen any results</li>
            <li> I like this product since it doesnot burn when applied and has minimal peeling.</li>
            <li> This is probably the single most  effective skin product I&#x27;ve ever used. My skin has not looked this good in 40 years! It looks clear, brighter, more moisturized and smoother. Dark spots are fading quite rapidly. It&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take much. That&#x27;s the good news, and would earn the product a solid 5 stars. However, PC products used to be very reasonably priced and in simple containers. Now the containers are nicer looking, but prone to malfunction--I have had several fail. The company stands behind their products and will readily replace any defectives, but it is irritating when it happens, I&#x27;m not happy about paying more for prettier packaging even if it doesn&#x27;t fail; and can&#x27;t help but think of all the extra plastic that goes into its manufacturing before use and into environmental purgatory afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So. My next purchase of a retinol product comes in a small glass bottle. It is considerably stronger for half the price, and has lots of positive reviews...</li>
            <li> Trying to avoid a prescription of tretoin. And this is strong enough to do the trick. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using avene retrinal for years.  Saw a huge difference after using paulas:) will definitely purchase again:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the samples of this recently &amp; it&#x27;s amazing!!!  It really does all it claims it can do. I was very impressed. I just ordered the full size pump today and can&#x27;t wait to use it long term. I also ordered some of their moisturizers, shampoo &amp; detangler as well. Here is a link you can click on to get $10 off your first order on their site. I just got $10 off my first order. :) :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Retin-A on and off since my teen years. Yes, it works great, but it&#x27;s expensive. Don&#x27;t need it anymore because this is the BEST!. Yes, it will redden and make your skin peel like retin-A if you use it alot. Same cautions and side effects--and the same results!. A tiny tube of retin-A is over 200 dollars. Get Paula&#x27;s Choice and you&#x27;ll get the results you want and save the high price. A little goes a long way--I use two small pumps for a full face and neck. I&#x27;m a believer now!</li>
            <li> I have been a regular user of Retin-A and Obaji #5. I was looking for a a cheaper alternative for them both. While this product might be useful for the less mature skin, it did not measure up to what I had been using.  I&#x27;m sticking to my older, more effective routine.</li>
