            <li>i realy love this eyebrow marker,is so lovely and fantanstic</li>
            <li>Medium will suit most needs.</li>
            <li>The color is perfect for my natural light hair and it doesn&#x27;t look like im &amp;#34;surprised&amp;#34; or used finger paint on my brows.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The product might be ok if there was anything in the tube.</li>
            <li>I really love this product</li>
            <li>I was able to wear it.</li>
            <li>Obviously, I love this product.</li>
            <li>What I like most about is that it has staying power.  </li>
            <li>I love this eyebrow marker.  </li>
            <li>Love love this product.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S OKAY</li>
            <li>I tried this product after using the $20 product mentioned in these reviews and I like ir better in many ways ..</li>
            <li>You just have to be very light handed and make very fine wisps with the point like drawing fine lines at an angle.</li>
            <li>It stayed on all day long and looked as perfect as it did in the morning by the time I came home from work in the rain.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy and love this product because it stays well and even darkens the skin so when it comes off it is still dark where it was on.</li>
            <li>THE EXTRA FINE TIP MAKES IT VERY EASY TO USE IF YOU DON&#x27;T HAVE GREAT DEXTERITY.  </li>
            <li>and it finished very quickly.</li>
            <li>Great precision plus not very dark although it is a liquid pen.  </li>
            <li>the quality is super cheap !</li>
            <li>I am a huge NYX fan</li>
            <li>The color is fantastic and doesn&#x27;t turn &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; like Laura Geller&#x27;s did.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because it is a cruelty free product.  </li>
            <li>the color is too light.</li>
            <li>Too light in color.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a wash of light brown</li>
            <li>The color is better and the price is right.</li>
            <li>Had to get a super light brown.  </li>
            <li>this by far is my favorite!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m blonde and fair; the medium brown color worked for me.</li>
            <li>Love it so much that I ordered another one in dk.</li>
            <li>I have tried many brands of eyebrow products and I really like the lighter color of this one and ability to adjust the thickness of the lines.  </li>
            <li>One day its good and the other</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>I find that you do need a fairly light touch, though, or it can get pretty intense.</li>
            <li>It is more like a fine line marker pen rather than a pencil or other brands that go on clumpy.  </li>
            <li>it looks very real.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what it should.</li>
            <li>My first one was a darker color</li>
            <li>I USE A POWDER FIRST AND THEN APPLY THE MARKER TO BROW</li>
            <li>AND THIS ONE IS EQUAL OR BETTER.  </li>
            <li>I make sure I have a back up and one for traveling in our trailer.  </li>
            <li>THAT IT IS GOOD BUT NOT LONG LASTING</li>
            <li>I always try new things for my super pale/transparent eyebrows</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and is soft looking and not hard looking.  </li>
            <li>but I will have to warn you that this isn&#x27;t a very good product if you want to stay out in the sun because it turns your eyebrows green when exposed to sun for too long.</li>
            <li>Dont really like it.</li>
            <li>It glides on easily, and stays put all day long, even after swimming.</li>
            <li>Getting my brows in point with this lovely little marker, thanks!</li>
            <li>This lighter brown seems a bit more reddish than the other product&#x27;s equivalent.  </li>
            <li>If I have any complaint it is that the product runs out more quickly than I would like.</li>
            <li>I bought this in medium, which is a pretty natural shade.    </li>
            <li>The liquid is too light and the tip becomes dry out of nowhere.</li>
            <li>And in general, I&#x27;ve loved Nyx products in the past.  </li>
            <li>but I think I prefer josie maran magic brows, although that&#x27;s much more expensive.</li>
            <li>I have very sparse eyebrows and have to use something that looks natural and has staying power.  </li>
            <li>As someone who has lost most of the hair in my eyebrows, I have looked for something to use to fill in the missing hairs.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately I only got to use it twice before my older sister borrowed ( kept) it to use, so I can&#x27;t really say how long this would last or how it is after many uses.</li>
            <li>It is easy to work with and just to see how long they actually stay on when done.  </li>
            <li>For the past 5 years, I have been using K-Palette&#x27;s eyebrow markers, and have always been a highly satisfied user.</li>
            <li>This eyebrow marker is more subtle and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I like a color a few shades lighter then my natural brows because my hair is so light now.  </li>
            <li>Fills in the brow and looks natural.</li>
            <li>My brows look so natural.  </li>
            <li>I Just tried this semi permanent brow liner and was very happily surprised.  </li>
            <li>Only able to use a few times before it ran out.</li>
            <li>It fills in my bare spots yet looks natural.  </li>
            <li>I looked high and low and finally found this NYX eyebrow pen.  </li>
            <li>I hope it is long lasting because it doesn&#x27;t appear like there is much in the tube.</li>
            <li>Then the shade I liked started getting increasingly difficult to find anywhere and that was when I noticed this marker.</li>
            <li>Pretty much a waste of money, in my opinion.</li>

            <li> Pretty much a waste of money, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> , I just hope it doesn&#x27;t dry out quickly because I have had that problem with a few other brand&#x27;s eyeliner markers.</li>
            <li> I got to use it long enough to test out how it worked, and then it was done.</li>
            <li> This color looks very natural even though the color of the marker looks a little orangish.  </li>
            <li> BUT IT DID NOT LAST VERY LONG</li>
            <li> Not sure if the item is defective or old but what could have possibly happened to an eyebrow pencil?</li>
            <li> Also Laura&#x27;s eyebrow colors tended to turn &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; for some strange reason.  </li>
            <li> Not water proof however but as long as you know...</li>
            <li> Over the years I have tweezed them down to nothing and let them grow back, only to tweeze them to death all over again.  </li>
            <li> But this marker is just about bone dry.  </li>
            <li> so my natural brows are a little too dark.  </li>
            <li> It was dried out, nothing in the tube or totally dried, Could barely get any color to come off on the back of my hand.</li>
            <li> This was a total waste of alot of money.</li>
            <li> So I would use this indoors And not really outdoors</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no eyebrows &amp; if you learn to put it on</li>
            <li> Not much thought has been put into making this &amp;#34;brow&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> WHETHER YOU NEED TO FILL IN SPARSE BROWS WITH INDIVIDUAL STROKES TO REPLACE MISSING HAIRS</li>
            <li> Not much product in it.  </li>
            <li> Right now they grow in at different times and are a little thin in some spots while thick and long in others.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several products by NYX cosmetics which were decent, but this one is definitely a fail in my book.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if i&#x27;m using wrong, but i have to use it, before my main makeup, &#x27;cause it won&#x27;t work too well, especially when i use after the eye brow shaper wax from NYX too.</li>
            <li> The pen tip is soft and flexible, making a subtle eyebrow line, but the color doesn&#x27;t even come out of the pen.  </li>
            <li> It works okay, but I was disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> It lasts a very long time &amp; I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> too dark and heavy - not as advertised</li>
            <li> This time I thought I&#x27;d try a little lighter shade called Medium.  </li>
            <li> so I knew they wouldn&#x27;t let me down with this product, and they didn&#x27;t!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a dried out marker.</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed with this and would not buy again.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure yet.  </li>
            <li> I have used Laura Geller eyebrow markers for the past 7-9 years.</li>
            <li> After a few uses it seems to have gone dry and is essentially useless.  </li>
            <li> I am Italian and have very thick, long eyebrows that can at times be crazy.  </li>
            <li> OR AT LEAST MINE</li>
            <li> So my 4 stars instead of 5 are merely because the color doesn&#x27;t work as well for me as the other product.</li>
            <li> or else I will look undone and a little weird.  </li>
            <li> and you can control how thin or thick you want the brow to be.  </li>
            <li> I have no eyebrows and can now do suprised and angry all with the help of my drwn on eyebrows.</li>
            <li> A total bust, awful.</li>
            <li> The color is too faint and looks nothing like the picture.</li>
            <li> I like it, but it&#x27;s quite difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Try it you won&#x27;t be sorry you did.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t look fake.</li>
            <li> Terrible - there is no color to it.</li>
            <li> Worst eyebrow pencil that I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the medium color, and although I can use it if I apply it sparingly, I&#x27;d prefer a color that&#x27;s a bit lighter than my eyebrows (I have medium brown hair). But I like how it goes on and seems to last well. I find that you do need a fairly light touch, though, or it can get pretty intense.</li>
            <li> i realy love this eyebrow marker,is so lovely and fantanstic,now i can mark my brow perfectly,am loveing it lol,this  is  wath i want</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it should. Fills in the brow and looks natural. Wonderful for those sparse spots! Medium will suit most needs.</li>
            <li> It leaks and it does not work on my skin.  I got the NYX powder and it is good but wanted something more permanent  this is not it.</li>
            <li> For the past 5 years, I have been using K-Palette&#x27;s eyebrow markers, and have always been a highly satisfied user. Then the shade I liked started getting increasingly difficult to find anywhere and that was when I noticed this marker. It glides on easily, and stays put all day long, even after swimming. It&#x27;s convenient to use and store. I bought this in medium, which is a pretty natural shade.    I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love it!  I always try new things for my super pale/transparent eyebrows&lt;br /&gt;and this by far is my favorite! The color is perfect for my natural light hair and it doesn&#x27;t look like im &amp;#34;surprised&amp;#34; or used finger paint on my brows.&lt;br /&gt;I need to stock up on this!</li>
            <li> I am Italian and have very thick, long eyebrows that can at times be crazy.  Over the years I have tweezed them down to nothing and let them grow back, only to tweeze them to death all over again.  Right now they grow in at different times and are a little thin in some spots while thick and long in others.  My hair is dyed platinum blonde so my natural brows are a little too dark.  I have to fill them in or else I will look undone and a little weird.  I like a color a few shades lighter then my natural brows because my hair is so light now.  I am a huge NYX fan so I knew they wouldn&#x27;t let me down with this product, and they didn&#x27;t!  I have tried a few eyeliner markers before and didn&#x27;t really like how they turned out.  This color looks very natural even though the color of the marker looks a little orangish.  It goes on very easily and you can control how thin or thick you want the brow to be.  It stayed on all day long and looked as perfect as it did in the morning by the time I came home from work in the rain.  The price is great for the quality of the product.  I have no complaints, I just hope it doesn&#x27;t dry out quickly because I have had that problem with a few other brand&#x27;s eyeliner markers.</li>
            <li> Getting my brows in point with this lovely little marker, thanks!</li>
            <li> I have no eyebrows and can now do suprised and angry all with the help of my drwn on eyebrows. I am very happy and love this product because it stays well and even darkens the skin so when it comes off it is still dark where it was on.</li>
            <li> I used to use Laura Geller eyebrow pens until she changed the tip.  Also Laura&#x27;s eyebrow colors tended to turn &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; for some strange reason.  I looked high and low and finally found this NYX eyebrow pen.  It goes on easy and is soft looking and not hard looking.  My brows look so natural.  The color is fantastic and doesn&#x27;t turn &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; like Laura Geller&#x27;s did.  My brows stay on all day and don&#x27;t come off until I wash them off before I go to bed.  Best product ever for eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got sparse brows and the brow powder not  looking neat....this is the answer! The color is perfect for me (Light brown)I have brown hair.I would buy again!!</li>
            <li> The product might be ok if there was anything in the tube. I got the product last week. Used it once and had to use a pencil to finish my eyebrows. It was dried out, nothing in the tube or totally dried, Could barely get any color to come off on the back of my hand. A total bust, awful. This was a total waste of alot of money.</li>
            <li> the quality is super cheap !</li>
            <li> I really love this product but I will have to warn you that this isn&#x27;t a very good product if you want to stay out in the sun because it turns your eyebrows green when exposed to sun for too long. So I would use this indoors And not really outdoors</li>
            <li> This eyebrow maker is great!! You just have to be very light handed and make very fine wisps with the point like drawing fine lines at an angle. Unfortunately I only got to use it twice before my older sister borrowed ( kept) it to use, so I can&#x27;t really say how long this would last or how it is after many uses. It did stay on my brows until I removed it with cleanser both time I was able to wear it.</li>
            <li> Terrible - there is no color to it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it is a cruelty free product.  They only had two colors.  Had to get a super light brown.  The pen tip is soft and flexible, making a subtle eyebrow line, but the color doesn&#x27;t even come out of the pen.  I&#x27;m pretty disappointed with this and would not buy again.  Trial and error...</li>
            <li> Obviously, I love this product. My first one was a darker color and I use it just to fill in my eyebrows.  Totally loved it.  This time I thought I&#x27;d try a little lighter shade called Medium.  I think I prefer this shade with my medium brown hair. I just received it today and used it so I&#x27;m not sure yet.  What I like most about is that it has staying power.  I take it off at night when I wash my face. Otherwise, it doesn&#x27;t smudge or disappear.  I plan to continue to use this product. I was using Revlon Colorstay but found it to be too waxy and obvious. It didn&#x27;t blend as well for me.  This eyebrow marker is more subtle and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I Just tried this semi permanent brow liner and was very happily surprised.  It is easy to work with and just to see how long they actually stay on when done.  I slept with this on for 3 nights, AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I love this eyebrow marker.  I have absolutely no eyebrows &amp; if you learn to put it on right it looks very real.  It does not turn greeen like I&#x27;ve read in some reviews.  It lasts a very long time &amp; I use it everyday.  It is not water proof though.  So if I go swimming I put a pencil coat over it.</li>
            <li> It works okay, but I was disappointed in this product. The coverage is spotty. I would probably not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like it at all. the color is too light. I think you need to buy one shaddow dsrker than you udually use. and it finished very quickly. as if it was used before</li>
            <li> I like the precision tip of this marker and that it doesn&#x27;t require sharpening. I&#x27;m blonde and fair; the medium brown color worked for me. I will be buying this product again instead of a brow pencil.</li>
            <li> Worst eyebrow pencil that I&#x27;ve ever tried. It&#x27;s like a dried out marker. The color is too faint and looks nothing like the picture. The marker doesn&#x27;t apply well and is smudgy. Not much thought has been put into making this &amp;#34;brow&amp;#34; marker. Not sure if the item is defective or old but what could have possibly happened to an eyebrow pencil? I&#x27;ve used several products by NYX cosmetics which were decent, but this one is definitely a fail in my book.</li>
            <li> I like it, but it&#x27;s quite difficult to use. I don&#x27;t know if i&#x27;m using wrong, but i have to use it, before my main makeup, &#x27;cause it won&#x27;t work too well, especially when i use after the eye brow shaper wax from NYX too.</li>
            <li> Love it so much that I ordered another one in dk. brown.  It works great and has an awesome tip for easy appying.</li>
            <li> WHETHER YOU NEED TO FILL IN SPARSE BROWS WITH INDIVIDUAL STROKES TO REPLACE MISSING HAIRS OR IF YOU HAVE NO BROWS AND MUST LITERALLY DRAW THEM IN-- THIS MARKER WILL WORK FOR YOU.  I USE A POWDER FIRST AND THEN APPLY THE MARKER TO BROW AND IT WILL LAST ALL DAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE USED MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE MARKERS AND THIS ONE IS EQUAL OR BETTER.  THE EXTRA FINE TIP MAKES IT VERY EASY TO USE IF YOU DON&#x27;T HAVE GREAT DEXTERITY.  DO NOT HESITATE TO TRY IT.&lt;br /&gt;I USE THE MEDIUM SHADE AND IT IS PERFECT.</li>
            <li> Returned it.  too dark and heavy - not as advertised</li>
            <li> Too light in color.  Doesn&#x27;t stay on.  Not much product in it.  Only able to use a few times before it ran out.</li>
            <li> The color is perfect, and the point looks like it&#x27;d be great.  And in general, I&#x27;ve loved Nyx products in the past.  But this marker is just about bone dry.  I got to use it long enough to test out how it worked, and then it was done.</li>
            <li> As someone who has lost most of the hair in my eyebrows, I have looked for something to use to fill in the missing hairs.  This eyebrow marker seemed to be the answer, and was ~ temporarily.  After a few uses it seems to have gone dry and is essentially useless.  Pretty much a waste of money, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I have tried many brands of eyebrow products and I really like the lighter color of this one and ability to adjust the thickness of the lines.  It fills in my bare spots yet looks natural.  It is more like a fine line marker pen rather than a pencil or other brands that go on clumpy.  I make sure I have a back up and one for traveling in our trailer.  If I have any complaint it is that the product runs out more quickly than I would like.</li>
            <li> Love love this product. Put it on and put powder through it...looks great and lasts! Not water proof however but as long as you know...</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S OKAY BUT IT DID NOT LAST VERY LONG OR AT LEAST MINE IT DRIED OUT FAST&lt;br /&gt;OTHER THAN THAT IT IS GOOD BUT NOT LONG LASTING</li>
            <li> I have used Laura Geller eyebrow markers for the past 7-9 years. They are pricey and do not last at twenty-four dollars per pen. This marker has already exceeded my expectations. The color is better and the price is right. These markers are just over one third the price of Laura Geller. $9.15 vs $24.00. Try it you won&#x27;t be sorry you did.</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money. The idea of a &amp;#34;marker&amp;#34; is great, but rubs off immediately. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I tried this product after using the $20 product mentioned in these reviews and I like ir better in many ways .. So my 4 stars instead of 5 are merely because the color doesn&#x27;t work as well for me as the other product. This lighter brown seems a bit more reddish than the other product&#x27;s equivalent.  BUT it goes on easier and I like the brush on NYX.</li>
            <li> Dont really like it. The liquid is too light and the tip becomes dry out of nowhere. One day its good and the other it gives no color.</li>
            <li> I have very sparse eyebrows and have to use something that looks natural and has staying power.  This product does the trick. I hope it is long lasting because it doesn&#x27;t appear like there is much in the tube. It&#x27;s a good product but I think I prefer josie maran magic brows, although that&#x27;s much more expensive. NYX is good for the price.</li>
            <li> Great precision plus not very dark although it is a liquid pen.  It&#x27;s like a wash of light brown so it doesn&#x27;t look fake.</li>
