            <li>Works perfectly as described and saves me money because I do not have to replace my full mask when this part wears out---and this is one of the 2 parts that wears out easily!</li>

            <li>It was a great fit on my frame and</li>

            <li>and I am able to relax with a good nights sleep.</li>
            <li>Not the mfgs fault all my own.</li>
            <li>Husband was thrilled to get this replacement mask.  </li>
            <li>I used this to replace an older worn out cushion and it works flawlessly.</li>
            <li>After a couple of weeks it seems that the smell wasn&#x27;t as strong as before, but being that every breath I take is thru that gel didn&#x27;t seem like a good idea.</li>
            <li>Not as good a fit  </li>
            <li>Good fit, very comfortable, and well made.</li>
            <li>so the seal is not as good as original.</li>
            <li>great replacement exactly what I needed</li>
            <li>as good as or better than original.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable mask</li>
            <li>Very comfortable for me.</li>
            <li>This is a very comfortable mask liner.  </li>

            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>I could not be more please or satisfied with this company.</li>
            <li>instead of having to use my insurance, I was able to buy this replacement gel mask at an affordable price.</li>
            <li>Love the fit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Bought this together with the frame, make sure you have the correct size.</li>
            <li>the comfort it provides is top notch.</li>
            <li>I purchased this hoping it would b ok.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying the product.</li>
            <li>Original replacement very easy to install.</li>
            <li>Never found any mask I love, but this one fits my machine and is relatively comfortable.</li>
            <li>I found that out of the masks available in the market the most confortable and reliable of all are the one that uses the gel cushion.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal replacement, good as the original I got with my machine, because its the name brand.</li>
            <li>just as pictured, easy to replace the old one.works really good.</li>
            <li>It takes a little getting used to this over the &#x27;factory&#x27; face mask that comes with your CPAP, but over time, it really is awesome.</li>
            <li>comfortable.</li>
            <li>comfortable mask and seals well,</li>
            <li>This with a comfortable holder, and of course head gear</li>
            <li>Genuine Respironics replacement part.  </li>
            <li>Since I have to use a cpap machine, I want it to be comfortable.  </li>
            <li>The ComfortGel mask fits my needs and is comfortable all night.</li>
            <li>As stated, this is a medium, but it doesn&#x27;t fit any of my medium mask.</li>
            <li>and it wouldn&#x27;t fit</li>
            <li>They are the same great quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised so many people have good luck right away.</li>
            <li>it came quickly, arrived in good shape, and all I had to do was unsnap the old cushion&#x27;s frame and snap this one on.  </li>
            <li>as original this one is thinner</li>
            <li>I may open my own store with all the pieces I now have that don&#x27;t fit and were used at most 2-3 days.</li>
            <li>Es de la misma calidad que el original.</li>
            <li>It is clean and soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The ordering experience was user friendly and quick.  </li>
            <li>This is true but don&#x27;t be deceived this is not a respironics product.</li>
            <li>A good replacement, I think, for the person who must buy supplies on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>it is very comfortable and robust.........and at a decent price.</li>
            <li>I got what was advertised; however the flap tore quickly and the gel leaked making it unusable.</li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly and undamaged.</li>
            <li>definitely better than the classic nasal mask.</li>
            <li>Important to have the wright size as it&#x27;s very misleading when you buy these products, must be familiar with the product names</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable and easily replaced my old one</li>
            <li>This Nasal Replacement Cushion is worth what you pay for.</li>
            <li>It was nice that I didn&#x27;t have to purchase the entire unit for my husband.</li>
            <li>I thought I researched it well enough to be confident in ordering, but it doesn&#x27;t fit my respironics mask.</li>
            <li>The Comfort Gel Blue Nasal was good has the ones would cost twice as much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the right mask cousion and</li>
            <li>Snapped right on my mask and no leaks.  </li>
            <li>I received the right item and we&#x27;ll with in the promise date</li>
            <li>It is not as comfortable as the Respironics  comfort classic but what a difference in price.  </li>
            <li>The ComfortGel mask is a good one as it fits my face tightly without any concern of air leakage.  </li>
            <li>Its a good replacement, the gel and material tend lose a little over the course of a year.  </li>
            <li>Its takes 5 seconds to pop the old out and pop the new in, make sure you have the right size.</li>
            <li>This was my first time buying these types of products on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>All the others I have purchased were Resperonics brand and had instructions on how to shape it with hot water.</li>
            <li>You would be better off going through a medical supply company.  </li>
            <li>It is better than replacing the entire mask.  </li>
            <li>I love the ComfortGel  Blue Nasal cushion/flaps.  </li>
            <li>Product was exactly what he needed and arrived on time.  </li>
            <li>Compared to what you can get at cpap.com stores at a higher price, you can certainly feel the difference in quality.</li>
            <li>I will be able to use this for a long time.</li>
            <li>Important to replace your CPAP mask regularly and at this price I can afford to.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>the product description was absolutely incorrect.</li>
            <li>Basically that is all I really needed anyway.  </li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend them to anyone needing CPAP supplies!</li>
            <li>Thanks for take the stress off ordering on line</li>
            <li>quality product, fast delivery</li>
            <li>THANKS FOR YOUR HELP WITH THIS.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li>Tends to rub high part of my check though.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend .</li>
            <li>This part maybe of good quality, but for me was the wrong shopping, because that is not matching with the first product that I bought in the same shopping order (ResMed Quattro FX Full Face Mask Frame System-No Headgear (Medium)).</li>
            <li>Gel was a bit more firm than I&#x27;d like, but I am still using it every night.</li>
            <li>From the pics, it looked like the old thicker cushion but was just the new thinner less comfortable, less likely to make a good seal flap.</li>
            <li>Product in new condition.</li>
            <li>We needed a new one, it works like it is supposed to although it takes a while fot my husband to get used to it.</li>
            <li>I finally opened it only to find it wouldn&#x27;t fit my mask.</li>
            <li>This is the exact same mask and fits the head gear.</li>
            <li>I stopped ordering masks through insurance and started buying them directly!</li>
            <li>These are the same exact cushions I purchased from CPAP to Go for triple the cost.</li>
            <li>The old adage stands, &amp;#34;You Get What You Pay For&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>It feels like a 3 month old cushion already</li>
            <li>I just reused the outer flap with the old gel.  </li>
            <li>As stated this is the complete cushion and flap.</li>
            <li>This cushion is so much softer then the regular mask</li>
            <li>I paid for this outnof pocket and still paid almost 1/2 as much as I had been paying AFTER my medical insurance paid.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than buying entire new set of headgear which is what a lot of the medical supply companies want you to do</li>
            <li>did i mention that Amazon makes it available at a small fraction of its &amp;#34;official cpap store&amp;#34; price?</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s cushion finally wore out and she needed a new one.  </li>
            <li>The quality and fit was below the orginial equipment purchased, leaks air and make noises, making it hard to sleep.</li>
            <li>This was a timely order and my first order of this and some other related items needed.</li>
            <li>I have had good luck with this product in the past; however this one was not a good value at all.</li>
            <li>(In the past, he charged us something like $100 for a whole new mask, not letting us know we could just buy this part.)  </li>

            <li> I received the right item and we&#x27;ll with in the promise date</li>
            <li> It is not as comfortable as the Respironics  comfort classic but what a difference in price.  </li>
            <li> The ComfortGel mask is a good one as it fits my face tightly without any concern of air leakage.  </li>
            <li> Its a good replacement, the gel and material tend lose a little over the course of a year.  </li>
            <li> Its takes 5 seconds to pop the old out and pop the new in, make sure you have the right size.</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying these types of products on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> All the others I have purchased were Resperonics brand and had instructions on how to shape it with hot water.</li>
            <li> You would be better off going through a medical supply company.  </li>
            <li> It is better than replacing the entire mask.  </li>
            <li> I love the ComfortGel  Blue Nasal cushion/flaps.  </li>
            <li> Product was exactly what he needed and arrived on time.  </li>
            <li> Compared to what you can get at cpap.com stores at a higher price, you can certainly feel the difference in quality.</li>
            <li> I will be able to use this for a long time.</li>
            <li> Important to replace your CPAP mask regularly and at this price I can afford to.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> the product description was absolutely incorrect.</li>
            <li> Basically that is all I really needed anyway.  </li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY recommend them to anyone needing CPAP supplies!</li>
            <li> Thanks for take the stress off ordering on line</li>
            <li> quality product, fast delivery</li>
            <li> THANKS FOR YOUR HELP WITH THIS.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> Tends to rub high part of my check though.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend .</li>
            <li> This part maybe of good quality, but for me was the wrong shopping, because that is not matching with the first product that I bought in the same shopping order (ResMed Quattro FX Full Face Mask Frame System-No Headgear (Medium)).</li>
            <li> Gel was a bit more firm than I&#x27;d like, but I am still using it every night.</li>
            <li> From the pics, it looked like the old thicker cushion but was just the new thinner less comfortable, less likely to make a good seal flap.</li>
            <li> Product in new condition.</li>
            <li> We needed a new one, it works like it is supposed to although it takes a while fot my husband to get used to it.</li>
            <li> I finally opened it only to find it wouldn&#x27;t fit my mask.</li>
            <li> This is the exact same mask and fits the head gear.</li>
            <li> I stopped ordering masks through insurance and started buying them directly!</li>
            <li> These are the same exact cushions I purchased from CPAP to Go for triple the cost.</li>
            <li> The old adage stands, &amp;#34;You Get What You Pay For&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> It feels like a 3 month old cushion already</li>
            <li> I just reused the outer flap with the old gel.  </li>
            <li> As stated this is the complete cushion and flap.</li>
            <li> This cushion is so much softer then the regular mask</li>
            <li> I paid for this outnof pocket and still paid almost 1/2 as much as I had been paying AFTER my medical insurance paid.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than buying entire new set of headgear which is what a lot of the medical supply companies want you to do</li>
            <li> did i mention that Amazon makes it available at a small fraction of its &amp;#34;official cpap store&amp;#34; price?</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s cushion finally wore out and she needed a new one.  </li>
            <li> The quality and fit was below the orginial equipment purchased, leaks air and make noises, making it hard to sleep.</li>
            <li> This was a timely order and my first order of this and some other related items needed.</li>
            <li> I have had good luck with this product in the past; however this one was not a good value at all.</li>
            <li> (In the past, he charged us something like $100 for a whole new mask, not letting us know we could just buy this part.)  </li>
            <li> From past experience, I did not want to go back to the prescribing doctor, because he charges &#x27;way too much for the same thing.  </li>
            <li> Only a  few weeks old</li>
            <li> I spent 4 days looking, measuring, and everything I could prior to opening the package, because once I did, I would be stuck with it.</li>
            <li> It only cover the nose and not the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my fault for getting it a little short; nevertheless it was what we needed.</li>
            <li> The blue gel had a strong chemical smell that was so bad</li>
            <li> Would not fit my mask, last time I do internet buying,and now I am stuck with this,..</li>
            <li> The size is medium and it does not fit the medium frame that I ordered recently.  </li>
            <li> not much to this product it works well and arrives as shown.</li>
            <li> still causes abrasion on my upper lip just below the nose after a few days, focing rotation to another CPAP mask..</li>
            <li> I was not able to find this local in my area and the place that I received the equipment was not helpful at all.</li>
            <li> I threw the item out as it was only a small size stamped on it and was advertised as &amp;#34;medium</li>
            <li> I have considered trying other masks, but have always ordered the ComfortGel.</li>
            <li> Cpap stuff gets expensive fast.  </li>
            <li> I guess I need to say more so the idiot programer that makes the verification turn the button on</li>
            <li> So, if it doesn&#x27;t work you are just throwing your money down the drain!</li>
            <li> wasted time and money</li>
            <li> It does not fit as well as</li>
            <li> Advertised as medium but does not fit my medium mask.</li>
            <li> Now, everything is broken up into pieces and is priced at what it would have cost for the entire thing.</li>
            <li> The flap though is a consumable item which needs to be replaced in about 12 months as I dissemble the mask everyday for cleaning.</li>
            <li> I have been without insurance for a few months and finding this product online and affordable was a dream come true!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Did not fit my unit&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not easy to find the replacement parts one needs when one does not have insurance can be quite taxing!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I need one that fits and you can have this useless piece back.</li>
            <li> I ordered the medium when I forgot I usually get small.</li>
            <li> Very thin and simply doe not work.</li>
            <li> They are hard to find but this was just as described.</li>
            <li> The picture makes it look like the gel is thick and comfy</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I took one of them out of the wrapping thinking I was putting it on the other piece</li>
            <li> There was nothing wrong with this mask, but it was the wrong size for the equipment my husband currently has.  </li>
            <li> It works but not nearly as good as OEM</li>
            <li> Sorry, I lost in this buying.</li>
            <li> ......totally useless.</li>
            <li> The gel is very thin and not&lt;br /&gt;very</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed</li>
            <li> This was the worst purchase I made on Amazon....</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good quality product that matches the Resperonics equipment well.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect replacement.  Much cheaper than buying entire new set of headgear which is what a lot of the medical supply companies want you to do</li>
            <li> just as pictured, easy to replace the old one.works really good.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable mask...glad to find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> great as good as advertize</li>
            <li> This was a miracle find for me. I was in dire need of this item and was so thrilled I found it on amazon. It&#x27;s comfortable and easily replaced my old one</li>
            <li> This is the real deal replacement, good as the original I got with my machine, because its the name brand. Very comfortable for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the right mask cousion and the price is better than anywhere else I could find it.</li>
            <li> I was not able to find this local in my area and the place that I received the equipment was not helpful at all. The product shipped and I received it as scheduled with out any issue&#x27;s and the products are great quality and I am able to relax with a good nights sleep.</li>
            <li> This is great value for a product like this. Glad we have access for this. I used this to replace an older worn out cushion and it works flawlessly.</li>
            <li> Original replacement very easy to install.</li>
            <li> Comfort Gel Blue Nasal Replacement cushion/flap. This is true but don&#x27;t be deceived this is not a respironics product. It works but not nearly as good as OEM</li>
            <li> My medical supply company will only allow me to purchase the entire mask and head gear costing almost 200.00. Although my insurance pays some, not all you can&#x27;t beat this. This is the exact same mask and fits the head gear.</li>
            <li> The old adage stands, &amp;#34;You Get What You Pay For&amp;#34;.  This Nasal Replacement Cushion is worth what you pay for. It is well made&lt;br /&gt;but short on comfort gel. The picture makes it look like the gel is thick and comfy but it is misleading. The gel is very thin and not&lt;br /&gt;very comfortable. I got it for my husband and he won&#x27;t use it. We are keeping it for an emergency back up.</li>
            <li> These are thinner than what I had before but work perfectly and are lighter, I&#x27;ll order them again.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You.</li>
            <li> This part maybe of good quality, but for me was the wrong shopping, because that is not matching with the first product that I bought in the same shopping order (ResMed Quattro FX Full Face Mask Frame System-No Headgear (Medium)). Sorry, I lost in this buying.</li>
            <li> Nonexistent cushioning. Very thin and simply doe not work. A good one will cost around thirty dollars, so you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Would not fit my mask, last time I do internet buying,and now I am stuck with this,.. wasted time and money</li>
            <li> My husband is on a Cpap machine. This is the style that is more comfy for him. He is pleased every time. We have to replace it every 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> I seems to be a knock off.  It does not fit as well as MANY others I have owed.  This was my first time buying these types of products on Amazon.  All the others I have purchased were Resperonics brand and had instructions on how to shape it with hot water. (I never do).  This one came with a sheet specifically stating NOT to do that.</li>
            <li> Important to replace your CPAP mask regularly and at this price I can afford to.&lt;br /&gt;Very comfortable mask and seals well,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this exact item with my cpap set-up and it is excellent. Good fit, very comfortable, and well made. Recommended. Oh... did i mention that Amazon makes it available at a small fraction of its &amp;#34;official cpap store&amp;#34; price?</li>
            <li> From the pics, it looked like the old thicker cushion but was just the new thinner less comfortable, less likely to make a good seal flap.</li>
            <li> Love this product................I use nightly........it is very comfortable and robust.........and at a decent price. A good replacement, I think, for the person who must buy supplies on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> for the price you get what you pay for. Compared to what you can get at cpap.com stores at a higher price, you can certainly feel the difference in quality.</li>
            <li> The size is medium and it does not fit the medium frame that I ordered recently.  I am very disappointed, I need one that fits and you can have this useless piece back.</li>
            <li> Only a  few weeks old and it appears that the product may have a defect. Its not as cushy as it should be.  It feels like a 3 month old cushion already</li>
            <li> Never found any mask I love, but this one fits my machine and is relatively comfortable. Tends to rub high part of my check though.</li>
            <li> Advertised as medium but does not fit my medium mask. can I return since never used?</li>
            <li> I got what was advertised; however the flap tore quickly and the gel leaked making it unusable. I have had good luck with this product in the past; however this one was not a good value at all.</li>
            <li> This is the best gell mask you can get.  My health provider coundnt get me one but junk so I bought this one thank you  Del</li>
            <li> This was the worst purchase I made on Amazon....the product description was absolutely incorrect. I threw the item out as it was only a small size stamped on it and was advertised as &amp;#34;medium......totally useless.</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to this over the &#x27;factory&#x27; face mask that comes with your CPAP, but over time, it really is awesome. No waking up with the fishbowl face like before. This with a comfortable holder, and of course head gear and you will like your CPAP more.</li>
            <li> Great price,great product</li>
            <li> The quality and fit was below the orginial equipment purchased, leaks air and make noises, making it hard to sleep.</li>
            <li> Perfect OE replacement for my Respironics  CPAP mask.</li>
            <li> Genuine Respironics replacement part.  Will buy from again.</li>
            <li> Excellent shipping time. Product in new condition. No problems. Very fair price!</li>
            <li> The replacement flap was perfect, it was the one that I needed and the price was within my budget.  Arrive immediately and I used it the same night.</li>
            <li> The blue gel had a strong chemical smell that was so bad I just reused the outer flap with the old gel.  Basically that is all I really needed anyway.  After a couple of weeks it seems that the smell wasn&#x27;t as strong as before, but being that every breath I take is thru that gel didn&#x27;t seem like a good idea.</li>
            <li> As stated this is the complete cushion and flap. It is the same quality as the ones sold by medical supply stores and fits the mask.</li>
            <li> Cpap stuff gets expensive fast.  Bought this for a friend.</li>
            <li> Double check to see that it fits your model number. It is make, packaged, and shipped well. No issues here, just my faule in not checking the application. Not the mfgs fault all my own.</li>
            <li> Its a good replacement, the gel and material tend lose a little over the course of a year.  Its takes 5 seconds to pop the old out and pop the new in, make sure you have the right size.</li>
            <li> great replacement exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> not much to this product it works well and arrives as shown. I will definitely be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly as described and saves me money because I do not have to replace my full mask when this part wears out---and this is one of the 2 parts that wears out easily! Glad I stopped ordering masks through insurance and started buying them directly!</li>
            <li> It was nice that I didn&#x27;t have to purchase the entire unit for my husband. These replacement parts are perfect!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for what I was trying to accomplish.&lt;br /&gt;It just wasn&#x27;t what I needed for my mask to work.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, most comfortable mask of all I tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent service, on time as described at great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have used this vendor several times.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly and undamaged. This cushion is so much softer then the regular mask but like all of them, will eventually pick up an odor unless you wash it every couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Not as good a fit  as original this one is thinner so the seal is not as good as original.</li>
            <li> You would be better off going through a medical supply company.  I would not recommend buying products like this on- line because there is no guarantee that it will work for you.  You don&#x27;t get to try it before you buy it!  So, if it doesn&#x27;t work you are just throwing your money down the drain!</li>
            <li> Since I have to use a cpap machine, I want it to be comfortable.  The ComfortGel mask fits my needs and is comfortable all night.</li>
            <li> I just received this product today. As stated, this is a medium, but it doesn&#x27;t fit any of my medium mask. I&#x27;m seeking to return this product.</li>
            <li> I found that out of the masks available in the market the most confortable and reliable of all are the one that uses the gel cushion.</li>
            <li> Used to be this was sold with the Headgear and tubing as a set. Now, everything is broken up into pieces and is priced at what it would have cost for the entire thing. I can&#x27;t even find the entire assembly anymore. Progress?</li>
            <li> Snapped right on my mask and no leaks.  It is better than replacing the entire mask.  They are hard to find but this was just as described.</li>
            <li> I thought I researched it well enough to be confident in ordering, but it doesn&#x27;t fit my respironics mask. I spent 4 days looking, measuring, and everything I could prior to opening the package, because once I did, I would be stuck with it. I finally opened it only to find it wouldn&#x27;t fit my mask. I&#x27;m surprised so many people have good luck right away. I&#x27;m on my 5th mask and the only one that worked has been discontinued by respironics. I was hoping to extend the life of my one good mask by buying a replacement cushion/flap. I may open my own store with all the pieces I now have that don&#x27;t fit and were used at most 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> I could not be more please or satisfied with this company. They were the best to deal with. I would HIGHLY recommend them to anyone needing CPAP supplies!</li>
            <li> THis was a great buy for me at the time, and I am happy with it, So Please if need a gel mask like this check it out.</li>
            <li> As advertised.  Medium size replacement for the respironics headgear.  Item arrived different than what was pictured, without the plactic flap.  Seller was contacted and sent the additional parts out immediately.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> AS per the advertised description.  Great item.  I am very pleased with it. I will be able to use this for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is a very comfortable mask liner.  It helps stop leaks and reduces the marks on my face in the morning.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Respironics BIPAP machine for over 3 years.  It is performing well.  The ComfortGel mask is a good one as it fits my face tightly without any concern of air leakage.  The flap though is a consumable item which needs to be replaced in about 12 months as I dissemble the mask everyday for cleaning.</li>
            <li> It is not as comfortable as the Respironics  comfort classic but what a difference in price.  Cleaning is simpler, too.</li>
            <li> I received the right item and we&#x27;ll with in the promise date</li>
            <li> as good as or better than original.</li>
            <li> I love the ComfortGel  Blue Nasal cushion/flaps.  The only problem is that I couldn&#x27;t find the Size S and had to order the M.&lt;br /&gt;They are labeled as S/M.  It is too big,</li>
            <li> Gel was a bit more firm than I&#x27;d like, but I am still using it every night. Price was great</li>
            <li> As described and works well. What can I say it is just like the one that came with my machine.</li>
            <li> works like its sposed to.  no big thrill.  well-packaged?  still causes abrasion on my upper lip just below the nose after a few days, focing rotation to another CPAP mask..</li>
            <li> There was nothing wrong with this mask, but it was the wrong size for the equipment my husband currently has.  Unfortunately, I took one of them out of the wrapping thinking I was putting it on the other piece and it wouldn&#x27;t fit; now I cannot get my money back and am stuck with something my husband can&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> Husband loves the comfortgel blue nasal replacement cushion.  He can still continue to get his rest.</li>
            <li> I choose this mask by looking at the picture. It only cover the nose and not the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my fault for getting it a little short; nevertheless it was what we needed.</li>
            <li> This was a timely order and my first order of this and some other related items needed. I am impressed with the quality of the item and began using it immediately. The order arrived ahead of the scheduled delivery. I do recommend this supplier and plan to make future reorders.</li>
            <li> We needed a new one, it works like it is supposed to although it takes a while fot my husband to get used to it.</li>
            <li> I ordered the medium when I forgot I usually get small. No matter though. Still works great. I highly recommend . Great price too.</li>
            <li> instead of having to use my insurance, I was able to buy this replacement gel mask at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> The Comfort Gel Blue Nasal was good has the ones would cost twice as much. The ordering experience was user friendly and quick.  Thanks for take the stress off ordering on line</li>
            <li> I have been without insurance for a few months and finding this product online and affordable was a dream come true!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not easy to find the replacement parts one needs when one does not have insurance can be quite taxing!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loved the product! Love the fit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will DEFINITELY order again!!!</li>
            <li> Saved me about $250 that it would have cost to replace my mask through a mainstream vendor. I&#x27;m a happy camper.</li>
            <li> Bought this together with the frame, make sure you have the correct size. It was a great fit on my frame and the comfort it provides is top notch. definitely better than the classic nasal mask.</li>
            <li> Es exactamente como el que me trajo la maquina que me empuja aire. Es de la misma calidad que el original.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s cushion finally wore out and she needed a new one.  From past experience, I did not want to go back to the prescribing doctor, because he charges &#x27;way too much for the same thing.  (In the past, he charged us something like $100 for a whole new mask, not letting us know we could just buy this part.)  So I tried this... it came quickly, arrived in good shape, and all I had to do was unsnap the old cushion&#x27;s frame and snap this one on.  It is a perfect fit.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hoping it would b ok. It was the same manufacture as what I had been buying at my medical supply store. I paid for this outnof pocket and still paid almost 1/2 as much as I had been paying AFTER my medical insurance paid.</li>
            <li> These are the same exact cushions I purchased from CPAP to Go for triple the cost. That&#x27;s the last time I purchase cushions from CPAP to Go. Try them if you currently buy them from another source. They are the same great quality.</li>
            <li> quality product, fast delivery</li>
            <li> I have used the ComfortGel Nasal cushion for 5 years. I have considered trying other masks, but have always ordered the ComfortGel. Very happy.</li>
            <li> AS DESCRIBED. THANKS FOR YOUR HELP WITH THIS. NOW I JUST NEED THE CUSION THAT GOES ACROSS THE FORHEAD. THANKS</li>
            <li> My husband is please with it.</li>
            <li> Husband was thrilled to get this replacement mask.  He can now breath properly again with his C pap.  Product was exactly what he needed and arrived on time.  Would definitely order from them again.</li>
            <li> Did not fit my unit&lt;br /&gt;OK I guess I need to say more so the idiot programer that makes the verification turn the button on Oh there it is..</li>
            <li> This mask leaks air around the bridge of my nose! I have readjusted my head gear multiple times, but cannot get rid of the leak</li>
            <li> I am enjoying the product. It fits well and comfotable. It is clean and soft.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping package of the product was excellent to protect the shape of product.&lt;br /&gt;I will use same service for next replacement.</li>
            <li> Important to have the wright size as it&#x27;s very misleading when you buy these products, must be familiar with the product names</li>
