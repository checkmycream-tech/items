            <li>It really is the best.</li>
            <li>These brushes have a nice springy bristle pad.</li>
            <li>I have loved spornette for most of my life</li>
            <li>This is a nice brush and is better than what I have seen in the store for this style of brush.  </li>
            <li>easy to hold and nice on your scalp&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this brush.</li>
            <li>I immediately thought of how I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use this on my kids</li>
            <li>However, now all it does is put static in my hair.</li>
            <li>Leaves a nice smooth shine.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my hair, and I love it.</li>
            <li>Can you tell I love this brush?</li>
            <li>I love this brush and my girls love it as well.</li>
            <li>But truthfully, you&#x27;ll love either.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely better than some.</li>
            <li>Most brushes won&#x27;t brush out curly hair</li>
            <li>Great product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>They just don&#x27;t seem to make the model I want any more.</li>
            <li>Feels great to brush your hair without too much pulling.</li>
            <li>We just wish it had more of a grip on the handle.  </li>
            <li>Its a great all-around and easy to use</li>
            <li>This is the best brush for long hair because it doesn&#x27;t pull your hair when you have tangles.  </li>
            <li>Great for detangling, and making your hair look and feel soft!</li>
            <li>(it works just as well, but is even more comfortable to use).</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;m glad it was cheap because after two strokes I realized that this brush would rip my hair to shreds.</li>
            <li>I own two of these, one for myself and one for my fianc√©, because she liked mine so much, which is rare.</li>
            <li>I attempted a couple of strokes, but the bristles&#x27; burrs kept snagging on my fine hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work on my daughter&#x27;s fine hair as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>At first the brush was suitable for smoothing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always the same great quality.</li>
            <li>bristle ends need to be capped with a smooth end-cap.</li>
            <li>Almost as good as my old horsehair brush.</li>
            <li>This brush is even better for tangles and fine hair; very gentle</li>
            <li>My daughters and I all have long hair and the brush has worked great for that.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just right for my fine, curly hair.  </li>
            <li>It feels great and doesn&#x27;t hurt like other brushes.</li>
            <li>Works good on long hair, not scratchy and</li>
            <li>and I also have extensions and these brushes are the best for long or short hair.  </li>
            <li>I hope this lasts as many years as the old one did.</li>
            <li>Both my thinner hair and my daughter&#x27;s thicker hair were brushed easily and comfortably with this brush.</li>
            <li>Other than that it works well and feels pretty good.</li>
            <li>I have really long, fine hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li>Great for my short hair, and the wife says they work well on her long hair, the flexible springy pad helps prevent knots.</li>
            <li>This might be ok for use as a pet or doll hair brush, but I&#x27;d never recommend its use on human hair.</li>
            <li>I actually bought a spare brush just to be sure I always have one.</li>
            <li>Not a styling brush, but good for combing through hair to tame or stimulate follicles.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why, but this brush simply works better, gets tangles out quicker, and works great on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li>I am pleased to have purchased it and hope it lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li>All the store ones just weren&#x27;t strong enough to do that.  </li>
            <li>I plan to do more research now and invest in a natural bristle hairbrush; that&#x27;s pretty much what I was planning to do, anyway, but the low cost of the Spornette won out.</li>
            <li>It glides through my hair so well that it doesn&#x27;t snap my hair, and I can brush my hair so much quicker.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on the hair, yet it feels like it massages your scalp and works through the hair.</li>
            <li>Also gentle.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like it...</li>
            <li>I was buying them from a hair dresser for $20 each and this seller so much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>It went effortlessly through our very curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I have long, curly, fine hair- lots of it</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite brush, it is not too soft for long hair.</li>
            <li>I have very long, fine hair and this brush</li>
            <li>I have always had medium-long hair, and other brushes just don&#x27;t work as effectively on tangles or just general brushing.</li>
            <li>I do realize that one shouldn&#x27;t attempt detangling with such a brush; I&#x27;d made sure to detangle prior to using the Spornette.</li>
            <li>But really, it isn&#x27;t that big of a deal to me because it is strong enough for tough and/or quick brushing day to day, and I can do better about taking care of my things.</li>
            <li>The luxury brush&#x27;s cushion is much softer like my old one -</li>
            <li>Makes unmanageable wild hair very coiffed &amp; dapper.</li>
            <li>I was eager to receive my new brush, based on all of the 4- and 5-star reviews.</li>
            <li>I have a tangle teezer and was excited to see a similar brush that actually had a handle.</li>
            <li>I also broke down and bought the Spornette Luxury Cushion Large because my old brush had some wilted bristles (an encounter with a very hot blow drying 10 years ago - not that it stopped me from using it).</li>
            <li>You do have to take care of it and clean it often, other than that..</li>
            <li>Real nice brush have used one similar to this in the years past this is just a little stiffer</li>
            <li>I can brush from the roots to the ends, right out of the shower, without tearing a single strand.  </li>
            <li>Unexpected quality from China.</li>
            <li>It is not harsh on your scalp at all.</li>
            <li>This is simply an old wig brush...</li>
            <li>Trust me, this brush will work for your 5 year old or a 50 year old.  </li>
            <li>so far hasn&#x27;t pulled any of the bristles out.</li>
            <li>My husband really liked it, though, and he has short, thick hair.  </li>
            <li>and I finally had to replace it with this new one.</li>
            <li>Over the years I&#x27;ve bought other brushes that look like this and cost more money, but I never liked them as much, so I always go back.</li>
            <li>I discovered it in the early 90&#x27;s and have only gone through 3.</li>
            <li>Bought it for somebody else who finally gave up their old one like this.</li>
            <li>I still use it and love it, broken handle and all.</li>
            <li>Good price,  but feels somewhat awkward in my hand.</li>
            <li>The body of the brush is made in one piece so the handle wont snap off-be wary of brushes with a \\&quot;decorative\\&quot; silver ring between the handle and brush part they snap very easily.</li>
            <li>When I first received this brush I was very surprised how hard the bristles are.</li>
            <li>The bristles in the new brush seem a little stiffer, but that just may be because it&#x27;s new.  </li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m sure my old one has been very broken in.</li>
            <li>My hair is down to my waste and it&#x27;s baby fine.  </li>
            <li>The large size is a little hard to travel with, but it&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>

            <li> and I finally had to replace it with this new one.</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve bought other brushes that look like this and cost more money, but I never liked them as much, so I always go back.</li>
            <li> I discovered it in the early 90&#x27;s and have only gone through 3.</li>
            <li> Bought it for somebody else who finally gave up their old one like this.</li>
            <li> I still use it and love it, broken handle and all.</li>
            <li> Good price,  but feels somewhat awkward in my hand.</li>
            <li> The body of the brush is made in one piece so the handle wont snap off-be wary of brushes with a \\&quot;decorative\\&quot; silver ring between the handle and brush part they snap very easily.</li>
            <li> When I first received this brush I was very surprised how hard the bristles are.</li>
            <li> The bristles in the new brush seem a little stiffer, but that just may be because it&#x27;s new.  </li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m sure my old one has been very broken in.</li>
            <li> My hair is down to my waste and it&#x27;s baby fine.  </li>
            <li> The large size is a little hard to travel with, but it&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
            <li> I have tons of thick corse hair and this only gets to about 2/3 of it, I rarely reach my scalp</li>
            <li> The nylon bristles are stiff and get both top and bottom layers with one stroke even on my daughter&#x27;s thick hair.</li>
            <li> The brush I loved and had for 15 years went kaput. :(</li>
            <li> Sometimes the bristles get pushed into the cushion and you have to tug them out again, but as long as you don&#x27;t let it get sun scorched, it will last a really long time.</li>
            <li> This one is well made&lt;br /&gt;and being that I have long hair</li>
            <li> My first one literally lasted 40 years and is still useable, just missing a few bristles.</li>
            <li> They work better than the expensive ones made for horses!</li>
            <li> I would recomend this brush to anyone that has color treated hair or just very long hair.  </li>
            <li> But this brush has a slight curve to it, which causes the bristles to spread out a little, so it doesn&#x27;t feel as dense as my old favorites.</li>
            <li> Nothing combs through it like this brush, wet or dry!</li>
            <li> so maybe it takes a little getting used to, but I actually like how it feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to say that I&#x27;m more than a bit shocked, now.</li>
            <li> Careful not to drop it or</li>
            <li> It is not too rough which I like</li>
            <li> It just felt too rough on my scalp and hair.</li>
            <li> It &#x27;s slippery when wet.</li>
            <li> The bristles are rough, blunt and sharp because they seem to be seared to keep them from fraying.</li>
            <li> Stiff cushioned nylon bristles, with flat burrs on the tips.</li>
            <li> Other than the hardness, I don&#x27;t have any complaint.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a brush like this that broke, so I tried a couple other kinds of brushes....</li>
            <li> I think that is because they were only used to those brushes with the little round tips...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve broken several of them dropping them in the shower, and am down to my last two.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;flat burrs\\&quot; that another reviewer mentioned are so harsh, sharp, and scratchy on their edges and undersides that I fail to see how the bristles wouldn&#x27;t cause considerable damage to hair!</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair down to my thighs and it takes care of all my snarls and tangles without any pain.</li>
            <li> unless I divide my hair in half.</li>
            <li> I had a couple roommates long ago who tried my brush and said the bristles are too hard on their scalp...</li>
            <li> There is lots of look alikes, but no true Spornette.i</li>
            <li> I wanted a brush that had bristles without the little knobs on the ends.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what manufacturers are thinking with the little balls on the ends of the brushes these days.  </li>
            <li> Dead skin under my nails creeps me out.</li>
            <li> I think when mine broke, it had been dropped a few times already over a period of time.</li>
            <li> was stiff and it scratched my scalp.  </li>
            <li> Have had this brush in the past.</li>
            <li> My husband has used one of these brushes for the past six years</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I was shocked how stiff the cushion was on the new brush</li>
            <li> This brush bristles are so hard you can&#x27;t let them touch your scalp.</li>
            <li> and I have really thick tangle prone hair.</li>
            <li> thick hair?  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Have had this brush in the past. Goes through your hair without pulling it. Massages the scalp.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Best hairbrush ever! I will never use any brush than this one.  I have been brushing my hair with this brush type for 20 years and still going.  Careful not to drop it or the handle can break off.  I still use it and love it, broken handle and all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best brush I&#x27;ve ever had. It glides through my hair so well that it doesn&#x27;t snap my hair, and I can brush my hair so much quicker. It&#x27;s a sturdy brush too, it hasn&#x27;t fallen apart and I have really thick tangle prone hair. It really is the best.</li>
            <li> Unexpected quality from China. Stiff cushioned nylon bristles, with flat burrs on the tips. Detangles, massages the scalp without scratching and brings out the shine. Almost as good as my old horsehair brush.</li>
            <li> My daughters and I all have long hair and the brush has worked great for that.  Good brush for the money.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush. It is gentle on the hair, yet it feels like it massages your scalp and works through the hair. It is not harsh on your scalp at all. You do have to take care of it and clean it often, other than that..its a great brush for a great price. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This is an excellent brush! Both my thinner hair and my daughter&#x27;s thicker hair were brushed easily and comfortably with this brush. The nylon bristles are stiff and get both top and bottom layers with one stroke even on my daughter&#x27;s thick hair. The body of the brush is made in one piece so the handle wont snap off-be wary of brushes with a \\&quot;decorative\\&quot; silver ring between the handle and brush part they snap very easily. Amazon&#x27;s price is excellent! Get this brush you will be very happy!</li>
            <li> When I first received this brush I was very surprised how hard the bristles are. I immediately thought of how I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use this on my kids so I guess I&#x27;ll try it out for myself. At first the brush was suitable for smoothing.  However, now all it does is put static in my hair. It is good for getting out the tangles if you have longer hair.   Probably would not buy it again if I already had one.</li>
            <li> Love this brush- Won&#x27;t use anything else! I discovered it in the early 90&#x27;s and have only gone through 3. Sometimes the bristles get pushed into the cushion and you have to tug them out again, but as long as you don&#x27;t let it get sun scorched, it will last a really long time. I have wavy hair down to my thighs and it takes care of all my snarls and tangles without any pain. Leaves a nice smooth shine. The large size is a little hard to travel with, but it&#x27;s completely worth it. Buy several!</li>
            <li> These brushes have a nice springy bristle pad. For just $6 a piece you can&#x27;t go wrong. Great for my short hair, and the wife says they work well on her long hair, the flexible springy pad helps prevent knots.</li>
            <li> This is my second Spornette brush.  My first one literally lasted 40 years and is still useable, just missing a few bristles. The bristles in the new brush seem a little stiffer, but that just may be because it&#x27;s new.  Over the years I&#x27;ve bought other brushes that look like this and cost more money, but I never liked them as much, so I always go back.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush.  I have used it for years. I finally found it online.  There is lots of look alikes, but no true Spornette.i</li>
            <li> I bought this for my hair, and I love it. It makes my scalp feel great. However, I found another use. My husband loves back scratches and I hate giving them. Dead skin under my nails creeps me out. This brush is perfect for scratching. So I have two brushes now - one for my hair and one for him.</li>
            <li> This is a good, sturdy, inexpensive brush for all hair types.  I am pleased to have purchased it and hope it lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> My husband has used one of these brushes for the past six years and I finally had to replace it with this new one. It&#x27;s always the same great quality.</li>
            <li> Can you tell I love this brush? I have really long, fine hair that tangles easily. Other brushes are painful to use. I had just about given up on finding a good one when I saw the good reviews for this one. Believe me, it lives up to the reviews! This is the only brush I&#x27;m buying from now on!</li>
            <li> thick hair?  this is the best!!!</li>
            <li> I was eager to receive my new brush, based on all of the 4- and 5-star reviews. I have to say that I&#x27;m more than a bit shocked, now. This brush ranks among the most uncomfortable hair implements I&#x27;ve ever tried or used. The \\&quot;flat burrs\\&quot; that another reviewer mentioned are so harsh, sharp, and scratchy on their edges and undersides that I fail to see how the bristles wouldn&#x27;t cause considerable damage to hair! I attempted a couple of strokes, but the bristles&#x27; burrs kept snagging on my fine hair. I do realize that one shouldn&#x27;t attempt detangling with such a brush; I&#x27;d made sure to detangle prior to using the Spornette. This might be ok for use as a pet or doll hair brush, but I&#x27;d never recommend its use on human hair. Thank goodness it was inexpensive! I plan to do more research now and invest in a natural bristle hairbrush; that&#x27;s pretty much what I was planning to do, anyway, but the low cost of the Spornette won out. Guess I should&#x27;ve listened to my intuition instead of my wallet... :(</li>
            <li> I own two of these, one for myself and one for my fianc√©, because she liked mine so much, which is rare. This is a nice brush and is better than what I have seen in the store for this style of brush.  It gets the knots out without making it feel like I am ripping my hair out.</li>
            <li> I love this brush and my girls love it as well. It feels great and doesn&#x27;t hurt like other brushes.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and I also have extensions and these brushes are the best for long or short hair.  All my friends keep taking them and I have to replace them because they are the best!</li>
            <li> As a hairdresser we always used the Spornette brand brush in our shops, so I thought it would be the same. Well, as you know nothing stays the same. This brush bristles are so hard you can&#x27;t let them touch your scalp. OUCH!</li>
            <li> The best brushes in the world for double-coated dogs.</li>
            <li> Other than the hardness, I don&#x27;t have any complaint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristle ends need to be capped with a smooth end-cap.</li>
            <li> easy to hold and nice on your scalp&lt;br /&gt;Does a good job of coating your hair with the oils from your head, yet leaves your hair smooth and &#x27;happy&#x27;</li>
            <li> After going thru 2 brushes bought in stores I found this.  It gets thru the hair to the scalp.  All the store ones just weren&#x27;t strong enough to do that.  And I don&#x27;t ahve thick hair.  So this perfect.  Will order an extra.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this spornette brush for 16 years, and finally bought another to use in the kid&#x27;s bathroom! I tried 2 others thinking it was silly to track this one down, but no matter what I bought, we always ended up running to my bathroom to get the brush that everyone likes. Gets snarls out without hurting - just amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I noticed: I was shocked how stiff the cushion was on the new brush - I&#x27;m sure my old one has been very broken in. I like it softer (it works just as well, but is even more comfortable to use). I also broke down and bought the Spornette Luxury Cushion Large because my old brush had some wilted bristles (an encounter with a very hot blow drying 10 years ago - not that it stopped me from using it). The luxury brush&#x27;s cushion is much softer like my old one - so for the best comfort, I&#x27;d go with that one. But truthfully, you&#x27;ll love either.</li>
            <li> I use these brushes for my horses&#x27; manes and tails. Love them! They work better than the expensive ones made for horses!</li>
            <li> I have long, curly, fine hair- lots of it and I love this brush!  Nothing combs through it like this brush, wet or dry!</li>
            <li> I loooove this brush!!! Great for detangling, and making your hair look and feel soft! Great for massaging the scalp too and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Thrilled to find these hair brushes! !!!</li>
            <li> Real nice brush have used one similar to this in the years past this is just a little stiffer</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length curly/wavy hair.  This brush is perfect for styling my hair and  getting through the tangles.  Also gentle.  Love this brush!</li>
            <li> Not my fav but will continue to use. The bristles on this brush are just too short for the volume of my hair. I have tons of thick corse hair and this only gets to about 2/3 of it, I rarely reach my scalp w/ it unless I divide my hair in half. It is not too rough which I like but again I would not recommend for those out there w/ tons of hair like myself.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these brushes years ago and i keep going back to it.  Its a great all-around and easy to use</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and thought I needed to give it a try. The brush I loved and had for 15 years went kaput. :( I saw the awesome reviews and decided to buy.  It doesn&#x27;t work on my daughter&#x27;s fine hair as I had hoped. It&#x27;s definitely better than some.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for years for the perfect hair brush, and this wasn&#x27;t it.  I have very long, fine hair and this brush was stiff and it scratched my scalp.  My husband really liked it, though, and he has short, thick hair.  So, he now has this brush and I&#x27;m still searching.</li>
            <li> I love this brush!  I looked in a couple dozen stores for a replacement of my beloved Conair cushion brush.  I emailed Conair and they don&#x27;t make them anymore.  This is the only thing I could find that was even close.  The bristles are a bit stiffer than I&#x27;m used to but I &#x27;m adapting.  It&#x27;s just right for my fine, curly hair.  Most brushes won&#x27;t brush out curly hair but this one does the job.  And you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> I have loved spornette for most of my life it&#x27;s the only brush I knew. This one was no exception.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Makes unmanageable wild hair very coiffed &amp; dapper. Not a styling brush, but good for combing through hair to tame or stimulate follicles.</li>
            <li> I had a brush like this that broke, so I tried a couple other kinds of brushes....I couldn&#x27;t stand them. I have always had medium-long hair, and other brushes just don&#x27;t work as effectively on tangles or just general brushing. I don&#x27;t know why, but this brush simply works better, gets tangles out quicker, and works great on wet or dry hair. I had a couple roommates long ago who tried my brush and said the bristles are too hard on their scalp...I think that is because they were only used to those brushes with the little round tips...so maybe it takes a little getting used to, but I actually like how it feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I can think of is that the handle can break if dropped. I think when mine broke, it had been dropped a few times already over a period of time. But really, it isn&#x27;t that big of a deal to me because it is strong enough for tough and/or quick brushing day to day, and I can do better about taking care of my things. I actually bought a spare brush just to be sure I always have one. Love this brush!</li>
            <li> love this brush!  I got hooked on spornette brushes several years ago, my three daughters won&#x27;t use anything else.  This brush is even better for tangles and fine hair; very gentle</li>
            <li> I bought this brush based on the reviews. I have a tangle teezer and was excited to see a similar brush that actually had a handle. Well, I&#x27;m glad it was cheap because after two strokes I realized that this brush would rip my hair to shreds. The bristles are rough, blunt and sharp because they seem to be seared to keep them from fraying. I&#x27;ll stick with my tangle teezer. My hair is almost to my knees and I know if I kept using this brush I&#x27;d have to cut off several feet just to deal with the damage it would cause. Spend the extra dollar, adapt to a lack of a handle and use a tangle teezer, that&#x27;s my advice.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for years for a Goodie brand hairbrush like several I have had over the years. They just don&#x27;t seem to make the model I want any more. I&#x27;ve broken several of them dropping them in the shower, and am down to my last two. I wanted a brush that had bristles without the little knobs on the ends. Like this one. But this brush has a slight curve to it, which causes the bristles to spread out a little, so it doesn&#x27;t feel as dense as my old favorites. That&#x27;s why I knocked off one star. Other than that it works well and feels pretty good.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite brush, it is not too soft for long hair. Feels great to brush your hair without too much pulling.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like it... :/ It didn&#x27;t meet my expectations. It just felt too rough on my scalp and hair. Ended up giving it away.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush for long hair because it doesn&#x27;t pull your hair when you have tangles.  I would recomend this brush to anyone that has color treated hair or just very long hair.  I have both.  My hair is down to my waste and it&#x27;s baby fine.  I can brush from the roots to the ends, right out of the shower, without tearing a single strand.  This is simply an old wig brush...but it&#x27;s the best brush ever invented. I don&#x27;t know what manufacturers are thinking with the little balls on the ends of the brushes these days.  They rip and pull.  Trust me, this brush will work for your 5 year old or a 50 year old.  It will not pull your hair.  I was buying them from a hair dresser for $20 each and this seller so much cheaper.  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I have always purchased Spornette brushes if I have the option. This one is well made&lt;br /&gt;and being that I have long hair the bristles brush through my hair just the way I like it.</li>
            <li> We like this brush.  It went effortlessly through our very curly hair.  We just wish it had more of a grip on the handle.  It &#x27;s slippery when wet.</li>
            <li> Good price,  but feels somewhat awkward in my hand.</li>
            <li> Bought it for somebody else who finally gave up their old one like this. I hope this lasts as many years as the old one did. Works good on long hair, not scratchy and so far hasn&#x27;t pulled any of the bristles out.</li>
