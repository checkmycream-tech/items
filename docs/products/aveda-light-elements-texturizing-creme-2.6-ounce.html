            <li>It didn&#x27;t smell as good as I remembered it, and fragrance was one of the main reasons I liked that brand.</li>
            <li>great product highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never had an issue with my hair becoming greasy from this.  </li>
            <li>I love Aveda&#x27;s Light Elements Texturizing Creme, bc</li>
            <li>It is light not greasy.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light, I can achieve texture, piecey-hair</li>
            <li>It is light, not oily or sticky or waxy.</li>
            <li>It gives body to your hair but not greasy and light.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased it from my hair salon after my stylist used it on me.  </li>
            <li>nice but almost two soft</li>
            <li>price is right and with gas</li>
            <li>Usually buy this in an Aveda salon, but the convenience of online buying is great.</li>
            <li>Great product but does slightly dull your hair.</li>

            <li>This wasn&#x27;t a new product for me.  </li>
            <li>I put only a slight amount toward the top of my head</li>
            <li>This Aveda product goes well for any female with short, fine hair looking for that extra boost in their morning styling routine.</li>
            <li>Feels natural.</li>
            <li>Maybe old?</li>
            <li>so expensive it is better to get delivered!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it works any better than John Freida Secret Weapon which is only about $8.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair bounce with active shape, look flexible and lively.</li>
