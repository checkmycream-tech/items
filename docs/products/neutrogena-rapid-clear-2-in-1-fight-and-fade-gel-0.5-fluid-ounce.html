            <li>Awesome product, I hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But without use of the lotion, the gel works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed.</li>

            <li>Thank you Neutrogena for a product that does not make my skin peel but still helps my skin look great.</li>
            <li>I prided myself on my great skin &amp; would often get compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li>Great to have in the medicine cabinet for breakouts.</li>
            <li>it was great</li>
            <li>and the GREAT ProActiv )  </li>
            <li>i was great</li>
            <li>If you have a breakout nothing works better than this!!</li>
            <li>She has tried many products but gets very good results with this product.</li>
            <li>Reading good reviews from others, and thought that this might be a good product, it turns out to be ineffective in treating acne.</li>
            <li>Good price for this product</li>
            <li>I am delighted to have found it.</li>
            <li>Good hygiene is a MUST so cleanse and treat in the morning and before bed.</li>
            <li>Good hygiene is a MUST so cleanse and treat in the morning and before bed.</li>
            <li>This I understand is a favorite among movie set Makeup artists!</li>
            <li>a shower or Soak a washcloth in warm water and put it on your spot</li>
            <li>but I was hoping the fade factor would be effective.</li>
            <li>I all on its own my acne just started disappearing</li>
            <li>and yes it is kind of like jelly</li>
            <li>These products contain Salicylic Acid which has been tremendously effective in reducing and preventing break outs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m really impressed with this product and would highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why this is so effective, but it&#x27;s the most effective breakout fighter in my arsenal.  </li>
            <li>I have to say this gel is just about the most effective thing I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m still on the lookout for more effective and/or cheaper alternatives.</li>
            <li>Nice container, does what it says it will do, thanks Amazon nice price!</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m using this product more for the scars that are on my face.</li>
            <li>i was diagnosed with a hormonal/metabolic Syndrome called Poly- Cystic Ovaries Syndrome (PCOS).&lt;br /&gt;One of the LOVELY side effects</li>
            <li>or you get to the bottom of the tube (see my tips for more on that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My favorite acne product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what magic they put into this</li>
            <li>Glad I did.</li>
            <li>i love this stuff.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>i mostly get zits on my chin, and this product did not help.</li>
            <li>I thought with the name Neutrogena that I would love this product, but it was sorely lacking.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>This stuff works fabulously for me.  </li>
            <li>Do your self a favor stop buying these cheap medicines and go to saphora.</li>
            <li>Then I lightly coat my nose and spot the gel on the pores and across my chin.  </li>
            <li>so he uses Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Wash (orange) and Clearasil Ultra Pore Cleansing Pads EVERY morning and night.</li>
            <li>Although it goes on quite smoothly, when I apply make-up or lotions, sometimes it tends to ball up.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff; it is really one of my favorite acne products.</li>
            <li>I have fair sensitive skin too with an allergy to benzoil peroxide.</li>
            <li>works good and fast and you can apply it right to the source during night or day.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s the high concentration, or maybe it&#x27;s the glycolic acid, but this product is extremely effective.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try this out because of the reviews</li>
            <li>within 2 hours i noticed the redness significantly faded.&lt;br</li>
            <li>: Rarely, does ONE product clear up acne unless it is VERY VERY MILD so a combination of products or kit is ALMOST ALWAYS NEEDED!!</li>
            <li>: Rarely, does ONE product clear up acne unless it is VERY VERY MILD so a combination of products or kit is ALMOST ALWAYS NEEDED!!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for two months now and recommend it with full confidence.  </li>
            <li>made me have an allergic reaction, super smelly and burned my skin</li>
            <li>Like so many others, I&#x27;ve tried just about everything out there, from drugstore brands to department store brands, most of the time with mixed results.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does tend to separate when you don&#x27;t use the product quickly</li>
            <li>Since I had Amazon Prime, the item came really quickly.</li>
            <li>if you use it on pimples before they come out cause itll stop them quick.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Neutrogena Rapid Clear Fight &amp; Fade Gel for my 14 year old son and it has worked great.</li>
            <li>but I doubt it will be very effective if it can&#x27;t absorb into your skin through other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly, highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>results i get with this product are worth it.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>The results i get with this product are worth it.   </li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews although I often read them.</li>
            <li>I appreciate the scent of this product, which isn&#x27;t overpowering and is quite pleasant, especially compared to the medicinal smell of many other anti-acne creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think this works really fast to clear up acne, but I&#x27;m not so sure about the &amp;#34;Fade&amp;#34; part of it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It was fast and it was super protected.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>If a pimple pops up and it does on occasion, he uses the Acnefree Sulphur Mask (stores have their own brand as well) as an overnight spot treatment to dry it up</li>
            <li>I use a Neutrogena lotion very lightly on forehead, around eyes and upper lip and neck.  </li>
            <li>again, you have to be consistent with it</li>
            <li>Thank you neutrogena &amp; I am telling anybody who is interested.</li>
            <li>I use a salicylic acid product to keep my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>When I first used it I had a zit on my lower forehead.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why the product turned my zit purple the first time, but it hasn&#x27;t done that since.</li>
            <li>this works pretty well, like 80% of the time</li>
            <li>First I use a very soft battery powered brush with soap on it to clean my face and rinse with lukewarm water.  </li>
            <li>have come to prefer and recommend Terminator 10 by Acnefree,&lt;br /&gt;Terminator 10  combats redness during and after, clears pimples in every range fast, does not dry ( which I love</li>
            <li>right now I give it 4 stars because it worked so fast</li>
            <li>I also used to use the oil of olay washclothes &amp; they kept my face clean &amp; clear , so i picked those up too.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect any quick fixes when using Rapid Clear.</li>
            <li>From what I&#x27;ve noticed, it seems to be pretty good at treating acne but not amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle cure-all, but it works very well.  </li>
            <li>ive been on this for a whole 5 months</li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY DOES speed up REDNESS and post acne scaring (i find the after zit scars fade way quicker than when i don&#x27;t use it)&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>how much i use it-</li>
            <li>The entire affected area is mow breakout free.  </li>
            <li>already using the product, and I think it&#x27;s very efficient.</li>
            <li>It really does help fade acne spots.</li>
            <li>Benzyl Peroxide dries out my skin, but doesn&#x27;t really get rid of pimples for me.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>I dont see any fast clearing of the skin of acne..</li>
            <li>Not as much as i hoped.</li>
            <li>product may seem as a gentle remedy , however, I see it as so gentle that it had zero</li>
            <li>didnt notice the smell much it didn&#x27;t bother me</li>
            <li>I will update my review once I leave it on overnight and see how fast it works.</li>
            <li>He still gets a pimple every now &amp; then but a dab of the Sulphur Mask dries it up fast.</li>
            <li>He still gets a pimple every now &amp; then but a dab of the Sulphur Mask dries it up fast.</li>
            <li>But this worked really well for me</li>
            <li>And I think it fades the look of old acne scars (the ones that resemble dents in the skin) better, but it might just be psychological because it feels like a face peel?</li>
            <li>/&gt;Those cons don&#x27;t matter so much to me considering the fact that some of the other  treatments i have tried have been WAY more</li>
            <li>For standard blemishes, it works as advertised, within about an 8 hour period (overnight or during the day), it significantly reduces blemishes and their associated redness.  </li>
            <li>Salicylic Acid does work, but for some reason this product works better than all the other salicylic acid spot treatments I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>so you have to hit it hard and be consistent in the treatment of it for it to be effective.</li>
            <li>(hair product residue will only worsen acne), increase your water consumption and keep your phone clean with a product containing alcohol.</li>
            <li>(hair product residue will only worsen acne), increase your water consumption and keep your phone clean with a product containing alcohol.</li>
            <li>i really dont have anything good or bad to say about this product but my experience with it was okay</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin too</li>
            <li>At 34 years old, this was a first.  </li>
            <li>My only advice is to continue using it for a full two months before giving up, as it can take six weeks to get all the gunk out of your pores.  </li>
            <li>It got here in a normal size box considering the product is really small.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anyway, definitely don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it to do the work so this one tube is probably going to last me for more than a year.</li>
            <li>It is very effective in stopping budding pimples from growing big, but doesn&#x27;t dry up big pimples.</li>
            <li>The tube gives you a fair amount and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I find Neutrogena a reliable brand and the Rapid Clear gel really does what it claims.</li>
            <li>This was helpful for my preteen&#x27;s acne and was not to harsh on her skin as many acne treatments can be.</li>
            <li>I rarely get big pimples anymore at all &amp; when I do get one at all, it&#x27;s gone within a day or two &amp; no marks.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t doubt it, it can take down the size of a unpopped pimple pretty quickly too.</li>
            <li>However, it does tend to make the tube last longer, which is nice since it can get a little pricey.</li>
            <li>It might be the fact that I&#x27;m rather tan as I live in California</li>
            <li>It is more than I can say for any product I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>This is the first one which actually works for me.</li>
            <li>This is the first product which actually worked for me.</li>
            <li>I used it a few different times, to make sure it wasn&#x27;t just coincidence, but I have developed new zits every time I&#x27;ve used this.</li>
            <li>After I began to use rapid clear</li>
            <li>so I was hoping this would clear them out.</li>
            <li>When paired with the Neutrogena Rapid Clear Toner + Cleanser, this gel works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I would NOT recommend using this alongside the Neutrogena Rapid Clear Lotion.</li>
            <li>and I feel like my skin has never looked so clear.</li>
            <li>It didnt clear my bumps overnight but helped with the color and size.</li>
            <li>It keeps your skin clear and helps with oily skin as well.  </li>
            <li>I am a 20 year old guy who gets really embarrassing acne still especially on my nose.</li>
            <li>so I purchased a Dial Antibacterial Body Wash and the Neutrogena Body Clear Spray which also contains Salicylic Acid.</li>
            <li>i am 27 years old and still getting acne</li>
            <li>/&gt;Any time I feel a zit brewing, I zap it directly with this stuff once or twice a day</li>
            <li>It was concentrated to the sides if my face too, near the jaw line.</li>
            <li>All I have is old marks now &amp; they are fading.</li>
            <li>A lil BG: i&#x27;m 29 yrs old and have been battling acne on and off since i was 13.&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
            <li>one tube at a time till its completely gone</li>
            <li>I have suffered from acne since I was a young girl.</li>
            <li>then adult acne in my 30&#x60;s  and was under Rx&#x60;s</li>
            <li>Try to keep your hands off of your face during the day to reduce the transfer of dirt &amp; bacteria, change your pillowcase frequently</li>
            <li>Try to keep your hands off of your face during the day to reduce the transfer of dirt &amp; bacteria, change your pillowcase frequently</li>
            <li>It works well reducing the swelling of early acne and any discoloration from old acne.</li>
            <li>Naturally, because I don&#x27;t apply it twice a day as recommended, the scar-fading properties don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li>Obviously, not all skin products work for everyone, but this is an awesomely powerful product for my face, and I&#x27;m definitely taking one with me wherever I go.</li>
            <li>It leaves behind a shiny residue, and I did not find it as effective as my favorite-now-discontinued-am-really-sad Neutrogena Rapid Clear Sore Pimple Eliminating Gel.</li>
            <li>I did not use it more than a few times to notice whether it actually faded blemish marks</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product as fairly effective, but I&#x27;m not 100% behind it.</li>
            <li>Within three days, it was barely there anymore, the swelling and redness was nearly gone.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because it was small and light</li>
            <li>The ONLY time since acquiring them that the pores get clean and appear smaller (debris gone) is when I regularly follow the above routine.  </li>
            <li>but i notice either new pimples or redness back in that spot.</li>
            <li>In addition, I have noticed some fading of old scars, but the efficacy varies according to how old the scars are and how regularly you apply this gel.</li>
            <li>Causes major</li>
            <li>Remember, you must USE the products twice daily, every day for them to work in most cases and teenage boys are lazy</li>
            <li>Remember, you must USE the products twice daily, every day for them to work in most cases and teenage boys are lazy</li>
            <li>this product is worth its little size.</li>
            <li>The other pimples from my previous angry breakout also look noticeably faded, which is great since my skin usually scars very easily.  </li>
            <li>wash &amp; scrub along with the Rapid Clear Fight &amp; Fade Toner twice daily.</li>
            <li>But, I got a professional massage once and the oil that was used must have been butter or something because within 2 days my back looked like a pizza.  </li>
            <li>And the skin on my back cleared up completely, and</li>
            <li>As for my scars, 3/4 have faded completely and the remaining are much smaller.  </li>
            <li>But as an adult I started breaking out again but this time they weren&#x27;t regular pimple</li>
            <li>If you can catch a pimple early, then this actually works in controlling it if you use it day and night.</li>
            <li>I just always hide myself and felt uncomfortable in my own skin.</li>
            <li>He did not have a face full of acne just the T-Zone area and mainly his chin but acne is tough to get rid of</li>
            <li>I have a hard time with these -- they are stubborn, but I am finding that the gel *significantly* reduces the amount of time I&#x27;m dealing with the blemish and also does reduce redness.  </li>
            <li>When I was using it twice a day, I usually ran out fairly quickly (maybe once a month or so) and had to restock quite often.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I put Rapid Clear on the zit in the morning, and by the evening the zit turned dark purple!I used other cleansers I had available on the zit, and the next morning in wasn&#x27;t purple anymore but still the same size.</li>
            <li>The Rapid Clear gel was sticky, had a strong rubbing alcohol smell, and left a shiny film behind rather than disappearing into the skin, making it something I wouldn&#x27;t use during the day.</li>
            <li>nothing is worse than going through life with people asking you if you are okay because you have a red shiny rash all over your face!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any fast reduction of dark spots.  </li>
            <li>Tip: Just a little will do but be consistent, apply several times a day.</li>
            <li>Those cons don&#x27;t matter so much to me considering the fact that some of the other  treatments i have tried have been WAY more expensive.   </li>
            <li>I also use it on four large pores (not on nose) that normally would appear dark brown or black.  </li>
            <li>Although this product did not get rid of these aliens completely they did dry them enough within a week which helped a lot because cystic acne hurts.</li>
            <li>i was a little hesitant, but this has worked really well.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> there isn&#x27;t an chemical smell, pimple size dramatically changes or dissapears within 3 to 4 days! :D</li>
            <li> Awesome product, I hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But without use of the lotion, the gel works wonderfully.</li>

            <li> I all on its own my acne just started disappearing</li>
            <li> and yes it is kind of like jelly</li>
            <li> These products contain Salicylic Acid which has been tremendously effective in reducing and preventing break outs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m really impressed with this product and would highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this is so effective, but it&#x27;s the most effective breakout fighter in my arsenal.  </li>
            <li> I have to say this gel is just about the most effective thing I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m still on the lookout for more effective and/or cheaper alternatives.</li>
            <li> Nice container, does what it says it will do, thanks Amazon nice price!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m using this product more for the scars that are on my face.</li>
            <li> i was diagnosed with a hormonal/metabolic Syndrome called Poly- Cystic Ovaries Syndrome (PCOS).&lt;br /&gt;One of the LOVELY side effects</li>
            <li> or you get to the bottom of the tube (see my tips for more on that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My favorite acne product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what magic they put into this</li>
            <li> Glad I did.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> i mostly get zits on my chin, and this product did not help.</li>
            <li> I thought with the name Neutrogena that I would love this product, but it was sorely lacking.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> This stuff works fabulously for me.  </li>
            <li> Do your self a favor stop buying these cheap medicines and go to saphora.</li>
            <li> Then I lightly coat my nose and spot the gel on the pores and across my chin.  </li>
            <li> so he uses Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Wash (orange) and Clearasil Ultra Pore Cleansing Pads EVERY morning and night.</li>
            <li> Although it goes on quite smoothly, when I apply make-up or lotions, sometimes it tends to ball up.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff; it is really one of my favorite acne products.</li>
            <li> I have fair sensitive skin too with an allergy to benzoil peroxide.</li>
            <li> works good and fast and you can apply it right to the source during night or day.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s the high concentration, or maybe it&#x27;s the glycolic acid, but this product is extremely effective.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to try this out because of the reviews</li>
            <li> within 2 hours i noticed the redness significantly faded.&lt;br</li>
            <li> : Rarely, does ONE product clear up acne unless it is VERY VERY MILD so a combination of products or kit is ALMOST ALWAYS NEEDED!!</li>
            <li> : Rarely, does ONE product clear up acne unless it is VERY VERY MILD so a combination of products or kit is ALMOST ALWAYS NEEDED!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two months now and recommend it with full confidence.  </li>
            <li> made me have an allergic reaction, super smelly and burned my skin</li>
            <li> Like so many others, I&#x27;ve tried just about everything out there, from drugstore brands to department store brands, most of the time with mixed results.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does tend to separate when you don&#x27;t use the product quickly</li>
            <li> Since I had Amazon Prime, the item came really quickly.</li>
            <li> if you use it on pimples before they come out cause itll stop them quick.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Neutrogena Rapid Clear Fight &amp; Fade Gel for my 14 year old son and it has worked great.</li>
            <li> but I doubt it will be very effective if it can&#x27;t absorb into your skin through other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly, highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> results i get with this product are worth it.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> The results i get with this product are worth it.   </li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews although I often read them.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the scent of this product, which isn&#x27;t overpowering and is quite pleasant, especially compared to the medicinal smell of many other anti-acne creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think this works really fast to clear up acne, but I&#x27;m not so sure about the &amp;#34;Fade&amp;#34; part of it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was fast and it was super protected.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> If a pimple pops up and it does on occasion, he uses the Acnefree Sulphur Mask (stores have their own brand as well) as an overnight spot treatment to dry it up</li>
            <li> I use a Neutrogena lotion very lightly on forehead, around eyes and upper lip and neck.  </li>
            <li> again, you have to be consistent with it</li>
            <li> Thank you neutrogena &amp; I am telling anybody who is interested.</li>
            <li> I use a salicylic acid product to keep my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> When I first used it I had a zit on my lower forehead.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why the product turned my zit purple the first time, but it hasn&#x27;t done that since.</li>
            <li> this works pretty well, like 80% of the time</li>
            <li> First I use a very soft battery powered brush with soap on it to clean my face and rinse with lukewarm water.  </li>
            <li> have come to prefer and recommend Terminator 10 by Acnefree,&lt;br /&gt;Terminator 10  combats redness during and after, clears pimples in every range fast, does not dry ( which I love</li>
            <li> right now I give it 4 stars because it worked so fast</li>
            <li> I also used to use the oil of olay washclothes &amp; they kept my face clean &amp; clear , so i picked those up too.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect any quick fixes when using Rapid Clear.</li>
            <li> From what I&#x27;ve noticed, it seems to be pretty good at treating acne but not amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle cure-all, but it works very well.  </li>
            <li> ive been on this for a whole 5 months</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY DOES speed up REDNESS and post acne scaring (i find the after zit scars fade way quicker than when i don&#x27;t use it)&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> how much i use it-</li>
            <li> The entire affected area is mow breakout free.  </li>
            <li> already using the product, and I think it&#x27;s very efficient.</li>
            <li> It really does help fade acne spots.</li>
            <li> Benzyl Peroxide dries out my skin, but doesn&#x27;t really get rid of pimples for me.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> I dont see any fast clearing of the skin of acne..</li>
            <li> Not as much as i hoped.</li>
            <li> product may seem as a gentle remedy , however, I see it as so gentle that it had zero</li>
            <li> didnt notice the smell much it didn&#x27;t bother me</li>
            <li> I will update my review once I leave it on overnight and see how fast it works.</li>
            <li> He still gets a pimple every now &amp; then but a dab of the Sulphur Mask dries it up fast.</li>
            <li> He still gets a pimple every now &amp; then but a dab of the Sulphur Mask dries it up fast.</li>
            <li> But this worked really well for me</li>
            <li> And I think it fades the look of old acne scars (the ones that resemble dents in the skin) better, but it might just be psychological because it feels like a face peel?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Those cons don&#x27;t matter so much to me considering the fact that some of the other  treatments i have tried have been WAY more</li>
            <li> For standard blemishes, it works as advertised, within about an 8 hour period (overnight or during the day), it significantly reduces blemishes and their associated redness.  </li>
            <li> Salicylic Acid does work, but for some reason this product works better than all the other salicylic acid spot treatments I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> so you have to hit it hard and be consistent in the treatment of it for it to be effective.</li>
            <li> (hair product residue will only worsen acne), increase your water consumption and keep your phone clean with a product containing alcohol.</li>
            <li> (hair product residue will only worsen acne), increase your water consumption and keep your phone clean with a product containing alcohol.</li>
            <li> i really dont have anything good or bad to say about this product but my experience with it was okay</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin too</li>
            <li> At 34 years old, this was a first.  </li>
            <li> My only advice is to continue using it for a full two months before giving up, as it can take six weeks to get all the gunk out of your pores.  </li>
            <li> It got here in a normal size box considering the product is really small.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anyway, definitely don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it to do the work so this one tube is probably going to last me for more than a year.</li>
            <li> It is very effective in stopping budding pimples from growing big, but doesn&#x27;t dry up big pimples.</li>
            <li> The tube gives you a fair amount and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I find Neutrogena a reliable brand and the Rapid Clear gel really does what it claims.</li>
            <li> This was helpful for my preteen&#x27;s acne and was not to harsh on her skin as many acne treatments can be.</li>
            <li> I rarely get big pimples anymore at all &amp; when I do get one at all, it&#x27;s gone within a day or two &amp; no marks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t doubt it, it can take down the size of a unpopped pimple pretty quickly too.</li>
            <li> However, it does tend to make the tube last longer, which is nice since it can get a little pricey.</li>
            <li> It might be the fact that I&#x27;m rather tan as I live in California</li>
            <li> It is more than I can say for any product I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> This is the first one which actually works for me.</li>
            <li> This is the first product which actually worked for me.</li>
            <li> I used it a few different times, to make sure it wasn&#x27;t just coincidence, but I have developed new zits every time I&#x27;ve used this.</li>
            <li> After I began to use rapid clear</li>
            <li> so I was hoping this would clear them out.</li>
            <li> When paired with the Neutrogena Rapid Clear Toner + Cleanser, this gel works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I would NOT recommend using this alongside the Neutrogena Rapid Clear Lotion.</li>
            <li> and I feel like my skin has never looked so clear.</li>
            <li> It didnt clear my bumps overnight but helped with the color and size.</li>
            <li> It keeps your skin clear and helps with oily skin as well.  </li>
            <li> I am a 20 year old guy who gets really embarrassing acne still especially on my nose.</li>
            <li> so I purchased a Dial Antibacterial Body Wash and the Neutrogena Body Clear Spray which also contains Salicylic Acid.</li>
            <li> i am 27 years old and still getting acne</li>
            <li> /&gt;Any time I feel a zit brewing, I zap it directly with this stuff once or twice a day</li>
            <li> It was concentrated to the sides if my face too, near the jaw line.</li>
            <li> All I have is old marks now &amp; they are fading.</li>
            <li> A lil BG: i&#x27;m 29 yrs old and have been battling acne on and off since i was 13.&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
            <li> one tube at a time till its completely gone</li>
            <li> I have suffered from acne since I was a young girl.</li>
            <li> then adult acne in my 30&#x60;s  and was under Rx&#x60;s</li>
            <li> Try to keep your hands off of your face during the day to reduce the transfer of dirt &amp; bacteria, change your pillowcase frequently</li>
            <li> Try to keep your hands off of your face during the day to reduce the transfer of dirt &amp; bacteria, change your pillowcase frequently</li>
            <li> It works well reducing the swelling of early acne and any discoloration from old acne.</li>
            <li> Naturally, because I don&#x27;t apply it twice a day as recommended, the scar-fading properties don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> Obviously, not all skin products work for everyone, but this is an awesomely powerful product for my face, and I&#x27;m definitely taking one with me wherever I go.</li>
            <li> It leaves behind a shiny residue, and I did not find it as effective as my favorite-now-discontinued-am-really-sad Neutrogena Rapid Clear Sore Pimple Eliminating Gel.</li>
            <li> I did not use it more than a few times to notice whether it actually faded blemish marks</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product as fairly effective, but I&#x27;m not 100% behind it.</li>
            <li> Within three days, it was barely there anymore, the swelling and redness was nearly gone.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it was small and light</li>
            <li> The ONLY time since acquiring them that the pores get clean and appear smaller (debris gone) is when I regularly follow the above routine.  </li>
            <li> but i notice either new pimples or redness back in that spot.</li>
            <li> In addition, I have noticed some fading of old scars, but the efficacy varies according to how old the scars are and how regularly you apply this gel.</li>
            <li> Causes major</li>
            <li> Remember, you must USE the products twice daily, every day for them to work in most cases and teenage boys are lazy</li>
            <li> Remember, you must USE the products twice daily, every day for them to work in most cases and teenage boys are lazy</li>
            <li> this product is worth its little size.</li>
            <li> The other pimples from my previous angry breakout also look noticeably faded, which is great since my skin usually scars very easily.  </li>
            <li> wash &amp; scrub along with the Rapid Clear Fight &amp; Fade Toner twice daily.</li>
            <li> But, I got a professional massage once and the oil that was used must have been butter or something because within 2 days my back looked like a pizza.  </li>
            <li> And the skin on my back cleared up completely, and</li>
            <li> As for my scars, 3/4 have faded completely and the remaining are much smaller.  </li>
            <li> But as an adult I started breaking out again but this time they weren&#x27;t regular pimple</li>
            <li> If you can catch a pimple early, then this actually works in controlling it if you use it day and night.</li>
            <li> I just always hide myself and felt uncomfortable in my own skin.</li>
            <li> He did not have a face full of acne just the T-Zone area and mainly his chin but acne is tough to get rid of</li>
            <li> I have a hard time with these -- they are stubborn, but I am finding that the gel *significantly* reduces the amount of time I&#x27;m dealing with the blemish and also does reduce redness.  </li>
            <li> When I was using it twice a day, I usually ran out fairly quickly (maybe once a month or so) and had to restock quite often.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put Rapid Clear on the zit in the morning, and by the evening the zit turned dark purple!I used other cleansers I had available on the zit, and the next morning in wasn&#x27;t purple anymore but still the same size.</li>
            <li> The Rapid Clear gel was sticky, had a strong rubbing alcohol smell, and left a shiny film behind rather than disappearing into the skin, making it something I wouldn&#x27;t use during the day.</li>
            <li> nothing is worse than going through life with people asking you if you are okay because you have a red shiny rash all over your face!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any fast reduction of dark spots.  </li>
            <li> Tip: Just a little will do but be consistent, apply several times a day.</li>
            <li> Those cons don&#x27;t matter so much to me considering the fact that some of the other  treatments i have tried have been WAY more expensive.   </li>
            <li> I also use it on four large pores (not on nose) that normally would appear dark brown or black.  </li>
            <li> Although this product did not get rid of these aliens completely they did dry them enough within a week which helped a lot because cystic acne hurts.</li>
            <li> i was a little hesitant, but this has worked really well.</li>
            <li> I guess you could apply the gel over the other products (it&#x27;s clear)</li>
            <li> Unlike a CERTAIN kind which dried a zit out so bad it left a permanent scar!  </li>
            <li> I noticed that the pimples cleared up much quicker and with very little squeezing.  </li>
            <li> This is my new little skin care gem.  </li>
            <li> I would probably just use this to clear up a break out, but something else long term to try to get rid of dark spots.</li>
            <li> When I felt a pimple coming out, i even went so far as to put a little hand sanitizer on the pimple &amp; to my surprise, it stopped them from coming out.</li>
            <li> I loled hard at this cuz it did absolutely zero shirt.</li>
            <li> So far I have either avoided putting other products over the gel, or put the gel on after other products and have had no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As long as I can get to the pimple in time, this product works well.</li>
            <li> a minor case of breakouts?</li>
            <li> Normally these take weeks to go away for me, even with my usual routine of dabbing tea tree oil on it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not clear and fade gel after all.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I think the cream version from Neutrogena works just as well, without the slight burn, so I will probably go back to that after this tube is used up.</li>
            <li> have one caveat, and that is that if you use the gel and other products (moisturizers, etc) on the same place on your face, the gel will peel up and off.  </li>
            <li> but it will help it dry up a bit.</li>
            <li> will help the product penetrate and helps to dry up the area.&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li> It didnt do a single thing.</li>
            <li> Last night, I saw two little pimples developing, put this on, and this morning both of them had dried up completely.</li>
            <li> , I do not have dry skin, but at my age I do not want to risk it ) , and even helps clear blackheads and small clogged pores.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Then it just hit out of the blue &amp; every pimple I got would leave a dark mark whether I picked it or not.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve still got half left.</li>
            <li> am middle aged, I have had a couple bouts of severe acne in the past ( teen to 20&#x60;s, and</li>
            <li> I have found that the gel plus judicious use of a clay mask and the nastier blemishes last about half as long as they used to, with less redness during and afterwards.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is no need to use a lot and would only be a waste.  </li>
            <li> The gel goes on wet and seems to stay wet..</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this stuff.</li>
            <li> When I was in high school I was tired of hiding</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe it worked for other people, but not for me.</li>
            <li> I tried this as an alternative to Neutrogena&#x27;s other salicylic acid gel, the Acne Stress Control 3-in-1 Hydrating Treatment, which was sold out.</li>
            <li> I use the Neutrogena Pink Grapefruit (YUMMY!)</li>
            <li> Try every other product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year now, in addition to other anti-acne products.</li>
            <li> I wash my face 2x per day with a salycitic acid wash then apply a salycitic treatment product and during the day a salycitic containing oil free base makeup to hide the red rash look of my face</li>
            <li> The small tubes last a very long time since I use a small amount each time.  </li>
            <li> Dark areas on my face were noticeably .</li>
            <li> It leaves a clear gel layer that can rub away if you try to put any makeup or concealer over it, so it&#x27;s not great for daytime use.</li>
            <li> IS NOT a miracle product and cannot be expected to take the place of everyday hygiene</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super annoying when it does this because it looks gross and</li>
            <li> Using Rapid Clear does make a slight difference in the life of my zits, but nothing dramatic.</li>
            <li> even at walmart its around 9-10 dollars for half an oz.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i had alot of acne scares and current acne, i used this product as instructed but it seemed like i was just useless after three months of use my acne has improved slightly and same goes for my scars!</li>
            <li> less noticeable after using this gel just one time.  </li>
            <li> I got this after I used up my previous acne treatment cream, Neutrogena All-in-1 Acne Control.</li>
            <li> I get bumps and blackheads but not true acne.  </li>

            <li> 1. Causes major breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;2. Does not reduce the redness like it claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it worked for other people, but not for me. I have oily skin.</li>
            <li> I think this works really fast to clear up acne, but I&#x27;m not so sure about the &amp;#34;Fade&amp;#34; part of it.  I didn&#x27;t see any fast reduction of dark spots.  I would probably just use this to clear up a break out, but something else long term to try to get rid of dark spots.</li>
            <li> you have to be diligent about putting this on every night. i am 27 years old and still getting acne and i&#x27;ve tried everything possible. i&#x27;m using this product more for the scars that are on my face. i was a little hesitant, but this has worked really well. i see parts of my face lightening up and the redness and scaring isn&#x27;t as noticeable. and my face has been through a lot and for something to work is quite something. again, you have to be consistent with it--i do forget sometimes and maybe its in my head, but i notice either new pimples or redness back in that spot. so keep at it! this product is worth its little size. you don&#x27;t need to slather it on either which is great.</li>
            <li> I occasionally get zits, here and there.  I never had a problem with it... just every now and then... one or 2.  But, I got a professional massage once and the oil that was used must have been butter or something because within 2 days my back looked like a pizza.  It was disgusting!  I had SEVERE backne (back acne... of course).  And it was summer!  I was humiliated.  Never had back zits before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a bunch of different stuff.  Even painful things...  Nothing worked.  They just kept coming!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I bought this stuff.  I squeezed a bit on each zit individually, once each morning after my shower.  And the skin on my back cleared up completely, and I mean, not just \\&quot;improved\\&quot; but, literally CLEARED UP entirely... as if I&#x27;d never had a problem - within 3-4 days!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No kidding.  This stuff works fabulously for me.  I have pretty sensitive skin too and I have never had any redness, irritation or any dryness.  Unlike a CERTAIN kind which dried a zit out so bad it left a permanent scar!  YIKES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any time I feel a zit brewing, I zap it directly with this stuff once or twice a day and it&#x27;s gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly, highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> This was helpful for my preteen&#x27;s acne and was not to harsh on her skin as many acne treatments can be.</li>
            <li> there isn&#x27;t an chemical smell, pimple size dramatically changes or dissapears within 3 to 4 days! :D</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks. I have noticed a reduction in the amount of acne that I get, the length of the bumps life on my face, and the amount of time it takes for the discoloration to disappear from my face. I am VERY pleased! YAY! Thank you Neutrogena for a product that does not make my skin peel but still helps my skin look great.</li>
            <li> This product works. I have never struggled with acne until about 4 months ago. I prided myself on my great skin &amp; would often get compliments on my skin. Then it just hit out of the blue &amp; every pimple I got would leave a dark mark whether I picked it or not. It was concentrated to the sides if my face too, near the jaw line. I tried everything, proactiv, etc. I even went to the dermatologist, who gave me all of this stuff along w antibiotics they wanted me to take for 4 months. That didn&#x27;t sit well with me. I tried the products they gave me for about 4 days with the antibiotics. My face felt like leather, bumpy leather, the acne was a lot worse &amp; it was so irritated &amp; red it was ridiculous. Went to the grocery store &amp; bought this. I also used to use the oil of olay washclothes &amp; they kept my face clean &amp; clear , so i picked those up too. I was desperate. When I felt a pimple coming out, i even went so far as to put a little hand sanitizer on the pimple &amp; to my surprise, it stopped them from coming out. So, i started using the washcloths, spot treating with the hand  sanitizer &amp; then this product. It works. I&#x27;ve been using it now for about 2 1/2 months &amp; there is a noticeable difference. I rarely get big pimples anymore at all &amp; when I do get one at all, it&#x27;s gone within a day or two &amp; no marks. All I have is old marks now &amp; they are fading. Thank you neutrogena &amp; I am telling anybody who is interested.</li>
            <li> I tried this as an alternative to Neutrogena&#x27;s other salicylic acid gel, the Acne Stress Control 3-in-1 Hydrating Treatment, which was sold out. I have combination skin with occasional, hormone-related breakouts. I use a salicylic acid product to keep my skin smooth and soft. The Rapid Clear gel was sticky, had a strong rubbing alcohol smell, and left a shiny film behind rather than disappearing into the skin, making it something I wouldn&#x27;t use during the day. It also seemed to break me out. I used it a few different times, to make sure it wasn&#x27;t just coincidence, but I have developed new zits every time I&#x27;ve used this.</li>
            <li> I loled hard at this cuz it did absolutely zero shirt. Do your self a favor stop buying these cheap medicines and go to saphora. Spend 100 and buy a acne kit&#x3D; profit</li>
            <li> made me have an allergic reaction, super smelly and burned my skin</li>
            <li> This is my new little skin care gem.  I&#x27;m in that wrinkles-plus-blemishes category that seems to be an emerging skin care demographic (or maybe it&#x27;s just me noticing it).  I&#x27;m 43, caucasian, oily skin but living in an arid climate.  Like so many others, I&#x27;ve tried just about everything out there, from drugstore brands to department store brands, most of the time with mixed results.  I have to say this gel is just about the most effective thing I&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s not a miracle cure-all, but it works very well.  For standard blemishes, it works as advertised, within about an 8 hour period (overnight or during the day), it significantly reduces blemishes and their associated redness.  In fact for me, for this type of blemish, one application and it&#x27;s gone.  Maybe two.  Cystic-type blemishes are another thing.  I have a hard time with these -- they are stubborn, but I am finding that the gel *significantly* reduces the amount of time I&#x27;m dealing with the blemish and also does reduce redness.  I have found that the gel plus judicious use of a clay mask and the nastier blemishes last about half as long as they used to, with less redness during and afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have one caveat, and that is that if you use the gel and other products (moisturizers, etc) on the same place on your face, the gel will peel up and off.  So far I have either avoided putting other products over the gel, or put the gel on after other products and have had no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m really impressed with this product and would highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> When the product description says 8 hours, they really mean 8 hours or longer. Don&#x27;t expect any quick fixes when using Rapid Clear. When I first used it I had a zit on my lower forehead. I put Rapid Clear on the zit in the morning, and by the evening the zit turned dark purple!I used other cleansers I had available on the zit, and the next morning in wasn&#x27;t purple anymore but still the same size. I don&#x27;t know why the product turned my zit purple the first time, but it hasn&#x27;t done that since. Using Rapid Clear does make a slight difference in the life of my zits, but nothing dramatic.</li>
            <li> I find Neutrogena a reliable brand and the Rapid Clear gel really does what it claims. It dries up problem spots in no time and leaves no marks. Great to have in the medicine cabinet for breakouts. Works well with make up.</li>
            <li> This s*** does not work ive been on this for a whole 5 months nothing happened im 14 and my sister tried it and nothing happened</li>
            <li> A lil BG: i&#x27;m 29 yrs old and have been battling acne on and off since i was 13.&lt;br /&gt;Most recently (@ 26yrs) i was diagnosed with a hormonal/metabolic Syndrome called Poly- Cystic Ovaries Syndrome (PCOS).&lt;br /&gt;One of the LOVELY side effects is Acne....&lt;br /&gt;I Feel Like Tried EVERY PRODUCT ON THIS MORTAL EARTH!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Went through 3 rounds of Accutane (AGE 16, 20, 25), have tried prescription/topical creams such as Retin-a , duac, Oral anti-biotics, sapronalactone ETC .&lt;br /&gt;OTC Products clean-n-clear, origins, liz earle, L&#x27;occitane, AcneeFree, Actonel, Clerisil, bensoil peroxide, clinique, sulfur soaps....  anyways- you get the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I STILL Continue to try products, and yet always seem to come back to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) For deep/cystic hormonal acne this helps but does not \\&quot;fix it\\&quot; but it will help it dry up a bit. (for usually makes the swelling and redness go down)&lt;br /&gt;2) Helps control oil (been using products with Salicylic base for years but this is the only one that i would put on my T- Zone to help prevent breakouts)&lt;br /&gt;3) ABSOLUTELY DOES speed up REDNESS and post acne scaring (i find the after zit scars fade way quicker than when i don&#x27;t use it)&lt;br /&gt;4) IS NOT a miracle product and cannot be expected to take the place of everyday hygiene (YOU STILL NEED TO WASH YOUR FACE)&lt;br /&gt;5) Will help with occasional non-hormonal acne but when i use it for that i have to be diligent and persistent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couple cons:&lt;br /&gt;It is expensive for what it is and how much i use it- i was actually looking on amazon to see if i could buy it in bulk! even at walmart its around 9-10 dollars for half an oz.&lt;br /&gt;It does tend to separate when you don&#x27;t use the product quickly or you get to the bottom of the tube (see my tips for more on that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip(s) I use:&lt;br /&gt;Take a shower or Soak a washcloth in warm water and put it on your spot your going to treat if you have an unbroken (underground) zit.&lt;br /&gt;It will help the product penetrate and helps to dry up the area.&lt;br /&gt;Use one tube at a time till its completely gone, keep it at room temp, shake it and rub it in well when your towards the last 1/6th of the tube&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;Those cons don&#x27;t matter so much to me considering the fact that some of the other  treatments i have tried have been WAY more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;The results i get with this product are worth it.&lt;br /&gt;It works for me.p it at room temp, shake it and rub it in well when your towards the last 1/6th of the tube      OVERALL:   Those cons don&#x27;t matter so much to me considering the fact that some of the other  treatments i have tried have been WAY more expensive.   The results i get with this product are worth it.   It works for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two months now and recommend it with full confidence.  For the last six months I had been breaking out on my chin and above my upperlip.  At 34 years old, this was a first.  Unfortunately, I picked at some of the pimples and they left ugly purplish scars.  I tried using expensive foundations by clinique and origins to cover them and ended up with worse outbreaks.  After I began to use rapid clear I noticed that the pimples cleared up much quicker and with very little squeezing.  The entire affected area is mow breakout free.  As for my scars, 3/4 have faded completely and the remaining are much smaller.  I will continue to use this product twice per day on my chin to prevent further breakouts and to help erase the two remaining scars.  My only advice is to continue using it for a full two months before giving up, as it can take six weeks to get all the gunk out of your pores.  Awesome product, I hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> It is one of the few products I can trust to even out my skin complexion in a day or two. I signed up to get it shipped to me every 6 month</li>
            <li> It got here in a normal size box considering the product is really small.&lt;br /&gt;It was fast and it was super protected.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m already using the product, and I think it&#x27;s very efficient.</li>
            <li> My favorite acne product. It really does help fade acne spots. If you&#x27;re going to buy acne medication anyway, why not buy one that does double duty?</li>
            <li> It is very effective in stopping budding pimples from growing big, but doesn&#x27;t dry up big pimples. As long as I can get to the pimple in time, this product works well. It is more than I can say for any product I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Since I had Amazon Prime, the item came really quickly. I believe I got it in a day rather than two.  I was excited to try this out because of the reviews but I haven&#x27;t gotten the results the reviews claim. I have a few acne here and there on my face so I was hoping this would clear them out. I&#x27;ve used this for several weeks daily and some acne did diminish but it hasn&#x27;t cleared them out. I assume this is the \\&quot;fight\\&quot; part of the name. It&#x27;s not clear and fade gel after all.  For the fading part, I haven&#x27;t had any results. It might be the fact that I&#x27;m rather tan as I live in California but I was hoping the fade factor would be effective. I&#x27;m still getting hyper pigmentation from my acne.  The tube gives you a fair amount and a little goes a long way.  Sometimes when I cover my acne with this gel, it stings but it&#x27;s bearable. I try not to accidentally brush my hand against the spots I&#x27;ve covered because this residue from the gel comes off.  In all, it works mediocre in the fight portion but not in the fading portion. It does not help my Rosecea. I do not think I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this is so effective, but it&#x27;s the most effective breakout fighter in my arsenal.  Benzyl Peroxide dries out my skin, but doesn&#x27;t really get rid of pimples for me. Salicylic Acid does work, but for some reason this product works better than all the other salicylic acid spot treatments I&#x27;ve tried. Maybe it&#x27;s the high concentration, or maybe it&#x27;s the glycolic acid, but this product is extremely effective.  It won&#x27;t kill all pimples, but I&#x27;ve found that it can stop a breakout in its tracks. If you slather it on a breakout area (spot treatment... I know) it will keep a breakout from happening. Last night, I saw two little pimples developing, put this on, and this morning both of them had dried up completely. The other pimples from my previous angry breakout also look noticeably faded, which is great since my skin usually scars very easily.  Obviously, not all skin products work for everyone, but this is an awesomely powerful product for my face, and I&#x27;m definitely taking one with me wherever I go.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from acne since I was a young girl.It was not sever acne but it was constantly lingering around. I just always hide myself and felt uncomfortable in my own skin. When I was in high school I was tired of hiding so I decided that I would just have to accept myself this way and so would everyone else. I all on its own my acne just started disappearing it was great I did not use any miracle face wash or creams. But as an adult I started breaking out again but this time they weren&#x27;t regular pimple they were cystic. Although this product did not get rid of these aliens completely they did dry them enough within a week which helped a lot because cystic acne hurts. This product works for the price I cannot be happier with it. I still have not found an acne solution but at least this product reduces the bumps and redness.</li>
            <li> This works almost immediated for me...everyone&#x27;s skin is different but this helps me..</li>
            <li> I get bumps and blackheads but not true acne.  However, when I regularly use this on my nose, the sebum is controlled.  I also use it on four large pores (not on nose) that normally would appear dark brown or black.  First I use a very soft battery powered brush with soap on it to clean my face and rinse with lukewarm water.  Then I lightly coat my nose and spot the gel on the pores and across my chin.  I use a Neutrogena lotion very lightly on forehead, around eyes and upper lip and neck.  The ONLY time since acquiring them that the pores get clean and appear smaller (debris gone) is when I regularly follow the above routine.  The small tubes last a very long time since I use a small amount each time.  There is no need to use a lot and would only be a waste.  In two years, I&#x27;ve bought two tubes. When current one gone, I&#x27;ll buy another since this product works for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter.  She has tried many products but gets very good results with this product.</li>
            <li> this works pretty well, like 80% of the time</li>
            <li> I rely on this little tube. It really works. Tip: Just a little will do but be consistent, apply several times a day.</li>
            <li> I bought this this gel thinkin it would work.. But it didnt work for me:/ it did help for the pimPles but not for the blemishes..</li>
            <li> The gel goes on wet and seems to stay wet.. It also smells like gorilla glue and the smell does not go away until you wash your face.. I dont see any fast clearing of the skin of acne..</li>
            <li> When paired with the Neutrogena Rapid Clear Toner + Cleanser, this gel works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have a minor case of breakouts? No problem. Use the cleanse + toner then this.... kiss those breakouts goodbye the next morning. I don&#x27;t know what magic they put into this but it works every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I would NOT recommend using this alongside the Neutrogena Rapid Clear Lotion. Together, the Fade Gel and Lotion do not mix. The lotion gets clumpy once it has made contact with the gel and they both fail to do their job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But without use of the lotion, the gel works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed. I bought this because I had an awful cystic blemish that was very painful, large, and red. Normally these take weeks to go away for me, even with my usual routine of dabbing tea tree oil on it. Decided to try this on a whim. Glad I did. By the next day, the pain was severely diminished. Within three days, it was barely there anymore, the swelling and redness was nearly gone. A week later it was like it never even happened. I get hormonal acne, but I&#x27;ve been using this on any blemish I get as soon as I notice it and I feel like my skin has never looked so clear. For me, this stuff is definitely a keeper.</li>
            <li> i really dont have anything good or bad to say about this product but my experience with it was okay i guess...i had alot of acne scares and current acne, i used this product as instructed but it seemed like i was just useless after three months of use my acne has improved slightly and same goes for my scars! but i don know if it was because of the work of this product or just time, either way im not really pleased with my acne problems!</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how fast my scares were clearing up that I thought why not try it on my sun spot. It has never look lighter.  i love this stuff. Yes, i&#x27;m also noticing less breakouts!</li>
            <li> It leaves behind a shiny residue, and I did not find it as effective as my favorite-now-discontinued-am-really-sad Neutrogena Rapid Clear Sore Pimple Eliminating Gel. While I noticed an improvement in the size of my pimple with the latter within hours (as well as a soothing coolness and decrease in soreness), I did not notice the same effect from the Fight and Fade Gel. It leaves behind a shiny residue so I would not recommend wearing it under makeup. I tried once and it was obvious that I had something on there. The gel would also peel. I did not use it more than a few times to notice whether it actually faded blemish marks (although based on my experience with the toner, it probably was not effective for fading either). I gave it to my sister instead.</li>
            <li> My scars are not fading.</li>
            <li> This is the only acne treatment that works for me</li>
            <li> Reading good reviews from others, and thought that this might be a good product, it turns out to be ineffective in treating acne. It only makes your acne worse..</li>
            <li> Nice container, does what it says it will do, thanks Amazon nice price! This I understand is a favorite among movie set Makeup artists!</li>
            <li> I wouldnt call this perfect but it works okay. It didnt clear my bumps overnight but helped with the color and size. Takes a few nights though.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff; it is really one of my favorite acne products. just put it on a couple times a day, and it will reduce the size and redness of a pimple that you just popped. Another reviewer has mentioned that it is used on movie sets and by actors. I don&#x27;t doubt it, it can take down the size of a unpopped pimple pretty quickly too. If you&#x27;re thinking about getting it, i would suggest you try; It may be pricey, but i bought a tube months ago and I&#x27;ve still got half left. A little goes a long way with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Good price for this product</li>
            <li> I keep this at all times.  It keeps your skin clear and helps with oily skin as well.  A MUST HAVE!!!</li>
            <li> It didnt do a single thing. Its suppose to fight and fade acne, but it did not fade anything. It didnt help get rid my acne problem. Not as much as i hoped. i mostly get zits on my chin, and this product did not help.</li>
            <li> I thought with the name Neutrogena that I would love this product, but it was sorely lacking.&lt;br /&gt;It did not help with my breakout duration, it did not help with the redness, nor in fading the lingering redness.&lt;br /&gt;I am middle aged, I have had a couple bouts of severe acne in the past ( teen to 20&#x60;s, and then adult acne in my 30&#x60;s  and was under Rx&#x60;s and the GREAT ProActiv )  but now I get the occasional breakout that varies from a &#x27;bad&#x27; pimple, to a small but aggravating zits.&lt;br /&gt;This product may seem as a gentle remedy , however, I see it as so gentle that it had zero affect.&lt;br /&gt;I have come to prefer and recommend Terminator 10 by Acnefree,&lt;br /&gt;Terminator 10  combats redness during and after, clears pimples in every range fast, does not dry ( which I love , I do not have dry skin, but at my age I do not want to risk it ) , and even helps clear blackheads and small clogged pores.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x60;t waste my money, time, or wishful thinking on this Neutrogena product again.</li>
            <li> I am a 20 year old guy who gets really embarrassing acne still especially on my nose. I periodically get this redness on my nose every 3-4 months and end up looking like Rudolph I applied this type of gel to the area and within 2 hours i noticed the redness significantly faded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didnt notice the smell much it didn&#x27;t bother me and yes it is kind of like jelly right now I give it 4 stars because it worked so fast I will update my review once I leave it on overnight and see how fast it works.</li>
            <li> Dark areas on my face were noticeably . . . er . . . less noticeable after using this gel just one time.  I am delighted to have found it.</li>
            <li> works good and fast and you can apply it right to the source during night or day. woks awesome if you use it on pimples before they come out cause itll stop them quick.</li>
            <li> If you can catch a pimple early, then this actually works in controlling it if you use it day and night. However, if you let the pimple grow during the day without treating, then this won&#x27;t do much later in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t like the texture. It leaves a clear gel layer that can rub away if you try to put any makeup or concealer over it, so it&#x27;s not great for daytime use.</li>
            <li> If you have a breakout nothing works better than this!!</li>
            <li> this product was terrific, espically on my area where i have pimples in on spot this took them all way in a matter in 5 days i was great cause i ad a formal to go to and i wasnt going with my face.... but try this and you wont go back to regular gels..</li>
            <li> I purchased the Neutrogena Rapid Clear Fight &amp; Fade Gel for my 14 year old son and it has worked great. I can always tell a difference if he SKIPS using the treatment. Benzoyl Peroxide lotions are not effective on him so he uses Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Wash (orange) and Clearasil Ultra Pore Cleansing Pads EVERY morning and night. He then applies a thin coat of the Neutrogena Gel to his acne prone areas. These products contain Salicylic Acid which has been tremendously effective in reducing and preventing break outs. He did not have a face full of acne just the T-Zone area and mainly his chin but acne is tough to get rid of so you have to hit it hard and be consistent in the treatment of it for it to be effective. If a pimple pops up and it does on occasion, he uses the Acnefree Sulphur Mask (stores have their own brand as well) as an overnight spot treatment to dry it up quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a problem with painful cystic acne breakouts on my chin and along my jawline until I began using Salicylic Acid and Sulphur products. Benzoyl Peroxide products are not effective on my acne either. I use the Neutrogena Pink Grapefruit (YUMMY!) wash &amp; scrub along with the Rapid Clear Fight &amp; Fade Toner twice daily. I use the Fight &amp; Fade gel at night on my chin/jawline. If a pimple pops up I cover it with the Sulphur mask overnight. This gel is hard to wear underneath a liquid based product (lotion, foundation, sunscreen) because it rolls up and flakes off when a wet product is applied over it so you girls may need to use the gel at night or change to a mineral powdered base make up. I guess you could apply the gel over the other products (it&#x27;s clear) but I doubt it will be very effective if it can&#x27;t absorb into your skin through other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son began having back acne this year so I purchased a Dial Antibacterial Body Wash and the Neutrogena Body Clear Spray which also contains Salicylic Acid. He uses the spray after his nightly shower and his back acne is GONE! He still gets a pimple every now &amp; then but a dab of the Sulphur Mask dries it up fast. He HAD hundreds of tiny pimples and several red, inflamed acne cysts on his back before he began using these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: Rarely, does ONE product clear up acne unless it is VERY VERY MILD so a combination of products or kit is ALMOST ALWAYS NEEDED!! If over the counter products are not working please see a doctor! There is NO reason for anyone to suffer with acne especially teenagers who can be traumatized by this. Remember, you must USE the products twice daily, every day for them to work in most cases and teenage boys are lazy so I have to stay on my son. Good hygiene is a MUST so cleanse and treat in the morning and before bed. Try to keep your hands off of your face during the day to reduce the transfer of dirt &amp; bacteria, change your pillowcase frequently (hair product residue will only worsen acne), increase your water consumption and keep your phone clean with a product containing alcohol.

            <li> I got this after I used up my previous acne treatment cream, Neutrogena All-in-1 Acne Control. This 2-in-1 gel is a lot harsher than the All-in-1 acne cream. I can actually feel the tingling when I put it on. It works well reducing the swelling of early acne and any discoloration from old acne. And I think it fades the look of old acne scars (the ones that resemble dents in the skin) better, but it might just be psychological because it feels like a face peel? Anyway, definitely don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it to do the work so this one tube is probably going to last me for more than a year. Overall, I think the cream version from Neutrogena works just as well, without the slight burn, so I will probably go back to that after this tube is used up.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used. I rarely write reviews although I often read them. I&#x27;ve had rosacea and oily red skin for years. I have fair sensitive skin too with an allergy to benzoil peroxide. I&#x27;ve tried a ton of products over the years from script to OTC. This is the first one which actually works for me. I wash my face 2x per day with a salycitic acid wash then apply a salycitic treatment product and during the day a salycitic containing oil free base makeup to hide the red rash look of my face and then a salycitic face powder to fix the shine. I bought this product because it was small and light and I could take it on vacation. After a week&#x27;s use I could go without base makeup or face powder for the first time in probably 25 years. This is the first product which actually worked for me. I use this product as the salycitic treatment product in my routine 2x per day after wash and still use a base and powder because I&#x27;m paranoid of my face rash coming back- nothing is worse than going through life with people asking you if you are okay because you have a red shiny rash all over your face! Now I&#x27;m looking to buy this product in bulk!</li>
            <li> It works ! You will see results overnight.</li>
            <li> Try every other product. But this worked really well for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year now, in addition to other anti-acne products. From what I&#x27;ve noticed, it seems to be pretty good at treating acne but not amazing. In addition, I have noticed some fading of old scars, but the efficacy varies according to how old the scars are and how regularly you apply this gel. I appreciate the scent of this product, which isn&#x27;t overpowering and is quite pleasant, especially compared to the medicinal smell of many other anti-acne creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I didn&#x27;t like, however, has to do with the texture of the gel. Although it goes on quite smoothly, when I apply make-up or lotions, sometimes it tends to ball up. It&#x27;s super annoying when it does this because it looks gross and I have to re-apply everything. For this reason, I tend to only use it at night before going to sleep. Naturally, because I don&#x27;t apply it twice a day as recommended, the scar-fading properties don&#x27;t work as well. However, it does tend to make the tube last longer, which is nice since it can get a little pricey. When I was using it twice a day, I usually ran out fairly quickly (maybe once a month or so) and had to restock quite often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product as fairly effective, but I&#x27;m not 100% behind it. I still continue to use it but I&#x27;m still on the lookout for more effective and/or cheaper alternatives.</li>
