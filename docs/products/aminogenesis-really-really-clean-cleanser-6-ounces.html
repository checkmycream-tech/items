    <ol>
            <li>/&gt;Aminogenesis products are the best!</li>
            <li>I have been an Aesthetician (Facialist) and Makeup Artist for 11 years and have had access to all of the best products out there.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best face wash ever.</li>
            <li>Very good product got to stock up on this.</li>
            <li>this cleanser is great</li>
            <li>It removes makeup without stripping the skin, it smells great and is great for a variety of skin types.</li>
            <li>Great product and service.</li>
            <li>Great cleanser at a good price.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it is the best lotion I found and would recommend it to everyone - women and men.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s good.</li>

            <li>I love how my face feels after I use this face soap!</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT ON MY FACE!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s one of best products in the AG line but doesn&#x27;t really heal or repair anything</li>
            <li>This cleanser doesn&#x27;t strip my skin&#x27;s moisture yet effectively dissolves makeup, oil, and grime to leave my skin feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li>I must say this cleanser is affordable, effective and full of great ingredients.</li>
            <li>i contacted the seller and they sent me a new bottle which i thought was great!..</li>
            <li>and this is by far, the best product for your money!</li>
            <li>it will keep your skin clean and bright.</li>
            <li>Sincerely  Janet</li>
            <li>she looks so much better.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks better and feels better.  </li>
            <li>my favorite face wash.</li>
            <li>I also feel that the ingredients of this cleanser are much more nourishing and better for my skin&#x27;s health and better for anti-aging benefits than most cleansing products out there.</li>
            <li>I have ordered this product many times.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully others will have a better experience with this product...</li>
            <li>highly recommend great price</li>
            <li>Amino Genesis is the best thing that has happen to me in a very long time</li>
            <li>Great product for oily skin though, not the best for continued use on sensitive or dry skin.</li>
            <li>I think the packaging is great and it is very affordable for getting such a great quality product.</li>
            <li>This cleanser works great for me as I have sensitive, aging skin.</li>
            <li>The company itself didn&#x27;t pay us or give us more product for a year like they said they would and the infomercial wasn&#x27;t made, but I&#x27;m now buying my own Really</li>
            <li>For a gentle loving touch, I love this wash.  </li>
            <li>That said, it is washes fine, but so do Neutrogena products.</li>
            <li>it feels fantastic on my skin.</li>
            <li>I Love this product,I have been using Aminogenesis Face wash for 4 years now and the new formula is even better.</li>
            <li>Really Clean cleanser</li>
            <li>REALLY CLEAN FEELING CLEANSER.</li>
            <li>This leaves your face sparkling clean.</li>
            <li>skin and a clean glow.</li>
            <li>I also like the sweet, clean smell.</li>
            <li>Really Really Clean has cleared her skin up tremendously.</li>
            <li>Love this productions the whole line of products.</li>
            <li>The cleaner is very gentle and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I almost consider this product as essential as water on my face...a PERFECT facial wash...not too drying, while managing to exquisitely clean the pores...</li>
            <li>I recommend this cleanser to anyone who wants fresh, clean skin!</li>
            <li>Makeup comes off easily and yet it&#x27;s gentle on the skin.  </li>
            <li>It cleans the skin properly without drying it out and over time leaves it with a nice glow.</li>
            <li>as for me im willing to pay a few extra bucks for all my beauty products from now on..as i have been reading many reviews about sellers not selling the real thing..then we wonder why they give us great deals!!</li>
            <li>My all time favorite facial cleaner!</li>
            <li>Cleans the face really well, rinses clean and leaves no residue, highly recommend for any type of skin,I really like it</li>
            <li>They leaked so much on the bottles themselves</li>
            <li>These were all products from Herbspro, but still sold by Amazon so they are just as responsible as these are the companies they chose.  </li>
            <li>I will say that I started using it (the whole anti aging line from Amino Genesis)when</li>
            <li>I use in combination with a acne wash in the morning and gentle cleanse (Amino) at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So incredibly gentle and yet, removes all the excess oil and dirt without drying the skin.</li>
            <li>Thank you and thanks for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li>the more my face feels alittle rough</li>
            <li>You only use a really small amount and it works great.</li>
            <li>The white covering on top that is supposed to protect the product was actually bubbled up and spilling out of the container.</li>
            <li>but I have been breaking out pretty consistently for the last two weeks since I&#x27;ve been using this.  </li>
            <li>It left my face a clean and soft feeling!</li>
            <li>Gently cleans and makes skin soft.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a few months but the more i use it</li>
            <li>the new bottle also didnt have the protection seal on it..</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin clear and glowing!</li>
            <li>And they were not small.  </li>
            <li>Cleans and foams thoroughly, rinses easily, stings a little sometimes (acids in the cleanser), and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.  </li>
            <li>(cleansers don&#x27;t stay on the face long enough to make significant change).  </li>
            <li>You are cleaning your face with 17 amino acids and vital nutrients.  </li>
            <li>It simply does what it says---really really cleans!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This cleanser takes my makeup off completely, cleans my face thoroughly, but does not leave it stripped.  </li>
            <li>It feels soft and moisturizer as well.  </li>
            <li>Love this cleanser , it removes every trace of makeup, mascara as well, without leaving your skin feeling dry and tight.......</li>
            <li>at least until I started using Really Really Clean.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this product.  Makeup comes off easily and yet it&#x27;s gentle on the skin.  I also like the sweet, clean smell. You are cleaning your face with 17 amino acids and vital nutrients.  I have used this product for over three years and won&#x27;t switch to anything else.</li>
            <li> I ordered several products but this one review is going to cover them all.  The products were received without proper lids which in shipping made them spill all over the boxes and stuck them together.  They leaked so much on the bottles themselves the labels were coming off!  This is a product that I was then supposed to use on my face.  I don&#x27;t think so! The product that was shipped seperately was just as bad.  The white covering on top that is supposed to protect the product was actually bubbled up and spilling out of the container. These were all products from Herbspro, but still sold by Amazon so they are just as responsible as these are the companies they chose.  All products were returned for refund which is always a hassle so I will not be buying any skin products from Amazon in the future, I don&#x27;t care how much less they are.  Remember you get what you pay for!  VERY disappointed in Amazon.  Sincerely  Janet</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a big acne problem but I used to get one or two a month in the same areas. And they were not small.  at least until I started using Really Really Clean.  I will say that I started using it (the whole anti aging line from Amino Genesis)when I was doing a test trial for an infomercial.  The company itself didn&#x27;t pay us or give us more product for a year like they said they would and the infomercial wasn&#x27;t made, but I&#x27;m now buying my own Really Really Clean cleanser because when I went back to another face cleanser, the acne was back.  I recommended it to my 15 year old neice who was having a really bad acne problem.  She had tried Pro-active and that other thing that&#x27;s out there now too.  neither worked.  Really Really Clean has cleared her skin up tremendously. she looks so much better. I don&#x27;t know about the anti-aging aspect (I think that&#x27;s why they didn&#x27;t pay us because it didn&#x27;t make us look younger)But it will keep your skin clean and bright.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the AminoGenesis Line for about 6 months now and I love it.  My skin looks better and feels better.  The cleaner is very gentle and easy to use.</li>
            <li> . . . this smells very odd, almost as though animal products had been used and the processing hadn&#x27;t been completed.  After developing headaches 3X from using this product, I threw it out.    That said, it is washes fine, but so do Neutrogena products.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser at a good price.</li>
            <li> I almost consider this product as essential as water on my face...a PERFECT facial wash...not too drying, while managing to exquisitely clean the pores...and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of stuff!!  I&#x27;m a lifer on Amazon if you continue to carry this product...</li>
            <li> My esthetician reccomended this stuff.  I like the texture and consistency but I have been breaking out pretty consistently for the last two weeks since I&#x27;ve been using this.  Dont know if its this or since its summer vacation could be kids-home-stress, but either way I am moving on!</li>
            <li> I Love this product,I have been using Aminogenesis Face wash for 4 years now and the new formula is even better.</li>
            <li> REALLY CLEAN FEELING CLEANSER. I&#x27;M A FAN NOW.</li>
            <li> For a gentle loving touch, I love this wash.  I use in combination with a acne wash in the morning and gentle cleanse (Amino) at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have changed the formula slightly but it smells even yummier.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cleanser for about 2 yrs and even though once in a while I try other products, I always come back to it.  It simply does what it says---really really cleans!!&lt;br /&gt;Aminogenesis products are the best!</li>
            <li> this cleanser is great it feels fantastic on my skin. I have a lot of face cleansers, but this is the only one I use anymore! I love Amino Genesis!</li>
            <li> Have used this cleanser for a long time. Gently cleans and makes skin soft.</li>
            <li> It left my face a clean and soft feeling!</li>
            <li> Cleans and foams thoroughly, rinses easily, stings a little sometimes (acids in the cleanser), and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.  Can&#x27;t beat the online price.  I think it&#x27;s one of best products in the AG line but doesn&#x27;t really heal or repair anything (cleansers don&#x27;t stay on the face long enough to make significant change).  Can&#x27;t use daily with clairisonic brush bec the brush and gel cleanser make my face a little red and raw.  Great product for oily skin though, not the best for continued use on sensitive or dry skin.</li>
            <li> my favorite face wash. been buying this product for well over 7 years</li>
            <li> I love this product because it is the best lotion I found and would recommend it to everyone - women and men.</li>
            <li> Cleans the face really well, rinses clean and leaves no residue, highly recommend for any type of skin,I really like it</li>
            <li> I have been an Aesthetician (Facialist) and Makeup Artist for 11 years and have had access to all of the best products out there. I must say this cleanser is affordable, effective and full of great ingredients. I use it and it works better than some $60.00 cleansers! It removes makeup without stripping the skin, it smells great and is great for a variety of skin types. I find it especially soothing for acne. I think the packaging is great and it is very affordable for getting such a great quality product.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite facial cleaner! So incredibly gentle and yet, removes all the excess oil and dirt without drying the skin.</li>
            <li> Been using this several years. I know it&#x27;s good. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product, it cleans your face really really clean</li>
            <li> Love this productions the whole line of products. Been using it for about two years. It cleans the skin properly without drying it out and over time leaves it with a nice glow.</li>
            <li> I love this product! You only use a really small amount and it works great. I&#x27;ve tried everything for my skin (dermalogica, miracle skin, posh, murad, etc) and this is by far, the best product for your money!</li>
            <li> I love how my face feels after I use this face soap! It&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> I recommend this cleanser to anyone who wants fresh, clean skin! This cleanser doesn&#x27;t strip my skin&#x27;s moisture yet effectively dissolves makeup, oil, and grime to leave my skin feeling refreshed. It does not leave a residue or break me out. I have oily, acne-prone skin and I use this and the Therapeutic Facial Repair and they help balance my skin well. I no longer have to use a separate makeup remover- and I wear a LOT of makeup! I also feel that the ingredients of this cleanser are much more nourishing and better for my skin&#x27;s health and better for anti-aging benefits than most cleansing products out there.</li>
            <li> Great product and service.</li>
            <li> My girl uses this every morning she said she recommends this to everyone. Very good product got to stock up on this.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT ON MY FACE! It&#x27;s the best face wash ever. Keeps my skin clear and glowing! A Must have !</li>
            <li> This cleanser works great for me as I have sensitive, aging skin. Leaves my skin feeling supple without the risk of any breakouts.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser , it removes every trace of makeup, mascara as well, without leaving your skin feeling dry and tight.......highly recommend great price</li>
            <li> Amino Genesis is the best thing that has happen to me in a very long time</li>
            <li> This cleanser takes my makeup off completely, cleans my face thoroughly, but does not leave it stripped.  It feels soft and moisturizer as well.  I have ordered this product many times.  I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> This leaves your face sparkling clean. It also leavers a silky feel to you skin and a clean glow. Thank you and thanks for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Deffinately beware! when i got this cleanser it did not have the seal of protection on it..i contacted the seller and they sent me a new bottle which i thought was great!..the new bottle also didnt have the protection seal on it..I have been using this product for a few months but the more i use it the more my face feels alittle rough ..i do not see any improvement despite using this with its facial moisturizer...I find it hard to belive these are legit aminogenesis products! Ofcourse im not positive about this but i did read a review from someone stating that these products do not have the same scent as others...who knows just beware..as for me im willing to pay a few extra bucks for all my beauty products from now on..as i have been reading many reviews about sellers not selling the real thing..then we wonder why they give us great deals!! Hopefully others will have a better experience with this product...</li>
