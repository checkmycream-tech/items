            <li>My gums feel and look so much better.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the soothing smooth mint over the invigorating clean mint flavor but both are good if you like mint.  </li>
            <li>Much better than the original &#x27;Pro Health&#x27; release.  </li>
            <li>My teeth and gums feel so clean and healthy after using it.</li>
            <li>I love how clean this toothpaste leaves my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>This product creates mild to severe allergic reactions in many though not all people.</li>
            <li>Such Great price.</li>
            <li>This is not a mouth friendly product.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean all day even after eating and drinking.</li>
            <li>It seems more abrasive than other toothpastes, which leads me to believe cleans superiorly.</li>
            <li>It also leaves a tingly, cool mentholated feeling along my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to buy whatever toothpaste was on sale, but now, I buy only this product based on the superior results.</li>
            <li>Got a sample of this on my last visit to the dentist and loved it.</li>
            <li>My hygienist recommended I use this to help with some mild gingivitis.</li>
            <li>I have been using this particular toothpaste for more than a year.</li>
            <li>I was wondering if this was normal, so I checked online, and I&#x27;m glad that I did-</li>
            <li>I got him crest toothpaste on subscribe and save as a christmas present and he really liked it.</li>
            <li>It has now been 5 days since I&#x27;ve used Pro-Health toothpaste and my stains are almost completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hesitant to say that this toothpaste stained my teeth, but I can say for sure that it did not help the situation.</li>
            <li>but I thought if it works, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>the opening is just the right size for a toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>and you will blow right through it.  </li>
            <li>Nice taste and better than the usual toothpaste you buy at the supermarket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Item arrived very fast.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of crest toothpaste and this is by far my favorite its the only one I buy now!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the first brushing, I noticed the peeling that everyone is complaining about.</li>
            <li>so many people are saying that the same things are happening or have happened to them!</li>
            <li>A quality product that is even better in a double pack.</li>
            <li>For me, most other toothpaste products are so loaded with chemical mint flavor that the inside of my mouth feels like it&#x27;s on fire whereas this toothpaste is pretty mild and doesn&#x27;t make me feel like I&#x27;m ablating the inside of my mouth every time I brush my teeth.</li>
            <li>After my first brushing after switching to this, I noticed that skin was peeling from my mouth, but I didn&#x27;t think much of it.</li>
            <li>- there are more and much more serious than staining.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d pay another $.50 just to have a traditional tube of toothpaste from which you can easily get the amount you want.</li>
            <li>Then I noticed that my mouth felt dry and that there was quite a bit of peeling, more than I realized initially- from my cheeks and lower lip primarily.</li>
            <li>I really like the tube this stuff comes in</li>
            <li>and you end of using twice as much as you need.  </li>
            <li>The top that stays attached to the tube won&#x27;t stay closed either.  </li>
            <li>Not so fast my friend.</li>
            <li>Hoping it is actually that much better for my gums, but not going to let them oversell me too far.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite toothpaste (other than Colgate Junior</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why a company would think it&#x27;s OK for an oral rinse to stain teeth!  </li>
            <li>Then you can go buy some more in half the time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting older</li>
            <li>So, I brushed last night, and gums seemed to feel better.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend for oral health and gum care.</li>
            <li>have two new bottles of the rinse and two new tubes of the paste that are going into the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any of the negative side effects that other people complain of.</li>
            <li>Make sure you get the 5.8 size as the 4.0 size is too small</li>
            <li>Better than the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; toothpastes I used in the past.  </li>
            <li>The dentist was not overly concerned and he was able to get the stains off in my normal teeth cleaning, but a few weeks after the cleaning, back came the stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/cleaning off the plaque on my teeth, even near the gum-line.  </li>
            <li>After using this toothpaste combined with the vitality spin toothbrush, I have noticed the swelling go away completely.</li>
            <li>Gosh, I read so many negative reviews that I almost didn&#x27;t try this toothpaste for gingivitis.  </li>
            <li>Also, so far, no slime, sores, etc.</li>
            <li>I have switched to a very soft toothbrush as recommended and only used for about a minute.  </li>
            <li>You have to find a way to put the tube upright between uses or you waste half of it leaking out on your counter top.</li>
            <li>I was shocked to read so many negative reviews on Amazon but have not had any of the problems other users have experienced.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to explain, but it feels like there are tiny smooth particles in the paste that are actually scrubbing</li>
            <li>Its more like a gentle exfoliation than anything unpleasant, and my mouth feels cleaner and longer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very surprised by the bad reviews of this toothpaste - I love it and it has been a lifesaver during pregnancy, which has made my gums incredibly sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s odd that many other people say this burns their mouth and is too harsh when I have the opposite effect.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this mess for TWO days...</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see the negative reviews of this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be going back to my usual stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing the price of this item is almost the same as target etc, but I have to say, I am never able to get the 5oz.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks, my gums had improved but I noticed dark stains between my teeth.</li>
            <li> Beware, there is truth in the reviews that say an odd slime lasts in your mouth for hours.</li>
            <li> It is a little on the pricey side</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve got to say that after using this for a few weeks, my teeth appear brighter and they truly feel cleaner.</li>
            <li> After a few days of using it your mouth feels as though you have chemical burns on your tongue, gums, and cheeks.</li>
            <li> Let Crest help you stand up to deadly victimize-r.</li>
            <li> Is it dead cells?</li>
            <li> Your tongue swells up and your taste buds become raw.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll usually buy whatever name-brand toothpaste is on sale (e.g., Aim)</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to get the amount of toothpaste you want</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I will continue using until I have a negative effect</li>
            <li> THEN I started to develop serious gum irritation and tooth pain.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;And then the internet is flooded with reports of the toothpaste causing serious gum irritation and teeth pain.  </li>
            <li> a little weird</li>
            <li> My advice is to give it a shot if you have poor gums and see how it goes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Worried about the stains, I decided to step up my game and try Crest Pro-Health Clinical toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I will say, like other users, I did notice the interior of my gums \\&quot;shedding\\&quot; but not in a painful way.</li>
            <li> My husband has a problem with swollen gums (nothing wrong though)</li>
            <li> My fiance likes it, but I think it has a weird aftertaste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weird.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re on the fence with this product and your gums are in bad shape, use it.</li>
            <li> My reaction has been quite painful.</li>
            <li> I have had a terrible experience which I believe is connected to Crest Pro-Health Clinical Rinse and Crest Pro-Health Clinical</li>
            <li> The taste is horrible</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are awful, awful products.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ll usually buy whatever name-brand toothpaste is on sale (e.g., Aim) but I&#x27;ve got to say that after using this for a few weeks, my teeth appear brighter and they truly feel cleaner. It&#x27;s hard to explain, but it feels like there are tiny smooth particles in the paste that are actually scrubbing/cleaning off the plaque on my teeth, even near the gum-line.  When I&#x27;m done, I can run my tongue over my teeth and they actually feel smoother. It also leaves a tingly, cool mentholated feeling along my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was told by my dentist to use a toothpaste that specifically promotes its ability to fight/remove plaque along the gum-line and help prevent damage from gingivitis. This toothpaste actually says it can help repair damage from gingivitis after four weeks, so I&#x27;m giving it a try and will r4port back after my next dentist visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall very happy with the product</li>
            <li> I have used this since it came out and have NO bad effects but all good . My gums and teeth sensitiveity could&#x27;nt be better! It&#x27;s a great product so thank-you. Tastes great too!</li>
            <li> This product creates mild to severe allergic reactions in many though not all people. My reaction has been quite painful. After a few days of using it your mouth feels as though you have chemical burns on your tongue, gums, and cheeks. Your tongue swells up and your taste buds become raw. This is not a mouth friendly product.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite toothpaste (other than Colgate Junior but I&#x27;m a little old for that now). I think it&#x27;s odd that many other people say this burns their mouth and is too harsh when I have the opposite effect. For me, most other toothpaste products are so loaded with chemical mint flavor that the inside of my mouth feels like it&#x27;s on fire whereas this toothpaste is pretty mild and doesn&#x27;t make me feel like I&#x27;m ablating the inside of my mouth every time I brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very surprised by the bad reviews of this toothpaste - I love it and it has been a lifesaver during pregnancy, which has made my gums incredibly sensitive.  This toothpaste has relieved a lot of the sensitivity in my gums. I haven&#x27;t experienced any of the negative side effects that other people complain of.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite toothpaste. My teeth and gums feel so clean and healthy after using it. My husband has a problem with swollen gums (nothing wrong though) so the dentist recommended this product and it has reduced the swelling on his gums. My teeth feel clean all day even after eating and drinking. I am a huge fan of crest toothpaste and this is by far my favorite its the only one I buy now! I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> My dad is the hardest person to get a gift for. I got him crest toothpaste on subscribe and save as a christmas present and he really liked it. a little weird but he was happy.</li>
            <li> Several months ago, I began to notice that my gums were receding. At first, I didn&#x27;t believe it to be anything serious. I wasn&#x27;t a regular flosser, so I assumed that flossing would correct the problem. When it didn&#x27;t, I went down to the local drug store and purchased nearly every product that claimed to hold a solution to my gum problem. Crest Pro-Health toothpaste and rinse were among my purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first brushing, I noticed the peeling that everyone is complaining about. The inside of my mouth began to shed soon after I brushed my teeth. This didn&#x27;t bother me. After 3 weeks, my gums had improved but I noticed dark stains between my teeth. Online reviews told me the stains were coming from the Pro-Health rinse, so I immediately discontinued the rinse. I continued to use the toothpaste, and my gums continued to improve. The stains between my teeth did not improve. I didn&#x27;t even consider that the toothpaste could be part of the problem until I went out of town for 2 days and had to use another paste. The staining improved drastically within two days. It has now been 5 days since I&#x27;ve used Pro-Health toothpaste and my stains are almost completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hesitant to say that this toothpaste stained my teeth, but I can say for sure that it did not help the situation. (Though I do know that the toothpaste contains an ingredient that can cause staining.) If you&#x27;re on the fence with this product and your gums are in bad shape, use it. If your gums are ok, then I wouldn&#x27;t risk the staining.</li>
            <li> My hygienist recommended I use this to help with some mild gingivitis. Of course, I assumed that she knew what she was talking about and got the toothpaste. After my first brushing after switching to this, I noticed that skin was peeling from my mouth, but I didn&#x27;t think much of it. Then I noticed that my mouth felt dry and that there was quite a bit of peeling, more than I realized initially- from my cheeks and lower lip primarily. I was wondering if this was normal, so I checked online, and I&#x27;m glad that I did- so many people are saying that the same things are happening or have happened to them! I&#x27;ve only been using this mess for TWO days... I can&#x27;t imagine how my mouth would be feeling if I used it for a week or more like some others had before stopping. I can&#x27;t believe that my hygienist recommended this, but more than that, I can&#x27;t believe that this stuff is still being made since people have been complaining about this for years! I&#x27;ll be going back to my usual stuff.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Clinical Gum Protection Toothpaste is my favorite toothpaste.  My dentist recommended it because my gums were starting to recede.  I prefer the soothing smooth mint over the invigorating clean mint flavor but both are good if you like mint.  I really like the tube this stuff comes in, the cap is flat so it can sit upright in my medicine cabinet and the opening is just the right size for a toothbrush.  Make sure you get the 5.8 size as the 4.0 size is too small and you will blow right through it.  It is a little on the pricey side but Crest is a name you can trust.  I was shocked to read so many negative reviews on Amazon but have not had any of the problems other users have experienced.  My advice is to give it a shot if you have poor gums and see how it goes.</li>
            <li> My fiance likes it, but I think it has a weird aftertaste. I also think toothpaste should not be crunchy. It&#x27;s weird.</li>
            <li> I love how clean this toothpaste leaves my teeth and gums. I used to buy whatever toothpaste was on sale, but now, I buy only this product based on the superior results. It seems more abrasive than other toothpastes, which leads me to believe cleans superiorly. I have 8 porcelain veneers and have had no issues after using this toothpaste for the paste 6 months. I used to accrue stains around the gum line of the veneers occasionally but no longer have that problem. I will say, like other users, I did notice the interior of my gums \\&quot;shedding\\&quot; but not in a painful way. I attribute it to the cleaning power of the product. Its more like a gentle exfoliation than anything unpleasant, and my mouth feels cleaner and longer.</li>
            <li> Only toothpaste I use.  Excellent product.  Does what it says it does. Highly recommend for oral health and gum care.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t comment on the toothpaste but this tube of toothpaste is the most difficult one I have ever used.  I think they do that on purpose so it&#x27;s hard to get the amount of toothpaste you want and you end of using twice as much as you need.  Then you can go buy some more in half the time.  The top that stays attached to the tube won&#x27;t stay closed either.  I&#x27;d pay another $.50 just to have a traditional tube of toothpaste from which you can easily get the amount you want. Edit #3/27/17 Accidentally bought more of these.  The tubes really leak bad even when they are half full.  You have to find a way to put the tube upright between uses or you waste half of it leaking out on your counter top.</li>
            <li> I have had a terrible experience which I believe is connected to Crest Pro-Health Clinical Rinse and Crest Pro-Health Clinical Toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using another rinse and decided to try Crest Pro-Health Clinical Rinse.  The taste is horrible (you feel like you&#x27;re rinsing your mouth with Windex) and your mouth will burn afterwards but I thought if it works, it&#x27;s worth it.  Then I started to develop brown stains on the edges of my teeth.  I&#x27;m getting older so I attributed this to age.  The dentist was not overly concerned and he was able to get the stains off in my normal teeth cleaning, but a few weeks after the cleaning, back came the stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worried about the stains, I decided to step up my game and try Crest Pro-Health Clinical toothpaste.  THEN I started to develop serious gum irritation and tooth pain.  My gums are raw, I feel like my gums are receding, and my teeth often hurt so much I have to take pain medication.  I&#x27;m miserable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worried about my symptoms, I looked on the internet and found that Crest Pro-Health Clinical products were the culprit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Procter &amp; Gamble fully acknowledges that the rinse WILL cause the brown staining, although this warning is nowhere on the bottle.  I&#x27;m not sure why a company would think it&#x27;s OK for an oral rinse to stain teeth!  And that&#x27;s just one side affect - there are more and much more serious than staining.  I think I got off easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then the internet is flooded with reports of the toothpaste causing serious gum irritation and teeth pain.  I don&#x27;t think this gum irritation is temporary, I think I&#x27;ve permanently damaged my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two new bottles of the rinse and two new tubes of the paste that are going into the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are awful, awful products.  Research them, and you&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see the negative reviews of this product. I have been using this particular toothpaste for more than a year. Never had any problems with it and no gingivitis at my latest dental appointment.</li>
            <li> I had braces two years ago and I always had issues with my gums swelling. Since my braces came off I still had problems with swollen gums. After using this toothpaste combined with the vitality spin toothbrush, I have noticed the swelling go away completely. My friends and family have, who did not know I was using this product, noticed my teeth had become whiter. I absolutely love this toothpaste to the point that I now brush my teeth three times a day. I feel so refreshed after using this product. I am surprised at the negative reviews because after years with other toothpaste products, this is the only product that left my mouth feeling fresh. No burning, no peeling.</li>
            <li> Such Great price. Item arrived very fast. Item arrived as described. Hard to find in stores. I loved it it!</li>
            <li> Better than the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; toothpastes I used in the past.  It does cost a bit more, but the benefit outweighs the cost difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing the price of this item is almost the same as target etc, but I have to say, I am never able to get the 5oz. at the stores. So great item to buy online</li>
            <li> Great price and can never have too much of it. A quality product that is even better in a double pack.</li>
            <li> Gingivitis is a B and then you die. Is that how the story goes? Not so fast my friend. Let Crest help you stand up to deadly victimize-r. Let&#x27;s get clinical.</li>
            <li> I love it and u should try it...Great deal and nice price. I will continue to use and buy this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s toothpaste. Isn&#x27;t all basically the same? Maybe. But I have found my mouth feeling fresher for longer with this stuff. Much better than the original &#x27;Pro Health&#x27; release.  Hoping it is actually that much better for my gums, but not going to let them oversell me too far.</li>
            <li> Gosh, I read so many negative reviews that I almost didn&#x27;t try this toothpaste for gingivitis.  Then, I thought, why not try it?  I have switched to a very soft toothbrush as recommended and only used for about a minute.  I&#x27;m also using a rinse prescribed by dentist.  So, I brushed last night, and gums seemed to feel better.  Brushed this morning, same thing.  I will continue using until I have a negative effect and  if it is helping me.  It is not the best tasting toothpaste in the world, but that is not why i bought it.  Also, so far, no slime, sores, etc. as written by some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just raised from 4 stars to 5 stars after using it longer.  My gums feel and look so much better.  I am so happy with this toothpaste.  I have not even been using the dentist prescribed rinse.</li>
            <li> Would recommend it.  Nice taste and better than the usual toothpaste you buy at the supermarket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I alternate it with a plaque reducing toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Beware, there is truth in the reviews that say an odd slime lasts in your mouth for hours. Is it dead cells? I dont know, but Im moving on to Tom&#x27;s. Plus the price is rising &amp; Crest plays games with all the tube sizes.</li>
            <li> Got a sample of this on my last visit to the dentist and loved it. Now it&#x27;s always on the bathroom vanity.</li>
