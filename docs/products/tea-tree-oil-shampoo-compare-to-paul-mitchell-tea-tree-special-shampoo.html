            <li>shampoo smells nice.</li>
            <li>This is really nice tea tree oil shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I knew how much I liked it.</li>
            <li>Spend the money and get the real stuff, which is awesome!</li>
            <li>It produces a nice, creamy lather and it&#x27;s done wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li>Great product at a super price.  </li>
            <li>but the mint like smell is kind of overwhelming.</li>
            <li>It has an invigorating scent and leaves your scalp clean and pleasantly tingling.  </li>
            <li>The tea tree provides a kind of refreshing feel on the scalp which I love.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>For the price I guess it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>Ive used it many times also, and love how manageable my hair is.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the freshness that I feel when I use it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this shampoo &amp; conditioner, just wish the scent was stronger.</li>
            <li>love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for.</li>
            <li>so glad that I was able to purchase from here.</li>
            <li>I will now save your site to purchase more.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and the conditioner as well.</li>
            <li>Glad I found it.  </li>
            <li>Smells more medicinal, dries my scalp instead of</li>
            <li>I will get fly-away static</li>
            <li>this did even better.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Today, I now use the brand name version of this product, and am glad that I do.  </li>
            <li>My hair now looks and feels healthy.  </li>
            <li>I personally love it because when I&#x27;m working out I sweat a lot on my neck and it gets into my hair and in order to get all of that sweat and grime off my scalp I have to use this product.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>my favorite shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Judging from the amount of &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; I feel when shampooing my hair, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have as much tea tree oil as the Paul Mitchell brand, but it does do the job and the price is great.</li>
            <li>; PM does; it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks and have decided to officially switch from my $25 a bottle shampoo to this way cheaper and way better option.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many tea tree oil shampoos and this tops them all.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent - it wasn&#x27;t overpowering at all</li>
            <li>I have used Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shampoo many times.</li>
            <li>The stuff smells good and on a hot day this stuff has a cooling effect that just feels unreal.</li>
            <li>And in my opinion, this is just as good as the higher priced name brand.</li>
            <li>my hair has never felt so clean, shiny, and manageable!</li>
            <li>Well it is definitely not Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo, but for the price I am very happy.</li>
            <li>This shampoo was recommended by our family beautician, and I must admit that she was right about its effectiveness to keep your hair clean and smelling good.  </li>
            <li>This had good reviews, so I bought it because of reasonable cost.  </li>
            <li>Just as good as the real stuff.</li>
            <li>Most of my irritation and itchiness has resolved in only one week, which is pretty impressive.</li>
            <li>Possibly better than the Paul Mitchell original</li>
            <li>This makes my hair feel more clean than its ever felt before.</li>
            <li>Very pleased and am totally getting more!</li>
            <li>To be honest, the smell had me worried at first, but it went away after I washed the conditioner out(same brand).</li>
            <li>And it all worked out fine.</li>
            <li>He has very oily hair, and this really does the job of cleaning his hair and making it look great.</li>
            <li>I wish you could get free shipping.</li>
            <li>However, it is a great product and I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>great value...a quality product at a low price</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this.</li>
            <li>I love how this shampoo smells and it makes me feel clean and fresh</li>
            <li>After using the shampoo, my hair was totally clean and free of grime.  </li>
            <li>Just like the original PM...</li>
            <li>Worth the money indeed!</li>
            <li>I tried this shampoo on a whim and it has helped significantly.</li>
            <li>Give it a try, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It leaves my head feeling tingly and clean, like Jack Frost&#x27;s a$$, but without the frostbite.</li>
            <li>After using this your hair feels fantastic and super clean.</li>
            <li>This removes the guarantee of a clean untainted product.  </li>
            <li>Great shampoo for dry scalp!</li>
            <li>The ingredients listed are the exact same as the Paul Mitchell brand, so it is a great buy.</li>
            <li>Generic Value Products Teatree Oil Shampoo and their tea tree conditioner are superior products.  </li>
            <li>I bought this generic because it was cheaper and had good reviews, but I now question whether the company has paid to have the reviews done.</li>
            <li>At first you&#x27;re going to notice a strong smell</li>
            <li>My hair is much softer and my scalp feels very clean.</li>
            <li>We are teachers &amp; in school, as well as have a school age son, so we really believe in &amp;#34;an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure&amp;#34;!!  </li>
            <li>I normally buy it on Sally&#x27;s site but shipping on here was better.</li>
            <li>I live in Calif. and have not been able to buy this product at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply for months.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You are worth every dime that you spend on yourself.  </li>
            <li>Amazon made it right tho.</li>
            <li>Smell is a bit strong but almost completely got rid of my psoriasis on my scalp.</li>
            <li>The moral of the story here is that we are all worth buying the authentic version of anything out there....</li>
            <li>Fast ship!  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s been using a bunch of different tea tree shampoos, and he says that it is his favorite.</li>
            <li>Exactly the same as what they use at Sport Clips! :)</li>
            <li>This generic shampoo as compared to Paul Mitchell&#x27;s tea tree shampoo is probably geared more towards people who have oily hair.  </li>
            <li>It is very well worth the money you spend.</li>
            <li>I have really enjoyed it and seen a lot of differences in my hair since starting to use it.</li>
            <li>I really dislike the smell!  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately not.</li>
            <li>GVP has just the right amount of tingle and a very generous amount of product for the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty strong, but my sense of smell is weak, so the stronger the better!</li>
            <li>After I washed my hair, it felt soft and clean.</li>
            <li>and it cuts through all the old hairspray and deposits to get my hair really clean.</li>
            <li>when using the two (shampoo/conditioner) together, it leaves my hair clean and soft.</li>
            <li>the Snowman come pop a squat on the top of my head if I really wanted to feel like a blizzard took a giant turd on my head.</li>
            <li>I love the product, and have used it for a long time.  </li>
            <li>It smells strong but, definitely doesn&#x27;t have the same minty fresh and clean feel of the name brand.  </li>
            <li>Same scent/aroma, same tingle, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>But the first time I&#x27;ve used it I litterally felt the buildup coming off my scalp and gave such a clean cooling feeling.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t work very well for me and leaves my scalp rather itchy.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is very over powering.</li>
            <li>Thanks A+ seller</li>
            <li>but I think I will stick to the real one</li>
            <li>My doctor even noticed it and prescribed an antifungal shampoo, which really didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li>The pump from my Paul Mitchell fit the generic bottle.</li>
            <li>off soothing it like the real stuff.</li>
            <li>and it did not hurt as much as before either.</li>
            <li>Mine also feels very voluminous.</li>
            <li>This sell this at Sallys Beauty Store but its much cheaper here.</li>
            <li>It does not have nearly as much Tea tree oil (if indeed any, maybe just smells the same) as the original</li>
            <li>The tingle and ability to really clean the oils and dandruff should be left to Paul Mitchell.</li>
            <li>The Paul mitchell version of this is very expensive and it being a recession and all, I try my best to bargain.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a more long lasting treatment.</li>
            <li>I have used both the real thing and this generic and they don&#x27;t really compare.</li>
            <li>so why not spend the extra bucks to get the real stuff to get the real results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a very sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>Even with a conditioner I can tell the difference in my hair using the original vs. this imitation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an ordinary guy who got the original as a gift in a small size and really liked it.</li>
            <li>There is such this as too much tingle, all you whiners proclaiming the merits of P-Mitch</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even put that much product in my hair but yet was always left with build up and flakes in my hair even when I would scrub for five minutes.</li>
            <li>All in all, I have bought cheaper shampoo that was not nearly as harsh on my hair.</li>
            <li>Will give an update on the products if they end up being complete duds.</li>
            <li>but I will pay for the real deal next time.</li>
            <li>Plus, my hair is so soft after a couple uses.  </li>
            <li>However, I can say that within 2 washes, the GVP shampoo completely cleared up my dandruff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same as the expensive product, but so much more affordable!!  </li>
            <li>Had my doubt&#x27;s about the products because they are generic and just about everything that I&#x27;ve tried in the past either did not help or just irritated my scalp even more.</li>
            <li>Other shampoos don&#x27;t clean like tea tree oil shampoo and won&#x27;t get the same effect.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel very full and thick.  </li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t even need an extra conditioner when I use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this shampoo on several different occasions, and I think that it really works well.  </li>
            <li>and I can barely tell a difference.</li>
            <li>However, I do not have much of a minty, tingly feeling when I use it as I expected.</li>
            <li>I was a little amazed because I&#x27;ve tried many other shampoos that promise to do the same thing, but if I missed even one night of washing, the dandruff would come back.</li>
            <li>But as of today, I&#x27;m happy with the products - and actually a tad bit shocked and in disbelief of how well they worked overnight.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too harsh but does the job and is a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I was surprised about how well it worked, but you definitely have to watch how long you keep it in your hair, because it tends to burn.</li>
            <li>One bottle lasts a long time as not much is needed to really lather the hair.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks and have decided to officially switch from my $25 a bottle shampoo to this way cheaper and way better option.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many tea tree oil shampoos and this tops them all.  </li>
            <li> I love the scent - it wasn&#x27;t overpowering at all</li>
            <li> I have used Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shampoo many times.</li>
            <li> The stuff smells good and on a hot day this stuff has a cooling effect that just feels unreal.</li>
            <li> And in my opinion, this is just as good as the higher priced name brand.</li>
            <li> my hair has never felt so clean, shiny, and manageable!</li>
            <li> Well it is definitely not Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo, but for the price I am very happy.</li>
            <li> This shampoo was recommended by our family beautician, and I must admit that she was right about its effectiveness to keep your hair clean and smelling good.  </li>
            <li> This had good reviews, so I bought it because of reasonable cost.  </li>
            <li> Just as good as the real stuff.</li>
            <li> Most of my irritation and itchiness has resolved in only one week, which is pretty impressive.</li>
            <li> Possibly better than the Paul Mitchell original</li>
            <li> This makes my hair feel more clean than its ever felt before.</li>
            <li> Very pleased and am totally getting more!</li>
            <li> To be honest, the smell had me worried at first, but it went away after I washed the conditioner out(same brand).</li>
            <li> And it all worked out fine.</li>
            <li> He has very oily hair, and this really does the job of cleaning his hair and making it look great.</li>
            <li> I wish you could get free shipping.</li>
            <li> However, it is a great product and I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> great value...a quality product at a low price</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this.</li>
            <li> I love how this shampoo smells and it makes me feel clean and fresh</li>
            <li> After using the shampoo, my hair was totally clean and free of grime.  </li>
            <li> Just like the original PM...</li>
            <li> Worth the money indeed!</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo on a whim and it has helped significantly.</li>
            <li> Give it a try, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It leaves my head feeling tingly and clean, like Jack Frost&#x27;s a$$, but without the frostbite.</li>
            <li> After using this your hair feels fantastic and super clean.</li>
            <li> This removes the guarantee of a clean untainted product.  </li>
            <li> Great shampoo for dry scalp!</li>
            <li> The ingredients listed are the exact same as the Paul Mitchell brand, so it is a great buy.</li>
            <li> Generic Value Products Teatree Oil Shampoo and their tea tree conditioner are superior products.  </li>
            <li> I bought this generic because it was cheaper and had good reviews, but I now question whether the company has paid to have the reviews done.</li>
            <li> At first you&#x27;re going to notice a strong smell</li>
            <li> My hair is much softer and my scalp feels very clean.</li>
            <li> We are teachers &amp; in school, as well as have a school age son, so we really believe in &amp;#34;an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure&amp;#34;!!  </li>
            <li> I normally buy it on Sally&#x27;s site but shipping on here was better.</li>
            <li> I live in Calif. and have not been able to buy this product at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply for months.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You are worth every dime that you spend on yourself.  </li>
            <li> Amazon made it right tho.</li>
            <li> Smell is a bit strong but almost completely got rid of my psoriasis on my scalp.</li>
            <li> The moral of the story here is that we are all worth buying the authentic version of anything out there....</li>
            <li> Fast ship!  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been using a bunch of different tea tree shampoos, and he says that it is his favorite.</li>
            <li> Exactly the same as what they use at Sport Clips! :)</li>
            <li> This generic shampoo as compared to Paul Mitchell&#x27;s tea tree shampoo is probably geared more towards people who have oily hair.  </li>
            <li> It is very well worth the money you spend.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed it and seen a lot of differences in my hair since starting to use it.</li>
            <li> I really dislike the smell!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately not.</li>
            <li> GVP has just the right amount of tingle and a very generous amount of product for the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty strong, but my sense of smell is weak, so the stronger the better!</li>
            <li> After I washed my hair, it felt soft and clean.</li>
            <li> and it cuts through all the old hairspray and deposits to get my hair really clean.</li>
            <li> when using the two (shampoo/conditioner) together, it leaves my hair clean and soft.</li>
            <li> the Snowman come pop a squat on the top of my head if I really wanted to feel like a blizzard took a giant turd on my head.</li>
            <li> I love the product, and have used it for a long time.  </li>
            <li> It smells strong but, definitely doesn&#x27;t have the same minty fresh and clean feel of the name brand.  </li>
            <li> Same scent/aroma, same tingle, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> But the first time I&#x27;ve used it I litterally felt the buildup coming off my scalp and gave such a clean cooling feeling.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work very well for me and leaves my scalp rather itchy.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is very over powering.</li>
            <li> Thanks A+ seller</li>
            <li> but I think I will stick to the real one</li>
            <li> My doctor even noticed it and prescribed an antifungal shampoo, which really didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li> The pump from my Paul Mitchell fit the generic bottle.</li>
            <li> off soothing it like the real stuff.</li>
            <li> and it did not hurt as much as before either.</li>
            <li> Mine also feels very voluminous.</li>
            <li> This sell this at Sallys Beauty Store but its much cheaper here.</li>
            <li> It does not have nearly as much Tea tree oil (if indeed any, maybe just smells the same) as the original</li>
            <li> The tingle and ability to really clean the oils and dandruff should be left to Paul Mitchell.</li>
            <li> The Paul mitchell version of this is very expensive and it being a recession and all, I try my best to bargain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a more long lasting treatment.</li>
            <li> I have used both the real thing and this generic and they don&#x27;t really compare.</li>
            <li> so why not spend the extra bucks to get the real stuff to get the real results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a very sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> Even with a conditioner I can tell the difference in my hair using the original vs. this imitation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an ordinary guy who got the original as a gift in a small size and really liked it.</li>
            <li> There is such this as too much tingle, all you whiners proclaiming the merits of P-Mitch</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even put that much product in my hair but yet was always left with build up and flakes in my hair even when I would scrub for five minutes.</li>
            <li> All in all, I have bought cheaper shampoo that was not nearly as harsh on my hair.</li>
            <li> Will give an update on the products if they end up being complete duds.</li>
            <li> but I will pay for the real deal next time.</li>
            <li> Plus, my hair is so soft after a couple uses.  </li>
            <li> However, I can say that within 2 washes, the GVP shampoo completely cleared up my dandruff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same as the expensive product, but so much more affordable!!  </li>
            <li> Had my doubt&#x27;s about the products because they are generic and just about everything that I&#x27;ve tried in the past either did not help or just irritated my scalp even more.</li>
            <li> Other shampoos don&#x27;t clean like tea tree oil shampoo and won&#x27;t get the same effect.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel very full and thick.  </li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t even need an extra conditioner when I use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo on several different occasions, and I think that it really works well.  </li>
            <li> and I can barely tell a difference.</li>
            <li> However, I do not have much of a minty, tingly feeling when I use it as I expected.</li>
            <li> I was a little amazed because I&#x27;ve tried many other shampoos that promise to do the same thing, but if I missed even one night of washing, the dandruff would come back.</li>
            <li> But as of today, I&#x27;m happy with the products - and actually a tad bit shocked and in disbelief of how well they worked overnight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too harsh but does the job and is a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I was surprised about how well it worked, but you definitely have to watch how long you keep it in your hair, because it tends to burn.</li>
            <li> One bottle lasts a long time as not much is needed to really lather the hair.  </li>
            <li> Seeing my friend have great results with her super expensive horse version of this, I decided to go with the less expensive option and get this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product, but like other 1-star reviews this product was not useful at all for my son.  </li>
            <li> Does not work that well either, leaving your hair feeling oily and flat.</li>
            <li> I actually look forward to washing my long hair now.</li>
            <li> It really left my hair dry - even after I used conditioner.  </li>
            <li> My scalp was healthier, but my hair was a COMPLETE mess.</li>
            <li> The smell stays in your hair for too long too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be purchasing this again once the current bottle nears empty.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and use it a everyday, my last bottle lasted me 6 months.</li>
            <li> Previously, I had a very red, irritated, itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> It became extremely brittle, puffy and horribly dry.  </li>
            <li> Worse, the shampoo is much, much, much harsher on the hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is not even remotely close to the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Oil shampoo.</li>
            <li> I tried a few other products and didn&#x27;t get the results I wanted and had to go back to this product.</li>
            <li> The generic is not a problem at all, it is less expensive and to me, it works just the same as the more expensive brand name.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the tingle on my scalp with this shampoo like I did with other tea tree ones, but in my opinion thats a bonus</li>
            <li> About a month after I tried this product, I ended up was extremely damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed that I didn&#x27;t get any scalp tingle, but it works and that&#x27;s what matters the most.</li>
            <li> Now the cleaning part: Is it just me or does your hair and scalp feel super cold when using this item in the shower?</li>
            <li> Whereas I can use the original and use a conditioner every other day, even every third day; when I use this, I must use a conditioner every day or my hair comes out is very bad and dry shape.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how you could tell it gets down to the scalp and peels away dirt, oil, hairspray residue, etc.</li>
            <li> One day I was crawling around under my car cleaning the grease off of my car, and my hair became covered in a rocky, greasy mess.  </li>
            <li> (in fact, I wish it were a little stronger).</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t  get  past the smell...</li>
            <li> not sure if it&#x27;s helping or not</li>
            <li> The price is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually give raving reviews after trying a product overnight.  </li>
            <li> Also, the shampoo is a bit expensive but it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> Not good.....</li>
            <li> You read that right, I have a mare who gets horrible scratches and fungus in the summer, and nothing was working.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really not that bad and</li>
            <li> I always use this shampoo, I am addicted to it.</li>
            <li> My son used it for months and is all broken out.  </li>
            <li> The place where I get my hair cut uses the expensive Paul Mitchel stuff.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical on buying pricer shampoo/conditioner bc</li>
            <li> Needless to say, it did!</li>
            <li> Had three painful sores/pimples on my head yesterday</li>
            <li> Definitely shocked.</li>
            <li> We were disappointed when our beauty supply place stopped sellingI this product.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It makes my hair feel very full and thick.  It has a great scent and leaves my hair manageable .</li>
            <li> This had good reviews, so I bought it because of reasonable cost.  This doesn&#x27;t work very well for me and leaves my scalp rather itchy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is not 100% identical to the Paul Mitchell version it claims to be, but it is definitely close enough for me.  I&#x27;ll definitely be getting it again!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is very over powering. The smell stays in your hair for too long too. It smells like you opened a medicine shop. Does not work that well either, leaving your hair feeling oily and flat. Not to mention when it came in the box, the person who boxed it cut a hole in the bottle and it was leaking all over.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo!  Just like the original PM...</li>
            <li> Generic Value Products Teatree Oil Shampoo and their tea tree conditioner are superior products.  We have been using this brand successfully for years, and have had great results.</li>
            <li> Works great as good as the original.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!!!!  It&#x27;s the same as the expensive product, but so much more affordable!!  Fast ship!  Thanks A+ seller</li>
            <li> I went from Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shampoo to this and I can barely tell a difference. Same scent/aroma, same tingle, I&#x27;m very pleased. I&#x27;ll be purchasing this again once the current bottle nears empty. I&#x27;m definitely pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, and he loves it. He&#x27;s been using a bunch of different tea tree shampoos, and he says that it is his favorite. It&#x27;s a great price and we&#x27;ll be buying more soon!</li>
            <li> You read that right, I have a mare who gets horrible scratches and fungus in the summer, and nothing was working. Seeing my friend have great results with her super expensive horse version of this, I decided to go with the less expensive option and get this shampoo. The fungus on her legs, and the rain rot on her flanks were gone by the next day, and the scratches are almost healed one week of getting her legs scrubbed with this shampoo daily. A cost effective solution for equestrians! Very pleased and am totally getting more!</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> I am a eepeat buyer that is about the best endorsement one can give</li>
            <li> There is such this as too much tingle, all you whiners proclaiming the merits of P-Mitch products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would just have Frosty the Snowman come pop a squat on the top of my head if I really wanted to feel like a blizzard took a giant turd on my head. GVP has just the right amount of tingle and a very generous amount of product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my head feeling tingly and clean, like Jack Frost&#x27;s a$$, but without the frostbite.</li>
            <li> I have used both the real thing and this generic and they don&#x27;t really compare. The tingle and ability to really clean the oils and dandruff should be left to Paul Mitchell. For the price I guess it&#x27;s ok but I think I will stick to the real one</li>
            <li> The place where I get my hair cut uses the expensive Paul Mitchel stuff. I found this one day at Sally&#x27;s and have been hooked on it ever since. The stuff smells good and on a hot day this stuff has a cooling effect that just feels unreal.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.  The tea tree provides a kind of refreshing feel on the scalp which I love.  One bottle lasts a long time as not much is needed to really lather the hair.  The generic is not a problem at all, it is less expensive and to me, it works just the same as the more expensive brand name.</li>
            <li> My husband has always liked tea tree shampoos. And in my opinion, this is just as good as the higher priced name brand. He has very oily hair, and this really does the job of cleaning his hair and making it look great. Makes his hair feel wonderful too. Helps with dandruff also.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo smells nice. Ive used it many times also, and love how manageable my hair is. I normally don&#x27;t even need an extra conditioner when I use it. I don&#x27;t get the tingle on my scalp with this shampoo like I did with other tea tree ones, but in my opinion thats a bonus</li>
            <li> I always use this shampoo, I am addicted to it. I love the smell and the freshness that I feel when I use it. I normally buy it on Sally&#x27;s site but shipping on here was better. I would recommend this shampoo to anyone! Also, the shampoo is a bit expensive but it lasts a long time! I have long hair and use it a everyday, my last bottle lasted me 6 months. Worth the money indeed!</li>
            <li> Exactly the same as what they use at Sport Clips! :)</li>
            <li> This is really nice tea tree oil shampoo.  We were informed years ago that lice doesn&#x27;t like tea tree oil and if you use it, lice is prevented.  We are teachers &amp; in school, as well as have a school age son, so we really believe in &amp;#34;an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure&amp;#34;!!  It&#x27;s been protecting us to this point and we will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> This generic shampoo as compared to Paul Mitchell&#x27;s tea tree shampoo is probably geared more towards people who have oily hair.  It really left my hair dry - even after I used conditioner.  It doesn&#x27;t smell as good either.  On the plus  side, it has great lather!</li>
            <li> This makes my hair feel more clean than its ever felt before. I don&#x27;t even put that much product in my hair but yet was always left with build up and flakes in my hair even when I would scrub for five minutes. But the first time I&#x27;ve used it I litterally felt the buildup coming off my scalp and gave such a clean cooling feeling. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 1-2 months now and just decided to go with the bigger bottle bc I knew how much I liked it. I was skeptical on buying pricer shampoo/conditioner bc I didn&#x27;t think I would notice a difference but I definetly did</li>
            <li> I have dandruff and it took three shampoos before I began to see the desired outcome.</li>
            <li> We were disappointed when our beauty supply place stopped sellingI this product.  So tried another that they had which wasn&#x27;t as good as this product.  Then I found it on Amazon and ordered it.  Now I have a happy husband as this is his favorite shampoo in the morning.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo &amp; conditioner, just wish the scent was stronger. It&#x27;s pretty strong, but my sense of smell is weak, so the stronger the better!</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I could recommend.&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Even the packaging is great. I wish you could get free shipping. It is very well worth the money you spend.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t  get  past the smell...Had to get rid of it..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an ordinary guy who got the original as a gift in a small size and really liked it. I bought this generic because it was cheaper and had good reviews, but I now question whether the company has paid to have the reviews done. It smells quite similar, and its also green shampoo, but the comparison really ends there. It does not have nearly as much Tea tree oil (if indeed any, maybe just smells the same) as the original so it does not produce the same level of tingle. Worse, the shampoo is much, much, much harsher on the hair. Whereas I can use the original and use a conditioner every other day, even every third day; when I use this, I must use a conditioner every day or my hair comes out is very bad and dry shape. Even with a conditioner I can tell the difference in my hair using the original vs. this imitation. All in all, I have bought cheaper shampoo that was not nearly as harsh on my hair. I may have to turn this stuff into body wash.</li>
            <li> I need this stuff because I am thinning... not sure if it&#x27;s helping or not but it is a great price! And speedy delivery</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo on several different occasions, and I think that it really works well.  One day I was crawling around under my car cleaning the grease off of my car, and my hair became covered in a rocky, greasy mess.  After using the shampoo, my hair was totally clean and free of grime.  I was surprised about how well it worked, but you definitely have to watch how long you keep it in your hair, because it tends to burn. You know it&#x27;s working then.</li>
            <li> This is the stuff, people. Makes showering a spicy minty tingly joy.</li>
            <li> I started using the shampoo one week ago. I have really enjoyed it and seen a lot of differences in my hair since starting to use it. Previously, I had a very red, irritated, itchy scalp. My doctor even noticed it and prescribed an antifungal shampoo, which really didn&#x27;t help much. I tried this shampoo on a whim and it has helped significantly. Most of my irritation and itchiness has resolved in only one week, which is pretty impressive. My hair is much softer and my scalp feels very clean. I will definitely continue to purchase this item.</li>
            <li> Possibly better than the Paul Mitchell original</li>
            <li> I got what I wanted at the time they said I&#x27;d get it. What more could you ask for. This product is no longer sold in Ca. I tried a few other products and didn&#x27;t get the results I wanted and had to go back to this product. The only way I could get it was on line. And it all worked out fine.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for dry scalp!</li>
            <li> I used to buy this product from Sallys but they are no longer stocking it and I couldn&#x27;t find it.  so glad that I was able to purchase from here. I will now save your site to purchase more.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and the conditioner as well. It tingles and feels great. After I washed my hair, it felt soft and clean. The ingredients listed are the exact same as the Paul Mitchell brand, so it is a great buy. The price is unbelievable. I would have given it a 5 but the mint like smell is kind of overwhelming. However, it is a great product and I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I live in Calif. and have not been able to buy this product at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply for months.&lt;br /&gt;I was delighted to find it via Amazon.  Have used this product for years and will continue&lt;br /&gt;to do so.</li>
            <li> Good stuff and ferret likes it</li>
            <li> Great product at a super price.  Glad I found it.  The pump from my Paul Mitchell fit the generic bottle.</li>
            <li> This stuff is not even remotely close to the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Oil shampoo. Diffent consistency, different smell..... Different results. Smells more medicinal, dries my scalp instead of off soothing it like the real stuff. Not good..... Spend the money and get the real stuff, which is awesome!</li>
            <li> great value...a quality product at a low price</li>
            <li> Well it is definitely not Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo, but for the price I am very happy.</li>
            <li> I love how this shampoo smells and it makes me feel clean and fresh and it cuts through all the old hairspray and deposits to get my hair really clean. I do need to use a cream rinse after shampooing or else I will get fly-away static but that&#x27;s probably because of my unsoftened well water.</li>
            <li> Excellent product as advertised.</li>
            <li> I had problem with scalp acme and started using this product and it disappeared.</li>
            <li> Had psoriasis my entire life. A house guest forgot this in my shower and told me to use the rest....I loved it! Instead of spending 20 bucks on a 5 oz of medicated shampoo from the Dr. this did even better. Smell is a bit strong but almost completely got rid of my psoriasis on my scalp.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo. It cleans my hair, has the added benefit of dandruff control, and is a good value.</li>
            <li> I really dislike the smell!  Also I looked it up on the ewg.org site and found it had a score of 5/10(moderate hazard).  It has cocamide DEA in it.</li>
            <li> because I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about 15 years and it leaves my hair something manageable that&#x27;s why I like it</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this. However, I do not have much of a minty, tingly feeling when I use it as I expected. I also dislike the fact that this contains sulfate, which damages hair follicles. Will not be buying this again based on that fact alone. If you do not mind the sulfate, then it is definitely a good buy for the price.</li>
            <li> GVP Tea Tree Oil Shampoo smells like and feels like Paul Mitchell Shampoo and comes in a great size bottle!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. It&#x27;s not too harsh but does the job and is a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the real stuff.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product, but like other 1-star reviews this product was not useful at all for my son.  We&#x27;ve used Tea Tree oil before and it works, so I assumed this product would too.  Unfortunately not.</li>
            <li> Hi: I just bought the shampoo and conditioner from Sally Beauty yesterday. I&#x27;ve got a very sensitive scalp. Had three painful sores/pimples on my head yesterday ( been there for a while). Had my doubt&#x27;s about the products because they are generic and just about everything that I&#x27;ve tried in the past either did not help or just irritated my scalp even more. Well, to my shock after only using them once last night, I woke up with only one sore/pimple on my head this morning ( the largest of the three that&#x27;s also lingered on my scalp the longest) and it did not hurt as much as before either. Definitely shocked. Will give an update on the products if they end up being complete duds. But as of today, I&#x27;m happy with the products - and actually a tad bit shocked and in disbelief of how well they worked overnight. I don&#x27;t usually give raving reviews after trying a product overnight.  Hi.  I just wanted to update my review.  About a month after I tried this product, I ended up was extremely damaged hair.  My scalp was healthier, but my hair was a COMPLETE mess. It became extremely brittle, puffy and horribly dry.  Today, I now use the brand name version of this product, and am glad that I do.  My hair now looks and feels healthy.  It also no longer breaks.  I actually had a client mention to me that my hair has grown and asked me if I was wearing extensions.  The moral of the story here is that we are all worth buying the authentic version of anything out there....so why not spend the extra bucks to get the real stuff to get the real results.  You are worth every dime that you spend on yourself.  Good luck.</li>
            <li> The Paul mitchell version of this is very expensive and it being a recession and all, I try my best to bargain. At first you&#x27;re going to notice a strong smell but it&#x27;s really not that bad and after a while you start to like it. Now the cleaning part: Is it just me or does your hair and scalp feel super cold when using this item in the shower? That&#x27;s how you could tell it gets down to the scalp and peels away dirt, oil, hairspray residue, etc. After using this your hair feels fantastic and super clean. Mine also feels very voluminous. Other shampoos don&#x27;t clean like tea tree oil shampoo and won&#x27;t get the same effect. I personally love it because when I&#x27;m working out I sweat a lot on my neck and it gets into my hair and in order to get all of that sweat and grime off my scalp I have to use this product. This sell this at Sallys Beauty Store but its much cheaper here.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Smells great, feels great, hair looks great.  All over it.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for.  This doesn&#x27;t compare to Paul Mitchell&#x27;s brand. It smells strong but, definitely doesn&#x27;t have the same minty fresh and clean feel of the name brand.  And same goes for the bar soap for those thinking about trying it as well. It gets 1 star because I have to.</li>
            <li> my favorite shampoo.  In the winter I get psoraisis on my scalp and this clears it up.</li>
            <li> Judging from the amount of &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; I feel when shampooing my hair, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have as much tea tree oil as the Paul Mitchell brand, but it does do the job and the price is great.</li>
            <li> If you have no Wheat?Gluten issues it would be great...but...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This contains Wheat Germ Oil..  I didn&#x27;t know and bought it anyway.  There is a bar code sticker covering part of the ingredients, where the Wheat Germ was listed.  My son used it for months and is all broken out.  Amazon made it right tho.</li>
            <li> Does not give you the &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; PM does; it&#x27;s okay. but I will pay for the real deal next time.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend hoping it would help with his dandruff. Needless to say, it did! I ran out of shampoo so I used some of his, and was very impressed! my hair has never felt so clean, shiny, and manageable! To be honest, the smell had me worried at first, but it went away after I washed the conditioner out(same brand). Read over the ingredients list and noticed it has algae in it (really good for your hair!)! I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks and have decided to officially switch from my $25 a bottle shampoo to this way cheaper and way better option. Give it a try, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I love the product, and have used it for a long time.  It is rated lower this time because, This time it was not sealed.  This removes the guarantee of a clean untainted product.  They obviously had knowledge of this because a piece of scotch tape was placed over the cap in place of the seal.  (Amazon...please don&#x27;t tell me this is not a proper review because it isn&#x27;t about the product.  it is about the product...purity, product integrity, proper product handeling, and product Safety).</li>
            <li> This shampoo was recommended by our family beautician, and I must admit that she was right about its effectiveness to keep your hair clean and smelling good.  I have purchased this shampoo twice already, and I am considering buying it again once my current product runs out.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  I&#x27;ve tried so many tea tree oil shampoos and this tops them all.  It has an invigorating scent and leaves your scalp clean and pleasantly tingling.  Plus, my hair is so soft after a couple uses.  I actually look forward to washing my long hair now.</li>
            <li> great stuff . helps with my skin condition</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used the actual Paul Mitchell version of this shampoo, so I can&#x27;t compare the two. However, I can say that within 2 washes, the GVP shampoo completely cleared up my dandruff. It produces a nice, creamy lather and it&#x27;s done wonders for my hair. I was a little amazed because I&#x27;ve tried many other shampoos that promise to do the same thing, but if I missed even one night of washing, the dandruff would come back. That&#x27;s not a problem with this one. It&#x27;s a more long lasting treatment. I love the scent - it wasn&#x27;t overpowering at all (in fact, I wish it were a little stronger). I was disappointed that I didn&#x27;t get any scalp tingle, but it works and that&#x27;s what matters the most. Great value size for the price, too. I finally found a shampoo I can stick with.</li>
            <li> I have used Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shampoo many times. In fact, I have a bottle now. I used this GVP shampoo at my mother-in-law&#x27;s house along with the conditioner.  I was blown away!! It isn&#x27;t as minty as PM&#x27;s Tea Tree Shampoo but it is very similar otherwise and when using the two (shampoo/conditioner) together, it leaves my hair clean and soft. So of course I ran to Amazon to order the biggest bottles I could find!! Love this stuff!!</li>
