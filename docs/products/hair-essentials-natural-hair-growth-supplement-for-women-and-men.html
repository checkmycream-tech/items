            <li>Will revisit this review in 3 months for long-term benefits, but very happy so far.</li>
            <li>Hair Essentials is a wonderful natural product.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair strong and healthy looking-&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Wasnt sure about this product but the guarantee clinched it.</li>
            <li>I thought for sure that I would be bald in no time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had so many friends notice the difference in the length and thickness of my hair</li>
            <li>It took months before I could see results, but the results are astonishing.</li>
            <li>Tried Biotin but this works better for me.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love it,  </li>
            <li>The longer you stick with it, the better the results seem to be.</li>
            <li>so it would be easily noticible if it was getting thicker.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like using strong chemicals as I was on chemo for 1 year which made all my hair fall out.  </li>
            <li>So I ordered 3 more bottles, like they recommend, to give myself the full three months to see an improvement.  </li>
            <li>I think it will work fine for maintenance.</li>
            <li>I was in hope that I would see a change quickly like so many people reported, but I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>My brush had been filled with hair and then that stopped.</li>
            <li>I took this several months ago, it was great then.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are many out there, but come on, with so many people having this same problem</li>
            <li>It is far too earl to tell if they will be effective.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a quick fix, this is not for you.</li>
            <li>and I was unsure if they were selling the real item or something different, but its the true product and this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Whatever works, right?</li>
            <li>My hair has always grown very fast</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended something with higher levels of biotin.</li>
            <li>Have been using this for a month now and can definitely tell a difference in nail strength---no more splitting, peeling or breaking.  </li>
            <li>The shedding is what stops first then, some thickening and then length.</li>
            <li>and I am a bit skeptical about the glowing reports, but if it did, great!  </li>
            <li>I would rate it Higher if there were a higher scale..</li>
            <li>I will continue to take it consistently until all 3 bottles are gone.</li>
            <li>My hair is noticeably thicker, especially at the top of my head and front hairline.  </li>
            <li>It really stopped my hair from thinning and pray that that it is a permanent thing!</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more in future</li>
            <li>OK, last year I did the 90 days of this and had all kinds of new hair growing where before it was falling out.</li>
            <li>Even my hair stylist commented on how much healthier my hair is now looking.  </li>
            <li>It really does work.  </li>
            <li>I did not think it would really work</li>
            <li>Fast shipping-</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I am planning to try for a year to see if it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>Will update again in a few weeks... with some positive review... hopefully :)</li>
            <li>It should be obvious to everyone that if you wait to do the full 3 month course you will be over the 90 day return time frame, so I don&#x27;t expect any refund..........</li>
            <li>It has slowed down so much the losing of my hair and have lots more new growth.</li>
            <li>I had more new little hairs come in and was very noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product but don&#x27;t look for results overnight....</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I am not sure how many bottles I have to go through before I see something positive.</li>
            <li>, I have a thyroid problem and yes, it it managed very well with natural hormone replacement</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for two years and this company is a new vendor for me</li>
            <li>so I have about an inch of new growth that shows no difference from what is already there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In one month if taken as directed I could see new grown appear.  </li>
            <li>I havent noticed any new growth so far</li>
            <li>I am 27 years old female who is losing so much hair for no reason at all since one year (all blood tests done) ...</li>
            <li>I am a 51-year old, menopausal woman.</li>
            <li>This is my second three bottles, I&#x27;m not loosing much hair!&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>Each time I start losing my hair, whether it be a  stress factor, or just natural causes, this product has always made a believer out of me.  </li>
            <li>I was taking them for about 3 or 4 months before I noticed a real difference, and now, probably 8 months later, I have tons of hair growth.</li>
            <li>My hairstylist commented on it last time I was there that I had a lot of growth coming in all over my scalp, and I can really see it now.</li>
            <li>, I am not aware of any rare diseases that I should be tested for.  </li>
            <li>I use both different brands, all I know is that if you stick to it new hair growth continues.</li>
            <li>make hair strong and thick.</li>
            <li>After 2 months.. no more significant hair loss.</li>
            <li>I had such beautiful thick hair and it had gotten so thin</li>
            <li>After a couple months, I noticed new hairs growing back where with other hair, skin and nails vitamins I did not.  </li>

            <li> Not only was it falling out after showers, but all day long.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and middle 40&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I waited to wright a review once I took them all to be fair :(</li>
            <li> do see new hair growth, takes a few months, and some of my hair is growing in dark brown among a field of white!</li>
            <li> Just be patient, take the tablets and don&#x27;t watch the paint dry.</li>
            <li> There is no new hairs sprouting up.  </li>
            <li> see new hair coming, I will definetly keep taking at least another set of three,</li>
            <li> I started taking it again - religiously - one month ago and notice little to no improvement.</li>
            <li> I would have expected some favorable results by now.  </li>
            <li> I have been taking this since 20 days, no positive effect till now.</li>
            <li> Now, my hair had gotten so thin that I can very clearly see each hair shaft that comes out of my skin.  </li>
            <li> , I do not use harsh shampoos, conditiners or any other hair treatments.&lt;br</li>
            <li> just like other hair products that make promises, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> prompt delivery, stops hair fall, but not significant hair regrowth</li>
            <li> My nails seem to be a little longer/stronger, but I bought it for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I was a little worried about losing hair for age but not anymore.</li>
            <li> I was literally crying after every shower.</li>
            <li> I noticed a change within a few weeks of trying it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product, but you do have to stick with it for a few months before seeing results- a friend tried these and gave up after a month or two and didn&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li> I noticed after starting grad school that my hair was shedding like crazy and was really dry.</li>
            <li> I dont usually write reviews, but I have to share this with everyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken this product in the past and thought I noticed improvement within a shorter period of time.</li>
            <li> Warning: &amp;#34;other areas&amp;#34; also showed restored hair growth  : /  </li>
            <li> I usually buy in quantities of 3 and save some.  </li>
            <li> I am taking it again, for I stopped for a while, got lazy.  </li>
            <li> but it does or at least for me.</li>
            <li> Seriously waiting for a miracle.</li>
            <li> but lately I started losing hair and didn&#x27;t want it to get any worse.  </li>
            <li> but I figure I save money now by not having to buy other type products and be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I know it can become expensive</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Wasnt sure about this product but the guarantee clinched it. I am a 51-year old, menopausal woman. My hairloss was feaking me out. I was literally crying after every shower. Not only was it falling out after showers, but all day long. I thought for sure that I would be bald in no time. I dont usually write reviews, but I have to share this with everyone. This stuff works. It does for me anyway. It takes some time, about amonth before it slows. After 2 months.. no more significant hair loss. I stopped taking it and after about 3 weeks my hair started falling out again. I guess i will be on this for the duration. Oh well. Whatever works, right?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this product for approx 18 months and I believe in it. I started taking it at age 59 when my hair started thinning and shedding . I&#x27;ve had so many friends notice the difference in the length and thickness of my hair and I happily recommend this product to them. However: Now that the price have increased so dramatically increased from 99.99 to 160.00 for 3 bottles, they have priced themselves out of my ability to pay. Very good product, but not for the money they ask for it now.</li>
            <li> it did not work on my hair.</li>
            <li> I think it will work fine for maintenance. My dermatologist recommended something with higher levels of biotin. When my situation even out I&#x27;m going to take it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I use both different brands, all I know is that if you stick to it new hair growth continues. I take from 2 to 3 capsules a day.&lt;br /&gt;I do see new hair growth, takes a few months, and some of my hair is growing in dark brown among a field of white! Be patient.</li>
            <li> OK, last year I did the 90 days of this and had all kinds of new hair growing where before it was falling out. My brush had been filled with hair and then that stopped. I got all caught up in buying a house and decided to not worry about this until later. I started noticing my hair falling out again and my brush clogging with hair about two months after I stopped the Hair Essentials. So I&#x27;m back to it. It seems to work!</li>
            <li> It has helped me a lot.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for a month now and can definitely tell a difference in nail strength---no more splitting, peeling or breaking.  My thinning hair seems to be getting thicker and stronger too.  Will revisit this review in 3 months for long-term benefits, but very happy so far.</li>
            <li> I received this product in a timely fashion. I was impressed. I&#x27;ve been using this product for two years and this company is a new vendor for me and I was unsure if they were selling the real item or something different, but its the true product and this product is amazing. It took months before I could see results, but the results are astonishing. Just be patient, take the tablets and don&#x27;t watch the paint dry. Its not a sprint its a maraothon.The shedding is what stops first then, some thickening and then length.</li>
            <li> This is my second three bottles, I&#x27;m not loosing much hair!&lt;br /&gt;And see new hair coming, I will definetly keep taking at least another set of three,</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle to try and took the pills faithfully every day.  I was in hope that I would see a change quickly like so many people reported, but I didn&#x27;t.  I know, wishfull thinking on my part.  So I ordered 3 more bottles, like they recommend, to give myself the full three months to see an improvement.  I took them religiously.............Nothing.  Now, my hair had gotten so thin that I can very clearly see each hair shaft that comes out of my skin.  There is no new hairs sprouting up.  The hair that I do have is in no way thicker.  I keep my hair very short so it would be easily noticible if it was getting thicker.  It&#x27;s not.  My hair has always grown very fast so I have about an inch of new growth that shows no difference from what is already there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I know everyone will try to diagnose me, so I will answer all the questions up front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I have a thyroid problem and yes, it it managed very well with natural hormone replacement therapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I take additional vitamin and mineral supplements and have had my blood work checked recently and everything is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I watch what I eat and treat myself for yeast overgrowth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, I do not use harsh shampoos, conditiners or any other hair treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, I am not aware of any rare diseases that I should be tested for.  I&#x27;m sure there are many out there, but come on, with so many people having this same problem, I doubt that is the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it has been over the 90 day money back time frame since I ordered the 3 bottle combination.  It should be obvious to everyone that if you wait to do the full 3 month course you will be over the 90 day return time frame, so I don&#x27;t expect any refund..........even if I do get the obligatory response from customer service telling me to call them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you that it worked for and I am a bit skeptical about the glowing reports, but if it did, great!  I just didn&#x27;t do anything for me except make me over a $100 poorer.</li>
            <li> I received the supplement and I am taking them as directed.  There are no side effects and otherwise no indication of any reaction.  It is far too earl to tell if they will be effective.  I will review the product again in three months.</li>
            <li> Since starting Hair Essentials, my hair has grown longer and thicker in just a matter of months.  Even my hair stylist commented on how much healthier my hair is now looking.  I highly recommend this product but don&#x27;t look for results overnight....give it time and be patient.  You&#x27;re in for a treat!</li>
            <li> This stuff works. My thinning areas are coming back. Tried Biotin but this works better for me.</li>
            <li> been using product for approx. 4 months. I havent noticed any new growth so far but it does seem to be slowing hair loss.I will continue to use and hope for the best.</li>
            <li> I started taking this product back in Nov 2013 to present, but I also take it with the vitamin Biotin. It has slowed down so much the losing of my hair and have lots more new growth. When before it was just losing hair and almost see the scalp on the front, now even my husband can see the difference.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It has made my hair start to re-grow and has given my hair added strength.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The results of the use of Hair Essentials,  excellent.  I would rate it Higher if there were a higher scale..</li>
            <li> prompt delivery, stops hair fall, but not significant hair regrowth</li>
            <li> Hair is still thinning, and I am on the third bottle.  I would have expected some favorable results by now.  I am not sure how many bottles I have to go through before I see something positive.</li>
            <li> it works like a charm...what a great product!!!  I tend to lose hair over stress and this is the second time that I purchase this product.  The immediate growth of my hair is visible.  I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken this product in the past and thought I noticed improvement within a shorter period of time. I started taking it again - religiously - one month ago and notice little to no improvement. My nails seem to be a little longer/stronger, but I bought it for my hair.  I will continue to take it consistently until all 3 bottles are gone. I may upgrade my review at that time.</li>
            <li> No difference in my hair, and I was trying this stuff religiously for close to 200 days before giving up. Good luck if you try this out as well.</li>
            <li> I am nearing 70.  (Coloring our hair never helps?) These work.  My hair is noticeably thicker, especially at the top of my head and front hairline.  Warning: &amp;#34;other areas&amp;#34; also showed restored hair growth  : /  lal</li>
            <li> Hair Essentials is a wonderful natural product. I love it,  just give it a try!!</li>
            <li> It really stopped my hair from thinning and pray that that it is a permanent thing! Wish it worked for male pattern baldness! I had such beautiful thick hair and it had gotten so thin it was embarassing! What a difference 6 weeks of taking this product has made!</li>
            <li> just like other hair products that make promises, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Each time I start losing my hair, whether it be a  stress factor, or just natural causes, this product has always made a believer out of me.  In one month if taken as directed I could see new grown appear.  I took pictures before and yes there is a difference now.  I have tried several hair and nails vitamins and prenatal, bought some from well known TV shows and nothing made a difference.  I don&#x27;t like using strong chemicals as I was on chemo for 1 year which made all my hair fall out.  It grew back in but lately I started losing hair and didn&#x27;t want it to get any worse.  Hair Essentials worked for me.  The only thing is you should probably keep taking it.  I know it can become expensive but I figure I save money now by not having to buy other type products and be disappointed.  I usually buy in quantities of 3 and save some.  I would recommend this to anyone facing this problem.</li>
            <li> Been using it for over a year. Nails and hair are visibly healthier</li>
            <li> I saw no result in this product. I waited to wright a review once I took them all to be fair :(</li>
            <li> I took this several months ago, it was great then.  I am taking it again, for I stopped for a while, got lazy.  It really does work.  I had more new little hairs come in and was very noticeable.  I did not think it would really work but it does or at least for me.</li>
            <li> My hair was starting to get noticeably thinner when I found these vitamins.  After a couple months, I noticed new hairs growing back where with other hair, skin and nails vitamins I did not.  I am continuing to take Hair Essentials.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping- One of the best hair products on the market- It makes your hair strong and healthy looking-&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t work out for me! i said I&#x27;m gonna try for four month and i did but i couldn&#x27;t say i see any different</li>
            <li> Good product.  Along with good nutrition and safe hair products, this product should work your you.</li>
            <li> love this stuff!  Thanks</li>
            <li> I am 27 years old female who is losing so much hair for no reason at all since one year (all blood tests done) ... 100 a day and 200 while washing. I have been taking this since 20 days, no positive effect till now. Seriously waiting for a miracle. Bought a pack of 3 yesterday from amazon. Will update again in a few weeks... with some positive review... hopefully :)</li>
            <li> I noticed a change within a few weeks of trying it. I am planning to try for a year to see if it really makes a difference. Patience with any alternative remedy is  something I have realized after trying several different alternative treatments. If you are looking for a quick fix, this is not for you.</li>
            <li> Good deal on a good product.  Not growing back but definitely stopped the shedding.  I will be purchasing more in future</li>
            <li> I have never written a product review before, but wanted to do one for these pills. I noticed after starting grad school that my hair was shedding like crazy and was really dry. I ordered these after doing TONS of research, and they work great. I was taking them for about 3 or 4 months before I noticed a real difference, and now, probably 8 months later, I have tons of hair growth. My hairstylist commented on it last time I was there that I had a lot of growth coming in all over my scalp, and I can really see it now. I would recommend this product, but you do have to stick with it for a few months before seeing results- a friend tried these and gave up after a month or two and didn&#x27;t see a difference. The longer you stick with it, the better the results seem to be. I also noticed an improvement with the dryness (although, I started using salon-quality shampoo and conditioner, so that could be the reason). Either way, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> make hair strong and thick. I have long hair and middle 40&#x27;s I was a little worried about losing hair for age but not anymore.</li>
            <li> Helps my hair to grow and not fall out</li>
            <li> these vitamins are great..........</li>
