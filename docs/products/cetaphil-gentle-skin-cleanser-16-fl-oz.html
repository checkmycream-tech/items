            <li>He still uses it, but doesn&#x27;t think its as great as I do.</li>
            <li>Great seller will buy again</li>
            <li>The Cetaphil has a pleasant smell, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and the best part is my skin feels very clean after I use it.</li>
            <li>good product for the price</li>
            <li>I read on the bottle that it was a cleanser, so i looked it up on the internet and heard how good it was.</li>
            <li>also use it like a moisturizing face mask - wash and rinse face (with the cetaphil), apply a fair amount onto skin and leave for about 10 minutes, then rinse off again.</li>
            <li>I love Cetiphil Cleanser!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t work for everyone, but give it a try!</li>
            <li>Safe to say I am never purchasing this product again!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I think anybody would enjoy the quality and Amazon&#x27;s great price.</li>
            <li>Cetaphil is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>but for now, I&#x27;m just happy to have smooth skin again.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It can be used with or without water which is nice.</li>
            <li>(How handy when traveling -</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t use the kind with medication in them.  </li>
            <li>so I rinse it all off with warm water or if I am camping</li>
            <li>It makes my skin very refreshed and also allows the makeup to blend perfectly into my skin for a great natural look.</li>
            <li>This product has 3 variations  of parabans but at safe levels that wont irritate the skin ,</li>
            <li>I am glad I found this stuff</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, I will use this stuff forever.  :)</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m zit free!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t think of a way they could make this product better -</li>
            <li>For me, Cetaphil is the way to go. :)</li>
            <li>It doesnt have fancy packaging or advertisements but this products works better for me than anything I have found.  </li>
            <li>it to the face giving a thorough non abasive cleaning, but most products that lather well leave a residue that</li>
            <li>I am a licensed ESTHETICIAN and love and recommend Cetaphil.</li>
            <li>Oh as another reviewer stated it doesn&#x27;t do much for acne, but I use the ELF zit zapper on my breakouts and this works great for me.</li>
            <li>*never touch your face unless you are cleansing it-hands carry many germs, *invest in a silk pillowcase-regular pillowcases hold dirt and oil from your face, neck and hair, *</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it can&#x27;t help the discoloration/scarring...</li>
            <li>It must me used EVERY day and make sure you wash your face at night- every night; I never sleep with makeup on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s the best as a make-up remover - especially eye makeup like mascara.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I loved it at first until one day I decided not to wear makeup.</li>
            <li>This product works pretty good.</li>
            <li>I have switched from Purpose liquid cleanser (a nice product) to Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser lotion and am amazed by how nice it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>It has this wonderful light smell that makes me want to lather my entire body in it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so great for my sensative skin and makes skin soft.  </li>
            <li>unless they gave it away for free :) I&#x27;ll buy it for life.</li>
            <li>This product is completely free of fragrances - which is important to me - I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy on the skin and works like a charm.  </li>
            <li>One day I saw a girl on youtube who shared a similar story and now had beautiful glowing skin.</li>
            <li>I wear makeup and it takes that off fine too without stinging at all-though sometimes I do have to use an eye makeup remover on my mascara.  </li>
            <li>It is like smoothing a soothing lotion all over your skin - you gentle rub, and it removes all traces of my waterbased makeup and mascara (better than anything I&#x27;ve used before!).</li>
            <li>I decided to give it a shot, and it made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Since using this for about 2 or 3 weeks, I see a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Face feels smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so cheap, why not?</li>
            <li>(I use an AHA to exfoliate my skin and keep it acne free)</li>
            <li>My skin now feels smooth and soothed.</li>
            <li>The Cetaphil products are not a treatment for acne, but they are so gentle that they don&#x27;t interfere with the topical meds you might be using - and for me that is exactly perfect.</li>
            <li>my face felt clean</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll keep some in the car to clean my hands on the road)</li>
            <li>perhaps there is a special technique for using it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so true.</li>
            <li>I love Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser, it is a great gentle every day cleaner that will not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>I read about Cetaphil in a best selling consumer-oriented beauty book that said that Cetaphil was the only facial cleanser that the author could truly recommend and had to try it.  </li>
            <li>Recommend it for any women who are pregnant and having acne problems</li>
            <li>and while it is a bit pricey (I&#x27;m pretty cheap</li>
            <li>Cetaphil is reasonably priced, fragrance free, and my face doesnt hurt.</li>
            <li>*use gentle moisturizer free of parabens and lanolins, *</li>
            <li>It definitely doesn&#x27;t hurt that my skin looks amazing too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it and the bottle (used by my eldest daughter and myself)</li>
            <li>This is much better than using soap on my sensitive skin and leaves it moist and</li>
            <li>Cetaphil is the only face cleanser I have found that can keep my skin looking good because it is gentle and never irritates it.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth the price and here</li>
            <li>Breakouts were consistent; they happened every month, specifically right before and/or during my period.</li>
            <li>There is no scent evident when squeezed into the hand or rubbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I am always looking for better products but this is one that I keep coming back to.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t contain soap, so you can open your eyes when washing your face.</li>
            <li>The price is good and you can always save a few bucks on it at Walgreens</li>
            <li>it is so true that you should not strip the natural oils from your skin!</li>
            <li>Cleanser is definitely a Gem worth keeping!!</li>
            <li>I have tried Clean and Clear, Clearasil, Noxema, Neutrogena, all of them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for two days and my skin is clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser is the gentlest facial cleanser I have been able to find.</li>
            <li>Both Cetaphil products seem to help my skin heal old marks that I thought would stay as light scars, and it keeps my skin so much healthier than before.</li>
            <li>gel cleanser is not gooey to touch and works rather quickly in obtaining clean skin for the entire body.</li>
            <li>stuff is like 1/10 the cost of my previous face wash but works better!  </li>
            <li>I used to use the Lancome Bi-facil double action eye makeup remover which is really good, but this works even better for so much less.</li>
            <li>My skin was really oily at first, but after a while my skin got use to it.</li>
            <li>I have combination, hypersensititve skin and pretty much</li>
            <li>bottle is rather large.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product in hopes that it would help clear my long struggle with moderate acne after reading great reviews.</li>
            <li>I am in my early twenties and my skin tends to be sensitive and break out easily.</li>
            <li>so when I am in a pinch I can clean my face anywhere though I generally prefer to use water to wash it off.  </li>
            <li>ONLY use fragrance/dye free products.</li>
            <li>Cetaphil is such a find - a very inexpensive, effective facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I am very prone to breakouts</li>
            <li>This cleanser is indeed gentle to the skin.</li>
            <li>My face, earlobes, chest and shoulders, and insides of wrists seem to be the most tender and will get red, itchy, hot, or blotched with a rash, if I am not careful about gentle cleansers, lotions, perfumes, fabrics, etc.</li>
            <li>By the way, if you want to feel really indulgent, use this all over in the shower, you&#x27;ll feel like you&#x27;ve been pampered.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This can be used while in the shower and rinse off after applying and rubbing gently.</li>
            <li>I prefer to use the Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser without water.</li>
            <li>The cleanser is a clear/off white gel type of texture that rubs into the skin with a light lather.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t get away with a couple of squirts on a washcloth to wash my whole body.</li>
            <li>It leaves no residue because you cant get much on your skin.</li>
            <li>My skin felt smooth, glowed, and looked younger...</li>
            <li>use gentle cleanser like Cetaphil,</li>
            <li>my husband, who has really oily skin, thinks this stuff is too \\&quot;weak\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>skin has cleared up so much.</li>
            <li>High quality product!</li>
            <li>Especially if you suffer from adult acne, this product plus a prescription cream are like magic together.</li>
            <li>At first I thought this was something just for the face, but I quickly learned when I perused the back label that this is for the body as well and can be used on babies.</li>
            <li>skin since I&#x27;ve started using this product and the Cetaphil Cream (original cream in the jar) twice daily.</li>
            <li>This works better than any other cleanser I have used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the all-purpose soap for almost everyone.&lt;br /&gt;Cetaphil  causes no reaction to anyone (okay a few folks may not be able to use anything other than water</li>
            <li>face wash is like water, barely produces a lather and slips right thru your fingers when you try to transfer it to your face.</li>
            <li>Not only does it make your face and body so smooth and soft</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the lotions and face creams.</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend this to anybody.</li>
            <li>The problem I have is the bottle is too large to fit someplace where I can remember it and see it daily in the bathroom, so it is confined to the bottom cabinet below the sink and it gets pushed back when new items are placed there.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After a few days of cleaning twice a day I noticed a huge difference!  </li>
            <li>So far this product is soothing to my baby and not irritating.</li>
            <li>Thanks to genetics, I was &amp;#34;blessed&amp;#34; with extremely sensitive skin of the combination type.</li>
            <li>Normal cleansers weren&#x27;t doing the trick</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft and clean - no oily residue OR dry tightness.</li>
            <li>I used this for about a week and saw slight improvement mostly in decrease of blackheads and was hopeful and all of a sudden I woke up one morning with a huge breakout on my chin which is not a normal place for me to break out.</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive skin, with some atopic dermatitis.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other products but this is one of the only ones that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>Still get a pimple or two every now and then, but they clear up quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gentle Skin Cleanser also works as a regular cleanser.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough for babies too.</li>
            <li>Or, you can use it without water, rub it on and wipe off with soft towel.</li>
            <li>statement on the bottle of Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser states, Softens As It Cleanses, one that I totally agree with and can attest to as an eczema sufferer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My pediatrician suggested this for my newborn with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just using it on my face and sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s for sensitive skin, so it&#x27;s not a harsh cleaner, but I dont like how it leaves my face still feeling oily.</li>
            <li>I am 42 years old and have been using this product on my face every day for 10 years after my dermatologist recommended it.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to everyone that asks me what I use on my skin because at 43 years old I still get checked for my ID when I go into a liquor store or by the shameful cigarettes for my husband.</li>
            <li>My doctor had recommened it to my brother who has extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve suffered with acne since I was 12 years old.</li>
            <li>There is no tight feeling to the skin, just soft and smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One more thing to note: I use the CVS generic version of Cetaphil; works the same and costs less.</li>
            <li>I no longer get the above mentioned red, itchy, hot, rashy etc.</li>
            <li>I have had to completely change my skin care regime, because my normal routine suddenly stopped working...badly.</li>
            <li>try a toner like THAYers, splash face with warm water b4 cleansing to open pores and rinse product off with cold water to tighten pores(make pores smaller) and *drink lots of WATER to keep skin-largest orgin in the body, free of toxins that can contribute to outbreaks.</li>
            <li>The gentle cleanser along with the facial moisturizer for extremely dry skin worked like a charm to make my face feel &#x27;normal&#x27; again.</li>
            <li>Then, one of my students told me her mother had been to the dermatologist for very similar concerns, and he had told her to simply switch to Cetaphyl (gentle face wash &amp; the lotion, too).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;FYI, in conjunction with having very sensitive skin, I also have rheumatoid arthritis, which is an inflammatory disorder that I am on multiple medications for and</li>
            <li>I am an African American woman in my mid twenties and have suffered from moderate to mild acne since my teen years.</li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive skin and mild adult acne that gets worse with exercise and the hot weather.</li>
            <li>bottle is clear so you can see when you are low and plan on restocking.</li>
            <li>used without water simple rub into skin and wipe excess with a soft cloth, leaving a bit on the skin.</li>
            <li>Apparently, the KISS rule works:  </li>
            <li>Eventually, at 18 years old, I finally realized that my acne was hormonal, and compared with my skin type, I&#x27;d need prescription stuff to get rid of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I can say that ifyou have sensitive skin and need products that won&#x27;t irritate it further, Cetaphil is a viable option to try.</li>
            <li>I will never waste my money on a different cleanser.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper at the drugstore, grocery store, and other places online ($5-$6 cheaper).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now since upgraded to the daily facial cleanser and moisturizer, and I&#x27;m still mostly clear.</li>
            <li>No dry patches, and no breakouts.</li>
            <li>I am highly allergic to several different soaps and preservatives, but Cetaphil doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out, itch, or dry up.</li>
            <li>With a cloth you can easily remove the excess, while leaving a thin film on the skin.</li>

            <li> Oh as another reviewer stated it doesn&#x27;t do much for acne, but I use the ELF zit zapper on my breakouts and this works great for me.</li>
            <li> *never touch your face unless you are cleansing it-hands carry many germs, *invest in a silk pillowcase-regular pillowcases hold dirt and oil from your face, neck and hair, *</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it can&#x27;t help the discoloration/scarring...</li>
            <li> It must me used EVERY day and make sure you wash your face at night- every night; I never sleep with makeup on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s the best as a make-up remover - especially eye makeup like mascara.  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I loved it at first until one day I decided not to wear makeup.</li>
            <li> This product works pretty good.</li>
            <li> I have switched from Purpose liquid cleanser (a nice product) to Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser lotion and am amazed by how nice it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> It has this wonderful light smell that makes me want to lather my entire body in it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so great for my sensative skin and makes skin soft.  </li>
            <li> unless they gave it away for free :) I&#x27;ll buy it for life.</li>
            <li> This product is completely free of fragrances - which is important to me - I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy on the skin and works like a charm.  </li>
            <li> One day I saw a girl on youtube who shared a similar story and now had beautiful glowing skin.</li>
            <li> I wear makeup and it takes that off fine too without stinging at all-though sometimes I do have to use an eye makeup remover on my mascara.  </li>
            <li> It is like smoothing a soothing lotion all over your skin - you gentle rub, and it removes all traces of my waterbased makeup and mascara (better than anything I&#x27;ve used before!).</li>
            <li> I decided to give it a shot, and it made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Since using this for about 2 or 3 weeks, I see a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Face feels smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cheap, why not?</li>
            <li> (I use an AHA to exfoliate my skin and keep it acne free)</li>
            <li> My skin now feels smooth and soothed.</li>
            <li> The Cetaphil products are not a treatment for acne, but they are so gentle that they don&#x27;t interfere with the topical meds you might be using - and for me that is exactly perfect.</li>
            <li> my face felt clean</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll keep some in the car to clean my hands on the road)</li>
            <li> perhaps there is a special technique for using it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so true.</li>
            <li> I love Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser, it is a great gentle every day cleaner that will not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> I read about Cetaphil in a best selling consumer-oriented beauty book that said that Cetaphil was the only facial cleanser that the author could truly recommend and had to try it.  </li>
            <li> Recommend it for any women who are pregnant and having acne problems</li>
            <li> and while it is a bit pricey (I&#x27;m pretty cheap</li>
            <li> Cetaphil is reasonably priced, fragrance free, and my face doesnt hurt.</li>
            <li> *use gentle moisturizer free of parabens and lanolins, *</li>
            <li> It definitely doesn&#x27;t hurt that my skin looks amazing too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it and the bottle (used by my eldest daughter and myself)</li>
            <li> This is much better than using soap on my sensitive skin and leaves it moist and</li>
            <li> Cetaphil is the only face cleanser I have found that can keep my skin looking good because it is gentle and never irritates it.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth the price and here</li>
            <li> Breakouts were consistent; they happened every month, specifically right before and/or during my period.</li>
            <li> There is no scent evident when squeezed into the hand or rubbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I am always looking for better products but this is one that I keep coming back to.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t contain soap, so you can open your eyes when washing your face.</li>
            <li> The price is good and you can always save a few bucks on it at Walgreens</li>
            <li> it is so true that you should not strip the natural oils from your skin!</li>
            <li> Cleanser is definitely a Gem worth keeping!!</li>
            <li> I have tried Clean and Clear, Clearasil, Noxema, Neutrogena, all of them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for two days and my skin is clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser is the gentlest facial cleanser I have been able to find.</li>
            <li> Both Cetaphil products seem to help my skin heal old marks that I thought would stay as light scars, and it keeps my skin so much healthier than before.</li>
            <li> gel cleanser is not gooey to touch and works rather quickly in obtaining clean skin for the entire body.</li>
            <li> stuff is like 1/10 the cost of my previous face wash but works better!  </li>
            <li> I used to use the Lancome Bi-facil double action eye makeup remover which is really good, but this works even better for so much less.</li>
            <li> My skin was really oily at first, but after a while my skin got use to it.</li>
            <li> I have combination, hypersensititve skin and pretty much</li>
            <li> bottle is rather large.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product in hopes that it would help clear my long struggle with moderate acne after reading great reviews.</li>
            <li> I am in my early twenties and my skin tends to be sensitive and break out easily.</li>
            <li> so when I am in a pinch I can clean my face anywhere though I generally prefer to use water to wash it off.  </li>
            <li> ONLY use fragrance/dye free products.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil is such a find - a very inexpensive, effective facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I am very prone to breakouts</li>
            <li> This cleanser is indeed gentle to the skin.</li>
            <li> My face, earlobes, chest and shoulders, and insides of wrists seem to be the most tender and will get red, itchy, hot, or blotched with a rash, if I am not careful about gentle cleansers, lotions, perfumes, fabrics, etc.</li>
            <li> By the way, if you want to feel really indulgent, use this all over in the shower, you&#x27;ll feel like you&#x27;ve been pampered.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This can be used while in the shower and rinse off after applying and rubbing gently.</li>
            <li> I prefer to use the Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser without water.</li>
            <li> The cleanser is a clear/off white gel type of texture that rubs into the skin with a light lather.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t get away with a couple of squirts on a washcloth to wash my whole body.</li>
            <li> It leaves no residue because you cant get much on your skin.</li>
            <li> My skin felt smooth, glowed, and looked younger...</li>
            <li> use gentle cleanser like Cetaphil,</li>
            <li> my husband, who has really oily skin, thinks this stuff is too \\&quot;weak\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> skin has cleared up so much.</li>
            <li> High quality product!</li>
            <li> Especially if you suffer from adult acne, this product plus a prescription cream are like magic together.</li>
            <li> At first I thought this was something just for the face, but I quickly learned when I perused the back label that this is for the body as well and can be used on babies.</li>
            <li> skin since I&#x27;ve started using this product and the Cetaphil Cream (original cream in the jar) twice daily.</li>
            <li> This works better than any other cleanser I have used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the all-purpose soap for almost everyone.&lt;br /&gt;Cetaphil  causes no reaction to anyone (okay a few folks may not be able to use anything other than water</li>
            <li> face wash is like water, barely produces a lather and slips right thru your fingers when you try to transfer it to your face.</li>
            <li> Not only does it make your face and body so smooth and soft</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the lotions and face creams.</li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY recommend this to anybody.</li>
            <li> The problem I have is the bottle is too large to fit someplace where I can remember it and see it daily in the bathroom, so it is confined to the bottom cabinet below the sink and it gets pushed back when new items are placed there.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a few days of cleaning twice a day I noticed a huge difference!  </li>
            <li> So far this product is soothing to my baby and not irritating.</li>
            <li> Thanks to genetics, I was &amp;#34;blessed&amp;#34; with extremely sensitive skin of the combination type.</li>
            <li> Normal cleansers weren&#x27;t doing the trick</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft and clean - no oily residue OR dry tightness.</li>
            <li> I used this for about a week and saw slight improvement mostly in decrease of blackheads and was hopeful and all of a sudden I woke up one morning with a huge breakout on my chin which is not a normal place for me to break out.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin, with some atopic dermatitis.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other products but this is one of the only ones that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Still get a pimple or two every now and then, but they clear up quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gentle Skin Cleanser also works as a regular cleanser.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough for babies too.</li>
            <li> Or, you can use it without water, rub it on and wipe off with soft towel.</li>
            <li> statement on the bottle of Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser states, Softens As It Cleanses, one that I totally agree with and can attest to as an eczema sufferer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My pediatrician suggested this for my newborn with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just using it on my face and sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s for sensitive skin, so it&#x27;s not a harsh cleaner, but I dont like how it leaves my face still feeling oily.</li>
            <li> I am 42 years old and have been using this product on my face every day for 10 years after my dermatologist recommended it.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to everyone that asks me what I use on my skin because at 43 years old I still get checked for my ID when I go into a liquor store or by the shameful cigarettes for my husband.</li>
            <li> My doctor had recommened it to my brother who has extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered with acne since I was 12 years old.</li>
            <li> There is no tight feeling to the skin, just soft and smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One more thing to note: I use the CVS generic version of Cetaphil; works the same and costs less.</li>
            <li> I no longer get the above mentioned red, itchy, hot, rashy etc.</li>
            <li> I have had to completely change my skin care regime, because my normal routine suddenly stopped working...badly.</li>
            <li> try a toner like THAYers, splash face with warm water b4 cleansing to open pores and rinse product off with cold water to tighten pores(make pores smaller) and *drink lots of WATER to keep skin-largest orgin in the body, free of toxins that can contribute to outbreaks.</li>
            <li> The gentle cleanser along with the facial moisturizer for extremely dry skin worked like a charm to make my face feel &#x27;normal&#x27; again.</li>
            <li> Then, one of my students told me her mother had been to the dermatologist for very similar concerns, and he had told her to simply switch to Cetaphyl (gentle face wash &amp; the lotion, too).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;FYI, in conjunction with having very sensitive skin, I also have rheumatoid arthritis, which is an inflammatory disorder that I am on multiple medications for and</li>
            <li> I am an African American woman in my mid twenties and have suffered from moderate to mild acne since my teen years.</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin and mild adult acne that gets worse with exercise and the hot weather.</li>
            <li> bottle is clear so you can see when you are low and plan on restocking.</li>
            <li> used without water simple rub into skin and wipe excess with a soft cloth, leaving a bit on the skin.</li>
            <li> Apparently, the KISS rule works:  </li>
            <li> Eventually, at 18 years old, I finally realized that my acne was hormonal, and compared with my skin type, I&#x27;d need prescription stuff to get rid of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I can say that ifyou have sensitive skin and need products that won&#x27;t irritate it further, Cetaphil is a viable option to try.</li>
            <li> I will never waste my money on a different cleanser.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper at the drugstore, grocery store, and other places online ($5-$6 cheaper).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now since upgraded to the daily facial cleanser and moisturizer, and I&#x27;m still mostly clear.</li>
            <li> No dry patches, and no breakouts.</li>
            <li> I am highly allergic to several different soaps and preservatives, but Cetaphil doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out, itch, or dry up.</li>
            <li> With a cloth you can easily remove the excess, while leaving a thin film on the skin.</li>
            <li> The products were either too weak and did nothing to rid my skin of the oil or too strong and make my skin as dry as 80-grit sandpaper.</li>
            <li> sporadic, deep-skinned break-outs of very stubborn pimples that usually left a dark coloration in their wake...and skin that had once been incredibly dry seemed to be suddenly combination.  </li>
            <li> In the month I used this (only lasted me that long)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my Irish complexion.   </li>
            <li> Compound this sensitivity with the fact that my skin is extremely acne prone if I am not careful.</li>
            <li> After trying Origins, Estee Lauder, Philosophy, Benefit, and numerous other high-end products, I still found I had problematic skin that had only started when I turned 30</li>
            <li> Few ingredients, I dont know what they do but so far they work on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have a 16 year old daughter who NEVER had trouble with her skin [pimples, breakouts</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m only ONE week into its use, and my skin is very rapidly returning to how it looked when I was in my late 20&#x27;s (at least as far as the texture and lack of breakouts).  </li>
            <li> I must be using this product incorrectly because my experience has been much different than the other reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> its a dry bath product.&lt;br /&gt;Take</li>
            <li> My skin now never feels taught, or dry.</li>
            <li> My face was extremely dry</li>
            <li> Every product I tried left my face tight and dry</li>
            <li> With Cetaphil, my skin is markedly less oily, I have about 1/4 the amount of breakouts, and I swear my pores look smaller.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all I use in those areas that require a little extra care</li>
            <li> , I just wipe it off with a wet towel.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty bad adult acne.</li>
            <li> It can also be dry in some areas and slightly oily in others.  </li>
            <li> This face wash along with the other two products I have reviewed were the only things that saved me from scratching my skin raw.</li>
            <li> the other shaving lotion I tried either irritates the skin a lot, or smells like perfume.</li>
            <li> With other cleansers, I still have breakouts, even with the Differin, and my pores are enlarged.</li>
            <li> I am 13 and have extreme combination skin.</li>
            <li> It is extremely soothing.</li>
            <li> I believe all these results are due to the fact that it is so hydrating and skin loves and needs lots of hydration.</li>
            <li> And I tried it because I ran out of my usual face wash and hasn&#x27;t switched back since (4 years ago).  </li>
            <li> face wash didn&#x27;t irritate my already extremely irritated, itchy red skin that was not enjoying the fact that I was having difficulty figuring out what to do with it, because it became that way out of no where.</li>
            <li> my skin is extremely picky about what I can use on it.</li>
            <li> only very few around cycle times] and never like the majority of others her age get.</li>
            <li> Later I found out that a co-worker who is known for being a beauty/cosmetic fanatic (and who literally spends hundreds of dollars on beauty/cosmetics) used Cetaphil as well.</li>
            <li> And because it&#x27;s doubles as make-up remover and mask, I can carry less when I travel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, but the zits I do have aren&#x27;t as red and are much smaller.</li>
            <li> Though the other products by Cetaphil is plain, this \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; skin cleanser is the #1 cleanser I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that the wrinkles around my eyes and forehead seem to have diminished a little.</li>
            <li> I noticed my little brother, who is 3 and has eczema, was using it.</li>
            <li> Thumbs down!</li>
            <li> only downside is that it won&#x27;t remove makeup very easily, so I only use it in the morning and use my trusty cold cream at night.</li>
            <li> I apply it, rub in, then towel off, leaving a tiny bit behind.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s that everyone is different and no one product will work for all people, as frustrating as that can be.</li>
            <li> I was actually pretty shocked</li>
            <li> Ever since my friend told me about Cetaphil a few years ago I have not used any thing else!</li>
            <li> It isnt too harsh to use every day, and even comes in soap bar form!</li>
            <li> Say no more.</li>
            <li> The different skin types have been evened out already, the oily places not nearly as oily, the dry places moisturized without that disgusting clog your pores feeling.</li>
            <li> Normal facial lotions didn&#x27;t help and I was miserable...</li>
            <li> I have been having a horrible time with my skin due to the harsh Wisconsin winter and this face wash is just what I needed in conjunction with the new serum and moisturizer I am using, that I posted reviews about.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some places are so oily that 6% benzoyle peroxide cleanser was prescribed my my dermatologist, other places were so dry that my skin cracked, peeled, and burned painfully.</li>
            <li> I hate my skin, and have spent big money on fancy specialty cleaners.</li>
            <li> It cleanses and is antibacterial and yet you never feel a sting or any irritation on delicate skin.</li>
            <li> Seems very expensive, given the same product costs 10 at Walgreens</li>
            <li> When I ran out I tried another, less expensive product that was also supposed to be dermatologist recommended.</li>
            <li> As a comparison, I did try Eucerin products, and sadly, I&#x27;m one of the 1 out of 180 people with Atopic Dermatitis who seems to have trouble with the lanolin in the Eucerin products.</li>
            <li> I first bought after reading reviews in Allure magazine and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed one bit!!</li>
            <li> During my second pregnancy I broke out like crazy!  </li>
            <li> It says you can leave a thin film on, but I find that it makes my skin itchy</li>
            <li> They used it before me, and they still had such bad acne that i was afraid to use it!Well, it didn&#x27;t help at all!I</li>
            <li> Keep It Simple, Stupid!</li>
            <li> I guess there is no perfect face wash that meets every requirement..</li>
            <li> The consistency is a bit weird, but whatever works!  </li>
            <li> Anyone with that type of skin knows how awful it is, like being stuck between a rock and a hard place.</li>
            <li> However, this is very expensive for this size of Cetaphil.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Few ingredients, I dont know what they do but so far they work on my skin. This product has 3 variations  of parabans but at safe levels that wont irritate the skin , just thought the people should know!</li>
            <li> good product for the price</li>
            <li> I bought this item bc of all the hype. I loved it at first until one day I decided not to wear makeup. I went to the gym later that day and wiped my face off on my white towel to find foundation residue. I was actually pretty shocked bc my face felt clean and I didnt put ANY foundation on (liquid/powder/tinted moisturized, NADA). Not to mention I washed my face twice (once at night and again in the morning). Its def dries your skin but I put a moisturizer on anyways so that doesnt bother me.</li>
            <li> Great product! It takes some getting use to because there is no lather. My skin was really oily at first, but after a while my skin got use to it. I have. No dry patches, and no breakouts. It&#x27;s even helped with some scaring</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what is in this stuff but it works great.   I use it at home every day.  My hubby uses it in the shower.  But that isn&#x27;t where it started.  We travel by bicycle around the country and this stuff can get the grit and grime of riding off without water.  This removes the dirt of the day.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my Irish complexion.   I am glad I found this stuff</li>
            <li> I have combination, hypersensititve skin and pretty much ONLY use fragrance/dye free products. Cetaphil is such a find - a very inexpensive, effective facial cleanser.  It leaves my skin feeling soft and clean - no oily residue OR dry tightness. I read about Cetaphil in a best selling consumer-oriented beauty book that said that Cetaphil was the only facial cleanser that the author could truly recommend and had to try it.  Later I found out that a co-worker who is known for being a beauty/cosmetic fanatic (and who literally spends hundreds of dollars on beauty/cosmetics) used Cetaphil as well. Haven&#x27;t tried the moisterizer yet (I use Neutrogena SPF 15 for sensitive skin) but will probably try it soon as it seems Neutrogena is intent on focusing on alphahydroxy products which cause me to turn red/itchy and the nonalphahydroxy products are getting harder to find. Do yourself a favor and check Cetaphil out.</li>
            <li> I love Cetiphil Cleanser! My dermatologist  recommended it to me and I use it all the time. It&#x27;s so great for my sensative skin and makes skin soft.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There is no odor like some cleansers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can be used not only on face but all over! The bottle also recommends this for babies. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It can be used with or without water which is nice. &lt;br /&gt;When used with water it has a very low later. &lt;br /&gt;When used without water simple rub into skin and wipe excess with a soft cloth, leaving a bit on the skin. (skin will absorb and lock in moisture). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Simply the best cleanser for sensative skin. I have tried many other products but this is one of the only ones that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Ever since my friend told me about Cetaphil a few years ago I have not used any thing else! Since then I have been introducing my friends and family to Cetaphil soaps and creams. Not only does it make your face and body so smooth and soft but I think it makes you look younger. I have noticed that the wrinkles around my eyes and forehead seem to have diminished a little. I highly recommend the lotions and face creams. This is a great product for all ages of women. You will feel the diffence on your skin as soon as you apply it!</li>
            <li> My sister left me a bottle from a summer visit.  I found out this cleanser is great as shaving lotion.  There is no fragrance, and the blade glides well with the lotion applied.  Face feels smooth afterwards. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All the other shaving lotion I tried either irritates the skin a lot, or smells like perfume. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser also works as a regular cleanser.</li>
            <li> I hate my skin, and have spent big money on fancy specialty cleaners. None work this well. I am very prone to breakouts and  I also use Differin gel. With other cleansers, I still have breakouts, even with the Differin, and my pores are enlarged. With Cetaphil, my skin is markedly less oily, I have about 1/4 the amount of breakouts, and I swear my pores look smaller. I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t work for everyone, but give it a try! It&#x27;s so cheap, why not? Especially if you suffer from adult acne, this product plus a prescription cream are like magic together.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is indeed gentle to the skin. If you have skin problems this is the answer. It cleanses and is antibacterial and yet you never feel a sting or any irritation on delicate skin. It&#x27;s all I use in those areas that require a little extra care I like it I think anybody would enjoy the quality and Amazon&#x27;s great price.</li>
            <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Cetaphil for years now.  I first bought after reading reviews in Allure magazine and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed one bit!! It&#x27;s the best, non drying and non-abrasive cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used... and while it is a bit pricey (I&#x27;m pretty cheap lol) it&#x27;s worth it and the bottle (used by my eldest daughter and myself) lasts us 6 months!  And you can use it without water if you needed too!  It&#x27;s amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I will use this stuff forever.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Cetaphil is absolutely amazing. Clears up any problems you have. It isnt too harsh to use every day, and even comes in soap bar form!</li>
            <li> I have two sisters, and we all use this product.They used it before me, and they still had such bad acne that i was afraid to use it!Well, it didn&#x27;t help at all!I switched to olay face pads or whatever.They are a lot better!Now i&#x27;m zit free!</li>
            <li> I am 13 and have extreme combination skin. Some places are so oily that 6% benzoyle peroxide cleanser was prescribed my my dermatologist, other places were so dry that my skin cracked, peeled, and burned painfully. I noticed my little brother, who is 3 and has eczema, was using it. I read on the bottle that it was a cleanser, so i looked it up on the internet and heard how good it was. I&#x27;ve used it for two days and my skin is clean and soft. The different skin types have been evened out already, the oily places not nearly as oily, the dry places moisturized without that disgusting clog your pores feeling. I apply it, rub in, then towel off, leaving a tiny bit behind. I&#x27;m not going back to my prescription cleansers and moisturizers, why should I? Cetaphil is reasonably priced, fragrance free, and my face doesnt hurt. Thats reason enough for me.</li>
            <li> Texture: silky&lt;br /&gt;Rinses off: invisibly!&lt;br /&gt;Purposes: Many&lt;br /&gt;This is the all-purpose soap for almost everyone.&lt;br /&gt;Cetaphil  causes no reaction to anyone (okay a few folks may not be able to use anything other than water but I assume they wouldn&#x27;t be looking at this product anyway).  Non-allergenic, no perfumes or dyes.&lt;br /&gt;The multi-purpose part:&lt;br /&gt;with water as a liquid soap.&lt;br /&gt;WithOUT water as moisturizing soap.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously.  Read the label for usage.  You can leave this on if travelling, don&#x27;t have access to water but want to get rid of grime or germs: its a dry bath product.&lt;br /&gt;Take it camping, hiking, in the car as well as shower or bath.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser is the gentlest facial cleanser I have been able to find. I am highly allergic to several different soaps and preservatives, but Cetaphil doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out, itch, or dry up. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d suggest the liquid Cetaphil cleanser instead of their soap bar, as bars can cause one to have clogged pours (read: blackheads). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that it won&#x27;t remove makeup very easily, so I only use it in the morning and use my trusty cold cream at night. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This bottle is rather large.  I use it to refill my 4 oz bottle since it&#x27;s cheaper to buy 16 ounces at a time.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Cetaphil Cleanser for years.  I have&lt;BR&gt;Rosacea so I was happy to use a product that didn&#x27;t irriate&lt;BR&gt;my skin.&lt;br /&gt;This Cleanser is definitely a Gem worth keeping!!</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin, with some atopic dermatitis. My face, earlobes, chest and shoulders, and insides of wrists seem to be the most tender and will get red, itchy, hot, or blotched with a rash, if I am not careful about gentle cleansers, lotions, perfumes, fabrics, etc. Compound this sensitivity with the fact that my skin is extremely acne prone if I am not careful. I have switched from Purpose liquid cleanser (a nice product) to Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser lotion and am amazed by how nice it makes my skin feel. It is extremely soothing. I no longer get the above mentioned red, itchy, hot, rashy etc. skin since I&#x27;ve started using this product and the Cetaphil Cream (original cream in the jar) twice daily. The Cetaphil products are not a treatment for acne, but they are so gentle that they don&#x27;t interfere with the topical meds you might be using - and for me that is exactly perfect. (I use an AHA to exfoliate my skin and keep it acne free) Both Cetaphil products seem to help my skin heal old marks that I thought would stay as light scars, and it keeps my skin so much healthier than before. My skin now never feels taught, or dry. My skin now feels smooth and soothed. The cleanser is not like anything I&#x27;ve ever used - it does not \\&quot;lather\\&quot; in the traditional sense. It is like smoothing a soothing lotion all over your skin - you gentle rub, and it removes all traces of my waterbased makeup and mascara (better than anything I&#x27;ve used before!). It seems like the makeup just melts away and rinses off, rather than being lathered away. I like the feeling now that I&#x27;m not expecting it to suds. The great part - it never stings my eyes. I even use it when shaving my legs, as a shaving cream, and I don&#x27;t get razor irritation anymore. It&#x27;s gentle enough for babies too. You can use it with water (which is how I do it 90% of the time) - just rub it on and rinse it off. Or, you can use it without water, rub it on and wipe off with soft towel. (How handy when traveling - I think I&#x27;ll keep some in the car to clean my hands on the road) This product is completely free of fragrances - which is important to me - I love it. I can&#x27;t think of a way they could make this product better - unless they gave it away for free :) I&#x27;ll buy it for life. By the way, if you want to feel really indulgent, use this all over in the shower, you&#x27;ll feel like you&#x27;ve been pampered. It&#x27;s great. As a comparison, I did try Eucerin products, and sadly, I&#x27;m one of the 1 out of 180 people with Atopic Dermatitis who seems to have trouble with the lanolin in the Eucerin products. For me, Cetaphil is the way to go. :)</li>
            <li> Say no more. Though the other products by Cetaphil is plain, this \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; skin cleanser is the #1 cleanser I have ever used.</li>
            <li> At first I thought this was something just for the face, but I quickly learned when I perused the back label that this is for the body as well and can be used on babies. This is meant to retain needed moisture and I notice immediately a glistening on one arm when I compared both arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This can be used while in the shower and rinse off after applying and rubbing gently. I prefer to use the Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser without water. The cleanser is a clear/off white gel type of texture that rubs into the skin with a light lather. There is no scent evident when squeezed into the hand or rubbed into the skin. With a cloth you can easily remove the excess, while leaving a thin film on the skin. There is no tight feeling to the skin, just soft and smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel cleanser is not gooey to touch and works rather quickly in obtaining clean skin for the entire body. I prefer to use it on my hands and legs and sometimes go for the face. This is much better than using soap on my sensitive skin and leaves it moist and almost glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is clear so you can see when you are low and plan on restocking. I have some left still since I do not use it on a daily basis. The problem I have is the bottle is too large to fit someplace where I can remember it and see it daily in the bathroom, so it is confined to the bottom cabinet below the sink and it gets pushed back when new items are placed there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The statement on the bottle of Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser states, Softens As It Cleanses, one that I totally agree with and can attest to as an eczema sufferer.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend Cetaphil strongly enough. I use this in at night as both a cleanser and a moisturizer and then I rub some into my skin in the morning before putting my makeup on. It makes my skin very refreshed and also allows the makeup to blend perfectly into my skin for a great natural look. I can&#x27;t imagine going one day without this and take it with me everytime I travel.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in hopes that it would help clear my long struggle with moderate acne after reading great reviews. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and I have tried tons of products but never had a reaction like this. I used this for about a week and saw slight improvement mostly in decrease of blackheads and was hopeful and all of a sudden I woke up one morning with a huge breakout on my chin which is not a normal place for me to break out. My face was extremely dry but I continued use of the product for about another week, I finally decided after no improvement to the breakout to stop using this product. The breakout on my chin went away after about 3-4days. Safe to say I am never purchasing this product again! Thumbs down!</li>
            <li> My pediatrician suggested this for my newborn with sensitive skin.  So far this product is soothing to my baby and not irritating.</li>
            <li> During my second pregnancy I broke out like crazy!  Normal cleansers weren&#x27;t doing the trick and I couldn&#x27;t use the kind with medication in them.  After a few days of cleaning twice a day I noticed a huge difference!  It&#x27;s easy on the skin and works like a charm.  The consistency is a bit weird, but whatever works!  ;)</li>
            <li> It doesnt have fancy packaging or advertisements but this products works better for me than anything I have found.  I am in my early twenties and my skin tends to be sensitive and break out easily. It can also be dry in some areas and slightly oily in others.  Cetaphil is the only face cleanser I have found that can keep my skin looking good because it is gentle and never irritates it.  I also like it that the product can be used without water so when I am in a pinch I can clean my face anywhere though I generally prefer to use water to wash it off.  I wear makeup and it takes that off fine too without stinging at all-though sometimes I do have to use an eye makeup remover on my mascara.  I am always looking for better products but this is one that I keep coming back to.  I also like that it has a lid so I can travel with it unlike pump cleansers.</li>
            <li> The texture of the cleanser takes some getting used to; it does not spread over the skin like soap so I can&#x27;t get away with a couple of squirts on a washcloth to wash my whole body. I have dry, sensitive skin and mild adult acne that gets worse with exercise and the hot weather. In the month I used this (only lasted me that long) I realized I wasn&#x27;t breaking out the way I used to. When I ran out I tried another, less expensive product that was also supposed to be dermatologist recommended. I broke out the next day and had itching in areas that weren&#x27;t itchy using Cetaphil. I&#x27;m going back to Cetaphil but to make it last longer I&#x27;m just using it on my face and sensitive areas. I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s for sensitive skin, so it&#x27;s not a harsh cleaner, but I dont like how it leaves my face still feeling oily.</li>
            <li> Seems very expensive, given the same product costs 10 at Walgreens</li>
            <li> I must be using this product incorrectly because my experience has been much different than the other reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;This face wash is like water, barely produces a lather and slips right thru your fingers when you try to transfer it to your face. It leaves no residue because you cant get much on your skin. The bottle I had did not have any instructions&lt;br /&gt;so perhaps there is a special technique for using it. I tend to prefer washes that lather with water and then gently&lt;br /&gt;apply it to the face giving a thorough non abasive cleaning, but most products that lather well leave a residue that&lt;br /&gt;you have to rub off. I guess there is no perfect face wash that meets every requirement..</li>
            <li> I love Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser, it is a great gentle every day cleaner that will not dry out your skin. However, this is very expensive for this size of Cetaphil. Much cheaper at the drugstore, grocery store, and other places online ($5-$6 cheaper).</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t contain soap, so you can open your eyes when washing your face. Love it!</li>
            <li> I am a licensed ESTHETICIAN and love and recommend Cetaphil. I am an African American woman in my mid twenties and have suffered from moderate to mild acne since my teen years. Every product I tried left my face tight and dry (i have oily/combo skin)which is what I thought I needed for my oily nose and forehead. One day I saw a girl on youtube who shared a similar story and now had beautiful glowing skin. She said she used Cetaphil, and at this point I was like I gotta try it. Guys it is so true that you should not strip the natural oils from your skin! This product ROCKS! My skin felt smooth, glowed, and looked younger...yes younger. I kid you not. I am not trying to over hype this product but it&#x27;s so true. It has this wonderful light smell that makes me want to lather my entire body in it. It has evened my skintone as well. I believe all these results are due to the fact that it is so hydrating and skin loves and needs lots of hydration. The price is good and you can always save a few bucks on it at Walgreens cause they often run sales. I will try the moisturizer next. Oh as another reviewer stated it doesn&#x27;t do much for acne, but I use the ELF zit zapper on my breakouts and this works great for me. However I have seen fewer breakouts since using it. Clients seem to think the overpriced cosmetic products have to be so great. Sometimes you need to simplify to get the best results. Tip 4 Mild-Moderate Acne Peo: *never touch your face unless you are cleansing it-hands carry many germs, *invest in a silk pillowcase-regular pillowcases hold dirt and oil from your face, neck and hair, *use gentle cleanser like Cetaphil, *use gentle moisturizer free of parabens and lanolins, *try a toner like THAYers, splash face with warm water b4 cleansing to open pores and rinse product off with cold water to tighten pores(make pores smaller) and *drink lots of WATER to keep skin-largest orgin in the body, free of toxins that can contribute to outbreaks. Hope this helps GOD Bless</li>
            <li> After trying Origins, Estee Lauder, Philosophy, Benefit, and numerous other high-end products, I still found I had problematic skin that had only started when I turned 30 and/or had my baby.  I had mysterious bumps that never went away on my chin...sporadic, deep-skinned break-outs of very stubborn pimples that usually left a dark coloration in their wake...and skin that had once been incredibly dry seemed to be suddenly combination.  I was truly at a loss and had tried (I thought) everything out there.  Then, one of my students told me her mother had been to the dermatologist for very similar concerns, and he had told her to simply switch to Cetaphyl (gentle face wash &amp; the lotion, too).  Why not?  I bought it...and I&#x27;m only ONE week into its use, and my skin is very rapidly returning to how it looked when I was in my late 20&#x27;s (at least as far as the texture and lack of breakouts).  I&#x27;m sure it can&#x27;t help the discoloration/scarring...but for now, I&#x27;m just happy to have smooth skin again.  I will never leave this product.  Apparently, the KISS rule works:  Keep It Simple, Stupid!</li>
            <li> This is a very good product! This is excellent! It does what it is suppose to do and therefore I am definitely buying this again if I need to.</li>
            <li> I am 42 years old and have been using this product on my face every day for 10 years after my dermatologist recommended it. I recommend it to everyone that asks me what I use on my skin because at 43 years old I still get checked for my ID when I go into a liquor store or by the shameful cigarettes for my husband. I have a 16 year old daughter who NEVER had trouble with her skin [pimples, breakouts only very few around cycle times] and never like the majority of others her age get. It must me used EVERY day and make sure you wash your face at night- every night; I never sleep with makeup on. I also use it to wash up after being out in the garden, ect., as you don&#x27;t have to worry about rinsing it all off. Worth the price and here, it is cheaper than Target or Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> I love this product! My doctor had recommened it to my brother who has extremely sensitive skin.  And I tried it because I ran out of my usual face wash and hasn&#x27;t switched back since (4 years ago).  It says you can leave a thin film on, but I find that it makes my skin itchy so I rinse it all off with warm water or if I am camping, I just wipe it off with a wet towel.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the best as a make-up remover - especially eye makeup like mascara.  I used to use the Lancome Bi-facil double action eye makeup remover which is really good, but this works even better for so much less. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I also use it like a moisturizing face mask - wash and rinse face (with the cetaphil), apply a fair amount onto skin and leave for about 10 minutes, then rinse off again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This stuff is like 1/10 the cost of my previous face wash but works better!  And because it&#x27;s doubles as make-up remover and mask, I can carry less when I travel. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;BUT my husband, who has really oily skin, thinks this stuff is too \\&quot;weak\\&quot;.  He still uses it, but doesn&#x27;t think its as great as I do.</li>
            <li> Thank you to all the people who reviewed this face wash. I have been having a horrible time with my skin due to the harsh Wisconsin winter and this face wash is just what I needed in conjunction with the new serum and moisturizer I am using, that I posted reviews about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This face wash didn&#x27;t irritate my already extremely irritated, itchy red skin that was not enjoying the fact that I was having difficulty figuring out what to do with it, because it became that way out of no where. I have had to completely change my skin care regime, because my normal routine suddenly stopped working...badly. I tried multiple serums, moisturizers, etc. This face wash along with the other two products I have reviewed were the only things that saved me from scratching my skin raw. It definitely doesn&#x27;t hurt that my skin looks amazing too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, in conjunction with having very sensitive skin, I also have rheumatoid arthritis, which is an inflammatory disorder that I am on multiple medications for and my skin is extremely picky about what I can use on it. This skin cleanser is a life saver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered with acne since I was 12 years old. Thanks to genetics, I was &amp;#34;blessed&amp;#34; with extremely sensitive skin of the combination type. Anyone with that type of skin knows how awful it is, like being stuck between a rock and a hard place. Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried countless products: Neutrogena, ProActiv, AcneFree...you name it. Never worked. The products were either too weak and did nothing to rid my skin of the oil or too strong and make my skin as dry as 80-grit sandpaper. Breakouts were consistent; they happened every month, specifically right before and/or during my period. Eventually, at 18 years old, I finally realized that my acne was hormonal, and compared with my skin type, I&#x27;d need prescription stuff to get rid of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My doctor prescribed me Epiduo along with a birth control pill to regulate my hormones. It began to work, but my skin was drier than the Sahara! Normal facial lotions didn&#x27;t help and I was miserable...and then I found Cetaphil at my local drugstore. I decided to give it a shot, and it made a huge difference. The gentle cleanser along with the facial moisturizer for extremely dry skin worked like a charm to make my face feel &#x27;normal&#x27; again. It took time for the pill/Epiduo/Cetaphil regimen to fully work, about 3-4 months, but my face finally cleared up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, I have gone on and off that regimen, and every time I did, the breakouts returned with a vengeance. I realize now that it&#x27;s the ONLY thing that works for me, and the Cetaphil line is the only one I can use on my skin that works without any issues. Truly a wonderful product! I&#x27;ve now since upgraded to the daily facial cleanser and moisturizer, and I&#x27;m still mostly clear. Still get a pimple or two every now and then, but they clear up quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;ve learned through my journey of sorts, it&#x27;s that everyone is different and no one product will work for all people, as frustrating as that can be. However, I can say that ifyou have sensitive skin and need products that won&#x27;t irritate it further, Cetaphil is a viable option to try. One more thing to note: I use the CVS generic version of Cetaphil; works the same and costs less.</li>
            <li> Great seller will buy again</li>
            <li> I have pretty bad adult acne. This works better than any other cleanser I have used. I have tried Clean and Clear, Clearasil, Noxema, Neutrogena, all of them. I would wash my face 2 times a day. They just seemed to irritate my skin and didn&#x27;t help my acne at all. Since using this for about 2 or 3 weeks, I see a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has cleared up so much. It&#x27;s not perfect, but the zits I do have aren&#x27;t as red and are much smaller. I don&#x27;t feel so gross anymore. I use this two to three times a day along with an AcneFree Severe spot treatment. I really only need the AcneFree once or twice a week. The Cetaphil has a pleasant smell, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and the best part is my skin feels very clean after I use it. It even removes my eye makeup so I don&#x27;t need makeup removing cloths anymore. I would HIGHLY recommend this to anybody. High quality product! I will never waste my money on a different cleanser. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> El producto me llego en buen estado, estoy satisfecho con la compra lo recomiendo 100% no tengo quejas,&lt;br /&gt;Muchas gracias por el servicio.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil products are always recommended by dermatologist, why?  Because it works.  Love it</li>
            <li> This product works pretty good. Recommend it for any women who are pregnant and having acne problems</li>
