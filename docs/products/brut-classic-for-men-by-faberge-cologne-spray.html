            <li>I have always liked Brut.</li>
            <li>nice addition to any one&#x27;s cologne collection..</li>
            <li>It was great to see how excited he was.</li>
            <li>The price is worth having this timeless scent linger for longer!!!</li>
            <li>Nice fresh bright scent that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Hopefully he will just be happy seeing the good old \\&quot;glass and chain\\&quot; bottle.</li>
            <li>A very masculine barber shop type scent; this Brut was a very good price.</li>
            <li>Better than the off the drugstore shelf stuff.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s history features many celebrities of the 60&#x27;s when this cologne was king.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite</li>
            <li>I love the smell of Brut.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>If you like BRUT deodorant body spray then this is a more potent version in the form of cologne.  </li>
            <li>I HAVE TO SAY I LOVE BRUT</li>
            <li>i really like it and the size is great.</li>
            <li>The product has all ways been a favorite of mine.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with it</li>
            <li>and it certinly does smell better than the stuff you get in the plastic bottle.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad they did not try to change anything.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;smelt is just okay, but i wont order again.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great and is a very affordable price.</li>
            <li>I love when my husband wears this stuff.</li>
            <li>so this is the next best thing.</li>
            <li>the decoration on the bottle makes it look special and nice as a gift.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved this since my first boyfriend when I was 13.</li>
            <li>, it has a unique and a refreshing smell, and best of all it does not linger around too long.</li>
            <li>Very good smell and last till the shirt is washed.</li>
            <li>If you enjoy the lighter Brut aftershave, then you will LOVE this gem.</li>
            <li>It is not as strong and the Brut Cologne they offer in the plastic splash bottles.</li>
            <li>This one is too strong for me.</li>
            <li>Smell is strong for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In Korea, there is no such great products.</li>
            <li>Do not buy if you ever loved the old stuff</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;d highly recommend this cologne if you have ever liked the aftershave.</li>
            <li>Says that the fragrance doesn&#x27;t match the original Brut.</li>
            <li>Not even close to original brut.</li>
            <li>I thought I was ordering the original Brut Cologne,  it is not the bottle I received</li>
            <li>when you order this if you are trying to order the original brute cologne this is not it.  </li>
            <li>Yes, the fragrance is nothing like the original.</li>
            <li>Use this many years ago...re-discovered it...love the smell and very affordable...</li>
            <li>He doesn&#x27;t even like cologne but keeps this stuff around because I love it so much.</li>
            <li>You are most likely paying a bit more for the glass bottle and the sprayer instead of the plastic splash bottle.</li>
            <li>Enjoy this fragrance very much and have been using it for years</li>
            <li>They need to make more new men&#x27;s colognes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a hot-shot designer fragrance, but it&#x27;s been around for decades and has held it&#x27;s own against numerous upstarts.  </li>
            <li>The price is right.  </li>
            <li>They seem to have gotten something right with this one.</li>
            <li>Brut is from long ago and is inexpensive but let&#x27;s just say, it holds its own.</li>
            <li>Brut is still a timeless classic and this spray version is the closest to the original from the 70&#x27;s that I have found.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive by today&#x27;s standards but same nice product.</li>
            <li>It was my favorite cologne back then.  </li>
            <li>I have used Brut after-shave when I was younger, and I have not used any after shave for many years.  </li>
            <li>WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT A REAL CLASSIC??</li>
            <li>Pretty bottle</li>
            <li>I use it consistently and never tire of the fragrance.</li>
            <li>This product smells great and is very long lasting...</li>
            <li>This is the classic, fresh fragrance you remember.  </li>
            <li>Have always liked Brut for its strong yet subtle (??)</li>
            <li>It was potent and lasted a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smell goes away kind of fast but other than that, I like it.</li>
            <li>Sprayer leaks a little but love the smell!</li>
            <li>a classically male fragrance, easily purchased from this seller.  </li>
            <li>I had this cologne when I was younger and forgot how strong a scent it has.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe it smells exactly like it did when I was in high school</li>
            <li>It is the real thing, let me tell you...</li>
            <li>Fast Ship Time, Item just as described.  </li>
            <li>but it smells very close.</li>
            <li>My daughters don&#x27;t really know the name...</li>
            <li>I prefer the real stuff to the off brand... and don&#x27;t want the after shave.  </li>
            <li>gift will be appreciated by my brother.</li>
            <li>I would have given this 2 stars really but refrained out of respect of \\&quot;Brut\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>fast delivery</li>
            <li>he hints all the time that he wants another one</li>
            <li>So I would recommend this version to anyone that is looking for the original and not the one in your local store.</li>
            <li>is special reserve  while it smells a little like the original it is not</li>
            <li>I was surprised that all the paint work on bottle was coming off the first time I touched it.</li>
            <li>Brut Classic smells stronger and deeper than the Brut in the plastic bottles.  </li>
            <li>Brut Cologne by Faberge is a classic fragrance that should not be ignored.</li>
            <li>IT BRINGS BACK OF WHEN I FIRST USED IT IN THE 1960&#x27;S. FIRST DATES I HAD FORGOTTEN--</li>
            <li>received my bottle of the Classic Brut an hour ago.</li>
            <li>Classic old Brut look and feel and smell.</li>
            <li>The middle and especially the ending notes do remind me of the original Brut.</li>
            <li>Its the new product in old stlye bottle.</li>
            <li>From the word &#x27;Classic&#x27;, I expected it to be same stregth as the original, it is not.</li>
            <li>Either amazon sent me a stale bottle (as if it matters) or it is popular in certain type of people :</li>
            <li>Just like I remember it when I was a young man.  </li>
            <li>It will remind him of the old days.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li>I am using Brut products since I was young</li>
            <li>The cologne version simply takes the classic barbershop Brut smell and solidifies it.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>I ONLY TOOK ONE STAR AWAY BECAUSE THIS SPECIAL VERSION SMELLS IDENTICLE TO THE DRUG STORE EVERYDAY VERSION.</li>
            <li>Not that it is better or worse but it does bring back memories of those days.  </li>
            <li>At age 60 I have tried other products but for me this is CLASSIC.</li>
            <li>Gifted half a dozen of them to my dad since he is a big fan of Brut, unfortunately he didnt like it so much.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is the real deal</li>
            <li> It is long lasting and has a peculiar fragrance.</li>
            <li> Have received several compliments; In my opinion, the fragrance tends to stay longer than most of the other designer perfumes/colognes (compared to Gucci Guilty).</li>
            <li> I will buy it again as long as it&#x27;s available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li> but as I have aged nothing seems as it did back then.  </li>
            <li> I miss the bar soap that has disappeared from shelves over the last few years</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> (They generally shy away from any personal product I use, assuming it must be old</li>
            <li> I COULD DESCRIBE THE SCENT, WHICH IS REALLY SPECIAL, BUT IT&#x27;S IMPOSSIBLE TO CONVEY THE MEMORIES</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s watered down</li>
            <li> As eager as I was to finally spray it and turn my nostalgia-mode on, I was due for utter disappointment.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I usually spray a little on the shirt I am wearing that day.</li>
            <li> If you like cologne, you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> I came across this one quite by accident at Amazon, and based on my past experience with Brut, I ordered it immediately.  </li>
            <li> Well this was my first time trying Brut and I am disappointed with how it smells.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine who lives in the Czech Republic received a bottle as a gift years ago and has been nursing it ever since, afraid to run out and have none left.</li>
            <li> even if it&#x27;s a blast from the past!</li>
            <li> stuff is weak and lasts three minutes.  </li>
            <li> but it is missing at least a few base notes from the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This cologne is very subtle yet manly.</li>
            <li> With this you can not go wrong with the ladies.</li>
            <li> having the cologne for couple of days I gotta admit - it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
            <li> The smell of this stuff makes me sick.</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> Disappointed!!</li>

            <li> Better than the off the drugstore shelf stuff.  Brut Classic smells stronger and deeper than the Brut in the plastic bottles.  I&#x27;m tempted to get the 25.6 ounce bottle too!!  Recommended.</li>
            <li> Classic old Brut look and feel and smell.</li>
            <li> Brut Cologne by Faberge is a classic fragrance that should not be ignored. It&#x27;s history features many celebrities of the 60&#x27;s when this cologne was king. It&#x27;s not my favorite but I tend to put it in rotation every once in a while. I gave this version 4/5 because it smells identical to the plastic bottle version that you can get at any box box/drugstore for cheaper. You are most likely paying a bit more for the glass bottle and the sprayer instead of the plastic splash bottle. What I plan on doing is when this runs out, buying a bottle of the plastic stuff and pouring it in for use.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my brother in law who is using it for dozens of years.&lt;br /&gt; He loves it &amp; refuses to change it.</li>
            <li> Just like I remember it when I was a young man.  It was my favorite cologne back then.  Very inexpensive by today&#x27;s standards but same nice product.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> I have been all over to find this cologne &lt; spray version &gt; and i found it,, it is a very good product... In the store all you find is the splash on stuff, i like the aersol stuff... It is the real thing, let me tell you... Good stuff ..</li>
            <li> This cologne is very subtle yet manly. I like the fact that it is not at all over-powering yet makes is presence known. Would buy again..</li>
            <li> Sprayer leaks a little but love the smell!</li>
            <li> Fast Ship Time, Item just as described.  Great seller.  Very happy with purchase</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Brut.  This product smells great and is very long lasting... You will be very pleased with this product</li>
            <li> I have used Brut after-shave when I was younger, and I have not used any after shave for many years.  I came across this one quite by accident at Amazon, and based on my past experience with Brut, I ordered it immediately.  I was very pleased (and so was my wife.)  Even my sons liked  it, which I consider to be quite amazing.  (They generally shy away from any personal product I use, assuming it must be old-fashioned.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a shot, it has a unique and a refreshing smell, and best of all it does not linger around too long.</li>
            <li> Its the new product in old stlye bottle. The product is no different than &#x27;splash on&#x27; strength. From the word &#x27;Classic&#x27;, I expected it to be same stregth as the original, it is not.</li>
            <li> This is just not the stuff I used thirty years ago. The smell of this stuff makes me sick. Do not buy if you ever loved the old stuff</li>
            <li> I have always liked Brut.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for a friend.&lt;br /&gt;He&#x27;s used Brute for years and does not plan to change.&lt;br /&gt;He enjoys the fragrance..</li>
            <li> My husband loves brut. It is long lasting and has a peculiar fragrance. I am not a big fan of brut but he is.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I don&#x27;t believe it smells exactly like it did when I was in high school :)  but it smells very close.</li>
            <li> I have wearing BRUT for 40-45 years.  My daughters don&#x27;t really know the name... they just say &amp;#34;it smell like DAD&amp;#34;.  I prefer the real stuff to the off brand... and don&#x27;t want the after shave.  At age 60 I have tried other products but for me this is CLASSIC.</li>
            <li> Just as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;The gift will be appreciated by my brother. It will remind him of the old days.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> Good use. To be used as a perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The repurchase will be taking on after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Korea, there is no such great products.</li>
            <li> If you like BRUT deodorant body spray then this is a more potent version in the form of cologne.  Nice fresh bright scent that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I HAVE TO SAY I LOVE BRUT IT SMELLS LIKE A MAN SHOULD. YOU SPRAY IT ON AND IT PUNCHES YOUR FACE AND TELLS IT TO &amp;#34;ACT LIKE A MAN&amp;#34;. I ONLY TOOK ONE STAR AWAY BECAUSE THIS SPECIAL VERSION SMELLS IDENTICLE TO THE DRUG STORE EVERYDAY VERSION.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the spray bottle. Can&#x27;t find it anywhere. It is not as strong and the Brut Cologne they offer in the plastic splash bottles. I usually spray a little on the shirt I am wearing that day. And to my over coats. I will buy it again as long as it&#x27;s available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast reliable shipping and I recommend the product and seller.</li>
            <li> WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT A REAL CLASSIC?? I COULD DESCRIBE THE SCENT, WHICH IS REALLY SPECIAL, BUT IT&#x27;S IMPOSSIBLE TO CONVEY THE MEMORIES IT BRINGS BACK OF WHEN I FIRST USED IT IN THE 1960&#x27;S. FIRST DATES I HAD FORGOTTEN--PLACES I WENT--THE PEOPLE I WAS WITH; THEY&#x27;RE ALL IN THE BRUT BOTTLE!</li>
            <li> it smells great on my man like heaven. i really like it and the size is great. the decoration on the bottle makes it look special and nice as a gift.</li>
            <li> Have always liked Brut for its strong yet subtle (??) fragrance. Have received several compliments; In my opinion, the fragrance tends to stay longer than most of the other designer perfumes/colognes (compared to Gucci Guilty).</li>
            <li> If you enjoy the lighter Brut aftershave, then you will LOVE this gem. The cologne version simply takes the classic barbershop Brut smell and solidifies it. This cologne is just a somewhat stronger and longer lasting version of the aftershave. So, I&#x27;d highly recommend this cologne if you have ever liked the aftershave. The price is worth having this timeless scent linger for longer!!! Cheers.</li>
            <li> after it was redelived no problimspity it wasnt the same with allthe products i brought</li>
            <li> I used Faberge Brut in the 1960&#x27;s.  It was potent and lasted a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is weak and lasts three minutes.  The scent is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle says Idelle labs on the back.  This is not Faberge Brut from the 1960&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This is the classic, fresh fragrance you remember.  The price is right.  If you like cologne, you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this fresh scent.  It isn&#x27;t overpowering and it lasts.</li>
            <li> What can I say? I&#x27;ve loved this since my first boyfriend when I was 13. Smells awesome. Pretty bottle</li>
            <li> Brut  -  after shave thats been used by me for years. The product has all ways been a favorite of mine.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my youngest, it still smells great to me- even if it&#x27;s a blast from the past! He wears it every day too!</li>
            <li> Terrible. I&#x27;m ashamed to give it away. A skunk might find this odor to his taste. Maybe Pepy Le Phoooo.</li>
            <li> Gifted half a dozen of them to my dad since he is a big fan of Brut, unfortunately he didnt like it so much. Says that the fragrance doesn&#x27;t match the original Brut. Disappointed!!</li>
            <li> When I got this from delivery, it was all leaking. I was surprised that all the paint work on bottle was coming off the first time I touched it. So pissed off with this. Not even close to original brut.</li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering the original Brut Cologne,  it is not the bottle I received is special reserve  while it smells a little like the original it is not,  I went to my orders to try to return it but it is not returnable.  SO BEWARE  when you order this if you are trying to order the original brute cologne this is not it.  I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Some say it doesn&#x27;t smell like the stuff from back in the 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s but as I have aged nothing seems as it did back then.  Not that it is better or worse but it does bring back memories of those days.  I am pleased with it and it certinly does smell better than the stuff you get in the plastic bottle.  Smell goes away kind of fast but other than that, I like it.</li>
            <li> This one is too strong for me. They need to make more new men&#x27;s colognes. Smell is strong for me.</li>
            <li> Well this was my first time trying Brut and I am disappointed with how it smells. Either amazon sent me a stale bottle (as if it matters) or it is popular in certain type of people :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not like the perfume.</li>
            <li> Not even closer! I would have given this 2 stars really but refrained out of respect of \\&quot;Brut\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;I received my bottle of the Classic Brut an hour ago. As eager as I was to finally spray it and turn my nostalgia-mode on, I was due for utter disappointment. Yes, the fragrance is nothing like the original. I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s watered down but it is missing at least a few base notes from the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a gift for my dad (he doesn&#x27;t give two hoots about the designer schtuff). Hopefully he will just be happy seeing the good old \\&quot;glass and chain\\&quot; bottle. Me, not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#### UPDATE 11th May ####&lt;br /&gt;Okk.. having the cologne for couple of days I gotta admit - it&#x27;s not that bad. The middle and especially the ending notes do remind me of the original Brut. Mmmmm! Can&#x27;t help not upgrading to 4 stars ^_^&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: Yep, my dad is digging it!</li>
            <li> Enjoy this fragrance very much and have been using it for years</li>
            <li> I would stay away from this product -  this&lt;br /&gt;is not Brut quality or Brut has gone&lt;br /&gt;downhill. I will never buy this again.</li>
            <li> Use this many years ago...re-discovered it...love the smell and very affordable...nice addition to any one&#x27;s cologne collection..good price online...fast delivery</li>
            <li> Smells great and got a good deal on it. With this you can not go wrong with the ladies. Next time I might get a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> This was so perfect. A friend of mine who lives in the Czech Republic received a bottle as a gift years ago and has been nursing it ever since, afraid to run out and have none left. So I checked on Amazon and low and behold, there is was. I ordered 5 bottles so he will be set for life!  It was great to see how excited he was. It is still the best fragrance that Brut has had for years.  I am so glad they did not try to change anything. Even the bottle with the medallion remains the same.</li>
            <li> Brut By Faberge Co., 3-Ounce&lt;br /&gt;smelt is just okay, but i wont order again. I would not recommend to anyone about this&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> Great cologne, love it but wish the price was a bit cheaper tho more like $10 or 11 not any more!</li>
            <li> Always been a fan of Brut cologne and aftershave.  It&#x27;s not a hot-shot designer fragrance, but it&#x27;s been around for decades and has held it&#x27;s own against numerous upstarts.  I use it consistently and never tire of the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I bought it  for myself. Very good smell and last till the shirt is washed.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and is a very affordable price. I love when my husband wears this stuff. He doesn&#x27;t even like cologne but keeps this stuff around because I love it so much.</li>
            <li> Brut is still a timeless classic and this spray version is the closest to the original from the 70&#x27;s that I have found. They seem to have gotten something right with this one. So I would recommend this version to anyone that is looking for the original and not the one in your local store.</li>
            <li> A very masculine barber shop type scent; this Brut was a very good price. I miss the bar soap that has disappeared from shelves over the last few years so this is the next best thing.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the scent  - I&#x27;m in!</li>
            <li> I have used it for years. However, this does not seem to have the same fragrance as ones in local store. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I had this cologne when I was younger and forgot how strong a scent it has.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a classically male fragrance, easily purchased from this seller.  Brut is from long ago and is inexpensive but let&#x27;s just say, it holds its own.</li>
            <li> I am using Brut products since I was young</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend he loves it he hints all the time that he wants another one so I have to get  another one for him because I can&#x27;t find it in store</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is the real deal but it smelt good</li>
