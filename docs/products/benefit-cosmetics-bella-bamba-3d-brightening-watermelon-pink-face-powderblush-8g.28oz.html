            <li>We&lt;br /&gt;have been able to count on this line for offering top-notch quality in colors &amp; creams.</li>
            <li>like blushes of all colors, but not anything too bright.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bright pinkish/orange with a sparkly gold shimmer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved bella bamba.</li>
            <li>and I received it very quickly!!</li>
            <li>I also love Coaralista and Dallas but they are all great.</li>
            <li>The Bella Bamba shade is the perfect blend of pinks and a golden hue.</li>
            <li>, so I&#x27;m not sold on the amplification of my cheekbones and a more sculpted look to my face, but this is a great color that I do plan to buy again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall...Love it and will buy more!</li>
            <li>I love this brand!</li>
            <li>It also has a nice fruity (strawberries + cherry?)</li>
            <li>It has a nice fragrance, too.</li>
            <li>pat w/ warm hands...</li>
            <li>I love this brand and it&#x27;s also good for your skin.</li>
            <li>Try the High beam and lip tints too they are all awesome!</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;And the box is very very cute, i love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>These products from Benefit are top notch gorgeous shades that amazingly work on most everyone.</li>
            <li>I love Bella Bomba</li>
            <li>so I love putting it on.</li>
            <li>Love it buying more blushes from benefit</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s consider one of the better lines of cosmetics being offered.  </li>
            <li>and I think “watermelon” is more appropriate.  </li>
            <li>you get a really lovely glow on your cheeks.  </li>
            <li>and I still love this product</li>
            <li>and it gives me a healthy and youthful blush when I put it on.</li>
            <li>The Bella Bamba blush gives me beautiful, shimmery pink cheeks that I love!</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of nars orgasm blush, but I like this better.  </li>
            <li>This is my first Benefit purchase and it has already become my favorite blush!  </li>
            <li>You really get a gorgeous glow with a light application.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty color and the sparkliness is nice without being overdone, but</li>
            <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t get the whole “dimensional” thing.</li>
            <li>On the side note, I noticed that it does have a light fragrance in the blush powder</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not overbearing and the scent is a light floral scent.</li>
            <li>LOVE This blush and its much cheaper here then in the stores plus bonus no tax and free S&amp;H on Prime!</li>
            <li>It adds a nice flush to my cheeks without being too bright on my pale skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I never thought a blush good make such a difference on your face...</li>
            <li>, It has the smell, packaging and quality of a true benefit product.</li>
            <li>color is pinkish, and it is does come on pretty strong.</li>
            <li>Not anything like the wonderful subtle colors of Benefit products everyone raves about.</li>
            <li>I love this blush and was so sad that it has been discontinued but was very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It really is very pretty.  </li>
            <li>I love Benefit boxed powders, and the new Bella Bamba is no exception.     </li>
            <li>I just love it, it matches my natural blush very nicely and I only have to apply a tiny bit to get a lovely glow.</li>
            <li>The brush that comes with it is super soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The powder goes on very silky and with a light application with the provided half-moon brush</li>
            <li>, just right.  </li>
            <li>I love this blush, i have Coralista, Hooola - the tanning powder one, and a few more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to open and it does have a clean protective covering between the blush powder and the brush.</li>
            <li>I am totally planning on buying more Benefit blushes because this one is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>- Benefit boxed powders are usually scented, and this one has a nice light fruity smell.  </li>
            <li>- If you live on the East Coast, it is a better idea to buy your Benefit products from Amazon, they ship much faster than ordering directly from the Benefit website (which ships from California)</li>
            <li>This stayed on all day long and has an interesting glow.  </li>
            <li>The color can be intense when you first look at it</li>
            <li>Love it and it really warms up my face in these long winter months.</li>
            <li>I love all Benefit products, however I am especially fond of this new shade of blush.</li>
            <li>You will have a fresh, gorgeous pink glow all day long with Bella Bamba!    </li>
            <li>I have a medium somewhat reddish toned complexion and I can wear every color they make very well.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li>(Too much shimmer</li>
            <li>The seller sold this at a reasonable price unlike a lot of sellers on here who take advantage of discontinued items and price gouge.</li>
            <li>Received it fast and in tact.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s set/stays whole day.  </li>
            <li>A highly rated product that really lives up to its name.  </li>
            <li>, I usually use my own makeup brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The little blush brush included is just ok</li>
            <li>I like the color (although a little more orange than I was expecting).  </li>
            <li>The pink is slightly less pink than in the picture and has a nice golden sheen to it, it smells very feminine and sweet but not overly so.</li>
            <li>Normally, I don&#x27;t go for makeup that have fragrances in them</li>
            <li>If you lkike this color but a more subtle blush try Coralista-&lt;br /&gt;Coralista for day time, and this one for night time, or just apply it very gently.</li>
            <li>-New packaging allows for magnetic closure, and a mirror in the box.    </li>
            <li>(This is definitely the most I&#x27;ve spent on blush ever.  </li>
            <li>Despite the smaller size, you are getting a very high quality product, and because of the pigmentation, you don&#x27;t need a lot of product to get the job done.</li>
            <li>love the color and its very pigmented and you dont need alot on, a little goes a long way!!!  </li>
            <li>go lite for natural glow...heavier for evenings.  </li>
            <li>but I was surprised with this one</li>
            <li>The gold shimmer is nice and subtle enough that I&#x27;ll use this blush year-round.</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s barely a dent in it...</li>
            <li>This product is a very 3-D pink that illuminates your entire face.</li>
            <li>the color goes on a subtle pinky water mellon with a soft golden sheen</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Buy through Amazon shipped from Benefit or direct from Benefit you won&#x27;t be disappointed their products keep us girls coming back for more again and again!</li>
            <li> but it is too small for me, so I don&#x27;t really care for it.</li>
            <li> The size of this boxed powder is smaller than any of the other Benefit boxed powders currently out on the market, but you are paying the same price for it.    </li>
            <li> it will probably last me a long long time.</li>
            <li> I recently tried Bella Bamba 3D brightening pink face powder.  </li>
            <li> Now I have loose powder and not pressed powder.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this blush and if you want a deeper saturated color a kabuki brush or a flat blush brush will do the trick.</li>
            <li> I also like that you only need to use a little bit and it stays on all day.</li>
            <li> so you only need a little bit on the brush.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d restrict it to summer use when I don&#x27;t mind a little extra shimmer and shine.)</li>
            <li> Not too pink, not too shimmery</li>
            <li> BeneFit refers to it as both “pink” and “watermelon”</li>
            <li> A little bit of this blush goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried about authenticity when I read other reviews</li>
            <li> Natural pink shade brightens with out looking fake.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time money and the aggravation buying fakes on ebay.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try and save money by buying Benefit products on Ebay especially if you are not familiar with this product and won&#x27;t know if you got a fake.</li>
            <li> and it was not the real deal, it had a horrible bubblegum color and actually had flecks of glitter in it!</li>
            <li> I need something that&#x27;s subtle and stands out a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not good ihated it</li>
            <li> not good not</li>
            <li> Believe me 99% of the stuff on ebay is fake including this product</li>
            <li> wrong color too bad</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad that benefit discontinued this product.</li>
            <li> bad color bad color chaky</li>

            <li> This is a great blush.  I am a huge fan of nars orgasm blush, but I like this better.  Not too pink, not too shimmery, just right.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I love this blush, i have Coralista, Hooola - the tanning powder one, and a few more. This one is great!&lt;br /&gt;The box is the best part because if you drop your blush sometimes it can break but this box secures it.&lt;br /&gt;And the box is very very cute, i love it!&lt;br /&gt;The color is pinkish, and it is does come on pretty strong. If you lkike this color but a more subtle blush try Coralista-&lt;br /&gt;Coralista for day time, and this one for night time, or just apply it very gently.</li>
            <li> I love Bella Bomba the color goes on a subtle pinky water mellon with a soft golden sheen very nice blush blends in beautifully!

            <li> Perfect color!! brightens the cheeks!</li>
            <li> Pros: A little bit of this blush goes a long way! The Bella Bamba blush gives me beautiful, shimmery pink cheeks that I love! It also has a nice fruity (strawberries + cherry?) smell to it so I love putting it on. I&#x27;ve had it since Christmas and there&#x27;s barely a dent in it...it will probably last me a long long time. I am totally planning on buying more Benefit blushes because this one is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: There is a mirror in the box but it is too small for me, so I don&#x27;t really care for it. The little blush brush included is just ok, I usually use my own makeup brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall...Love it and will buy more!</li>
            <li> I love all Benefit products, however I am especially fond of this new shade of blush. The Bella Bamba shade is the perfect blend of pinks and a golden hue. Love it and it really warms up my face in these long winter months. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Both boxes had contents totally crumbled inside. Now I have loose powder and not pressed powder.  Need to figure this one out or get credit.</li>
            <li> My sister was visiting and I ran out of blush so I used hers.  I loved it!!  (This is definitely the most I&#x27;ve spent on blush ever.  This stayed on all day long and has an interesting glow.  It really is very pretty.  I never thought a blush good make such a difference on your face...but this one does!</li>
            <li> I like the color (although a little more orange than I was expecting).  I also like that you only need to use a little bit and it stays on all day.</li>
            <li> I love this brand! The blush stays on all day and is the perfect color for my skin tone. Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> This shade will look great on almost anyone.  Natural pink shade brightens with out looking fake.  It&#x27;s packed with pigment so you only need a little bit on the brush.  I wear it on my eyelids too!</li>
            <li> I love Benefit boxed powders, and the new Bella Bamba is no exception.     PROS  -This product is so pigmented. You really get a gorgeous glow with a light application.  - Benefit boxed powders are usually scented, and this one has a nice light fruity smell.  -New packaging allows for magnetic closure, and a mirror in the box.    CONS  - The size of this boxed powder is smaller than any of the other Benefit boxed powders currently out on the market, but you are paying the same price for it.    Overall, the pros of this product definitely overcome the cons. Despite the smaller size, you are getting a very high quality product, and because of the pigmentation, you don&#x27;t need a lot of product to get the job done. You will have a fresh, gorgeous pink glow all day long with Bella Bamba!    *P.S. - If you live on the East Coast, it is a better idea to buy your Benefit products from Amazon, they ship much faster than ordering directly from the Benefit website (which ships from California)*</li>
            <li> love the color and its very pigmented and you dont need alot on, a little goes a long way!!!  Love it buying more blushes from benefit i&#x27;m obessed with thier blushes now...recommend it..go get you one...xoxo</li>
            <li> This product is a very 3-D pink that illuminates your entire face. Every time I wear this shade I get instant compliments.</li>
            <li> not good ihated it bad color bad color chaky wrong color too bad i hd to try it and be stuck with it not good not</li>
            <li> The pink is slightly less pink than in the picture and has a nice golden sheen to it, it smells very feminine and sweet but not overly so. I just love it, it matches my natural blush very nicely and I only have to apply a tiny bit to get a lovely glow. I was a bit worried about authenticity when I read other reviews but I was happily relieved when I got the blush, It has the smell, packaging and quality of a true benefit product.</li>
            <li> A highly rated product that really lives up to its name.  It&#x27;s consider one of the better lines of cosmetics being offered.  We&lt;br /&gt;have been able to count on this line for offering top-notch quality in colors &amp; creams.</li>
            <li> I recently tried Bella Bamba 3D brightening pink face powder.  It adds a nice flush to my cheeks without being too bright on my pale skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like blushes of all colors, but not anything too bright. I need something that&#x27;s subtle and stands out a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bella Bamba is a pressed powder. BeneFit refers to it as both “pink” and “watermelon” and I think “watermelon” is more appropriate.  It&#x27;s a bright pinkish/orange with a sparkly gold shimmer.  It has a nice fragrance, too. Fruity. Dare I say...melony?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benefit suggests that you “sweep on the apples of your cheeks &amp; dot at the hairline for a total thrill of dimensional color.” I do sweep, but I don&#x27;t dot. Honestly, I don&#x27;t get the whole “dimensional” thing. It&#x27;s a pretty color and the sparkliness is nice without being overdone, but 3D? I don&#x27;t even know what that means!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so I&#x27;m not sold on the amplification of my cheekbones and a more sculpted look to my face, but this is a great color that I do plan to buy again. The gold shimmer is nice and subtle enough that I&#x27;ll use this blush year-round. (Too much shimmer and I&#x27;d restrict it to summer use when I don&#x27;t mind a little extra shimmer and shine.)</li>
            <li> I love this blush and was so sad that it has been discontinued but was very happy with my purchase. The seller sold this at a reasonable price unlike a lot of sellers on here who take advantage of discontinued items and price gouge. Received it fast and in tact.</li>
            <li> This is my first Benefit purchase and it has already become my favorite blush!  The powder goes on very silky and with a light application with the provided half-moon brush you get a really lovely glow on your cheeks.  A little goes a long way with this blush and if you want a deeper saturated color a kabuki brush or a flat blush brush will do the trick.</li>
            <li> Perfect cheek colour:  go lite for natural glow...heavier for evenings.  I apply, pat w/ warm hands...it&#x27;s set/stays whole day.  Great price from this vendor.</li>
            <li> I love this brand and it&#x27;s also good for your skin. The color can be intense when you first look at it but it&#x27;s not. This product allows you to have build-able coverage on your cheeks and anywhere else you want to put this on. The brush that comes with it is super soft and easy to clean. It&#x27;s easy to open and it does have a clean protective covering between the blush powder and the brush. On the side note, I noticed that it does have a light fragrance in the blush powder but it&#x27;s not overbearing and the scent is a light floral scent. Normally, I don&#x27;t go for makeup that have fragrances in them but I was surprised with this one and I still love this product and it gives me a healthy and youthful blush when I put it on.</li>
