            <li>Great, affordable conditioner.</li>
            <li>And the smell is very nice also.</li>
            <li>It is also VERY GOOD for making your hands feel smooth as i found out while i was cleaning up over 1/2 of the bottle that leaked out all over everything else that i ordered!</li>
            <li>feels good, smells good and Works</li>
            <li>This, however, is a good thing if you are trying to get tangles out.  </li>
            <li>I gave this conditioner 5 stars because it has a good scent and conditions well.  </li>
            <li>Smells really good</li>
            <li>My hair felt gorgeous in the shower after using it.</li>
            <li>Price and quality wise</li>
            <li>This conditioner is just amazing.</li>
            <li>Even my husband likes this and that is amazing.</li>
            <li>but it takes out tangles and smells nice.</li>
            <li>But nothing on bottom &amp; items could still shake  around very easily.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and beautiful!</li>
            <li>have this under my subscription list making sure I get this every month</li>
            <li>well expend, will buy more and more, the more the better</li>
            <li>There WAS air bags on top</li>
            <li>/&gt;Only more time will tell if I keep using this; I think there&#x27;s a better than 50% chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>B001KYQQ8U Suave for Kids Kids 3-in-1 Shampoo, Conditioner &amp; Body Wash, Wacky Melon 22.5 fl oz (665 ml)]] and [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the fruity smell of this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and feel of his conditioner.</li>
            <li>it being summer, I love to swim in the pool, but that dries out my hair, even with a swim cap.</li>
            <li>Shiney, smooth and bouncy!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Unlike the shampoo for me the conditioner is pretty good.</li>
            <li>Just like it&#x27;s important to have a large number of forces in your army, so true is it with one&#x27;s hair, that the more volume you have, the more beautiful you look.</li>
            <li>tangles easily &amp; gets static in it, and this product seems to help a lot.  </li>
            <li>And its pretty good price when i bought it plus free shipping when i bought.</li>
            <li>Smells great and leaves my dry hair nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Just like my marines have to keep their bodiesin shape, Garnier keeps the strands of hair strong, and the ends un-split.</li>
            <li>B002CMLS28 Aveda Smooth Infusion Conditioner, 6.7-Ounce Tube]]</li>
            <li>And I make my hair feel smooth.</li>
            <li>I used it in the past &amp; it is great!</li>
            <li>Super sleek and smooth.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great deal, &amp; Amazon lets you include it along with other products for free shipping.  </li>
            <li>The Detangler, Super Rich Conditioner, 16.9-ounce]]</li>
            <li>Low price good quality.</li>
            <li>super</li>
            <li>And i got it really quick....</li>
            <li>So far the best type of conditioners I have ever used, its easy with this nice soft scent but not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>but from where i live, it would cost more in gas money to drop off at USPS</li>
            <li>Sure, I played with G.I. Joes, Tonka trucks and so on, but if I ever wanted anyone to play WITH me, I&#x27;d have to tolerate tea parties with grilled cheese sandwich triangles, barbie dolls, Tiger Beat magazine and New Kids on the Block dance parties.</li>
            <li>First i give 5 stars for the conditioner!</li>
            <li>is worth every dollar</li>
            <li>This smelled great and felt nice, my hair was slick when wet, easy to comb.</li>
            <li>I was probably more familiar with the particulars of female adolescence than any boy my age would probably want.</li>
            <li>Based on reviews, I tried this along with the shampoo, and right away my hair was softer and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I can detangle with it, it has nice slip, it smells good and a little goes a long way with this conditioner.</li>
            <li>If you experienced the same problem, I&#x27;d suggest using Organix Argan Oil Shampoo in the pretty blue bottle.</li>
            <li>This has done wonders for my curls and it is gluten-free at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>As any military historian can tell you, your forces are only as good as the supporting foundation upon which they&#x27;re supported; likewise with your hair, it&#x27;s only as good as your roots and hair follicles with moisture and structure, a mission that Garnier Fructis accomplishes.</li>
            <li>There was no reason for it to say fragile either, just needed more protection).</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner, but we only received one of the two bottles.</li>
            <li>Call it reflexive behavior, but when I was of age, I joined the Marines, and developed a very illustrative career, rising up in the ranks, eventually becoming a Lieutenant Colonel.</li>
            <li>My peers would say I&#x27;ve been pivotal in the country&#x27;s role as a global peacekeeper, and in the development of the finest fighting forces civilization has ever seen.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Garnier Fructis&#x27; whole line of shampooing and conditioning products are OUT-STAND-ING, and I hope you carry on!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the first time I used it, I thought that maybe I used too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m certain Amazon would have replaced it</li>
            <li>partner with his curly hair really likes it as well.</li>
            <li>This conditioner works very well with my hair.  </li>
            <li>So I bought this conditioner because it was cheap and was really surprised how soft it made my hair.</li>
            <li>It is thick, smells good and works well.</li>
            <li>I grew up in a large family of girls; our family consisted of me, the youngest son, my four older sisters and my mom--dad ran off to join the circus when I was three.</li>
            <li>I have long, straight, fine hair.</li>
            <li>Decent price, decent conditioner!</li>
            <li>However, it does seem to build up on my scalp and it initially makes my hair feel oily instead of squeaky clean -- and I&#x27;m not fond of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have really long baby fine hair &amp; it</li>
            <li>I used it on my hair, let it sit for about 30 minutes, rinsed out and let it air dry my hair was silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I will definitely try out some more of these toiletry items out in the future.</li>
            <li>always high</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this conditioner,</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>When I come home from a hard day of managing forces in the Middle East Theatre of battle, I like to pour myself a glass of wine, put on some New Kids on the Block, make myself a grilled cheese sandwich, cut it into triangles, and take a nice hot shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Needless to say that had a very profound effect on my career choice.</li>
            <li>This stuff is NOT easy to clean off of things since it is so smooth &amp; it was a chore just cleaning off the other items i ordered (all shipped from Amazon).</li>
            <li>It leaves it feeling soft without any residue.  </li>
            <li>I had bought this for summer in hopes of de-frizzing my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>I usually straighten it, but the humidity turns it into a huge frizz</li>
            <li>and they all have dense, fine hair, all several inches past their</li>
            <li>and I could barely get a brush through it.  </li>
            <li>I have very thick hair and this product has allowed me to better maneuver my hair for styling or otherwise after my short.</li>

            <li> I have very thick hair and this product has allowed me to better maneuver my hair for styling or otherwise after my short.</li>
            <li> Thankfully my other items (besides shampoo) were all wrapped in clear bags so no damage from conditioner.</li>
            <li> I wound up wrapping my long hair up in a towel and scrubbing with soap and a poof to get rid of the slime on my skin.</li>
            <li> It was a lonely time to be the single male presence in that house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A trick I learned was to put conditioner on my dry hair before putting on the the swim cap.  </li>
            <li> hair feels so soft and in didnt get frizzy as usual.</li>
            <li> but that actually did less than the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I live in a very hot city and the humidity rules in here, so I was afraid my hair getting greasy after washing it (as it always do)but it didnt happened!</li>
            <li> I have a slight ombre and my ends were really dry.</li>
            <li> and it leave my hair so shiny and not feeling heavy -- I have long hair and it doesn&#x27;t leave the excess conditioner when I wash it off</li>
            <li> Reading the other review for this I would agree - there is some residue after rinsing.  </li>
            <li> I was almost pointless to even use, as it left my hair looking greasy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m super unhappy with it.</li>
            <li> I tried this stuff 3 or 4 times to see if I could make it work, but my hair and scalp kept getting worse, even if I only used a little bit and tried to keep it only on my hair and not scalp.</li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell would be second place, though definitely not as effective as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While it did control a small amount of frizz, it was overall, a waste of my time.</li>
            <li> After washing my hair, no matter how much I scrubbed or rinsed, my hair was left feeling dirty after it dried.</li>
            <li> Made my scalp itchy after a few uses and didn&#x27;t control my frizz or mosturize.</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel course and stiff.</li>
            <li> This conditioner stays in the hair and separates them with very little friction, basically allowing you to rinse out the tangles when you rinse out their hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> B0013UAPVK Johnson&#x27;s No More Tangles Spray Detangler, 10 Ounce (Pack of 2)]]  </li>
            <li> When it dried, oh boy!</li>
            <li> It has the same concept, but doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling dirty.</li>
            <li> I am guessing it is because the conditioner is so thick...</li>
            <li> Nothing is going to be 100% on thick hair in Florida with the humidity</li>
            <li> I was using very expensive salon conditioners and after washing my long hair, it felt like straw</li>
            <li> However, the reason it controls hair in humidity is because it leaves this nasty film too heavy for the heat to lift.</li>
            <li> The shampoo itself isn&#x27;t as bad as the conditioner, although it still felt slimy and I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> * When i took my eye-kit clutch (eye-shadow) out &amp; opened it, shadow went everywhere :(</li>
            <li> Absolutely disgusting.</li>

            <li> First i give 5 stars for the conditioner! I used it in the past &amp; it is great! It is also VERY GOOD for making your hands feel smooth as i found out while i was cleaning up over 1/2 of the bottle that leaked out all over everything else that i ordered! Box was bigger then it should have been for one. There WAS air bags on top But nothing on bottom &amp; items could still shake  around very easily. Since there was no air bags on bottom, during delivery or somewhere the box had to of been thrown or dropped (it did not say fragile so NOT USPS fault! There was no reason for it to say fragile either, just needed more protection). When i opened the box &amp; took out the 3 TINY air bags there was conditioner EVERYWHERE!!! This stuff is NOT easy to clean off of things since it is so smooth &amp; it was a chore just cleaning off the other items i ordered (all shipped from Amazon). My Garnier shampoo was intact &amp; not everywhere. My guess would be that MAYBE this is shipped by Air &amp; the pressure is what squeezed out over 1/2 the bottle of conditioner? Why not the shampoo...? I am guessing it is because the conditioner is so thick...I guess, no scientist here. Thankfully my other items (besides shampoo) were all wrapped in clear bags so no damage from conditioner. ****Now**** When i took my eye-kit clutch (eye-shadow) out &amp; opened it, shadow went everywhere :( NEVER had damaged items &amp; i don&#x27;t want to deal with having to ship back for low cost items) so... I ended up with 1/2 bottle of conditioner &amp; cleaned out the remaining chunks of eye-shadow &amp; gave it to daughter to play with. I&#x27;m certain Amazon would have replaced it but from where i live, it would cost more in gas money to drop off at USPS then i payed for it &amp; i have enough going on. So, There you have it!</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner, but we only received one of the two bottles. I haven&#x27;t taken the time to complain but save yourself the hassle and get something else.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is just amazing. feels good, smells good and Works super good!&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels so soft and in didnt get frizzy as usual. I live in a very hot city and the humidity rules in here, so I was afraid my hair getting greasy after washing it (as it always do)but it didnt happened! the Price worths it</li>
            <li> This has done wonders for my curls and it is gluten-free at a very reasonable price.  It also doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  However, it does seem to build up on my scalp and it initially makes my hair feel oily instead of squeaky clean -- and I&#x27;m not fond of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only more time will tell if I keep using this; I think there&#x27;s a better than 50% chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My partner with his curly hair really likes it as well.</li>
            <li> Reading the other review for this I would agree - there is some residue after rinsing.  This, however, is a good thing if you are trying to get tangles out.  We have 3 girls, 4, 6, and 9 and they all have dense, fine hair, all several inches past their shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve tried a number of conditioners and sprays including  [[ASIN:B0009OMNHU Paul Mitchell The Detangler, Super Rich Conditioner, 16.9-ounce]] and [[ASIN:B001KYQQ8U Suave for Kids Kids 3-in-1 Shampoo, Conditioner &amp; Body Wash, Wacky Melon 22.5 fl oz (665 ml)]] and [[ASIN:B001ESA2YG Jason Kids Only Daily Detangling, Conditioner, 8 Ounce]] and [[ASIN:B0013UAPVK Johnson&#x27;s No More Tangles Spray Detangler, 10 Ounce (Pack of 2)]]  We even tried my wife&#x27;s [[ASIN:B002CMLS28 Aveda Smooth Infusion Conditioner, 6.7-Ounce Tube]] but that actually did less than the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is best.  This conditioner stays in the hair and separates them with very little friction, basically allowing you to rinse out the tangles when you rinse out their hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Paul Mitchell would be second place, though definitely not as effective as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions or comments or found this review helpful, please let me know!</li>
            <li> So far the best type of conditioners I have ever used, its easy with this nice soft scent but not overwhelming.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Did not like this. It made my hair feel course and stiff. I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love the fruity smell of this shampoo. Also, as a side note -- the picture shows 2 bottles; there is actually only 1.</li>
            <li> What a great deal and it was cheaper than Walmart or Target without having to deal with the crowds. I will definitely try out some more of these toiletry items out in the future.</li>
            <li> Even my husband likes this and that is amazing. It is thick, smells good and works well. Nothing is going to be 100% on thick hair in Florida with the humidity always high but it takes out tangles and smells nice.</li>
            <li> Made my scalp itchy after a few uses and didn&#x27;t control my frizz or mosturize.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works very well with my hair.  It leaves it feeling soft without any residue.  I am very happy with the product.  And the smell is very nice also.</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves my dry hair nice and smooth.  I like that it&#x27;s relatively inexpensive so I don&#x27;t have to skimp on lathering up my mane.</li>
            <li> I grew up in a large family of girls; our family consisted of me, the youngest son, my four older sisters and my mom--dad ran off to join the circus when I was three. My entire childhood life consisted of women, women, women, all around me. I was probably more familiar with the particulars of female adolescence than any boy my age would probably want. Sure, I played with G.I. Joes, Tonka trucks and so on, but if I ever wanted anyone to play WITH me, I&#x27;d have to tolerate tea parties with grilled cheese sandwich triangles, barbie dolls, Tiger Beat magazine and New Kids on the Block dance parties. It was a lonely time to be the single male presence in that house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say that had a very profound effect on my career choice. Call it reflexive behavior, but when I was of age, I joined the Marines, and developed a very illustrative career, rising up in the ranks, eventually becoming a Lieutenant Colonel. My peers would say I&#x27;ve been pivotal in the country&#x27;s role as a global peacekeeper, and in the development of the finest fighting forces civilization has ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I cannot deny myself the simple pleasures of self-pampering my sisters and my mom taught me, growing up. It&#x27;s not un-manly to treat yourself to an hour of beauty every evening. I feel it&#x27;s part of taking care of yourself. When I come home from a hard day of managing forces in the Middle East Theatre of battle, I like to pour myself a glass of wine, put on some New Kids on the Block, make myself a grilled cheese sandwich, cut it into triangles, and take a nice hot shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s where the Garnier Fructis Sleek Shine Fortifying Conditioner comes in. As any military historian can tell you, your forces are only as good as the supporting foundation upon which they&#x27;re supported; likewise with your hair, it&#x27;s only as good as your roots and hair follicles with moisture and structure, a mission that Garnier Fructis accomplishes. Just like my marines have to keep their bodiesin shape, Garnier keeps the strands of hair strong, and the ends un-split. Just like it&#x27;s important to have a large number of forces in your army, so true is it with one&#x27;s hair, that the more volume you have, the more beautiful you look. And we teach that in the corps also--beauty is of utmost importance on the battle field.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Garnier Fructis&#x27; whole line of shampooing and conditioning products are OUT-STAND-ING, and I hope you carry on!</li>
            <li> Low price good quality. I use it after I use shampoo. And I make my hair feel smooth. I like it.</li>
            <li> I gave this conditioner 5 stars because it has a good scent and conditions well.  I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Smells really good thank u i like it. And its pretty good price when i bought it plus free shipping when i bought. And i got it really quick.... Thank u</li>
            <li> I love the smell and feel of his conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a Garnier Fructis product before, decided to give this a try with the matching shampoo. Big mistake. The shampoo itself isn&#x27;t as bad as the conditioner, although it still felt slimy and I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. This conditioner went beyond slime...My shoulders and back were covered with a greasy film after rinsing, and no amount of additional rinsing would get rid of it. I wound up wrapping my long hair up in a towel and scrubbing with soap and a poof to get rid of the slime on my skin. Absolutely disgusting. As to my hair, no amount of rinsing got it off of my scalp either, and left me with an itchy buildup. I tried this stuff 3 or 4 times to see if I could make it work, but my hair and scalp kept getting worse, even if I only used a little bit and tried to keep it only on my hair and not scalp. I finally wound up having to buy a pine tar shampoo and tea tree conditioner from Sally&#x27;s to get rid of the buildup and itching. In the trash it went.</li>
            <li> So I bought this conditioner because it was cheap and was really surprised how soft it made my hair. I have a slight ombre and my ends were really dry. I used it on my hair, let it sit for about 30 minutes, rinsed out and let it air dry my hair was silky smooth. I highly recommend this conditioner,</li>
            <li> I was using very expensive salon conditioners and after washing my long hair, it felt like straw and I could barely get a brush through it.  Based on reviews, I tried this along with the shampoo, and right away my hair was softer and shiny.  After two weeks, it is even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With it being summer, I love to swim in the pool, but that dries out my hair, even with a swim cap. A trick I learned was to put conditioner on my dry hair before putting on the the swim cap.  With this conditioner, after swimming, I just rinse off and my hair is softer than when I got in!</li>
            <li> I had bought this for summer in hopes of de-frizzing my naturally curly hair. I usually straighten it, but the humidity turns it into a huge frizz ball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m super unhappy with it. While it did control a small amount of frizz, it was overall, a waste of my time. My hair felt gorgeous in the shower after using it. Super sleek and smooth. However, the reason it controls hair in humidity is because it leaves this nasty film too heavy for the heat to lift. After washing my hair, no matter how much I scrubbed or rinsed, my hair was left feeling dirty after it dried. When I blew it out or straightened it, I could feel the residue on my hands, and even see it in my hair. I was almost pointless to even use, as it left my hair looking greasy. I felt like I needed to shower all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first time I used it, I thought that maybe I used too much. I used a different shampoo for a week with no problem, and then switched back to this one, using a smaller amount than before. Once again, my hair looked and felt dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless the formula is improved, I definitely won&#x27;t be purchasing this again. If you experienced the same problem, I&#x27;d suggest using Organix Argan Oil Shampoo in the pretty blue bottle. It has the same concept, but doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling dirty.</li>
            <li> I have long, straight, fine hair. I have to search to find products that don&#x27;t flatten my hair out. This smelled great and felt nice, my hair was slick when wet, easy to comb. When it dried, oh boy! My hair was beautiful! Shiney, smooth and bouncy! The convenience of ordering from the comfort of your home and having it delivered is great. I highly recommend this product. I love it.</li>
            <li> I knew at $2.96 or so that there was surely only one bottle, NOT TWO as pictured, so don&#x27;t let it fool you.  It&#x27;s still a great bargain, and I like the Garnier products.  I have really long baby fine hair &amp; it tangles easily &amp; gets static in it, and this product seems to help a lot.  Price and quality wise it&#x27;s a great deal, &amp; Amazon lets you include it along with other products for free shipping.  Can&#x27;t beat that !</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and this product has allowed me to better maneuver my hair for styling or otherwise after my short. For softer hair I leave it in longer before washing it out. Have been using this for years. Great, affordable conditioner.</li>
            <li> The bottle came in a bag and 1/3 of the conditioner was leaked out of the bottle into the bag.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for!  Decent price, decent conditioner!</li>
            <li> Unlike the shampoo for me the conditioner is pretty good. I can detangle with it, it has nice slip, it smells good and a little goes a long way with this conditioner. Even after i rinsed it out, the smell of the conditioner lasted for days in my hair. Repurchasing this!</li>
            <li> I like the conditioner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: The picture is misleading.  You only get one bottle, even though there are two in the picture.</li>
