            <li>I love this brand of shampoo.</li>
            <li>I prefer the moisture shampoo and conditioner best as the 4 stars only because I love the scent.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, leaves my hair looking so healthy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many many shampoos, conditioners, &amp; products.</li>
            <li>I love these products.</li>
            <li>Kenra is one of the better shampoos I have used to create volume in my fine hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many that will make my fine hair fuller and softer.</li>
            <li>hair feels silky and is easily styled with the products.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is just fine, I don&#x27;t know that it helps my hair</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and I love how it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>I’m really impressed, and even though it is a little pricier (and on the “fancy” side of Ulta) I will keep buying it because I know it works well for me.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t like the smell (which is important to me).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as cheap as you can get it.</li>
            <li>Great products, use regularly.  </li>
            <li>It smells heavenly, with a light fruit scent, but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>When I said just the cheap stuff, she scolded me.</li>
            <li>I opened the conditioner and it does not have the &amp;#34;coconut rich smell of the original</li>
            <li>I use TIGI Small Talk and Queen for a Day volumizer and they do a great job with making my hair look nice and full.  </li>
            <li>my stylist uses kenra shampoo and conditioner and always loved the way my hair felt when i left.</li>
            <li>Cleans your hair while adding volume, and there is no build up, which I&#x27;ve experienced with other volumizing shampoos.</li>
            <li>I am continuing my search for a great shampoo and conditioner for my long, straight hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received several compliments about how healthy my hair looks, so it shows!</li>
            <li>My hair has never been this soft and my scalp isn&#x27;t irratated like with many others.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll have a hard time finding a more reliable and effective formulation.</li>
            <li>Great for use with hard water.</li>
            <li>Also effective with wide variety of hair types.  </li>
            <li>Got buildup after the first week of using it.</li>
            <li>I have used several Kenra Products and have been satisfied with all of them.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE the Kenra hairspray and smoothing sirum, but the shampoo and conditioner left a lot to be desired.  </li>
            <li>(Well, not really, but kind of.)</li>
            <li>It smells like peaches, and makes my hair super soft!!</li>
            <li>There may have been slightly more body in my hair, but it wasn&#x27;t worth the dry feeling</li>
            <li>Not my favorite, not my least favorite.</li>
            <li>She said buying the good shampoos can really help your hair, and recommended a few brands to me.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and thin, and I am allergic to many hair products that cause my scalp and skin around my face line to break out.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t seem to do much for my hair</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner really do make a difference in the look and feel of your hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I just opened my Kenra shampoo and much to my dismay</li>
            <li>I looked in the stores and it is really pricey.</li>
            <li>Because I have so much hair</li>
            <li>I really, really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>Definitely adds volume to your hair and makes it look shiny and clean.</li>
            <li>So if you are on the lookout for new shampoo and are trying to decide what to buy, try the silver bottles!</li>
            <li>Amazon not only had the product, but the price was very comparable, and the shipping charges were worth me getting them delivered to my front door.</li>
            <li>I bought the volumizing shampoo and conditioner in hopes to get a little more body in my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty reasonably priced too for such a high quality product.</li>
            <li>It does not lather very easily and my hair is not as soft and manageable as it was when I used this brand in the past.  </li>
            <li>I’m constantly looking for products to help me have a positive relationship with my mane.</li>
            <li>I have fine, limp hair, and always gravitate towards volumizing products.</li>
            <li>That was nearly one year ago, and I now have full-size bottles of each in my shower.</li>
            <li>I have very fine dark hair, and I felt like the Kenra just left it feeling very dry.</li>
            <li>If you have read other blog posts from me about hair care, you know that I really struggle with my hair.</li>
            <li>When I blew it dry it wasn&#x27;t soft or silky.</li>
            <li>Have always had trouble with my hair feeling clean with any other shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and thin.</li>
            <li>it smells a little odd, but the effects are worth it!</li>

            <li> Kenra&#x27;s had staying power for a long time and with justifiable reason:  it works.  </li>
            <li> I have long, color-treated hair, so I need something that conditions well and adds volume.  </li>
            <li> I look for products that will go a long way when not needing a lot, this combo didn&#x27;t do it for me.  </li>
            <li> and I only wash my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> I have to be careful what shampoos I use because my hair tends to get dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Just what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I searched for quite a while to find the right shampoo and conditioner, and unfortunately for me, this wasn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> It’s limp, flat and so frizzy.</li>
            <li> Only need a small amount of shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair down the middle of my back</li>
            <li> – oomphs my hair a bit and helps keep the frizz down.</li>
            <li> No more frizz or dry hair either!</li>
            <li> I used to use Kenra products a long time ago (at least 10-15 years) and it seems they changed their formula.  </li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair but lots of it, and it tends to just be flat and boring.</li>
            <li> I usually have to find a friend that has a beautician license to get this product at a discount.  </li>
            <li> The printing on the bottles is too small to read.  </li>
            <li> But once I got home, I went to Ulta and bought small bottles of each to try it out.</li>
            <li> and I have a hard time finding a shampoo/conditioner combo that works well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Kenra products on my hair for over 15 years, you can&#x27;t go wrong with Kenra, they care for your hair.</li>
            <li> Too bad the price went up $4.00 a bottle.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Happy to find Kenra products.</li>
            <li> Definitely adds volume to your hair and makes it look shiny and clean. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> Not my favorite, not my least favorite. Didn&#x27;t seem to do much for my hair and I didn&#x27;t like the smell (which is important to me).</li>
            <li> I searched for quite a while to find the right shampoo and conditioner, and unfortunately for me, this wasn&#x27;t it. I have very fine dark hair, and I felt like the Kenra just left it feeling very dry. When I blew it dry it wasn&#x27;t soft or silky. There may have been slightly more body in my hair, but it wasn&#x27;t worth the dry feeling I was left with. I was overall underwhelmed.</li>
            <li> Kenra is one of the better shampoos I have used to create volume in my fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels silky and is easily styled with the products. I would recommend this&lt;br /&gt;particular Kenra shampoo and conditioner to those who want to add volume to their hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine, limp hair, and always gravitate towards volumizing products. These are okay. I don&#x27;t feel they worked any miracles, but they are a nice shampoo and conditioner nonetheless. The smell is wonderful, and they do help create a lot of smoothness. But I&#x27;m not sure they really do much to help volumize. I like them, but when they run out, I&#x27;ll probably try something else rather than purchase these again.</li>
            <li> I had never used Kenra Volumizing shampoo Conditioner until now have not detected any problem yet.  I am able to feel the consistency of my hair with these products also love how my hair shines.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and I love how it makes my hair feel. I have long curly, color processed hair. I have to be careful what shampoos I use because my hair tends to get dry and frizzy.  I will be purchasing a bigger bottle next time!</li>
            <li> Very good deal. This shampoo and conditioner really do make a difference in the look and feel of your hair. It&#x27;s salon luxury in your own home.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this set! It&#x27;s as cheap as you can get it. Supply House price also. Would buy again! Thanks</li>
            <li> Kenra has a great line of products that I&#x27;ve been using for over 6 years.  I work 10 - 12 hours a day, and can&#x27;t always get to the salon on time to purchase when I need it.  Amazon not only had the product, but the price was very comparable, and the shipping charges were worth me getting them delivered to my front door.</li>
            <li> Have always loved Kenra products,  Very quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Great transaction; product and receipt as promised</li>
            <li> My mom&#x27;s hair dresser recommended this to add volume to her hair. Works well. Smells good too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months &amp; I am pleased with the results. Will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Kenra products on my hair for over 15 years, you can&#x27;t go wrong with Kenra, they care for your hair.</li>
            <li> Use daily. Only need a small amount of shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Kenra&#x27;s had staying power for a long time and with justifiable reason:  it works.  Great shampoo with the volumizing claim fulfilled in spades. Also effective with wide variety of hair types.  You&#x27;ll have a hard time finding a more reliable and effective formulation.</li>
            <li> I just opened my Kenra shampoo and much to my dismay this product in no way resembles the Kenra product I have been buying and using for 2 years.  Shampoo smell, consistency, lather not the same!  I had a little of old bottle to compare.  This smells and looks like dish washing soap.  I opened the conditioner and it does not have the &amp;#34;coconut rich smell of the original so I am throwing both of these away!!!&lt;br /&gt;Will go to reputable salon and buy my products from now on. My salon recently quit carrying it so thought I would order online.  Big Mistake!</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo. Great for use with hard water. Have always had trouble with my hair feeling clean with any other shampoo.</li>
            <li> I usually have to find a friend that has a beautician license to get this product at a discount.  This purchase worked out well....</li>
            <li> Great products, use regularly.  Ordered without issues and promptly received.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner!  It smells heavenly, with a light fruit scent, but not overpowering.  I have long, color-treated hair, so I need something that conditions well and adds volume.  This does the trick.  It&#x27;s pretty reasonably priced too for such a high quality product.</li>
            <li> It did help a bit on volumizing  but it caused me lots of acne around my hair line all over.  So, I won&#x27;t buy it anymore.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner.  Too bad the price went up $4.00 a bottle.</li>
            <li> I know why it costs so much, it is really good product. My hair has never been this soft and my scalp isn&#x27;t irratated like with many others.</li>
            <li> Got buildup after the first week of using it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is just fine, I don&#x27;t know that it helps my hair but I like the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I used to use Kenra products a long time ago (at least 10-15 years) and it seems they changed their formula.  It does not lather very easily and my hair is not as soft and manageable as it was when I used this brand in the past.  I am continuing my search for a great shampoo and conditioner for my long, straight hair.</li>
            <li> I thought i was ordering 2 bottles of shampoo.  But one shampoo and one conditioner arrived.  Kenra shampoos ARE conditioning shampoos, so the word conditioner in the title didn&#x27;t lead me to believe the 2 bottles were not the same.  The printing on the bottles is too small to read.  Even the description doesn&#x27;t clarify it any.  So now I have one bottle of shampoo and one bottle something I never use, but paid for.</li>
            <li> I have used several Kenra Products and have been satisfied with all of them.  My hair is fine and thin. Kenra gives my hair volumn and easier to manage.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and these products work really great for me.  I use TIGI Small Talk and Queen for a Day volumizer and they do a great job with making my hair look nice and full.  And as a bonus, the products all smell great!</li>
            <li> my stylist uses kenra shampoo and conditioner and always loved the way my hair felt when i left. I looked in the stores and it is really pricey. This was an amazing price and i love the product. it smells a little odd, but the effects are worth it!</li>
            <li> I love this brand of shampoo. I prefer the moisture shampoo and conditioner best as the 4 stars only because I love the scent. This shampoo is great for volume and no by products...A+++</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, leaves my hair looking so healthy.</li>
            <li> Cleans your hair while adding volume, and there is no build up, which I&#x27;ve experienced with other volumizing shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair down the middle of my back and I have a hard time finding a shampoo/conditioner combo that works well.  I LOVE the Kenra hairspray and smoothing sirum, but the shampoo and conditioner left a lot to be desired.  Because I have so much hair I look for products that will go a long way when not needing a lot, this combo didn&#x27;t do it for me.  I went through both bottles in a week and I only wash my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> I adore this shampoo and conditioner! I&#x27;ve tried so many that will make my fine hair fuller and softer. I have baby fine hair but lots of it, and it tends to just be flat and boring. I&#x27;ve tried many many shampoos, conditioners, &amp; products. But this Kenra is by far the best. It smells like peaches, and makes my hair super soft!! No more frizz or dry hair either!</li>
            <li> If you have read other blog posts from me about hair care, you know that I really struggle with my hair. It’s limp, flat and so frizzy. I’m constantly looking for products to help me have a positive relationship with my mane. I met a hair stylist on my honeymoon last February, and she asked what shampoo and conditioner I used after I told her my woes. When I said just the cheap stuff, she scolded me. (Well, not really, but kind of.) She said buying the good shampoos can really help your hair, and recommended a few brands to me. One was Kenra. I had heard of Kenra and know friends who use it, but being a lot pricey than I was used to, I just didn’t want to splurge. But once I got home, I went to Ulta and bought small bottles of each to try it out. I bought the volumizing shampoo and conditioner in hopes to get a little more body in my hair. That was nearly one year ago, and I now have full-size bottles of each in my shower. I really, really like this stuff. It smells good, but I think it does what it promises – oomphs my hair a bit and helps keep the frizz down. I’m really impressed, and even though it is a little pricier (and on the “fancy” side of Ulta) I will keep buying it because I know it works well for me. So if you are on the lookout for new shampoo and are trying to decide what to buy, try the silver bottles!</li>
            <li> I love these products. My hair is very fine and thin, and I am allergic to many hair products that cause my scalp and skin around my face line to break out. My hair and skin look healthier than it has looked in years.  I&#x27;ve received several compliments about how healthy my hair looks, so it shows!</li>
