            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>you so much!!!!!</li>
            <li>but I found I can color the hair to give it a closer match to my own hair.</li>
            <li>Nice quality hair.</li>
            <li>The hair is extremely soft and matches perfectly with my own hair.</li>
            <li>and It matched my hair color perfectly and was easy to curl with the hot iron!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>It is human hair and it blends perfectly with my color.</li>
            <li>I did by 2 packs based on reviews and glad i did.</li>
            <li>Okay, honestly these are CHEAP for a reason.</li>
            <li>was OK.</li>
            <li>MATCHED MY HAIR PERFECTLY( #2) AND HELD UP TO MY CONSTANT CURLING.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried hair extensions, so I was happy to find these were really easy to attach to my hair.</li>
            <li>Tress Match has nice hair, not cheap but excellent quality.</li>
            <li>Beautiful natural dark chocolate brown color, matched my hair almost perfect.</li>
            <li>I love it very much !</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t fit in my hair</li>
            <li>The clips were cheap plastic</li>
            <li>Overall great buy for the price.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s exactly what the title says, CHEAP!  </li>
            <li>This hair had good color but who knows if it would remain nice after a few washes.</li>
            <li>The hair itself looks and feels a bit like real hair; the match isn&#x27;t perfect (a little too light for me)</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and am overall happy.</li>
            <li>But with these extentions, they were easy to use with the clips attached and they looked like the real thing!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thats if the hair doesn&#x27;t fall out first!</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with the quality of these extensions and will be purchasing some more in the future.</li>
            <li>I ordered one pack and it is just enough to blend my chin length fine very straight hair into a shoulder length do.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li>I have another hair extension from a different brand and the clips are far more trustworthy staying in my hair unlike this one, they don&#x27;t really grip my hair as well.</li>
            <li>so if you have curly hair I&#x27;d opt for a curly version because this hair come pin straight.</li>
            <li>Personally I love that it is single wefted because it makes it look natural and not bulky.</li>
            <li>I definitely look forward to making more purchases with abHair in the future!</li>
            <li>The hair is dry, brittle,  light &amp; totally lifeless.  </li>
            <li>It matches my hair the clips are hard to snap better</li>
            <li>It is coarse hair but when curled with my real hair you cant even tell.</li>
            <li>Was I surprised when my stylist used it in my hair</li>
            <li>good but sent wrong color</li>
            <li>The hair itself isn&#x27;t a thin type of hair, which was okay for me because i have thicker hair, and so far it doesn&#x27;t seem like it melts with any heat styling.</li>

            <li> Called the same day received to return, not worth the money even at the Cheap Price due to the POOR quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely order another set tho, as my natural hair is quite thick...</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re super thin to begin with!</li>
            <li> A little coarse but match my hair color</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have said, the clips didn&#x27;t damage my hair.</li>
            <li> The Extensions were not even, one clip had waaaaay less hair in it than the other one &amp;</li>
            <li> Clips are a bit difficult to open and make adhere to the head.  </li>
            <li> I have thick relaxed hair and it matches my texture.</li>
            <li> it is not worth buying!!!!</li>
            <li> Each piece contains three clipped hair pieces, which aren&#x27;t very thick.  </li>
            <li> not happy with the hair too thin, just not happy with the hair will not buy again</li>
            <li> Some of the sites I visited did not have hair to match my hair color (2).The ones that did had outrageous prices.</li>
            <li> horrible look and hair quality</li>

            <li> It matches my hair the clips are hard to snap better they hold on to your hair I love it</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.  Clips are a bit difficult to open and make adhere to the head.  Each piece contains three clipped hair pieces, which aren&#x27;t very thick.  It does appear to be course human hair.</li>
            <li> good but sent wrong color</li>
            <li> Great color and will work well with my hair. It is coarse hair but when curled with my real hair you cant even tell. Shipped fast and am overall happy.</li>

The hair itself isn&#x27;t a thin type of hair, which was okay for me because i have thicker hair, and so far it doesn&#x27;t seem like it melts with any heat styling. But overall, for its price it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair extension because it matched my hair and was inexpensive.  Was I surprised when my stylist used it in my hair and It matched my hair color perfectly and was easy to curl with the hot iron!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased and will order again. Some of the sites I visited did not have hair to match my hair color (2).The ones that did had outrageous prices. But with these extentions, they were easy to use with the clips attached and they looked like the real thing!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely order again but not right away because this hair last so long!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much!!!!!</li>
            <li> really good for the price you pay!</li>
            <li> Metal clips workwd great! Took color perfectly!  Handled hot tools on a medium heat perfectly! I&#x27;ll definitely order another set tho, as my natural hair is quite thick...all around good buy</li>
            <li> not happy with the hair too thin, just not happy with the hair will not buy again</li>
            <li> I bought this hair and it is not human hair it&#x27;s synthetic... it is not worth buying!!!! I would not recommend buying this product</li>
            <li> This hair had good color but who knows if it would remain nice after a few washes. Thats if the hair doesn&#x27;t fall out first! The clips were cheap plastic and I couldn&#x27;t even clasp one of them to my hair! The Extensions were not even, one clip had waaaaay less hair in it than the other one &amp; they&#x27;re super thin to begin with! it&#x27;s exactly what the title says, CHEAP!  I sent this product back!</li>
            <li> Nice quality hair. Clips have a silicone bumper for non-slip grip. Beautiful natural dark chocolate brown color, matched my hair almost perfect. I ordered one pack and it is just enough to blend my chin length fine very straight hair into a shoulder length do. If you have thicker hair you will definitely need two packages. And the widest extension has 3 clips. Also this is human hair so can be curled and styled but heat will eventually wear them out so if you have curly hair I&#x27;d opt for a curly version because this hair come pin straight.</li>
            <li> Just received my hair. I love it! It is human hair and it blends perfectly with my color. I did by 2 packs based on reviews and glad i did. I have thick relaxed hair and it matches my texture. Personally I love that it is single wefted because it makes it look natural and not bulky. Overall great buy for the price. Will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> Okay, honestly these are CHEAP for a reason. The hair is dry, brittle,  light &amp; totally lifeless.  I bought in several lengths so this wasn&#x27;t a fluke. ..ALL the hair pieces were the same.  Called the same day received to return, not worth the money even at the Cheap Price due to the POOR quality. Tress Match has nice hair, not cheap but excellent quality.</li>
            <li> I love it very much !The hair is extremely soft and matches perfectly with my own hair. I definitely look forward to making more purchases with abHair in the future!</li>
            <li> was OK. A little coarse but match my hair color and it blended in.</li>
            <li> horrible look and hair quality</li>
            <li> I WAS SKEPTICAL ABOUT THESE CLIP INS BECAUSE THEY ARE SO CHEAP BUT THEY HAVE BEEN GREAT! MATCHED MY HAIR PERFECTLY( #2) AND HELD UP TO MY CONSTANT CURLING. I&#x27;VE HAD THEM FOR A MONTH AND THEY STILL LOOK GOOD. I WOULD DEFINITELY PURCHASE AGAIN!</li>
            <li> I like this product and I will order another soon</li>
            <li> Does it have a closure to it ?</li>
