            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say that I&#x27;ve found the solution to my hair loss right here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>No difference noticeable but the nutrition label looks interesting.  </li>

            <li>It looks healthy and not dull like before.</li>

            <li>Product really does work well.</li>

            <li> After continued use of this I have started to see a  lot of small thin hairs coming in.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works but not as fast as they claim</li>
            <li> My hair recently started falling out and my nails has became brittle from a medication I started taking.  I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review and was excited to try it and see if it would help. I have noticed a change since taking. My hair has stopped falling out. It looks healthy and not dull like before. I can actually keep nails now and they are healthier and shiny too. I will continue to take and be purchasing in the future.</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle, which is good for HALF a month, and was looking forward to continuing with it; however, the price has doubled since I last purchased, so I&#x27;ll be looking for alternatives.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made use of this supplement every day, for six months to help with hair loss. My nails haven&#x27;t ever been tougher and my skin looks great, so, in my opinion, the formula is effective. I&#x27;ve come across brand new hair growth, however they continue to be wispy and light, however in just 6 months time the new strands have become around 3 to 4 inches longer. I&#x27;m hoping they will thicken up and fill out.</li>
            <li> I hope to see improvement in my hair as I continue to use this.  I will post another review after next bottle.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. I&#x27;m currently on my second bottle and I have noticed a change in my nails, they are stronger. I have also seen growth in my hair and my hair is stronger. I will definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants stronger hair and nails. I will be ordering my third bottle soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 27 and I work as a bartender night shifts only and I rarely get a day off during the summer season. After we finished for this year, my immune system simply crashed.This resulted in general weakness and hair loss. After my last haircut I noticed 5-6 small bald spots on my head around the ear areas, which my hairdresser said were &amp;#34;stress spots&amp;#34;. I went to a dermathologist and he confirmed that accumulated fatigue and stress can cause the skin on the scalp to lose its elasticity to such an extend that it can&#x27;t support the hair growth process anymore. I&#x27;m happy to say that I&#x27;ve found the solution to my hair loss right here on Amazon. I did a check on Hair Growth X&#x27;s ingredients before making the purchase and it seemed that this product could help. Three weeks after taking the pills, the bald spots are gone and my hair looks healthier than ever.&lt;br /&gt;Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> No difference noticeable but the nutrition label looks interesting.  A very good list of vitamins are available in good amount.</li>
            <li> Developed allergic reaction. Noticed rash/little bumps appearing after approx. three days of using. Bumps/rash disappeared after discontinuing use.&lt;br /&gt;May work for others???</li>
            <li> I received this item in exchange for a review, and I am SO GLAD I did! Pretty life changing stuff, here!</li>
            <li> Not so good as I expected. I had no results. It&#x27;s to expensive for what really is. Won&#x27;t buy it again!</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for several months, and I have not seen any results  from the product. Not satisfied.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS!!! I had lost a lot of hair since aging and it seemed to be thinning quite a bit. After continued use of this I have started to see a  lot of small thin hairs coming in.  I didn&#x27;t believe it was possible but now I do.  It hasn&#x27;t been too long but I see them and they&#x27;re there and can&#x27;t wait until they&#x27;re longer. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> The product seems to have stopped the hair falling out. I am waiting to see new growth next. I know it can take a few months.</li>
            <li> I would not buy this product again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about three weeks now, and when I first purchased this I really was skeptical but it honestly does work. About a week ago, I started noticing changes and that it was working. My hair have grown about half an inch. It&#x27;s amazing!! I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> It works just like a charm...what a terrific supplement!!! I have a tendency to experience hair loss due to anxiety and this is the 2nd occasion which I ordered this supplement. The instant increase of my hair is obvious. I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> Used six months. No noticeable improvement in the mop.</li>
            <li> Just started using product.Need time to show any progress.</li>
            <li> Product really does work well.</li>
            <li> Most of the hair growth products have a hefty price tag. I bought this one because it was highly rated and not off the charts expensive. I&#x27;m no longer losing hair every time I run a brush through it, so I have to say it is helping.</li>
            <li> This is the third hair growth formula I&amp;#34;ve ordered from Amazon.  (Hair Omega 3 and Das Gro were the other 2.)  I&#x27;ve heard that Saw Palmetto is good for fine and thinning hair and all 3 of these supplements have it.  I can&#x27;t tell a difference yet, but most reviews say it takes up to 4 months to really notice a change.  I am in my 3rd month of using these products, so maybe it&#x27;s too soon to know how well they are actually working.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review..I had my dad try it out since he has formed some hair loss in the past few years and its been doing its job correctly. He has been taking them and I have seen a miraculous change in his hair. It looks very nice and its growing all together very nicely!</li>
            <li> i m trying and checking my hair to grow</li>
            <li> Hopefully this product works, I have some doubts but I&#x27;m going to try to bring this my medical advisor to see what he says about it. This hair growth stuff should work without a flaw. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review</li>
            <li> I really like this product. As a result of taking it, my hair is healthier, and is growing faster!</li>
