            <li> product works well on wet or dry hair.  </li>

            <li> There are many products that claim to be &amp;#34;Moroccan oil&amp;#34; that  have very little argan oil as the base. Not so with this product.  It is the real deal. My relaxed hair is thick, I use just a little after washing, before my roller set and just  a little makes my hair smooth and shinny and does not weigh it down (only a little is needed).  It also has a great smell. I also use it as a moisturizer after showering it makes my skin nice &amp; smooth with no oily residue.</li>
            <li> Great quality, product was described as it is and fast shipment, wish to do business with in the future. highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great product. I have fine, limp hair this product does not weigh it down and has helped to repair damage.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair. When I wear my hair straight I use the Moroccan oil hair treatment on my hair before&lt;br /&gt;I blow dry and straighten. It works great!! Leaves my hair looking healthy.</li>
            <li> This always leaves my hair smooth and shiny without the appearance of oiliness. The only drawback is the price. However, a bottle this size usually lasts me 2-3 months</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products on my hair and this one is hands down my favorite.  You can add a small amount to your hair after a shower for added moisture, or add it to dry before styling or touch ups.  If used sparingly, it won&#x27;t leave a greasy feel and lasts awhile.</li>
            <li> I discovered Moroccan Hair Oil about 5 years ago in Canada when a hair stylist there used it on my hair. It left my hair shiny and strong. Now I use it religiously every time I wash my hair, which is usually 3 times a week or more. I have been buying it on Amazon since the price was more affordable. Recently I noticed that a slightly larger bottle was being offered at a discounted price and I jumped at the opportunity to have my special hair oil for less than I was paying previously. Thank you!</li>
            <li> My daughter gave me a sample of this oil.  She loves it for her thick thick hair.  Now I do too!  Even on days when nothing could completely tame my massive mop, this stuff makes it shiny and smell terrific.</li>
            <li> I love Moroccan oils it doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down with a greasy feel. It makes my hair feel so silky and soft to the touch. I have thick wavy hair which is relaxed. Which is hard to detangle if I don&#x27;t use the rite shampoo, my hair is usually dry but now it is improving. I use Moroccan oil with the Moroccan oil Hydrating styling cream to roller set my hair when it is wet. I also use it to wrap my hair to get that extra shine. My package came  in time for me to take to the salon. It was neatly wrapped with the box separate didn&#x27;t understand why but hey no complains. Also remember that a lil goes along way and pay attention to your ends. Before when I went to the hair salon my ends was so dry and brittle I would have to clip it every two months now I clip my ends every 4 months because I keep my ends moisturized.</li>
            <li> Received in a timely manner.  Packaged well in NEW BOX.  Product WAS NOT expired and had NEVER been opened.  This product is awesome.  I have used it for around 5 years and cannot say enough good things about it.  In my opinion, there are no other products that can begin to compare with it....I think I have tried them all!  The scent is the BEST of them all, for sure!!!  The only negative thing, that a few other buyers have noted, is regarding the pump.  The pump is junk, to put it nicely.  That is not the seller&#x27;s fault.  Keep your original top, because you will need it!  Just pouring a small amount into your hand works best.  Will purchase from this seller again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works well on wet or dry hair.  A little goes a long way.  This size bottle lasts me about a year, with daily usage.  It does not make your hair oily!!!  Gives great shine. Helps to mend your hair if you color or perm your hair.  Also, is great for taming curly, frizzy, and wavy hair.  Works for me....hope it does for you, too!</li>
            <li> A hairdresser got me using this great product.  Be sure to use sparingly.  A little bit goes a long way.  Be sure to check out the .85 oz size for travel.</li>
            <li> I love this product, the buyer was fast to deliver it as well. It is very smooth and I this is first time I bought this product.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for maintaining my hair hydrated because I tend to wash the life out of it, so this helps to keep it calm and full bodied.</li>
