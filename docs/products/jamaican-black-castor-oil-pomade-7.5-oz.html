            <li> I may try the straight black castor oil</li>
            <li> it also appears to be filling my edges back in (they were weak from braids and over twisting when the person first started my locs).  </li>
            <li> My hair has grown soo long with this product..</li>
            <li> My daughters hair was dry brittle and wouldn&#x27;t grow.  </li>
            <li> the product keep your from feeling dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> If you have thick curly hair like me and like all natural products, I definitely recommend this oil.</li>
            <li> prior.and so far i could small hairs reappearing in the bald spots that i had</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> I use this every other day and her hair has started growing.  </li>
            <li> We all know these dyes cause cancer and other illness, so why would we want it in our hair.</li>
            <li> It is what I expected it to be!</li>
            <li> This company needs to sit down, regroup, and think about how their products are made...</li>
            <li> Do not buy this fake black castor oil pomade it is not made of real jamaican black castor oil as stated.</li>
            <li> I ran across this looking for Jamaican Black Castor Oil and decided to order it to try it out.</li>
            <li> I ran across this product by accident, they also make Black Castor Oil</li>
            <li> It leaves a black color on anything you rub your head against.  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser told me to use a biotin shampoo/conditioner and some Jamaican black castor oil.  </li>
            <li> It did nothing for my eyebrows either, but my lashes are a little longer and darker after six weeks.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the smell is a little off but</li>
            <li> but that is a little to heavy for my hair texture.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping to see some additional growth in a few months.</li>
            <li> Its a less expensive alternative to the traditional Jamaican Black Castor oil and works  just as well.</li>
            <li> I did not realize, that this was a thick form of greese and it was black</li>
            <li> Not sure yet how it works.</li>
            <li> mainly got it for me edges since its so thin due to a very bad sew-</li>
            <li> Also the eczema I have at the base of hairline at the back my neck improved.</li>
            <li> worst item I&#x27;ve bought on amazon.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Omg this is my last and final product I&#x27;ll ever try!  This stuff is amazing!  My daughters hair was dry brittle and wouldn&#x27;t grow.  I use this every other day and her hair has started growing.  Bought 4 more to have on hand.</li>
            <li> I love this product it leaves my hair soft</li>
            <li> My hair was thinning very much in the center of scalp, being a woman, this was not gonna work, I have tried so many things, and this really works...I now have fuss in the very bald area of my scalp, and i can&#x27;t  be more than very happy. It has a  pleasant smell, and is really not greasy..I liked it so much that I sent to my sister, that was having hair issues.  we both have had chemo, and I recommend to all my cancer friends.</li>
            <li> I have been using now to early to see a difference but will continue to use it love the smell</li>
            <li> I brought this product to grow and thicken my hair. I have been using this for six weeks and read reports that after two weeks folks saw \\&quot;amazing\\&quot; results. This product has a nice scent, easy to rub in, but at this point did not make my hair grow any faster, or thicken it. It adds some shine and manageability. It did nothing for my eyebrows either, but my lashes are a little longer and darker after six weeks. Also the eczema I have at the base of hairline at the back my neck improved. I may try the straight black castor oil maybe I just need something stronger.</li>
            <li> I Like The Way It Goes On My Scalp, Not Greasey. I Love It Hair Oil And It Has No Ordor.</li>
            <li> I ran across this looking for Jamaican Black Castor Oil and decided to order it to try it out. I&#x27;m glad I did. It makes my hair very soft and super shiny. A little goes a long way so use it sparingly. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the smell is a little off but nothing that will make me stop using it and it wears off really quickly. It&#x27;s very healthy for your hair and scalp...read the ingredients. I would probably buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I ran across this product by accident, they also make Black Castor Oil but that is a little to heavy for my hair texture.  This pomade is very light, I have locs and it keeps my hair from itching and flaking it also appears to be filling my edges back in (they were weak from braids and over twisting when the person first started my locs).  I absolutely love this product and will be buying this on a continuous basis.</li>
            <li> Great Product! Good nourishment for the scalp!</li>
            <li> i recently got this item in the mail and i have been using it twice a day non stop since then mainly got it for me edges since its so thin due to a very bad sew-in i got a month prior.and so far i could small hairs reappearing in the bald spots that i had and i just got my hair dont and i see alot of new growth already so i will keep using this product and by septemeber or october give another review on how its coming along.the smell is kind of a turn off but im getting use to it.</li>
            <li> This product softens my hair and adds shine.&lt;br /&gt;It also controls itching and it appears to be&lt;br /&gt;growing. I will buy this product from the same&lt;br /&gt;seller again, It was a smooth transaction..&lt;br /&gt;Thank You.</li>
            <li> This hair pomade is amazing! Normally I would not use this type of product in my hair however, after friend recommended it I decided to try it. This pomade left my hair feeling soft and super manageable. I&#x27;m going to continue using this eternally.I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I first brought this product about a year ago while transitioning to my natural hair and it has helped me alot. My hair has grown alot faster than before. Its thick, healthy,and smells great. Its a less expensive alternative to the traditional Jamaican Black Castor oil and works  just as well. The best part is that it tames my  3c/4a mix hair frizz. I am definitely pleased with this seller getting my product on time since this oil has become my weekly hair regimen. If you have thick curly hair like me and like all natural products, I definitely recommend this oil.</li>
            <li> this product leaves my hair feeling soft and shiny, the only thing I don&#x27;t like about it, is that it smells kinda funny, I have seen some hair growth since iv been using it. I would recommend this product to people that want to grow their hair out.</li>
            <li> Now yes i know everybody&#x27;s hair is diffrent.this product sucked for me, I was having troble growing the top of my hair.i fixed that with the strong roots red pimento oil I got on amazon now I&#x27;m ready to wave my hair, this product say good for waves I think NOT it has no holding power and my hair is not thick.now we move to  stimilate hair growth I don&#x27;t even think so weeks of using this product I find the top of my hair thinner than when I started in conclusion worst item I&#x27;ve bought on amazon.</li>
            <li> I did not realize, that this was a thick form of greese and it was black so it stained my scalp, and itvreally did not help in any why, why I bought it I dont know, Just trying diffrent things.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff my hair was really damaged so I cute it ALL off and Im using this and my hair is growing back really fast I Already have a fade and I cute it 3-4 weeks ago</li>
            <li> All of the best oils for your hair in the form of a pretty light pomeade.  I really like this product and often use it insteads of the liquid hair oils.</li>
            <li> Love this product starting to see improvements.</li>
            <li> THE BEST PRODUCT FOR NATURAL HAIR</li>
            <li> I like it. make my hair feel Good, smell good too.Thanks</li>
            <li> Love love this product</li>
            <li> my husband likes it.  It leaves a black color on anything you rub your head against.  But he still likes it and use it daily.</li>
            <li> I actually love this product, it has done wonders for my hair. I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this fake black castor oil pomade it is not made of real jamaican black castor oil as stated. And it did nothing more for my or my daughter&#x27;s hair than Blue Magic hair grease!</li>
            <li> Well I thought I was buying a great organic/natural product until I received it and read the ingredients, and the ingredient are perfect until you get to the last line and there you will find 3 different food coloring dyes. Whats the point of making something with great organic ingredients if you are just going to kill it in the end by adding man made chemical food dyes. We all know these dyes cause cancer and other illness, so why would we want it in our hair. These dyes will also come off onto our clothes, pillows, furniture. This company needs to sit down, regroup, and think about how their products are made...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take the dyes out of this product and I will be a lifetime consumer of it, otherwise its into the trashcan it goes..!</li>
            <li> This product works it makes my hair shine and soft this is a real good product and i love it.</li>
            <li> I am working diligently to grow the sides of my hair, as well as the back.  I have locs and while the rest of my hair has no problem growing, it has always been a challenge getting my hair to grow in those areas.  My hairdresser told me to use a biotin shampoo/conditioner and some Jamaican black castor oil.  Checking all of my local jamaican markets everyone was out of castor oil; so to the internet I went.  I discovered this pomade and the price was right; so I went for it.  I absolutely love this product.  It puts a nice sheen on my hair, it cuts down on dandruff, and it makes my hair super soft.  I will check back in about a couple of months to give an update on hair growth, but thus far it&#x27;s working great and it does not create build up in my hair.  I oil my scalp about once a week.</li>
            <li> GOOD QUALITY, PLEASE WITH THE TEXTURE IT KEEPS MY HAIR IN.NOT OILY NOR GREASY, JUST RIGHT. GOOD FOR THINNING HAIR.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before. It is what I expected it to be! I have no complaints. Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> The best that ever  happen to my hair I love this product it really work my  hair has grown tremendously</li>
            <li> I like the way it made my hair feel, not to oily. the product keep your from feeling dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair feel so soft. I am natural and I wear a wet set. The pomade protects my curls from moisture. It&#x27;s not greasy. It smells earthy like spice and even though my edges are thin it lays them beautifully. It gives me the appearance of thicker hair around the edges. I&#x27;m hoping to see some additional growth in a few months.</li>
            <li> I currently started transitioning to natural back in january 2012, I did the BC this month, during this process I became research junkie on the best products to used on my 4c texture hair, and Black Castrol Oil products are becoming my favorite products to used during this natural hair journey.</li>
