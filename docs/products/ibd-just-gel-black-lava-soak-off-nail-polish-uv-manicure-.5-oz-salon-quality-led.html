            <li>We used THREE coats and it was perfect.</li>
            <li>I used it with my asp and gelish foundations and when it started coming off prematurely the foundation was still intact perfectly.</li>
            <li>But it does what it says, and it leaves my nails perfect.</li>
            <li>and this product was awesome!</li>

            <li>but I&#x27;d rather pay more for a good quality brand name.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>/&gt;--------BELOW is the original review with a 5 star raiting----------&lt;br /&gt;EXCELLENT Size!  </li>
            <li>So much cheaper than OPI and better quality!</li>
            <li>The color is amazing and really opaque.</li>
            <li>Looks ok with 2 coats, but 3 is optimal for a great opaque black.  </li>
            <li>Great black polish, goes on smooth, cures under light quickly.</li>
            <li>Black Lava is the perfect true black UV/LED soak off gel polish and has a nice cream finish.</li>
            <li>The IBD Just Black Lava gel soak off polish goes on GREAT, and looks FAB,</li>
            <li>I have done my own Harmony Gelish nails and that of both my daughters for several years now</li>
            <li>Price is right.</li>
            <li>For some reason, I could not get a good result from this black.  </li>
            <li>I have the IBD pink, red, &amp; neon purple and those all work great</li>
            <li>The color came was very true to the picture, only had to do two coats too!</li>
            <li>If you put a pearlized gel polish over top of the black it turns into a very pretty purple color</li>
            <li>Aside the shrinking issue, this is the blackest black I own in my collection and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve posted my review now because I really wanted to try out this polish.</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s the bonder that&#x27;s a bitch to get off, and you really have to have a buffer or grit stone to get it all the way off.</li>
            <li>Got it fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>great product I had to cure just a little bit long , but the color and shine lasted until I removed it , this will be my black polish for many years .</li>
            <li>This is the very first one that I can count on NOT lasting through normal wear and tear on the hands/nails.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely order more in the near future.</li>
            <li>When I buy nail polish I usually get OPI because they are usually better quality.</li>
            <li>BUT.. after 3 manicures I&#x27;ve done with it, it has one MAJOR FLAW!  </li>
            <li>Sometimes it didnt seem to cure nearly at all in the middle.</li>
            <li>I will say, it doesn&#x27;t give the strength to the nail that harder gels give, but it really doesn&#x27;t chip if you put it on.</li>
            <li>I fault the polish, as every other mani I&#x27;ve done with other colors in the IBD and other gel lines are fine.  </li>

            <li> , she wanted BLACK with silver stars..</li>
            <li> review is for the Black Lava IBD just gel color.</li>
            <li> still my go to black.</li>
            <li> When I used this black it wrinkled when I cured it.  </li>
            <li> This type of polish you must apply it in really, really extra thin coats, but still be carefull, it might still shrink.</li>
            <li> Cheaper / got it in less than a week!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done with the Black Lava as the main base</li>
            <li> Instead of the gel polish that&#x27;s being advertised, I received regular black nail polish, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Just do thin coats.</li>
            <li> It has a bit thin consistency.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, and I hate to reduce such a fab color to nothing</li>
            <li> Terrible, won&#x27;t dry with led or uv.</li>
            <li> --maybe a bad batch?</li>
            <li> This is with me not filing my nails or using a base coat.</li>
            <li> IT CHIPS HORRIBLY!  </li>

            <li> Terrible, won&#x27;t dry with led or uv.</li>
            <li> UPDATE! 7-4-2015!  Reduced from a 5 star to a 1 star!  The IBD Just Black Lava gel soak off polish goes on GREAT, and looks FAB, BUT.. after 3 manicures I&#x27;ve done with it, it has one MAJOR FLAW!  IT CHIPS HORRIBLY!  All THREE mani&#x27;s I&#x27;ve done with the Black Lava as the main base has all chipped within 24 - 48 hours, every darn time!  I fault the polish, as every other mani I&#x27;ve done with other colors in the IBD and other gel lines are fine.  This is the very first one that I can count on NOT lasting through normal wear and tear on the hands/nails.  I&#x27;m sorry, and I hate to reduce such a fab color to nothing but GEL POLISH is meant to stay on and resist chips, cracks etc... this one color is the only color I&#x27;ve ever had a problem with.  With 3 mani&#x27;s from 3 different people (myself included) all having the same issue, this color needs to get reformulated.&lt;br /&gt;--------BELOW is the original review with a 5 star raiting----------&lt;br /&gt;EXCELLENT Size!  Get a LOT! Looks ok with 2 coats, but 3 is optimal for a great opaque black.  I did a mani with this on my friend for her son&#x27;s graduation, she wanted BLACK with silver stars.. so we did it.  We used THREE coats and it was perfect. Loved this! Pics speak for themselves.&lt;br /&gt;This does NOT pull away from the edges before you cure, (I hate that!) so I&#x27;m pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is for the Black Lava IBD just gel color.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for it. It always seemed to wrinkle and didn&#x27;t last as long as gelish polishes.  Sometimes it didnt seem to cure nearly at all in the middle. I used it with my asp and gelish foundations and when it started coming off prematurely the foundation was still intact perfectly. Yes you do get quite a lot more in the bottle but I&#x27;d rather pay more for a good quality brand name.</li>
            <li> Instead of the gel polish that&#x27;s being advertised, I received regular black nail polish, very disappointed. I&#x27;m never ever ordering from this carrier again. I recommend no one by this.</li>
            <li> If you put a pearlized gel polish over top of the black it turns into a very pretty purple color</li>
            <li> The color is amazing and really opaque. The only con I found is that sometimes it shrinks while curing. This type of polish you must apply it in really, really extra thin coats, but still be carefull, it might still shrink. Aside the shrinking issue, this is the blackest black I own in my collection and still my go to black. I&#x27;ve posted my review now because I really wanted to try out this polish. It&#x27;s still amazing.</li>
            <li> When I used this black it wrinkled when I cured it.  I have done my own Harmony Gelish nails and that of both my daughters for several years now and I have even used other IBD gels, with no trouble.  For some reason, I could not get a good result from this black.  It wrinkled every time.  I couldn&#x27;t even make it work if I worked one nail at a time.  I have the IBD pink, red, &amp; neon purple and those all work great--maybe a bad batch?</li>
            <li> I bought the IBD system when I got my lamp, and I&#x27;ve been wearing it for almost two months. I love it. I will say, it doesn&#x27;t give the strength to the nail that harder gels give, but it really doesn&#x27;t chip if you put it on. For me, it&#x27;s the bonder that&#x27;s a bitch to get off, and you really have to have a buffer or grit stone to get it all the way off. But it does what it says, and it leaves my nails perfect. Just do thin coats.</li>
            <li> great product I had to cure just a little bit long , but the color and shine lasted until I removed it , this will be my black polish for many years .</li>
            <li> Love it...Got it fast. Love the color. Price is right. I will definitely order more in the near future. Thanks</li>
            <li> When I buy nail polish I usually get OPI because they are usually better quality. I just started getting all my Gel Nail stuff and this product was awesome! So much cheaper than OPI and better quality! The OPI lid has a little plastic liner that shows the colors that&#x27;s it, and it comes off every time I open it. The color came was very true to the picture, only had to do two coats too! Lots of compliments when I had this color on my nails! (: Glad I found this brand! Cheaper / got it in less than a week! (:</li>
            <li> Great black polish, goes on smooth, cures under light quickly. Is flexible to keep from cracking.</li>
            <li> Great product!  This works just as well for me as the more expensive gel polishes.  I cannot tell any difference in wear when applied properly.</li>
            <li> Black Lava is the perfect true black UV/LED soak off gel polish and has a nice cream finish. IBD brand polishes apply, remove, and wear just as well as more expensive brands but also come in matching regular (lacquer) nail polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cured using Salon Edge 36W Nail UV Lamp.</li>
            <li> This is GREAT nail polish!!! The gel is just like the salon and I feel like these bottles will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Love the color!  It lasts about 2 weeks before it starts peeling at the tip. This is with me not filing my nails or using a base coat.</li>
            <li> It has a bit thin consistency. You need to apply about 3 coats to even have it look black not grey.</li>
