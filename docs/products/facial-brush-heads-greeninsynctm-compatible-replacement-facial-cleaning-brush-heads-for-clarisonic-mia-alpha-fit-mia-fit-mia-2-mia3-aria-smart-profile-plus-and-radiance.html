            <li>I have a Mia2 and these brush heads work perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Great deal!</li>
            <li>Perfect!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprisingly happy with these, and appreciate that each head has a &amp;#34;cap&amp;#34; on it-- thank you for that!</li>
            <li>The price is wonderful and I WILL repurchase.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product.</li>
            <li>They work great, at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>They are great and work just like the $25 store brand.</li>
            <li>I do not see a difference between these and the Clarisonic Brand brushes, so this are a GREAT buy.</li>
            <li>These worked great.</li>
            <li>my wife is quite happy with these brushes.</li>

            <li>These replacement heads for my clarisonic mia fit perfectly and the price was great.  </li>
            <li>These work great with my clarisonic and to be honest, you can&#x27;t beat this price.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t feel my face as clean as I felt it with the original brush, I got what I paid for!!!!!</li>
            <li>They can keep their money &amp; I&#x27;ll be able to warn you instead!</li>
            <li>They fit perfectly; it was extremely easy to put this brush head on ....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the sonic movement and how clean my face feels with these brush</li>
            <li>The brush heads shipped quickly and were a great value.</li>
            <li>Because I have sensitive skin, these are the best Mia brush heads for me.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the original brushes</li>
            <li>this product it&#x27;s not as good as I expected, it fits perfectly</li>
            <li>I saw these brushes and said &#x27;too good to be true&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I have had my Clarisonic Mia for many years.</li>
            <li>Fits my Mia 2 perfectly and works just the same.</li>
            <li>I was definitely able to tell the difference while using it.</li>
            <li>I am vey pleased with the 4 pack bushes.</li>
            <li>These are great and such a good price.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for offering them at such a great price!</li>
            <li>The Clarisonic brush heads glide smoothly over the skin whereas it felt like these were giving more resistance while I moved it across my face.</li>
            <li>Just a good and much cheaper than the brand name.</li>
            <li>The brush head fits the Mia 2 perfectly, and I&#x27;m sure it will fit the other devices as well!</li>
            <li>Fits ok and my wife did not complain about the feel or have any problem with how well they clean, but…</li>
            <li>Good fairly stiff bristles , but fits my clarisonic and works great .</li>
            <li>they seem to work fine.</li>
            <li>These brushes fit fine on my Clarisonic Mia 2 and work for the price.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how cheap they were.</li>
            <li>The first one screwed on ok, but that&#x27;s about it.  </li>
            <li>None of them work properly in my 3 month young perfect original Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li>They fit find but clean nothing like the real Clarisonic brush heads.</li>
            <li>These are totally worth it.</li>
            <li>How can this be right?  </li>
            <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t feel as clean, and I was able to see more residue than usual on my cotton ball after using toner.</li>
            <li>These are a super buy, works very well with my clarisonicPro brush.  </li>
            <li>Even if it is a really great Chinese knock-off... who cares, it does the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>I hope to get more in the future.</li>
            <li>These look exactly like the Clarisonic brush heads</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It feels more like the deep cleansing brushes which was too abrasive for my skin.</li>
            <li>Will absolutely order again!</li>
            <li>Naturally I tried my original brushes &amp; thankfully everything was still in working order.  </li>
            <li>it can&#x27;t fit my clarisonic plus, it will stuck after start for a while , every head was the same</li>
            <li>fork out the $$$&#x27;s for the original brushes I guess next time which will be much sooner than I thought.</li>
            <li>They feel exactly like my sensitive brush that I bought for 25.00.</li>
            <li>The brush itself is fine but normal, not sensitive.</li>
            <li>However, I received the normal skin version instead.</li>
            <li>but they hurt like heck - rougher than th normal clarisonic brush - going to toss these and buy the brand ones.</li>
            <li>I could not tell a difference between these and my normal brush head.</li>
            <li>and I had a new brush head on my Mia.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft (softer than the Clarisonic brand --- I have one new Clarisonic brush head I used for comparison).  </li>
            <li>I will not be buying from this seller again and will be leery on purchasing more at this price wondering if it will always be the bait &amp; switch which is not okay.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>More disturbing news is that I just did a search using my original order #&#x27;s &amp; the items were again listed by OrganicMed</li>
            <li>The brushes are also not what they should be i.e. the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; brush has far less bristle strength than my original Clarisonic Brand &amp;#34;delicate&amp;#34; brush.  </li>
            <li>The problem is that it doesn&#x27;t fit the Clairsonic properly so that half the time my Clairsonic doesn&#x27;t work,only sits and buzzes.</li>
            <li>I barely spent any money on them and it wasn&#x27;t worth it to me to try to send them back.</li>
            <li>Same look and feel as the Sensitive Brush Heads sold by Clarisonic at a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li>I bought these generic Clairsonic brushes expecting them to be the sensitive version.</li>
            <li>I purchased the replacement heads for sensitive skin hoping they would be the same as the clarisonic brand at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand how it can be ethical, I bought all of these thru OrganicMed, based on reviews about them, but all 3 types of brushes I bought were shipped by different companies &amp; different addresses with different return policies.</li>
            <li>Alas, they are not as soft and kind of tough compared to the real deal.</li>

            <li> After about 30 seconds my Clarisonic began making a strange low pitched noise.  </li>
            <li> These are seriously the exact same thing you buy from Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Not a sensitive head brush.</li>
            <li> I was afraid of doing damage to it, so I quickly tested all of the brushes, found they were all doing the same thing, then I stopped &amp; never plan on trying another.  </li>
            <li> Because I barely spent any money on these I&#x27;ve decided to use them</li>
            <li> This one came from Omeya, &amp; they gave me a partial refund.  </li>
            <li> They said I could keep the brushes &amp; partial refund providing I give them a 5 star rating!  </li>
            <li> So please be careful &amp; if OrganicMed is mentioned as a seller DONT BUY THESE BRUSHES!</li>
            <li> Worked just like the clarosonic brushes just with half the price.</li>
            <li> Because of the poor fit none of them vibrate using the sonic function which makes them useless.  </li>
            <li> never had trouble with the originals</li>
            <li> I will continue using these because I do not like to waste money, but when I run out again I will go ahead and just purchase the brush heads from Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> a month using once a week, she complained that the brush started to stink, moldy smell.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li> people claiming these are different or do not work as well are crazy.</li>
            <li> Also, what is truly disturbing &amp;</li>
            <li> But it did not work as well as I had hoped. :(</li>

            <li> Just a good and much cheaper than the brand name.</li>
            <li> I have a Mia2 and these brush heads work perfectly.  They feel exactly like my sensitive brush that I bought for 25.00.</li>
            <li> I bought these generic Clairsonic brushes expecting them to be the sensitive version. However, I received the normal skin version instead. Because I barely spent any money on these I&#x27;ve decided to use them and they do work great and fit my Clairsonic perfectly. But they are not what I ordered, what was advertised or what I was expecting to receive. I barely spent any money on them and it wasn&#x27;t worth it to me to try to send them back. I will not be buying from this seller again and will be leery on purchasing more at this price wondering if it will always be the bait &amp; switch which is not okay.</li>
            <li> it can&#x27;t fit my clarisonic plus, it will stuck after start for a while , every head was the same</li>
            <li> I have had my Clarisonic Mia for many years. I have always bought their replacement brushes. I saw these brushes and said &#x27;too good to be true&#x27;. But. I tried them anyway. WOW! They work great, at a fraction of the price. I can&#x27;t believe how cheap they were. Will be purchasing them in the future. Great deal!</li>
            <li> These are a super buy, works very well with my clarisonicPro brush.  I change these brushes every three months no problems.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads for my clarisonic mia fit perfectly and the price was great.  Thank you.  I hope to get more in the future.</li>
            <li> my girls gotta have this and this is what they look forward to beauty.....</li>
            <li> These look exactly like the Clarisonic brush heads (I have a Clarisonic Mia).  They fit perfectly; it was extremely easy to put this brush head on .... a simple twist and I had a new brush head on my Mia.  The bristles are very soft (softer than the Clarisonic brand --- I have one new Clarisonic brush head I used for comparison).  I&#x27;m happy with the sonic movement and how clean my face feels with these brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!!!  I will be back for more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> They are great and work just like the $25 store brand. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Good and great price.</li>
            <li> Good fairly stiff bristles , but fits my clarisonic and works great .</li>
            <li> I purchased the replacement heads for sensitive skin hoping they would be the same as the clarisonic brand at a fraction of the cost. Alas, they are not as soft and kind of tough compared to the real deal. It feels more like the deep cleansing brushes which was too abrasive for my skin. I&#x27;ll keep them for periodic cleaning but I can&#x27;t use these every day.</li>
            <li> These brushes fit fine on my Clarisonic Mia 2 and work for the price. However, I will not be ordering again because they start to stink and mold (turn brown) after only a couple weeks (should last 3 months!).</li>
            <li> Not a sensitive head brush. these are rough - there is an ink stamp that says sensitive - but they hurt like heck - rougher than th normal clarisonic brush - going to toss these and buy the brand ones.</li>
            <li> this product it&#x27;s not as good as I expected, it fits perfectly but I don&#x27;t feel my face as clean as I felt it with the original brush, I got what I paid for!!!!!</li>
            <li> Because I have sensitive skin, these are the best Mia brush heads for me. I have been using these heads for 3 years now. The brush heads shipped quickly and were a great value.</li>
            <li> Same look and feel as the Sensitive Brush Heads sold by Clarisonic at a fraction of the price! Fits my Mia 2 perfectly and works just the same. Will absolutely order again!</li>
            <li> Fits ok and my wife did not complain about the feel or have any problem with how well they clean, but…&lt;br /&gt;After a month using once a week, she complained that the brush started to stink, moldy smell.&lt;br /&gt;She never had trouble with the originals and she has not changed how she uses them or cleans the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will fork out the $$$&#x27;s for the original brushes I guess next time which will be much sooner than I thought.</li>
            <li> Worked just like the clarosonic brushes just with half the price. I would definitely buy them again.</li>
            <li> These brushes don&#x27;t work &amp; I think this seller is taking advantage of buyers! I just received my final shipment of brushes (from Hong Kong), &amp; tried them.  The first one screwed on ok, but that&#x27;s about it.  None of them work properly in my 3 month young perfect original Clarisonic.  The brushes are also not what they should be i.e. the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; brush has far less bristle strength than my original Clarisonic Brand &amp;#34;delicate&amp;#34; brush.  You can&#x27;t depend on any of them to work or be the correct bristle strength. Because of the poor fit none of them vibrate using the sonic function which makes them useless.  They are basically a brush screwed onto your Clarisonic buzzing without any power.  After about 30 seconds my Clarisonic began making a strange low pitched noise.  I was afraid of doing damage to it, so I quickly tested all of the brushes, found they were all doing the same thing, then I stopped &amp; never plan on trying another.  Naturally I tried my original brushes &amp; thankfully everything was still in working order.  Also, what is truly disturbing &amp; I don&#x27;t understand how it can be ethical, I bought all of these thru OrganicMed, based on reviews about them, but all 3 types of brushes I bought were shipped by different companies &amp; different addresses with different return policies. This one came from Omeya, &amp; they gave me a partial refund.  They said I could keep the brushes &amp; partial refund providing I give them a 5 star rating!  Are you kidding me?  The nerve to even ask!  They can keep their money &amp; I&#x27;ll be able to warn you instead! I&#x27;ve already alerted Amazon &amp; they&#x27;re investigating this also.  More disturbing news is that I just did a search using my original order #&#x27;s &amp; the items were again listed by OrganicMed but they were now being fulfilled by a completely different company!  How can this be right?  I bought my brushes from OrganicMed but they were sent by 3 different companies.  I suspect they are manufactured by 1 entity &amp; sold to the othersthat in turn sell for whatever they can get.  The defects were all the same from all 3 distributors &amp; that can&#x27;t be a coincidence.  So please be careful &amp; if OrganicMed is mentioned as a seller DONT BUY THESE BRUSHES!</li>
            <li> These work great with my clarisonic and to be honest, you can&#x27;t beat this price. I could not tell a difference between these and my normal brush head.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the original brushes</li>
            <li> I do not see a difference between these and the Clarisonic Brand brushes, so this are a GREAT buy.</li>
            <li> They fit find but clean nothing like the real Clarisonic brush heads. Boo to that!</li>
            <li> The brush head fits the Mia 2 perfectly, and I&#x27;m sure it will fit the other devices as well! But it did not work as well as I had hoped. :( The bristles feel a bit denser and rougher than the Clarisonic brush heads. I was definitely able to tell the difference while using it. The Clarisonic brush heads glide smoothly over the skin whereas it felt like these were giving more resistance while I moved it across my face. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel as clean, and I was able to see more residue than usual on my cotton ball after using toner. I will continue using these because I do not like to waste money, but when I run out again I will go ahead and just purchase the brush heads from Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Works just like the name brand at a fraction of the cost. Will definitely order these again and again. Perfect!</li>
            <li> I am vey pleased with the 4 pack bushes. Give it the highest rating and will order again. Will order again</li>
            <li> The brush itself is fine but normal, not sensitive. The problem is that it doesn&#x27;t fit the Clairsonic properly so that half the time my Clairsonic doesn&#x27;t work,only sits and buzzes.</li>
            <li> These are great and such a good price.  We have been using the Clarisonic for years, but the replacement heads can be pricey.  These worked great.</li>
            <li> These are seriously the exact same thing you buy from Clarisonic. The packaging is identical, even has Clarisonic logo on the brush cap. Even if it is a really great Chinese knock-off... who cares, it does the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;Other people claiming these are different or do not work as well are crazy. You don&#x27;t need to spend $20 every 3 months on a piece of plastic. These are totally worth it.</li>
            <li> my wife is quite happy with these brushes. they seem to work fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprisingly happy with these, and appreciate that each head has a &amp;#34;cap&amp;#34; on it-- thank you for that! The price is wonderful and I WILL repurchase. Thank you for offering them at such a great price!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Works great.</li>
