            <li>It&#x27;s nice to change things up.  </li>
            <li>It can smell like rose or apples, the scent is a chameleon. ^_^[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>As for the perfume itself, it has a citrus smell nicely combined with something woodsy and somewhat musky.</li>

            <li>I really liked the smell of this.</li>

            <li>Love love love this perfume!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thoroughly satisfied with this fragrance and am sure many bottles have been sold on Amazon as a result of my zeal! :)</li>

            <li>i love betsey johnson and her designs.</li>

            <li>This is one of my favorite fragrances</li>

            <li>Fantastic deal!</li>
            <li>I am so in love with this perfume .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments on a perfum.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fan of scarfs, and I love to spray one before I wear it.</li>
            <li>My perfume was lost in the mail and they sent another one free of charge asap!  </li>
            <li>My favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>I hope I will be able to keep buying online.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume, so this didn&#x27;t sit with me well.  </li>
            <li>Love this scent &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I was scared since I am buying online to not get the real deal perfume, but I did &amp; I am so happy.</li>
            <li>i love the price and the size...</li>
            <li>but they discontinued it in most stores,</li>
            <li>Really glad I bought this perfume.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this perfume because I love most fruity floral fragrances.</li>
            <li>just love it and a great price to fast easy shipping</li>
            <li>Its a sweet, warm musk.</li>
            <li>Love it, size and priced just right, fragrance lasts for awhile, one of my favorite perfume to wear and to buy!</li>
            <li>Most of them are too strong and nauseating to me</li>
            <li>Smells great and super pretty bottle.</li>
            <li>Very sweet.</li>
            <li>Very sweet candy type perfume but still wearable for ladies not in their twenties.</li>
            <li>I never smell this kind of perfume I love it so much!</li>
            <li>best price was none other than Amazon</li>
            <li>I like how it smells, and I love the packaging and bottle, so fun!</li>
            <li>If you like your perfumes strong.....</li>
            <li>so if you don&#x27;t like a strong perfume this may or may not be for you .</li>
            <li>The scent is somewhat strong and I always give a spray to my neck, shoulder &amp; a spray to my hair.</li>
            <li>The scent was to strong and the bottle is made of plastic.  </li>
            <li>Though the first 5-10min it is strong, it settles nicely and I receive compliments anywhere from morning to evening.</li>
            <li>This parfum is amazing, very fruty!</li>
            <li>Perfect  lively scent for a young person</li>
            <li>they say a size 10 on bottom, fit like a size 8.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of a cheap children&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light scent</li>
            <li>.There&#x27;s also Aquolina&#x27;s Pink Sugar that&#x27;s good for teens as well as adults!</li>
            <li>The bottle is pretty, and the scent stays on without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume on my fifth or six bottle by now first received it as a gift since then</li>
            <li>This smells great, and the scent lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>When I originally ordered this perfume, I was so excited I gave it five stars.  </li>
            <li>Of course amazon is amazing as well :) Definitely recommend this perfume.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unique, young, fun and can also be sexy and great for your professional life.</li>
            <li>It really was a great price for the size of the bottle and came pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this perfume and the seller shipped this to me pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>The scent is perfect and hard to match.</li>
            <li>The scent reminds me of warm vanilla sugar cookies surrounded by fresh flowers at high tea.  </li>
            <li>Though its got a sweet tint to it so they might .</li>
            <li>Not too sweet but not too musky.  </li>
            <li>it smells soo good and last all night ..</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s also very affordable.</li>
            <li>It is sweet and feminine with a hint of sophistication.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t smelled it on myself prior to purchasing it, so there was a chance it wouldn&#x27;t smell good on my skin.</li>
            <li>Love the perfume, love the deal; I will definitely be back!</li>
            <li>This bottle is huge, which is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>and it was pretty cheap to.</li>
            <li>I appreciate a light, pretty scent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in Florida and when it&#x27;s hot (always) you want to keep things light &amp; fresh.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>and so I just had to make it my new favorite must have.</li>
            <li>I love trying new scents from Amazon because its cheaper than shopping at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I first came across this scent in 2007 and have been wearing it ever since!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say this is a more mature scent</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it to buy.</li>
            <li>I can smell the scent throughout the day, and that makes me smile.</li>
            <li>Fresh, fun, exciting and not a bore.  </li>
            <li>That goofy pink mantilla-type top always make me smile.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Opened it right away</li>
            <li>I contacted Amazon about the problem and they replaced the perfume right away.  </li>
            <li>If you want to get your teen a perfume I&#x27;d suggest a Gwen Stefani (more likely one of the Harajuku lovers perfumes), Vera Wang (most like Princess), or Escada (there&#x27;s a vareity of fruity, sweet scents in the Escada line) perfume .</li>
            <li>I paid $50 at a large retail store for 1/3 of the amount on this deal!</li>
            <li>I had previously bought this perfume and LOVED it.</li>
            <li>This seductive, yet fun and fruity fragrance is sure to be addictive to you and everyone around you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High</li>
            <li>and it is lasting but not over powering and a great surprise in my last order</li>
            <li>I feel so fresh, young, fancy and free when I wear it...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so hard to judge perfume, you really need to be able to test it out on your own skin before you know</li>
            <li>either that or my skin type doesnt go well with the perfume I do recomend to get a sample first and then decide what you want to do</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s similar to the fragrance I had grown to love</li>
            <li>Got perfume at ross, instantly fell in love with it and now the price I paid of 14$</li>
            <li>Love it for a daily wear.</li>
            <li>The description sounded like exactly what my wife would like.</li>
            <li>I bought it on a whim because of the designer and the pretty package.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so pretty</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s priced fantastically here at amazon unlike the department store that I first noticed at.  </li>
            <li>I lined it up on the first \\&quot;B\\&quot;</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>THis is almost like Britnay Spears first perfume.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t appreciate the musk, but combined with the citrus, it does create a pleasant odor.</li>
            <li>This is my 3rd time to purchase it and I will keep coming back for more!</li>
            <li>Also, a little side note.. there is a website called fragrancex.com where you can buy cheap designer perfume and they almost always give you coupon codes for free shipping.</li>
            <li>but i was very disapointed by the fragrance.</li>
            <li>I was afraid it was going to spell expired but the scent is perfectly preserved.</li>
            <li>The lotion made my skin feel very silky and the smell was a lot milder than the perfume.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really wear perfume</li>
            <li>Extremely fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve sampled other perfumes and I can honestly say more people LOVE this one hands down over any of my other scents!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the smell, last a long time always getting compliments, great price compare to other stores!!!!  </li>
            <li>I usually wear clinique happy or the blue Ralph Lauren</li>
            <li>Luckily I really like the smell (sweet w/ a little floral but only undertones) and the scent is appropriate for work, going out, running errands...very versatile.</li>
            <li>quick delivery and a lot cheaper than macy&#x27;s where the same size is $75.</li>
            <li>Shipping time was decent too.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this perfume, I wear this perfume everyday.</li>
            <li>first day I wore this, I got several compliments... which makes you wonder, did I put on too much?  </li>
            <li>none the less.&lt;br /&gt;I am very sensitive to scents but Betesy Johnsons&#x27;s name sake did not disappoint.</li>
            <li>My favorite everyday perfume!</li>
            <li>My daughter bought some at marshalls and when she squirted some on me and I was not thrilled until a few minutes later the smell was awesome</li>
            <li>but this is the only one i&#x27;ll wear when i first smelled it</li>
            <li>thought I&#x27;d try my luck on amazon, its exactly the same scent</li>
            <li>but when I find \\&quot;the one\\&quot; (usually by smelling it on someone else) I&#x27;ll make sure I find out what it is even if I have to ask a complete stranger what it is they&#x27;re wearing.</li>
            <li>but I paid half what I had and for a bigger bottle, love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this perfume for nearly three years and still receive compliments from strangers on a weekly basis.</li>
            <li>but I miss the old smell.</li>
            <li>No matter how old this perfume is since it came out</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite perfume, and I had run out of my other smaller bottle, so I&#x27;m hoping that this one will last me a while.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time also, rare for a low end perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, the size is really big and way cheaper then at a dept. store.</li>
            <li>My husband is not a fan of this perfume because it is too strong during the initial spray, but after a few minutes on my person, it does even out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little intense (but not overtly intense)</li>
            <li>I first encountered this perfume at Sephora&#x27;s the other day .</li>
            <li>No other perfume has matched my personality to a T like this one.</li>
            <li>although just like B.J.&#x27;s other scent TooToo, I wish the whole bottle  was glass but</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s nice to change things up.  </li>
            <li> It can smell like rose or apples, the scent is a chameleon. ^_^[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> As for the perfume itself, it has a citrus smell nicely combined with something woodsy and somewhat musky.</li>
            <li> I get so many good compliments on this.</li>
            <li> I really liked the smell of this.</li>
            <li> The product came extremely quickly and I thought that it was sold at a great price.</li>

            <li> I get more compliments on it than anything else I own.  </li>
            <li> Love love love this perfume!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thoroughly satisfied with this fragrance and am sure many bottles have been sold on Amazon as a result of my zeal! :)</li>

            <li> i love betsey johnson and her designs.</li>

            <li> Fantastic deal!</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this perfume .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments on a perfum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of scarfs, and I love to spray one before I wear it.</li>
            <li> My perfume was lost in the mail and they sent another one free of charge asap!  </li>
            <li> My favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> I hope I will be able to keep buying online.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume, so this didn&#x27;t sit with me well.  </li>
            <li> Love this scent &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I was scared since I am buying online to not get the real deal perfume, but I did &amp; I am so happy.</li>
            <li> i love the price and the size...</li>
            <li> but they discontinued it in most stores,</li>
            <li> Really glad I bought this perfume.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this perfume because I love most fruity floral fragrances.</li>
            <li> just love it and a great price to fast easy shipping</li>
            <li> Its a sweet, warm musk.</li>
            <li> Love it, size and priced just right, fragrance lasts for awhile, one of my favorite perfume to wear and to buy!</li>
            <li> Most of them are too strong and nauseating to me</li>
            <li> Smells great and super pretty bottle.</li>
            <li> Very sweet.</li>
            <li> Very sweet candy type perfume but still wearable for ladies not in their twenties.</li>
            <li> I never smell this kind of perfume I love it so much!</li>
            <li> best price was none other than Amazon</li>
            <li> I like how it smells, and I love the packaging and bottle, so fun!</li>
            <li> If you like your perfumes strong.....</li>
            <li> so if you don&#x27;t like a strong perfume this may or may not be for you .</li>
            <li> The scent is somewhat strong and I always give a spray to my neck, shoulder &amp; a spray to my hair.</li>
            <li> The scent was to strong and the bottle is made of plastic.  </li>
            <li> Though the first 5-10min it is strong, it settles nicely and I receive compliments anywhere from morning to evening.</li>
            <li> This parfum is amazing, very fruty!</li>
            <li> Perfect  lively scent for a young person</li>
            <li> they say a size 10 on bottom, fit like a size 8.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of a cheap children&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light scent</li>
            <li> .There&#x27;s also Aquolina&#x27;s Pink Sugar that&#x27;s good for teens as well as adults!</li>
            <li> The bottle is pretty, and the scent stays on without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume on my fifth or six bottle by now first received it as a gift since then</li>
            <li> This smells great, and the scent lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> When I originally ordered this perfume, I was so excited I gave it five stars.  </li>
            <li> Of course amazon is amazing as well :) Definitely recommend this perfume.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unique, young, fun and can also be sexy and great for your professional life.</li>
            <li> It really was a great price for the size of the bottle and came pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume and the seller shipped this to me pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> The scent is perfect and hard to match.</li>
            <li> The scent reminds me of warm vanilla sugar cookies surrounded by fresh flowers at high tea.  </li>
            <li> Though its got a sweet tint to it so they might .</li>
            <li> Not too sweet but not too musky.  </li>
            <li> it smells soo good and last all night ..</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s also very affordable.</li>
            <li> It is sweet and feminine with a hint of sophistication.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t smelled it on myself prior to purchasing it, so there was a chance it wouldn&#x27;t smell good on my skin.</li>
            <li> Love the perfume, love the deal; I will definitely be back!</li>
            <li> This bottle is huge, which is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> and it was pretty cheap to.</li>
            <li> I appreciate a light, pretty scent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in Florida and when it&#x27;s hot (always) you want to keep things light &amp; fresh.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> and so I just had to make it my new favorite must have.</li>
            <li> I love trying new scents from Amazon because its cheaper than shopping at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I first came across this scent in 2007 and have been wearing it ever since!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say this is a more mature scent</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it to buy.</li>
            <li> I can smell the scent throughout the day, and that makes me smile.</li>
            <li> Fresh, fun, exciting and not a bore.  </li>
            <li> That goofy pink mantilla-type top always make me smile.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Opened it right away</li>
            <li> I contacted Amazon about the problem and they replaced the perfume right away.  </li>
            <li> If you want to get your teen a perfume I&#x27;d suggest a Gwen Stefani (more likely one of the Harajuku lovers perfumes), Vera Wang (most like Princess), or Escada (there&#x27;s a vareity of fruity, sweet scents in the Escada line) perfume .</li>
            <li> I paid $50 at a large retail store for 1/3 of the amount on this deal!</li>
            <li> I had previously bought this perfume and LOVED it.</li>
            <li> This seductive, yet fun and fruity fragrance is sure to be addictive to you and everyone around you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High</li>
            <li> and it is lasting but not over powering and a great surprise in my last order</li>
            <li> I feel so fresh, young, fancy and free when I wear it...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to judge perfume, you really need to be able to test it out on your own skin before you know</li>
            <li> either that or my skin type doesnt go well with the perfume I do recomend to get a sample first and then decide what you want to do</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s similar to the fragrance I had grown to love</li>
            <li> Got perfume at ross, instantly fell in love with it and now the price I paid of 14$</li>
            <li> Love it for a daily wear.</li>
            <li> The description sounded like exactly what my wife would like.</li>
            <li> I bought it on a whim because of the designer and the pretty package.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so pretty</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s priced fantastically here at amazon unlike the department store that I first noticed at.  </li>
            <li> I lined it up on the first \\&quot;B\\&quot;</li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> THis is almost like Britnay Spears first perfume.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t appreciate the musk, but combined with the citrus, it does create a pleasant odor.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd time to purchase it and I will keep coming back for more!</li>
            <li> Also, a little side note.. there is a website called fragrancex.com where you can buy cheap designer perfume and they almost always give you coupon codes for free shipping.</li>
            <li> but i was very disapointed by the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it was going to spell expired but the scent is perfectly preserved.</li>
            <li> The lotion made my skin feel very silky and the smell was a lot milder than the perfume.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really wear perfume</li>
            <li> Extremely fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve sampled other perfumes and I can honestly say more people LOVE this one hands down over any of my other scents!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the smell, last a long time always getting compliments, great price compare to other stores!!!!  </li>
            <li> I usually wear clinique happy or the blue Ralph Lauren</li>
            <li> Luckily I really like the smell (sweet w/ a little floral but only undertones) and the scent is appropriate for work, going out, running errands...very versatile.</li>
            <li> quick delivery and a lot cheaper than macy&#x27;s where the same size is $75.</li>
            <li> Shipping time was decent too.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume, I wear this perfume everyday.</li>
            <li> first day I wore this, I got several compliments... which makes you wonder, did I put on too much?  </li>
            <li> none the less.&lt;br /&gt;I am very sensitive to scents but Betesy Johnsons&#x27;s name sake did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> My favorite everyday perfume!</li>
            <li> My daughter bought some at marshalls and when she squirted some on me and I was not thrilled until a few minutes later the smell was awesome</li>
            <li> but this is the only one i&#x27;ll wear when i first smelled it</li>
            <li> thought I&#x27;d try my luck on amazon, its exactly the same scent</li>
            <li> but when I find \\&quot;the one\\&quot; (usually by smelling it on someone else) I&#x27;ll make sure I find out what it is even if I have to ask a complete stranger what it is they&#x27;re wearing.</li>
            <li> but I paid half what I had and for a bigger bottle, love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this perfume for nearly three years and still receive compliments from strangers on a weekly basis.</li>
            <li> but I miss the old smell.</li>
            <li> No matter how old this perfume is since it came out</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite perfume, and I had run out of my other smaller bottle, so I&#x27;m hoping that this one will last me a while.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time also, rare for a low end perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, the size is really big and way cheaper then at a dept. store.</li>
            <li> My husband is not a fan of this perfume because it is too strong during the initial spray, but after a few minutes on my person, it does even out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little intense (but not overtly intense)</li>
            <li> I first encountered this perfume at Sephora&#x27;s the other day .</li>
            <li> No other perfume has matched my personality to a T like this one.</li>
            <li> although just like B.J.&#x27;s other scent TooToo, I wish the whole bottle  was glass but</li>
            <li> When I first tried it on, I noticed I could hardly smell the scent, but thought maybe it was just that I had been used to it.  </li>
            <li> Loved the smell but was disappointed on the quality.</li>
            <li> with this perfume i smell it all day long.</li>
            <li> I wish that I had discovered this fragrance a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> This perfume has a long life in the skin.</li>
            <li> But I also thought it smelled a little different.  </li>
            <li> the topper part in pink is plastic.  </li>
            <li> The pink foo-foo topper just gets in the way.  </li>
            <li> Perfume arrived today; it is empty and has spilled out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Perfume seems to be watered down and can&#x27;t smell it for very long.  </li>
            <li> I personally hate a perfume so strong that I can smell without actually bringing the crook of my arm up to smell where I have sprayed it.</li>
            <li> it does not stay longer than I expected but!</li>
            <li> I have no idea how to describe the scent other then intoxicating.</li>
            <li> The other day I sprayed before going to the gym (yes, I prefer Betsy Johnson over my BO when exercising) and received a compliment in the Starbucks line after my workout.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took at least 3 times for her to remind me of the name of this perfume but finally the name stuck with me</li>
            <li> I bought this product just for the perfume as I&#x27;ve been wearing it since it came out five or some odd years ago.</li>
            <li> Bad idea ordered the perfume received the tracking information rather quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit girly, but layered with body lotion</li>
            <li> only I weren&#x27;t a poor college student :C ).</li>
            <li> so I have gone through about 4 bottles in the past 5 years.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if teens would like it . ..</li>
            <li> I have worn it a couple times now and unlike some perfumes I have worn in the past it didn&#x27;t give me a headache after having it on for a couple hours</li>
            <li> Order it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed the only disappointment will stem from guilt if you don&#x27;t order it ;)</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to tell where the hole is.  </li>
            <li> I am terribly dissappointed and would have rather applied the $20.00 to the real thing.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, she loves it and so do I.</li>
            <li> so I won&#x27;t blind myself on hectic mornings...</li>
            <li> I think I may have ordered the wrong bottle or they reformulated it.</li>
            <li> sadly I&#x27;ve been out for approx.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very addicted to this</li>
            <li> bottle is annoying.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I luv this perfume... it is the best... I get so many compliments from it.. üòç</li>
            <li> i love betsey johnson and her designs. if anyone asks me i&#x27;m like a Betsey Johnson groupy but i was very disapointed by the fragrance. the pachouli is what makes it not work for me. either that or my skin type doesnt go well with the perfume I do recomend to get a sample first and then decide what you want to do</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product</li>
            <li> Love the smell, last a long time always getting compliments, great price compare to other stores!!!!  I recommend this product, can&#x27;t beat the price for the amount you receive !!!</li>
            <li> As much as I love fragrance, I can&#x27;t say that there are many out there that I absolutely love and just have to have. Most of them are too strong and nauseating to me but when I find \\&quot;the one\\&quot; (usually by smelling it on someone else) I&#x27;ll make sure I find out what it is even if I have to ask a complete stranger what it is they&#x27;re wearing. My favorite must-have used to be Bath &amp; Body Works Breathe Romance Amber Myrrh fragrance mist and then, of course, they discontinued it. (Never understand why companies stop making a good thing that&#x27;s very popular???) So when I got a whiff of this fragrance (one of my friends/co-workers) wears, I just had to know what it was. It&#x27;s similar to the fragrance I had grown to love and so I just had to make it my new favorite must have. She told me it was Betsey Johnson but I had never heard of the perfume nor had I heard of the designer, Betsey Johnson so I could never remember. It took at least 3 times for her to remind me of the name of this perfume but finally the name stuck with me and I began my search...best price was none other than Amazon and I was pleasantly surprised at how beautiful the bottle and packaging is...not to mention the wonderful scent!</li>
            <li> Got perfume at ross, instantly fell in love with it and now the price I paid of 14$</li>
            <li> Had to order it as my name is &amp;#34;Betsy Johnson&amp;#34;!  Smells good!</li>
            <li> I used to have this perfume a while back and I loved it! Then I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere, but then I finally found it! So happy! I really love this perfume.</li>
            <li> Betsy Johnson perfume arrived on time and my wife loves it.</li>
            <li> Very light and flowery scent that is sure not to over power the nose. Love it for a daily wear.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances so I have gone through about 4 bottles in the past 5 years. at $28 for a 3.4 oz bottle, you have an unbeatable deal! I was afraid it was going to spell expired but the scent is perfectly preserved. If you like this perfume, you won&#x27;t regret buying from this seller at such a deal!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this perfume because I love most fruity floral fragrances. Unfortunately,I found it to be very strong on the musk side which I&#x27;m not a fan of. I felt incredibly self conscious while wearing it because I thought it would offend others. If you like your perfumes strong..... this ones for you.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume! I usually wear clinique happy or the blue Ralph Lauren but this one is amazing! Also, a little side note.. there is a website called fragrancex.com where you can buy cheap designer perfume and they almost always give you coupon codes for free shipping. Of course amazon is amazing as well :) Definitely recommend this perfume. I always get compliments when i wear it!</li>
            <li> MMMMMMM, I love the way this smells on my girl.  Great pricing from Amazon!</li>
            <li> It really was a great price for the size of the bottle and came pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume... it reminds me of Paris Hilton&#x27;s \\&quot;CanCan\\&quot; as well as Britney Spear&#x27;s \\&quot;Fantasy.\\&quot; It has a very pleasant, sweet aroma.</li>
            <li> This product smells great and the price is even better. Is great smell for any day or night event i keep it with me!!</li>
            <li> I had previously bought this perfume and LOVED it. My roomate bought it and she Loved it. I highly recommend it, the size is really big and way cheaper then at a dept. store. The bottle is pretty, and the scent stays on without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews. It was described perfectly. The description sounded like exactly what my wife would like. SOooo I pulled the trigger and got it for her. Needless to say, she loves it and so do I.</li>
            <li> My favorite everyday perfume! I get so many compliments on it!</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume combo for my daughter. I thought it came with lotion but it was body wash.  Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> I first encountered this perfume at Sephora&#x27;s the other day . .and I fell absolutely in love (it tore me apart to leave the store without it . . .if only I weren&#x27;t a poor college student :C ). This seductive, yet fun and fruity fragrance is sure to be addictive to you and everyone around you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High Notes include: grapefruit,tangerine, black-berry currants, and pear&lt;br /&gt;Mid-Notes include: freesia, lily-of-the-valley, and apple&lt;br /&gt;Low Notes include: cedarwood, sandalwood, musk, praline, and amber&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips/Suggestions/Comments involving Betsey Johnson:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It&#x27;s a little intense (but not overtly intense) so if you don&#x27;t like a strong perfume this may or may not be for you . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) It&#x27;s long-lasting so it&#x27;s great for a day at work or even a night out in town . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) I&#x27;d say this is a more mature scent so I&#x27;m not sure if teens would like it . .. Though its got a sweet tint to it so they might . . .but I don&#x27;t know if it would be good to risk it . .. If you want to get your teen a perfume I&#x27;d suggest a Gwen Stefani (more likely one of the Harajuku lovers perfumes), Vera Wang (most like Princess), or Escada (there&#x27;s a vareity of fruity, sweet scents in the Escada line) perfume . .There&#x27;s also Aquolina&#x27;s Pink Sugar that&#x27;s good for teens as well as adults!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume and the seller shipped this to me pretty quickly.  I would reccomend both the perfume and the seller.  If you like a perfume with floral and fruity notes, try this one.  P.S. -- EVERY time I wear it I am complimented.</li>
            <li> Smells nice. Came as pictured.</li>
            <li> My wife is very happy with this perfume. Smells awesome and it&#x27;s a great price. It even came with a scented bottle of lotion.</li>
            <li> smells great. I absolutely love this perfume, I wear this perfume everyday. it does not stay longer than I expected but! it&#x27;s worth it to buy. I never smell this kind of perfume I love it so much!</li>
            <li> I saw this perfume at marshalls and i never knew betsey johnson made perfume. I bought it on a whim because of the designer and the pretty package. Im so happy i did! i love this perfume it smells so good and it was pretty cheap to. I have no idea how to describe the scent other then intoxicating. throughout the day i smell it which is nice. sometime i buy perfume and you smell it for an hour and then thats it. with this perfume i smell it all day long. i truley love this perfume and i will definatley be buying more when my bottle runs out!</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery, Very great size bottle!!! They are good sellers fersure. Will be buying more</li>
            <li> Great scent.  I received this for my Birthday and I fell over for the bottle.  It&#x27;s so pretty although just like B.J.&#x27;s other scent TooToo, I wish the whole bottle  was glass but the topper part in pink is plastic.  But it&#x27;s a nice bottle none the less.&lt;br /&gt;I am very sensitive to scents but Betesy Johnsons&#x27;s name sake did not disappoint. I have worn it a couple times now and unlike some perfumes I have worn in the past it didn&#x27;t give me a headache after having it on for a couple hours so that&#x27;s a plus.  The scent will last through the day into night without reapplying.  It&#x27;s priced fantastically here at amazon unlike the department store that I first noticed at.  The scent reminds me of warm vanilla sugar cookies surrounded by fresh flowers at high tea.  I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to judge perfume, you really need to be able to test it out on your own skin before you know if it&#x27;s a keeper...  I appreciate a light, pretty scent.  Not too sweet but not too musky.  I&#x27;m in Florida and when it&#x27;s hot (always) you want to keep things light &amp; fresh.&lt;br /&gt;The first day I wore this, I got several compliments... which makes you wonder, did I put on too much?  One woman ran after me into Target to tell me I smelled \\&quot;wonderful\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s a little bit girly, but layered with body lotion it seems to mellow.  It lasts a long time also, rare for a low end perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to embrace the girly-pinkness. It&#x27;s nice to change things up.  The price is amazing too.  I would probably get it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is annoying. The pink foo-foo topper just gets in the way.  The nozzle is all one color so it&#x27;s hard to tell where the hole is.  I lined it up on the first \\&quot;B\\&quot; so I won&#x27;t blind myself on hectic mornings...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this perfume for nearly three years and still receive compliments from strangers on a weekly basis. After receiving one of those compliments today, I decided to post about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw a reviewer post that the bottle she received was plastic. I&#x27;ve never received anything but glass from Amazon. I do, however, always order the 3.4 ounce bottle, so perhaps smaller versions are not always glass. The scent is somewhat strong and I always give a spray to my neck, shoulder &amp; a spray to my hair. Though the first 5-10min it is strong, it settles nicely and I receive compliments anywhere from morning to evening. The other day I sprayed before going to the gym (yes, I prefer Betsy Johnson over my BO when exercising) and received a compliment in the Starbucks line after my workout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thoroughly satisfied with this fragrance and am sure many bottles have been sold on Amazon as a result of my zeal! :)</li>
            <li> Love this scent. This is one that you spray a lot on and it offends no one. Very sweet. Would be a good signature scent.</li>
            <li> Love it, size and priced just right, fragrance lasts for awhile, one of my favorite perfume to wear and to buy!</li>
            <li> I ordered the Betsy Johnson perfume last week, now I have been wearing this fragrance for about 2 years. However after not wanting to pay the retail price any longer I attempted to purchase from Amazon.. Bad idea ordered the perfume received the tracking information rather quickly. Perfume arrived today; it is empty and has spilled out of the bottle. The bottle also has an orange ring around the bottom not reminiscent at all of the Betsy Johnson I am accustomed to. I am terribly dissappointed and would have rather applied the $20.00 to the real thing. I have been dooped by Amazon 3 times in one week. Shoes finally arrived from China they say a size 10 on bottom, fit like a size 8. ONCE AGAIN MY PERFUME WAS SPILLED INSIDE THE BOX, could have been a mistake by the carrier,(maybe) but there is no way to receive a refund since the contents are flammable!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume but when I got it it didn&#x27;t smell like I remembered. I think I may have ordered the wrong bottle or they reformulated it. I&#x27;m using it but I miss the old smell.</li>
            <li> So I bought this online after reading some reviews on here and I was worried because I usually don&#x27;t buy perfume without smelling it first. But I went ahead and bought it and I can say I am in love with this scent!!!! And the scent stays on all day!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome product and price! Good buy, will buy again.</li>
            <li> My daughter bought some at marshalls and when she squirted some on me and I was not thrilled until a few minutes later the smell was awesome and then I had to have some so I looked on amazon and got the big bottle!</li>
            <li> Love this scent. Its a sweet, warm musk. It can smell like rose or apples, the scent is a chameleon. ^_^[[ASIN:B000P3X8HY Betsey Johnson By Betsey Johnson For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 3.4 oz]]</li>
            <li> Fantastic deal! I paid $50 at a large retail store for 1/3 of the amount on this deal! Love the perfume, love the deal; I will definitely be back!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Betsey perfume since I was 16 (I&#x27;m now 21).  I love the smell of it, and I always get compliments!  It stays on all day, I never leave home without it on.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I bought this perfume. I DONT LIKE IT AT ALL!! it is not feminine, not pleasing , not flattering at all. I gave it a one star for the bottle cover</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this perfume . my mom bought it for me for Christmas and it was the best thing ever. it smells soo good and last all night ..</li>
            <li> I love this perfume on my fifth or six bottle by now first received it as a gift since then I buy it great smell and it is lasting but not over powering and a great surprise in my last order it had body lotion added to my box just love it and a great price to fast easy shipping</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister as a christmas present and she absolutely loves it! Smells great and super pretty bottle.</li>
            <li> I personally hate a perfume so strong that I can smell without actually bringing the crook of my arm up to smell where I have sprayed it. Have worn this for years and still get daily compliments from my husband.</li>
            <li> I got a great deal on this. I like how it smells, and I love the packaging and bottle, so fun!</li>
            <li> I bought this product just for the perfume as I&#x27;ve been wearing it since it came out five or some odd years ago. $30 is a great price for the Betsey Johnson perfume but to my surprise, this package came with a greatly scented lotion. The lotion made my skin feel very silky and the smell was a lot milder than the perfume. My husband is not a fan of this perfume because it is too strong during the initial spray, but after a few minutes on my person, it does even out. As for the perfume itself, it has a citrus smell nicely combined with something woodsy and somewhat musky. I usually don&#x27;t appreciate the musk, but combined with the citrus, it does create a pleasant odor.</li>
            <li> This parfum is amazing, very fruty! quick delivery and a lot cheaper than macy&#x27;s where the same size is $75. Great deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments on a perfum. I love it and was so happy when I got it!</li>
            <li> Opened it right away and it leaks everywhere</li>
            <li> The best perfume ever.  I get so many good compliments on this.</li>
            <li> This bottle is huge, which is exactly what I wanted. This is by far my favorite perfume, and I had run out of my other smaller bottle, so I&#x27;m hoping that this one will last me a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this for a couple years now and I adore it! Betsey Johnson is my favorite designer and her perfume is just as awesome as her handbags and clothing. Shipping time was decent too.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and great product!</li>
            <li> Perfect  lively scent for a young person</li>
            <li> I love trying new scents from Amazon because its cheaper than shopping at Macy&#x27;s. This smells great, and the scent lasts a long time. I&#x27;m a fan of scarfs, and I love to spray one before I wear it. I can smell the scent throughout the day, and that makes me smile.</li>
            <li> My perfume was lost in the mail and they sent another one free of charge asap!  And they were very nice about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I love this perfume!  I get more compliments on it than anything else I own.  It smells amazing!</li>
            <li> The product came extremely quickly and I thought that it was sold at a great price. Amazing scent, I love it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really wear perfume but this is the only one i&#x27;ll wear when i first smelled it i felt like if i didn&#x27;t get it i couldn&#x27;t sleep lol</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift and recipient was very pleased with the scent and it has since become their go-to Eau de Parfum.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> Favorite perfume at a wonderful price !</li>
            <li> Awesome product. It arrived just in time for my daughters birthday.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume. It smells so good</li>
            <li> The scent was to strong and the bottle is made of plastic.  It reminds me of a cheap children&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li> They stopped selling this perfume in the stores, so I stopped wearing it. Then I saw it online and bought it. I forgot how much I loved it. The scent is perfect and hard to match. I hope I will be able to keep buying online.</li>
            <li> When I originally ordered this perfume, I was so excited I gave it five stars.  However, that was before opening the package.  When I first tried it on, I noticed I could hardly smell the scent, but thought maybe it was just that I had been used to it.  But I also thought it smelled a little different.  This is my favorite perfume, so this didn&#x27;t sit with me well.  I then started to get comments from people telling me that my perfume smelled like peaches.. or that they couldn&#x27;t notice it at all. I contacted Amazon about the problem and they replaced the perfume right away.  I am completely satisfied now and looking forward to my delivery!!!  Love this scent &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this same perfume for 3 years now. I love it. It can be strong at times but it has a very nice scent to it. I love that it&#x27;s also very affordable. I read they stopped making it which is upsetting.</li>
            <li> Always a good time with Betsey.  Fresh, fun, exciting and not a bore.  Just what you need to get the heck off to work on a Monday.  That goofy pink mantilla-type top always make me smile. How can you not have a good day.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells great! This is my 3rd time to purchase it and I will keep coming back for more! Love it and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Perfume seems to be watered down and can&#x27;t smell it for very long.  Loved the smell but was disappointed on the quality.</li>
            <li> I really liked the smell of this. I use it alot. Had been looking for awhile for this. THis is almost like Britnay Spears first perfume.</li>
            <li> I wish that I had discovered this fragrance a long time ago.  It is sweet and feminine with a hint of sophistication.</li>
            <li> EVRY TIME I PASS A MAN OR WOMAN THEY SAY, I SMELL SEXY!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this item in stores any longer.  It&#x27;s light scent and I always get compliments when I wear it.  What would we do without amazon?</li>
            <li> I was scared since I am buying online to not get the real deal perfume, but I did &amp; I am so happy. No matter how old this perfume is since it came out I love it &amp; it smells sweetly great.</li>
            <li> I first came across this scent in 2007 and have been wearing it ever since! It&#x27;s unique, young, fun and can also be sexy and great for your professional life. No other perfume has matched my personality to a T like this one. I still get compliments to this day. I hope this product stays in production because I will wear it for the rest of my life. I&#x27;m so in love with this smell!!!</li>
            <li> Love it! Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Love love love this perfume!  Extremely fast shipping.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> i love the price and the size...i recommended to all my friends an i will buy it again..&lt;br /&gt;Please buy it soon</li>
            <li> This perfume has a long life in the skin. You&#x27;ll get many people complimenting you telling you how GREAT you smell. I&#x27;m very addicted to this sadly I&#x27;ve been out for approx. 2mo. I&#x27;ve sampled other perfumes and I can honestly say more people LOVE this one hands down over any of my other scents!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your undecided...don&#x27;t be!!! Order it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed the only disappointment will stem from guilt if you don&#x27;t order it ;)</li>
            <li> Betsey Johnson struck gold with me and my body chemistry with this fragrance, everywhere i go people tell me they love it!! I feel so fresh, young, fancy and free when I wear it...</li>
            <li> Perfect - super fast delivery.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume! Great price too!</li>
            <li> Happy daughter when she opened this great perfume for xmas. It smells lovely! Nice fancy bottle for display purposes too!</li>
            <li> One of the best perfumes I&#x27;ve gotten on Amazon! Very sweet candy type perfume but still wearable for ladies not in their twenties. A really great price.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume a couple years back but they discontinued it in most stores, thought I&#x27;d try my luck on amazon, its exactly the same scent but I paid half what I had and for a bigger bottle, love it</li>
            <li> Really glad I bought this perfume. I hadn&#x27;t smelled it on myself prior to purchasing it, so there was a chance it wouldn&#x27;t smell good on my skin. Luckily I really like the smell (sweet w/ a little floral but only undertones) and the scent is appropriate for work, going out, running errands...very versatile. I&#x27;ve since found this perfume at Nordstrom Rack, so if you want to smell it first, that might be your best bet.</li>
