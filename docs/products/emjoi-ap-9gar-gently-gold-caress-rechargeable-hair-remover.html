    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I like best about this</li>
            <li>The trade off is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>and I was very happy with it.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t* recommend using it in the bikini area), but works great and lasts days longer than shaving!</li>
            <li>well, in 5 minutes I had 1/2 a leg done and looked great!!</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>a word, AWESOME!  </li>
            <li>This IS an excellent product!</li>
            <li>I was very happy with that but could not find another to replace it with so bought the EMJOY</li>
            <li>I got this in 2007, and it still works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>The best advice I can give is to not treat it like a razor.  </li>
            <li>What I found works best is to use it before I shower, all it takes is 5 minutes</li>
            <li>You do have get use to it, but it does an excellent job of keeping the hair away.   </li>
            <li>Perfect, in my book, so I recommend this.  </li>
            <li>Buy it, you will be happy!</li>
            <li>It was great!!!!  </li>
            <li>LOVE THIS THING!!!!</li>
            <li>What a great money-saving beauty tool!</li>
            <li>Thank you, It&#x27;s wonderful</li>
            <li>This product is great!  </li>
            <li>Even though, initially it is very good, it is not a reliable product.  </li>
            <li>This product does a very good job in removing the hair.  </li>
            <li>- I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s ideal for everyone</li>
            <li>C&#x27;est la vie, six years is still a good run!</li>
            <li>It seems to be a great system though.  </li>
            <li>I read about this in a magazine, and the Amazon reviews were great, so I put it on my wish list.  </li>
            <li>It has worked great.  </li>
            <li>Rechargable option is great as the cord does not get on your way.  </li>
            <li>I was so happy to see that I didn&#x27;t need to shave every day.  </li>
            <li>and I was keeping up with it and happy with the results.    </li>
            <li>I started my legs and it brought tears to my eyes (and not tears of joy).  </li>
            <li>If you can get through the pain on your legs, this product would give you great results.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this 5 years ago and it still works great.  </li>
            <li>but this works great.  </li>
            <li>just great.  </li>
            <li>(this is great).</li>
            <li>This product is GREAT for underarms.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it worked great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Emjoi for two months now and am so happy that I no longer have to pay for ongoing trips to the salon.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re great.  </li>
            <li>definitely a great product.  </li>
            <li>Guys, please watch out for their promotional certificate discount, as they will find a cheap way to cheat on their customers!!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very effective.  </li>
            <li>very nice thing is that</li>
            <li>I love it and it works great!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE MY EMJOI, THE BEST!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled!</li>
            <li>This item is wonderful because I can do it at my own pace and on my own schedule.  </li>
            <li>This device is probably best for those with fine hair, or for use on the face.</li>
            <li>And to get all the hair off of your lower legs, you&#x27;ll probably need a couple hours to do a really good job.</li>
            <li>and I am impressed at how smooth they feel.</li>
            <li>He started using the Emjoi and loved it.  </li>
            <li>The Emjoi had good reviews, so I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>Bottom line, if keeping your legs smooth is a battle, this is the best weapon of choice!</li>
            <li>I took this looking at some good reviews.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think this is a great product, and I am glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>I am most happy about the bikini line.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this item!  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>, I love it!  </li>
            <li>will continue to use this as I love not having to shave every day!</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator, and I am highly impressed.  </li>
            <li>I love it and will never be without one!  </li>
            <li>It was amazing.</li>
            <li>Use at your own risk</li>
            <li>But the nice thing with this is you can use it</li>
            <li>The nice thing about it</li>
            <li>* while using Emjoi to reduce catching your skin.</li>
            <li>I liked it a lot...</li>
            <li>I found it gave the most painless GOOD results  </li>
            <li>It does get even some of the shortest hairs, which is a nice bonus.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nice for the bikini area.  </li>
            <li>This is really nice for travel and convenience.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is great for my legs, but am totally happy with the product thus far.  </li>
            <li>Almost do not feel any pain, very easy to use.</li>
            <li>it is well worth the money and another great feature is it is rechargable.</li>
            <li>product is an excellent choice for women with heavier hair growth who need to shave frequently.  </li>
            <li>(after months of epilating, your hairs get very fine).  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair on my legs</li>
            <li>This epilator gets all the hairs, but I have to use it in a good light to be sure to see them all.  </li>
            <li>Not because the hair doesn&#x27;t grow (wouldn&#x27;t that be nice), but because it comes in so fine that it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li>I wanted more tweezers and a faster unit</li>
            <li>(you can&#x27;t find them for a better price anywhere).  </li>
            <li>I mostly wear sleeveless tops, and unsightly underarm hair was a problem.  </li>
            <li>It was much better than the wax.  </li>
            <li>One thing I love about this is that it doesn&#x27;t make my mosquito bites bleed, I can \\&quot;shave\\</li>
            <li>It is lovely.    </li>
            <li>I wish it were more angled to the bikini area, but I find it works well for underarms and legs.</li>
            <li>I just LOVE it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This will obviously not be a product for everyone, but I am impressed by the results I am having.</li>
            <li>And I must say, I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Emjoi is the best present I&#x27;ve ever gotten!</li>
            <li>What I love most about it is the way it works on my underarms.  </li>
            <li>I really love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this hair remover.  </li>
            <li>I guess if you use it on your legs you will be okay.</li>
            <li>I have owned this epilator for almost 5 years and love it.  </li>
            <li>Afterall it&#x27;s been so many years</li>
            <li>The force of the discs pulling the hair out is greater than the spring used by the Epilady.  </li>
            <li>OK for the workweek grind,</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE it.</li>
            <li>After that it feels more like a tingling feeling</li>
            <li>however waxing isn&#x27;t for everyone and hurts more for some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is certainly more versital than the Epilady was.  </li>
            <li>I have never used an epilator, but chose this one because many of the reviews rated it better than others.</li>
            <li>gave this product 4 stars because I LOVE the result it had on my underarms.  </li>
            <li>,  I started on my legs and it took more than an hour for both since I had to get used to the pain.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better then using a razor.  </li>
            <li>It does get better.  </li>
            <li>I will not compare the epilator to wax or shaving, i&#x27;d better compare it to another epilator.  </li>
            <li>it cordless - i love this feature.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard thru his publicist that Hugh Laurie is pleased with the news.    </li>
            <li>I also haven&#x27;t been able to see a leg hair in all that time.  </li>
            <li>I would gladly buy this product again.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Emjoi AP-9GAR for three years now and love it.  </li>
            <li>I tought the longer the hair the better it works.</li>
            <li>I truly do love mine.</li>
            <li>Most hair removal techniques do hurt.  </li>
            <li>so I switched it to the lower setting and it seemed to work better.  </li>
            <li>It got most of my hairs but the shorter ones it didn&#x27;t quite get.  </li>
            <li>will surely be plucked out.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>and it did a fantastic job!  </li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure it would get better.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Works better plugged in  3.</li>
            <li>You have to try various directions before you figure out what works best -</li>
            <li>sure you scrub well.</li>
            <li>If you are a fan of waxing and have hair that is lighter than you will love the ease and convenience.</li>
            <li>and I have had a heck of a time trying to find a method of hair removal that I am really pleased with.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it</li>
            <li>And I wish it didn&#x27;t sound like an &amp;quot;personal massager&amp;quot;!</li>
            <li>It has become much more tolerable.  </li>
            <li>I used an epilady for many years and when it died I searched for something simular.</li>
            <li>I love the Emjoi.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s way better than slicing off a chunk of my leg with a razor blade or ripping off a bunch of skin with wax.  </li>
            <li>but maybe there&#x27;s something better.</li>
            <li>I like emjoi better.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re planning on using this item though, be sure to exfoliate both before and after to help prevent ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>so epilating is so much better than shaving</li>
            <li>From all the stories I have heard, though, it sounds like it gets better every time, like pucking your eyebrows does, so I am going to continue,and I encourage you to continue or start to.</li>
            <li>I also enjoyed being able to recharge it and take it along to trips with me.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>but I was getting too many ingown hairs</li>
            <li>Best used on smaller areas, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>I bought the first one about 6 years ago and loved it.</li>
            <li>It works best in short, light strokes.  </li>
            <li>Also, while the instructions say that the lower speed is better for fine hairs ... don&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li>Still works fine after many years of use.</li>
            <li>My mom decided that if it did not bother him that much, why not try it, and she loved it.   </li>
            <li>This thing hurts the first couple times FOR SURE!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s NOT BAD!</li>
            <li>We had wonderful success with Braun products; they perform and they last.</li>
            <li>It worked great for the first year, but after the warranty ran out, I noticed it started to operate funny.  </li>
            <li>easy to use and becomes painless after a while.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>No pain, no gain has never been more true.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly it didn&#x27;t hurt much at all; yes it did cause some bleeding, but very much worth the results!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way cheaper than going to the salon for waxing, and the results are just as effective, plus you have the option of quick at home touch ups which makes it super convenient.</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t handle fine hairs well</li>
            <li>It works fine in the bikini area</li>
            <li>and I had to remove the cover to free it.  </li>
            <li>It gets all the hair out and yes, it makes your legs smooth too.</li>
            <li>It works fantastic, but try to focus on the television or listen to the radio.</li>
            <li>This is not a pain free system.  </li>
            <li>This does not keep your legs as smooth as if you shaved with a razor.  </li>
            <li>In the end, even though your legs may LOOK hair free, they still do not feel as smooth to the touch as shaving.  </li>
            <li>This product is most definitely worth the money</li>
            <li>and I would recommend to anyone who likes to keep their legs (or wherever else) smooth and hair-free.</li>
            <li>It leaves them hairless looking, and fairly smooth, but not as silky smooth as shaving does.  </li>
            <li>I used this machine yesterday and my legs are still completly smooth.</li>
            <li>My thighs aren&#x27;t perfectly smooth, but I don&#x27;t have the ingrown hairs I had with shaving.   </li>
            <li>Great product overall!!</li>
            <li>I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>You can feel it lightly stinging</li>
            <li>That includes using it for underarms and bikini line, both totally comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I bought this item primarily for use on my face.</li>
            <li>After the initial hair removal, great.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, after you use it you still do not have a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>The sound is also intimidating.  </li>
            <li>If you want that silky smooth you get from a razor, this one isn&#x27;t for you.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>I will be honest, it did sting at first, but that went away quickly.  </li>
            <li>When I examined it, I noticed that the ball bearing on the right side have mostly fallen out.  </li>
            <li>: I gave my emjoi to my sister and took back the braun epilator ( I am very nice).  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;It seems to work much better on very fine hair, otherwise I get more breaking off than actual extraction.  </li>
            <li>but so worth it in the end!</li>
            <li>Your hair needs to be prep first (read the instructions ladies) and if you do follow all of it, the results are much better.</li>
            <li>but now, I don&#x27;t even use it cordless because it is not as powerful as when it is corded!</li>
            <li>It does hurt as it is an epilator, doesn&#x27;t remove the really fine hairs, but it does a good job overall.</li>
            <li>The first time is scary and ouchy, especially (mostly) around sensitive bikini and underarm areas--but the product works best on those areas, ironically.</li>
            <li>After using this product under my arms, I now have that clean look.  </li>
            <li>Gives it a clean look, no razor bumps or ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>It is just a clean line.  </li>
            <li>I love my emjoi, I never thought I would ever have smooth underarm skin, but I do, thanks to my Emjoi</li>
            <li>Skin is so much smoother and more hair free than it could ever be with shaving.</li>
            <li>right after you shave, it works great on really tiny hairs.</li>
            <li>So, I still shave for special occasions.  </li>
            <li>I also purchased the GiGi wax warmer and brazilian hard wax which is awesome.</li>
            <li>I can eventually get my legs pretty smooth but not as smooth as shaving.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s good tool.</li>
            <li>This is good news, because it smells and is too tiny to inspire confidence.  </li>
            <li>This is a dream come true.</li>
            <li>EE110-5306/.Braun is still OK, but this one is much faster and another plus is,that it is cordless</li>
            <li>Many claim to be virtually pain-free, but this one really was pain-free.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to keep going over and over an area in order to get full hair removal.</li>
            <li>When I was doing the calves of my legs, where I had already waxed, it was not bad.  </li>
            <li>I will work on it for a while to get it all done; the underarms were not bad at all.    </li>
            <li>Not bad,</li>
            <li>This is comfortable, easy, takes about 10-20 min to do my whole body, and lasts about 2 weeks for me.  </li>
            <li>Ok, first off I do have to say, this product will hurt in more sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li>The first use was fine - got all the hairs on my tummy and bikini area</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used for more than 3 years the older version of Emjoi Hair Remover</li>
            <li>(Luckily for him, I didn&#x27;t.)  </li>
            <li>Overall, it is a ok product, better than shaving razor because it doesn&#x27;t remove the surface hair, rather, it removes hair from the root.</li>
            <li>This item is great as it really does get those short hairs.</li>
            <li>got mine today, and quickly bathed and scrubbed my legs and underarms and began to use it.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve finally gotten used to pain and able to remove all most all the hair.  </li>
            <li>I do a quick once-over 3-4 times a week</li>
            <li>have a high pain tolerance, and so I&#x27;ll use this again (for the price tag, it beats a $40 wax or more every month).  </li>
            <li>Okay, after using this for a few months I am more in love than ever.  </li>
            <li>This does a good job if the hair is sufficiently long.</li>
            <li>Overall, if you can use this machine while being distracted like watching TV, it is pretty good.</li>
            <li>But the first couples of times using this product really hurt, more so than waxing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So, i would recommend Gently Soft for the first time users, but for advanced users i would recommend to try something else - faster and more agressive.</li>
            <li>You may be scared at first, but after the first time, it&#x27;s easy as cake.</li>
            <li>I have large psoriases patches on my legs, so shaving and waxing are both HUGE no-nos.</li>
            <li>It would likely be a worthwhile option for someone with fine or sparse hair.</li>
            <li>It is great for coarse hair, as it only breaks off fine hairs leaving the root intact.</li>
            <li>have ordered the Braun top of the line, which apparently has a a bikini-line special attachment.  </li>
            <li>It really is worth it.</li>
            <li>It takes some work to get all the hairs but to me is well worth it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In comparison with an Epilady, or even waxing, the Emjoi wins in every regard -  &lt;BR</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s still worth it, because it allows me to stretch to 3-4 days between shaving, whereas without the epilator, I felt as if I had to shave every day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i chose not to use this machine and prefer my old hair removal methods better, but my sister loves it for removing her hair, but isn&#x27;t too keen on its curved shape.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For me, it was worth every cent just for that.  </li>
            <li>In battery operated mode, it&#x27;s not as powerful and doesn&#x27;t stay charged longer than 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I did both full legs the first time in under 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li>was worth the reward.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe it, but it is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I had an old fashioned Epilady for many years.  </li>
            <li>True, it doesn&#x27;t get all the hair on the first pass, and you do have to prevent ingrown hairs</li>
            <li>use the \\&quot;Emjoi\\&quot; on nearly every part of my body, some parts with more success than others for the reasons I mentioned.</li>
            <li>however the &#x27;pain&#x27; is definately worth the results.  </li>
            <li>It does not catch every hair every time, so you will have to go over some spots again and again, but again, its worth it.</li>
            <li>This one is, by far, my favorite.  </li>
            <li>but then, i guess $50/year for taking away unwanted hair painlessly is worth it.  </li>
            <li>After emailed back and forth, Amazon still denied of owning their own mistake on the delay of issuing the certificate.</li>
            <li>This product is good for those who need quick hair removal without the mess of waxing.</li>
            <li>However, it works great on the legs, but the first few times you will not get all the hairs.  </li>
            <li>My true test of courage came more recently - under the arms.  </li>
            <li>I have had smooth legs for over a month now, with no effort at all, I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>The Braun is better at getting all the hairs, BUT has a tendency to pinch the skin painfully if I am not totally careful.  </li>
            <li>I thought the previous reviews were helpful and I find this hair remover to be really good.</li>
            <li>You really get used to it quickly.</li>
            <li>i use it primarily on my underarms and after a year of continued use, i noticed much finer hair and very sparse growth.  </li>
            <li>Like anything else, you can only recharge something so many times before it needs to be replaced -- in the end, I was able to recharge it, but it would only last for about 10 mins and it wasn&#x27;t very strong.</li>
            <li>I like it very much and would encourage others to try it.</li>
            <li>really* good deal on my second one ($20 less than the first one) and have been enjoying it ever since.</li>
            <li>legs, though, it tends to leave a bit of stubble (I have mostly fine blonde hairs, so that may be the problem) and will probably stick mostly to shaving (although a combo of the two will work well, especially if one is preparing for a vacation or special occasion sort of deal).</li>
            <li>First, while using it on my arm, it grabbed the skin on my elbow</li>
            <li>I wish I did not make this purchase because if I wanted an alternate shaver I would have gotten a better one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit, at first the pain was quite a deterrant to using it on my underarms, but I was determined.  </li>
            <li>It will be the first time I&#x27;ve ever returned an item to Amazon.com since I started shopping here three years ago.  </li>
            <li>It works exactly as described - the gold discs</li>
            <li>REALLY!</li>
            <li>But once you get through the first pass with this baby, you&#x27;ll be hooked.   </li>
            <li>The first time you use it, expect some pain.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it says that it is curved because our bodies are curved, but out bodies are curved in many different ways and degrees so just keep that in mind before buying this.  </li>
            <li>The pain is the same as waxing, except you control when to stop, whichs makes this a much better choice.  </li>
            <li>When I first got it I decided to do my underarms</li>
            <li>Gently, my ...!  </li>
            <li>I recommend it, but I don&#x27;t recommend it higher than waxing.</li>
            <li>And It REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li>So I recommend shaving the first time then try it.</li>
            <li>My first time did cause discomfort, but it was nothing compared to waxing (</li>
            <li>You get used to it after the first minute or so.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used one, it was pretty prickly</li>
            <li>I love not having stubble or razor-burn (especially on my bikini line).  </li>
            <li>Attempts to contact customer service were futile, and I was willing to send it in to have it repaired at any cost to me (</li>
            <li>Works as listed, but doesn&#x27;t keep the hair from coming back any better than shaving.  </li>
            <li>If you are a first time user, do yourself a favor and get waxed first, than keep up w/the Emjoi.</li>
            <li>It felt like something hot was prickling my skins as I went over my leg.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest that if you are using it for the first time, begin on areas that do not have a lot of hair until you get used to the prickling feeling.  </li>
            <li>There is an opening on the top and if you don&#x27;t have your skin pulled back taut, there is the chance that your skin will get sucked into that opening.</li>
            <li>the first time)and</li>
            <li>For anyone interested, I believe Junior will be placing the Emjoi on ebay once he finds it.</li>
            <li>so I can handle pain pretty well</li>
            <li>The fact that it is rechargeable mattered to me when I first bought it</li>
            <li>that I am aware of.   </li>
            <li>In order to avoid this, I used ice packs on that area first and then went ahead with the epilator.  </li>
            <li>I just finished my first time at the Emjoi, and, man did that thing hurt.  </li>
            <li>I tried to use it for most of that time, thinking that things would improve, but in the end I had to send it back.</li>
            <li>Bonus is one does not have stubble growth, does not have to remove hair again for several weeks, no risk of razor cuts, and skin looks better after using Emjoi.   </li>
            <li>Now I can touchup every few days and my legs always look good.</li>
            <li>I agree with all the positive statements others have made regarding this product - it really works! &lt;</li>
            <li>My corded devices became finicky over time (damaged cord, most likely), and I had to hold the cord a certain way to get them to work.  </li>
            <li>I waited a long time before getting it because I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be worth spending that much on it</li>
            <li>I am always in search of new ways to remove unwanted hair and after reading the reviews here I was so excited to receive my Emjoi AP-9GAR1 Gently</li>
            <li>also really like being able to use this on the face (chin, upper lip).  </li>
            <li>Pulling out hair doesn&#x27;t seem to hurt as much as tugging on it several times so the Emjoi is much better than the Epilady.  </li>
            <li>If keeping your legs smooth is a constant battle, the pain might be worth it for you.</li>
            <li>This particular model I find very effective, easy to clean, doesn&#x27;t look as freaky weird as the other ones I saw, and I like the gold blades better.</li>
            <li>I have very fine blonde leg hair that most other epilators won&#x27;t grab.  </li>
            <li>The positive is it didn&#x27;t hurt and I am a wimp.</li>
            <li>Once you get through the aweful first time it gets much easier because you can use it as you see hair.</li>
            <li>and I tried it immediately-it does much better job than the Braun one,I had for long time/Silk-epil</li>
            <li>In any case, it appears that the blades are on a straight surface, plus it seems to be much higher seeling than the Emjoi.  </li>
            <li>I started at the very top of the hair line and just went over a few hairs.  </li>
            <li>really does hurt the first couple of times but after that the pain isn&#x27;t as noticable.</li>
            <li>It has many more tweezers and it is easier to make sure that no hairs are left behind in the unit.  </li>
            <li>The beauty of the Emjoi is that it is so easy to reach the back of my calves and thighs.  </li>
            <li>I took Advil and promised myself a large whiskey as soon as I finished.  </li>
            <li>it certainly works for me</li>
            <li>It is certainly a lot faster and cleaner than shaving or waxing.  </li>
            <li>Hairs grow back very fine and soft, not prickly.  </li>
            <li>As a former Epilady user, I found this product to be much better, less pain, more hair removed.  </li>
            <li>What a HUGE difference from the last one!  </li>
            <li>I am really looking forward to it.    </li>
            <li>&quot; my whole leg.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used tweezing (no pain, too much time for all my hair),</li>
            <li>and it really did not hurt me that much</li>
            <li>I also use it on my face for my upper lip and it makes it so smooth.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Gently Gold Caress.</li>
            <li>if it is unbearable than just know the speed of the machine helps, but the fact that there are many more hairs being tweezed makes it more painful.  </li>
            <li>Gently Gold Caress Rechargeable Hair Remover.  </li>
            <li>It took me 3 attempts over 2 days to do my whole leg, no bleeding.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because I have very course hair on my legs and underarms.  </li>
            <li>When I purchased it 2 years ago it was over $70, shouldn&#x27;t something that cost that much</li>
            <li>If you just chose a squared area the size of the device and tweeze in all four directions, you&#x27;ll cover a lot of skin real estate in no time.  </li>
            <li>No pain, visually hairless and fairly smooth results to the touch.  </li>
            <li>With eyes watering, I sucked it up and fully completed one whole pit before deciding the 4 minutes of recordable pain</li>
            <li>I used the Gently Gold again.  </li>
            <li>It also will stop the blades/tweezers from rolling if you apply to much pressure</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I just got my Emjoi Gently Gold yesterday and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.  </li>
            <li>Will make a comparison once i get it, but if the above sounds relevant, bear it in mind.</li>
            <li>This epilator works very well.</li>
            <li>really dreaded doing my underarms.  </li>
            <li>It took about 2-3 minutes to do each underarm and it really did not hurt that much.  </li>
            <li>and I really thought I had made a mistake in buying the product, but I persevered.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend is very opinionated.  </li>
            <li>and then I might not mind the intense pain so much.</li>
            <li>Nothing gentle about it.</li>
            <li>Well, it hurts so much.</li>
            <li>With the epilator, my face stays smooth for days (not the 4 to 6 weeks promised, but a big improvement!).  </li>
            <li>It does not hurt as much as I thought it would.  </li>
            <li>It really does get the job done, though.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it for underarms because it hurts too much</li>
            <li>I just had no idea how much.  </li>
            <li>I thought that if I just stuck with it for a while, I would get toughened up, and using it wouldn&#x27;t bother me so much.  </li>
            <li>product name is Gently Gold Caress.  </li>
            <li>It also works very well with the charger plugged in to the unit.  </li>
            <li>Does an excellent job and is great for removing the annoying facial fuzz (upper lip and chin), foot and toe hair, and underarm hair.  </li>
            <li>It took about 40 minutes to completely clear the area and within 15 minutes I broke out in blisters that left marks that lasted for more than a month.</li>
            <li>I rarely write Amazon reviews but had to share my experience with the Emjoi Gently Gold Caress because I&#x27;ve been so pleasantly surprised at how well it works.</li>
            <li>You will never be able to get the same silky soft legs that you can with a razor.&lt;BR</li>
            <li>It may also take a couple more days of using the Enjoi after the initial session to completely remove all hair from and area.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recomend the use of this hair removal robot, and to just tough it out the first time, because it is a lot better than shaving.  </li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve found it works best if you use an up and down motion instead of the small circles recommended in the manual.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The process is also much quicker than other home hair removal systems and the results are more complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other epilators and love them (burnt the motor out on my Braun after 3 yrs).  </li>
            <li>Some detractors say the device doesn&#x27;t last long, but, even if I don&#x27;t get more than a year, it was (and will be) worth the price.  </li>
            <li>so he can clean out his ears and such.  </li>
            <li>I am still impressed with it even though the motor slowed down lately.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, I was able to use it on my underarms (although it may take several tries to get the hair totally gone, it&#x27;s already better than if I&#x27;d shaved), and I am gradually working on the bikini line.  </li>
            <li>I MUCH prefer taking care of hair-removal once a week (at an absolute MOST), while sitting watching TV instead of my former daily, fancy-angling-my-foot-in-the-soap-dish-shower-praying-I-don&#x27;t-fall-over-and wreck-the-bathroom routine.</li>
            <li>I only wish it would make my legs a little more smooth</li>
            <li>and i think it all depends on how much it hurts when you tweeze hair normally.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend numbing the area with ice first if you are really sensitive.</li>
            <li>I was not actually crying, but that&#x27;s how much my eyes were watering!  </li>
            <li>Apparently the little ball bearings were falling out of the sides, prohibiting the smooth and easy operation of the device.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I have a higher pain tolerance than most, but I have very little pain using the Emjoi.  </li>
            <li>After 2 years of using the Optima I decided to give this one a try, mainly because of the cordless option.</li>
            <li>Day 2, I attempted my whole bikini area and lower, (I couldn&#x27;t do the whole thing though, way too sensitive)</li>
            <li>I tried using it quickly without prepping and my hair and all the negatives happened like hair not getting pulled out properly, only getting cut.&lt;br</li>
            <li>legs will not be a smooth as they are with shaving, but you also won&#x27;t get the same type of irritation and you won&#x27;t need to remove the hair as frequently as with shaving.  </li>
            <li>My main problem area is some hair on my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>This product really works only if you use it the right way.</li>
            <li>Well...I have a high tolerance to pain</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, although you could save a couple of bucks and get the corded version.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>ok that hurt a little but again</li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s effective, just hard to get used to.</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant to put it near my leg because of how loud it was and the rotating of it was so fast.  </li>
            <li>It did not hurt my legs near as much as waxing.  </li>
            <li>I foolishly purchased this to take care of hair I would normally have waxed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a few, but not as many as I&#x27;d get with waxing.  </li>
            <li>I urge you to strongly consider buying an alternate brand of epilator, such as a Braun.</li>
            <li>When I take ball bearing out of the left side to insert them in the right side, they still fall out.  </li>
            <li>It got all of the hairs on my face, with the exception of two that were very stiffly laid back against the skin, but tweezing two hairs instead of two dozen was definitely a good thing.</li>
            <li>I have gotten it down to a habit and it is so easy.  </li>
            <li>This seemed to cut down on the pain, and then it went very quickly after that.  </li>
            <li>applies for their new version.</li>
            <li>Hooray for tank tops (I live in L.A.  </li>
            <li>providing it did not exceed the cost of a new one!).&lt;BR&gt;</li>
            <li>But there was some discomfort, because hey, yanking out hair from sensitive skin hurts, but not as much as razor burn on sensitive skin does.</li>
            <li>Except for a small patch on one ankle and the first pass over either the underarms or bikini line, there really wasn&#x27;t any pain, just the sensation and mild discomfort of hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>if you are only going to use this for your legs than its shape is probably great, but since i have really thin hair on my legs</li>
            <li>I went back 5 days later and achieved really smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>Surprising it doesn&#x27;t hurt much there if your skin is tight and firm.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a quality products that helps to cut down on time spent shaving/waxing and does not get you irritated, which for most of us is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>For intimate curvy areas, it is important to be only one shaft wide.  </li>
            <li>It stings at first but after a second or so the pain goes away.</li>
            <li>It gets irretating after a while, but in the long run, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Wow, the additional tweezers make all the difference in the world too!  </li>
            <li>did!&lt;br /&gt;One thing you need to know is that it does hurt, BUT only at first.  </li>
            <li>first thinking that if I could stand that pain I could definitely do my legs.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Normally to get results like this, you would have to go to a PROFESSIONAL.  </li>
            <li>It was more uncomfortable on my upper thighs because I had more hair because I have not shaved or waxed there in a while.  </li>
            <li>It did take me a while to get up the courage, and my younger sister helped me with that and went first without me knowing.  </li>
            <li>so i&#x27;ll probably order my third one pretty soon.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this a second time because I lost the first one on a vacation trip.  </li>
            <li>My favorite is the fact I have no more underarm pricklies which I used to get from shaving.  </li>
            <li>so you have a clean start, then use Emjoi going forward for maintenance, (2) put a little baby powder on your skin prior to using Emjoi to ensure your skin is dry, and (2) be sure to pull your skin</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants to quit using a shaver daily.</li>
            <li>old one i had for 3 years is Braun - it&#x27;s still in perfict condition, but i just wanted somethng new.</li>
            <li>It was so gentle and fast on my legs that I did what would have been unthinkable in my Epilady days -</li>
            <li>The braun epilator is not as noisy ( the emjoi is kind of scary the first time in term of noise) but creates stubbles on my legs.</li>
            <li>All those horror stories you hear about a woman&#x27;s daily beauty treatments are all true, especially the hair removal ones.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt very much when you are doing it, but later I had red bumps and my legs were VERY sensitve to touch for a couple of days.  </li>
            <li>The first few times you will have to go back over your legs with a razor to get them really smooth.</li>
            <li>I was able to do my upper thighs, which had significantly less hair growth to begin with</li>
            <li>Like other reviewers, I also must have a higher pain tolerance because it doesn&#x27;t really hurt.</li>
            <li>And if could get use to the pain (however brief) of waxing, I can certain get use to the discomfort of this.   </li>
            <li>Overall, highly recommended if you have a high pain tolerance.</li>
            <li>I do have about a million little red bumps in an almost unmentionable place, but my skin is smooth!  </li>
            <li>They would be clear for one day.  </li>
            <li>No razor burn, no hair, no shadow, Just clear skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;the machine is very noisy and looks kind of scary if you aren&#x27;t used to these kinds of machines, but after my sister ashured me it didn&#x27;t hurt</li>
            <li>It now takes me about 45 minutes to completely remove hair from both legs, bikini area, chin and underarms.    </li>
            <li>I was a frequent waxer, and thought wow look at this</li>
            <li>It removes hair from essentially any area of the body, and you really can use it the day after shaving.  &lt;</li>
            <li>I finally found the Emjoi Gently Gold Caress.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;My advice to anyone that has written negative comments regarding the pain of using the Emjoi is to stick with it more than just a couple of times before you grab your razor.  </li>
            <li>I just used this machine once so far.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of the old days when you had an alarm clock or GHETO BLASTER and it worked for 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My Epilady took at least an hour or more to get the job done, the Emjoi only 30-45 minutes depending if I did my whole leg or just the lower leg.  </li>
            <li>(I also found that margaritas help considerably with numbness).  </li>
            <li>I purchased this hoping that it would be the answer to frequent shaving and waxing.</li>
            <li>As near as I can tell it was snapping my thinner regrowing hairs off at skin level.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, this product is NOT for you.    </li>
            <li>the female body also has curves that are concave, not just convex, eg around the bikini line.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but my skin is really sensitive to begin with -</li>
            <li>you are also on the hairy side, this product will make your personal grooming soooo much easier.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it works as well as if you were to go to a salon and get a professional waxing.</li>
            <li>Some things I don&#x27;t like are that I get the feeling that sometimes it does not pluck the hair completely but instead breaks the hair off.</li>
            <li>more complaint</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is so much cheaper to by this product than spend money regularly in a salon.</li>
            <li>So this morning while Junior was sleeping I took the Emjoi Gently Gold Caress and gave a swipe at his back hair.  </li>
            <li>It does leave hair soft, but still there.</li>
            <li>I got the accessory pack too which gives you a sensitive attachment that covers some of the tweezers.   </li>
            <li>and \\&quot;Caress\\&quot; are descriptive terms that shouldn&#x27;t be allowed anywhere near this product.</li>
            <li>The lower speed is great for beginners as it is less painful than the high speed, but it is also less effective for removing hairs.</li>
            <li>It does pinch the skin if I move it too fast but holding the skin flat prevents this.</li>
            <li>I rarely wore sleeveless tops in the Summer, due to the continuous need to shave.</li>
            <li>Give it at least a couple tries if it hurts at first, and see if it gets better.</li>
            <li>different parts of the body can handle different amounts of pain or rather are more or less sensitive to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This means that instead of grabbing each hair and tugging 5 or 6 times before it pulls it out, the Emjoy actually pulls it out on the first or second attempt, almost every time.  </li>
            <li>This product is decent compared to traditional razor shaving</li>
            <li>My main reason for purchasing was for unwanted facial hair.  </li>
            <li>I only got one leg done at first because I had to be somewhere, but after dreading coming back to it for an hour, I returned home and finished the rest of the torture job.  </li>
            <li>But I personally like to use it on high on my legs &amp; under arms.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item and will be buying another one just as soon as possible.  </li>
            <li>If you are used to waxing it hurts less than that - my wife has a very sensetive skin and she didnt feel much when I did her underarms.</li>
            <li>Other reviews are right: there is a little irritation, but it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>But all this is a small price to pay for reasonably smooth legs every day.</li>
            <li>After the first two or three uses, discomfort is minimal.  </li>
            <li>The key for me is to really pull the skin tight, I even had my husband hold my skin the first time.</li>
            <li>Now, it feels sort of like running a stiff bristle brush over the area, prickly but not painful.  </li>
            <li>It was not holding its charge very long and was not working as fast as before, even when it was plugged.  </li>
            <li>Time: It took about 5 minutes to do what would have taken me 15-25 minutes previously, had more complete hair removal, and hurt a lot less.</li>
            <li>I looked at it for at least 8 months before I finally took the plunge, and am I glad that I</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to wait for that half inch worth of hair before heading to the salon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once you have used it a few times, it doesn&#x27;t hurt much because there isn&#x27;t as much hair.  </li>
            <li>On top of that, Amazon issue the certificate discount 2months late leaving a short period of time before it expired.</li>
            <li>Using this on the bikini area is fine, but I recommend waxing the first time since the long hair is hard for Emjoi to remove properly.  </li>
            <li>Just keep it on high and do it quick if your hair is a little long.</li>
            <li>In addition, I have to rigorously exfoliate, or else I get major ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While it is delightful to note that the makers of this otherwise sturdy little machine have noticed this long-obscure fact about the female body, I do have to point out to them the following two startling observations:&lt;br /&gt;1.  </li>
            <li>i just wax - i like just going over one large area fast quick pain rather than the random plucking feeling.  </li>
            <li>and I loved it so very much, but after a few years it seemed to slow down</li>
            <li>After the first use or two, it doesn&#x27;t hurt (other reviewers gave up too early and didn&#x27;t give them enough time).  </li>
            <li>After a few months (yes, it did take that long), that hair also became so fine that it also removes with ease now.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as painful as waxing and results are great.  </li>
            <li>I still have to epilate at least once a week, and I have to shave every couple of days to feel smooth.</li>
            <li>The skin under my arms is very very white and clear.  </li>
            <li>Waxing kept my legs smooth for 3 weeks, then there were the next 3 weeks spent hairy as I grew it long enough to wax again, all the while hoping that no dress-wearing occasions popped up while I was growing the hair out.</li>
            <li>It has several features I have never seen before that make it clearly</li>
            <li>recently (yes, it&#x27;s about 13 years old)</li>
            <li>Who knew those places were quite that sensitive when ripping out multiple hairs by the root!??!  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m buying this product again after my three year old machine stopped charging last night.</li>
            <li>I am using it on nearly a weekly basis as the hair grows at different paces.</li>
            <li>Last week he ordered up this here product for me and made me cook him his dinner early</li>
            <li>It took me weeks to complete the first round of hair removal in this area as I am one of those unlucky people whose \\&quot;private\\&quot; hair seems to grow to my knees.  </li>
            <li>I used this product for several months, hoping that as time went on the hair on my legs would start growing back more slowly (as promised).</li>
            <li>The design of this gadget is not perfect (curved shape does not make it easy in some areas), but it certainly does the job.  </li>
            <li>It is well worth the money and for new users the discomfort of using a product like this only last a few times.</li>
            <li>I would go over my legs quickly with the Emjoi every few days to get the hairs that were in a different stage of the growth cycle</li>
            <li>(I mean really lightly), but it is nothing compared to the pain of my intestines being removed via my shin bone from two decades ago.  </li>
            <li>It hurts pretty bad the first time but every time after that it&#x27;s not bad at all</li>
            <li>Anyway, as far as performance and overall satisfaction goes, this is definitely a keeper.  </li>
            <li>I was really satisfied with the way it handled underarms, although bikini was a little more painful</li>
            <li>My emjoi barely hurts, but I only use it on legs and armpits.</li>
            <li>surprised how long it&#x27;s lasted.  </li>
            <li>I shaved my legs after the first few times</li>
            <li>When I first purchased this item, I paid about $90 a few years ago.  </li>
            <li>It is not unbearable, however, and the small amount of pain is worth the results.</li>
            <li>it is basically useless on my leg because the hair on my leg is very fine and it just cuts it off rather than pulling it out from the roots.</li>
            <li>It feels like little tiny needle sticks at first</li>
            <li>All reviews said that the first time would be the most painful.</li>
            <li>, I used to wax my legs not anymore, this is much easier and less painfull.</li>
            <li>Another con is that it does not get hairs at odd angles very well.</li>
            <li>My legs look a lot less furry and much smoother than they did a couple of hours ago.  </li>
            <li>After the first few times it gets easier and the red bumps don&#x27;t appear either.  </li>
            <li>I found it useful for underarms, since it is a small area with coarse hair.</li>
            <li>Ok, ripping the hair out of your skin by the roots is never fun, but this has to be the least traumatic device I have used yet.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;The result for me is smoother and less irritating than waxing, as my sensitive skin often becomes burned with even the most cautious waxing pros.&lt;br /&gt;The product does not work as well on my legs, though.  </li>
            <li>It is much easier to do a little at a time.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it under my arms, it was very little pain.</li>
            <li>So, I started researching on this, I read all the reviews, the good and bad ones.</li>
            <li>When the hairs grow back, they are lighter and thinner (good) but they tend to break off instead of pull out (bad).</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> and I was very happy with it.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t* recommend using it in the bikini area), but works great and lasts days longer than shaving!</li>
            <li> well, in 5 minutes I had 1/2 a leg done and looked great!!</li>
            <li> Great product!</li>

            <li> This IS an excellent product!</li>
            <li> I was very happy with that but could not find another to replace it with so bought the EMJOY</li>
            <li> I got this in 2007, and it still works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> The best advice I can give is to not treat it like a razor.  </li>
            <li> What I found works best is to use it before I shower, all it takes is 5 minutes</li>
            <li> You do have get use to it, but it does an excellent job of keeping the hair away.   </li>
            <li> Perfect, in my book, so I recommend this.  </li>
            <li> Buy it, you will be happy!</li>
            <li> It was great!!!!  </li>
            <li> LOVE THIS THING!!!!</li>
            <li> What a great money-saving beauty tool!</li>
            <li> Thank you, It&#x27;s wonderful</li>
            <li> This product is great!  </li>
            <li> Even though, initially it is very good, it is not a reliable product.  </li>
            <li> This product does a very good job in removing the hair.  </li>
            <li> - I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s ideal for everyone</li>
            <li> C&#x27;est la vie, six years is still a good run!</li>
            <li> It seems to be a great system though.  </li>
            <li> I read about this in a magazine, and the Amazon reviews were great, so I put it on my wish list.  </li>
            <li> It has worked great.  </li>
            <li> Rechargable option is great as the cord does not get on your way.  </li>
            <li> I was so happy to see that I didn&#x27;t need to shave every day.  </li>
            <li> and I was keeping up with it and happy with the results.    </li>
            <li> I started my legs and it brought tears to my eyes (and not tears of joy).  </li>
            <li> If you can get through the pain on your legs, this product would give you great results.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this 5 years ago and it still works great.  </li>
            <li> but this works great.  </li>
            <li> just great.  </li>
            <li> (this is great).</li>
            <li> This product is GREAT for underarms.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it worked great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Emjoi for two months now and am so happy that I no longer have to pay for ongoing trips to the salon.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re great.  </li>
            <li> definitely a great product.  </li>
            <li> Guys, please watch out for their promotional certificate discount, as they will find a cheap way to cheat on their customers!!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very effective.  </li>
            <li> very nice thing is that</li>
            <li> I love it and it works great!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE MY EMJOI, THE BEST!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled!</li>
            <li> This item is wonderful because I can do it at my own pace and on my own schedule.  </li>
            <li> This device is probably best for those with fine hair, or for use on the face.</li>
            <li> And to get all the hair off of your lower legs, you&#x27;ll probably need a couple hours to do a really good job.</li>
            <li> and I am impressed at how smooth they feel.</li>
            <li> He started using the Emjoi and loved it.  </li>
            <li> The Emjoi had good reviews, so I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> Bottom line, if keeping your legs smooth is a battle, this is the best weapon of choice!</li>
            <li> I took this looking at some good reviews.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I think this is a great product, and I am glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I am most happy about the bikini line.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this item!  </li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> , I love it!  </li>
            <li> will continue to use this as I love not having to shave every day!</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator, and I am highly impressed.  </li>
            <li> I love it and will never be without one!  </li>
            <li> It was amazing.</li>
            <li> Use at your own risk</li>
            <li> But the nice thing with this is you can use it</li>
            <li> The nice thing about it</li>
            <li> * while using Emjoi to reduce catching your skin.</li>
            <li> I liked it a lot...</li>
            <li> I found it gave the most painless GOOD results  </li>
            <li> It does get even some of the shortest hairs, which is a nice bonus.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice for the bikini area.  </li>
            <li> This is really nice for travel and convenience.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is great for my legs, but am totally happy with the product thus far.  </li>
            <li> Almost do not feel any pain, very easy to use.</li>
            <li> it is well worth the money and another great feature is it is rechargable.</li>
            <li> product is an excellent choice for women with heavier hair growth who need to shave frequently.  </li>
            <li> (after months of epilating, your hairs get very fine).  </li>
            <li> I have very fine hair on my legs</li>
            <li> This epilator gets all the hairs, but I have to use it in a good light to be sure to see them all.  </li>
            <li> Not because the hair doesn&#x27;t grow (wouldn&#x27;t that be nice), but because it comes in so fine that it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li> I wanted more tweezers and a faster unit</li>
            <li> (you can&#x27;t find them for a better price anywhere).  </li>
            <li> I mostly wear sleeveless tops, and unsightly underarm hair was a problem.  </li>
            <li> It was much better than the wax.  </li>
            <li> One thing I love about this is that it doesn&#x27;t make my mosquito bites bleed, I can \\&quot;shave\\</li>
            <li> It is lovely.    </li>
            <li> I wish it were more angled to the bikini area, but I find it works well for underarms and legs.</li>
            <li> I just LOVE it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This will obviously not be a product for everyone, but I am impressed by the results I am having.</li>
            <li> And I must say, I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Emjoi is the best present I&#x27;ve ever gotten!</li>
            <li> What I love most about it is the way it works on my underarms.  </li>
            <li> I really love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this hair remover.  </li>
            <li> I guess if you use it on your legs you will be okay.</li>
            <li> I have owned this epilator for almost 5 years and love it.  </li>
            <li> Afterall it&#x27;s been so many years</li>
            <li> The force of the discs pulling the hair out is greater than the spring used by the Epilady.  </li>
            <li> OK for the workweek grind,</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE it.</li>
            <li> After that it feels more like a tingling feeling</li>
            <li> however waxing isn&#x27;t for everyone and hurts more for some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is certainly more versital than the Epilady was.  </li>
            <li> I have never used an epilator, but chose this one because many of the reviews rated it better than others.</li>
            <li> gave this product 4 stars because I LOVE the result it had on my underarms.  </li>
            <li> ,  I started on my legs and it took more than an hour for both since I had to get used to the pain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better then using a razor.  </li>
            <li> It does get better.  </li>
            <li> I will not compare the epilator to wax or shaving, i&#x27;d better compare it to another epilator.  </li>
            <li> it cordless - i love this feature.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard thru his publicist that Hugh Laurie is pleased with the news.    </li>
            <li> I also haven&#x27;t been able to see a leg hair in all that time.  </li>
            <li> I would gladly buy this product again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Emjoi AP-9GAR for three years now and love it.  </li>
            <li> I tought the longer the hair the better it works.</li>
            <li> I truly do love mine.</li>
            <li> Most hair removal techniques do hurt.  </li>
            <li> so I switched it to the lower setting and it seemed to work better.  </li>
            <li> It got most of my hairs but the shorter ones it didn&#x27;t quite get.  </li>
            <li> will surely be plucked out.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> and it did a fantastic job!  </li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t sure it would get better.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Works better plugged in  3.</li>
            <li> You have to try various directions before you figure out what works best -</li>
            <li> sure you scrub well.</li>
            <li> If you are a fan of waxing and have hair that is lighter than you will love the ease and convenience.</li>
            <li> and I have had a heck of a time trying to find a method of hair removal that I am really pleased with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it</li>
            <li> And I wish it didn&#x27;t sound like an &amp;quot;personal massager&amp;quot;!</li>
            <li> It has become much more tolerable.  </li>
            <li> I used an epilady for many years and when it died I searched for something simular.</li>
            <li> I love the Emjoi.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s way better than slicing off a chunk of my leg with a razor blade or ripping off a bunch of skin with wax.  </li>
            <li> but maybe there&#x27;s something better.</li>
            <li> I like emjoi better.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re planning on using this item though, be sure to exfoliate both before and after to help prevent ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> so epilating is so much better than shaving</li>
            <li> From all the stories I have heard, though, it sounds like it gets better every time, like pucking your eyebrows does, so I am going to continue,and I encourage you to continue or start to.</li>
            <li> I also enjoyed being able to recharge it and take it along to trips with me.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> but I was getting too many ingown hairs</li>
            <li> Best used on smaller areas, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I bought the first one about 6 years ago and loved it.</li>
            <li> It works best in short, light strokes.  </li>
            <li> Also, while the instructions say that the lower speed is better for fine hairs ... don&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li> Still works fine after many years of use.</li>
            <li> My mom decided that if it did not bother him that much, why not try it, and she loved it.   </li>
            <li> This thing hurts the first couple times FOR SURE!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s NOT BAD!</li>
            <li> We had wonderful success with Braun products; they perform and they last.</li>
            <li> It worked great for the first year, but after the warranty ran out, I noticed it started to operate funny.  </li>
            <li> easy to use and becomes painless after a while.  </li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> No pain, no gain has never been more true.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly it didn&#x27;t hurt much at all; yes it did cause some bleeding, but very much worth the results!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way cheaper than going to the salon for waxing, and the results are just as effective, plus you have the option of quick at home touch ups which makes it super convenient.</li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t handle fine hairs well</li>
            <li> It works fine in the bikini area</li>
            <li> and I had to remove the cover to free it.  </li>
            <li> It gets all the hair out and yes, it makes your legs smooth too.</li>
            <li> It works fantastic, but try to focus on the television or listen to the radio.</li>
            <li> This is not a pain free system.  </li>
            <li> This does not keep your legs as smooth as if you shaved with a razor.  </li>
            <li> In the end, even though your legs may LOOK hair free, they still do not feel as smooth to the touch as shaving.  </li>
            <li> This product is most definitely worth the money</li>
            <li> and I would recommend to anyone who likes to keep their legs (or wherever else) smooth and hair-free.</li>
            <li> It leaves them hairless looking, and fairly smooth, but not as silky smooth as shaving does.  </li>
            <li> I used this machine yesterday and my legs are still completly smooth.</li>
            <li> My thighs aren&#x27;t perfectly smooth, but I don&#x27;t have the ingrown hairs I had with shaving.   </li>
            <li> Great product overall!!</li>
            <li> I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> You can feel it lightly stinging</li>
            <li> That includes using it for underarms and bikini line, both totally comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I bought this item primarily for use on my face.</li>
            <li> After the initial hair removal, great.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, after you use it you still do not have a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> The sound is also intimidating.  </li>
            <li> If you want that silky smooth you get from a razor, this one isn&#x27;t for you.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> I will be honest, it did sting at first, but that went away quickly.  </li>
            <li> When I examined it, I noticed that the ball bearing on the right side have mostly fallen out.  </li>
            <li> : I gave my emjoi to my sister and took back the braun epilator ( I am very nice).  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;It seems to work much better on very fine hair, otherwise I get more breaking off than actual extraction.  </li>
            <li> but so worth it in the end!</li>
            <li> Your hair needs to be prep first (read the instructions ladies) and if you do follow all of it, the results are much better.</li>
            <li> but now, I don&#x27;t even use it cordless because it is not as powerful as when it is corded!</li>
            <li> It does hurt as it is an epilator, doesn&#x27;t remove the really fine hairs, but it does a good job overall.</li>
            <li> The first time is scary and ouchy, especially (mostly) around sensitive bikini and underarm areas--but the product works best on those areas, ironically.</li>
            <li> After using this product under my arms, I now have that clean look.  </li>
            <li> Gives it a clean look, no razor bumps or ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> It is just a clean line.  </li>
            <li> I love my emjoi, I never thought I would ever have smooth underarm skin, but I do, thanks to my Emjoi</li>
            <li> Skin is so much smoother and more hair free than it could ever be with shaving.</li>
            <li> right after you shave, it works great on really tiny hairs.</li>
            <li> So, I still shave for special occasions.  </li>
            <li> I also purchased the GiGi wax warmer and brazilian hard wax which is awesome.</li>
            <li> I can eventually get my legs pretty smooth but not as smooth as shaving.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s good tool.</li>
            <li> This is good news, because it smells and is too tiny to inspire confidence.  </li>
            <li> This is a dream come true.</li>
            <li> EE110-5306/.Braun is still OK, but this one is much faster and another plus is,that it is cordless</li>
            <li> Many claim to be virtually pain-free, but this one really was pain-free.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to keep going over and over an area in order to get full hair removal.</li>
            <li> When I was doing the calves of my legs, where I had already waxed, it was not bad.  </li>
            <li> I will work on it for a while to get it all done; the underarms were not bad at all.    </li>
            <li> Not bad,</li>
            <li> This is comfortable, easy, takes about 10-20 min to do my whole body, and lasts about 2 weeks for me.  </li>
            <li> Ok, first off I do have to say, this product will hurt in more sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li> The first use was fine - got all the hairs on my tummy and bikini area</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used for more than 3 years the older version of Emjoi Hair Remover</li>
            <li> (Luckily for him, I didn&#x27;t.)  </li>
            <li> Overall, it is a ok product, better than shaving razor because it doesn&#x27;t remove the surface hair, rather, it removes hair from the root.</li>
            <li> This item is great as it really does get those short hairs.</li>
            <li> got mine today, and quickly bathed and scrubbed my legs and underarms and began to use it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve finally gotten used to pain and able to remove all most all the hair.  </li>
            <li> I do a quick once-over 3-4 times a week</li>
            <li> have a high pain tolerance, and so I&#x27;ll use this again (for the price tag, it beats a $40 wax or more every month).  </li>
            <li> Okay, after using this for a few months I am more in love than ever.  </li>
            <li> This does a good job if the hair is sufficiently long.</li>
            <li> Overall, if you can use this machine while being distracted like watching TV, it is pretty good.</li>
            <li> But the first couples of times using this product really hurt, more so than waxing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So, i would recommend Gently Soft for the first time users, but for advanced users i would recommend to try something else - faster and more agressive.</li>
            <li> You may be scared at first, but after the first time, it&#x27;s easy as cake.</li>
            <li> I have large psoriases patches on my legs, so shaving and waxing are both HUGE no-nos.</li>
            <li> It would likely be a worthwhile option for someone with fine or sparse hair.</li>
            <li> It is great for coarse hair, as it only breaks off fine hairs leaving the root intact.</li>
            <li> have ordered the Braun top of the line, which apparently has a a bikini-line special attachment.  </li>
            <li> It really is worth it.</li>
            <li> It takes some work to get all the hairs but to me is well worth it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In comparison with an Epilady, or even waxing, the Emjoi wins in every regard -  &lt;BR</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s still worth it, because it allows me to stretch to 3-4 days between shaving, whereas without the epilator, I felt as if I had to shave every day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i chose not to use this machine and prefer my old hair removal methods better, but my sister loves it for removing her hair, but isn&#x27;t too keen on its curved shape.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For me, it was worth every cent just for that.  </li>
            <li> In battery operated mode, it&#x27;s not as powerful and doesn&#x27;t stay charged longer than 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I did both full legs the first time in under 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> was worth the reward.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it, but it is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I had an old fashioned Epilady for many years.  </li>
            <li> True, it doesn&#x27;t get all the hair on the first pass, and you do have to prevent ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> use the \\&quot;Emjoi\\&quot; on nearly every part of my body, some parts with more success than others for the reasons I mentioned.</li>
            <li> however the &#x27;pain&#x27; is definately worth the results.  </li>
            <li> It does not catch every hair every time, so you will have to go over some spots again and again, but again, its worth it.</li>
            <li> This one is, by far, my favorite.  </li>
            <li> but then, i guess $50/year for taking away unwanted hair painlessly is worth it.  </li>
            <li> After emailed back and forth, Amazon still denied of owning their own mistake on the delay of issuing the certificate.</li>
            <li> This product is good for those who need quick hair removal without the mess of waxing.</li>
            <li> However, it works great on the legs, but the first few times you will not get all the hairs.  </li>
            <li> My true test of courage came more recently - under the arms.  </li>
            <li> I have had smooth legs for over a month now, with no effort at all, I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> The Braun is better at getting all the hairs, BUT has a tendency to pinch the skin painfully if I am not totally careful.  </li>
            <li> I thought the previous reviews were helpful and I find this hair remover to be really good.</li>
            <li> You really get used to it quickly.</li>
            <li> i use it primarily on my underarms and after a year of continued use, i noticed much finer hair and very sparse growth.  </li>
            <li> Like anything else, you can only recharge something so many times before it needs to be replaced -- in the end, I was able to recharge it, but it would only last for about 10 mins and it wasn&#x27;t very strong.</li>
            <li> I like it very much and would encourage others to try it.</li>
            <li> really* good deal on my second one ($20 less than the first one) and have been enjoying it ever since.</li>
            <li> legs, though, it tends to leave a bit of stubble (I have mostly fine blonde hairs, so that may be the problem) and will probably stick mostly to shaving (although a combo of the two will work well, especially if one is preparing for a vacation or special occasion sort of deal).</li>
            <li> First, while using it on my arm, it grabbed the skin on my elbow</li>
            <li> I wish I did not make this purchase because if I wanted an alternate shaver I would have gotten a better one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, at first the pain was quite a deterrant to using it on my underarms, but I was determined.  </li>
            <li> It will be the first time I&#x27;ve ever returned an item to Amazon.com since I started shopping here three years ago.  </li>
            <li> It works exactly as described - the gold discs</li>
            <li> REALLY!</li>
            <li> But once you get through the first pass with this baby, you&#x27;ll be hooked.   </li>
            <li> The first time you use it, expect some pain.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it says that it is curved because our bodies are curved, but out bodies are curved in many different ways and degrees so just keep that in mind before buying this.  </li>
            <li> The pain is the same as waxing, except you control when to stop, whichs makes this a much better choice.  </li>
            <li> When I first got it I decided to do my underarms</li>
            <li> Gently, my ...!  </li>
            <li> I recommend it, but I don&#x27;t recommend it higher than waxing.</li>
            <li> And It REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li> So I recommend shaving the first time then try it.</li>
            <li> My first time did cause discomfort, but it was nothing compared to waxing (</li>
            <li> You get used to it after the first minute or so.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used one, it was pretty prickly</li>
            <li> I love not having stubble or razor-burn (especially on my bikini line).  </li>
            <li> Attempts to contact customer service were futile, and I was willing to send it in to have it repaired at any cost to me (</li>
            <li> Works as listed, but doesn&#x27;t keep the hair from coming back any better than shaving.  </li>
            <li> If you are a first time user, do yourself a favor and get waxed first, than keep up w/the Emjoi.</li>
            <li> It felt like something hot was prickling my skins as I went over my leg.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest that if you are using it for the first time, begin on areas that do not have a lot of hair until you get used to the prickling feeling.  </li>
            <li> There is an opening on the top and if you don&#x27;t have your skin pulled back taut, there is the chance that your skin will get sucked into that opening.</li>
            <li> the first time)and</li>
            <li> For anyone interested, I believe Junior will be placing the Emjoi on ebay once he finds it.</li>
            <li> so I can handle pain pretty well</li>
            <li> The fact that it is rechargeable mattered to me when I first bought it</li>
            <li> that I am aware of.   </li>
            <li> In order to avoid this, I used ice packs on that area first and then went ahead with the epilator.  </li>
            <li> I just finished my first time at the Emjoi, and, man did that thing hurt.  </li>
            <li> I tried to use it for most of that time, thinking that things would improve, but in the end I had to send it back.</li>
            <li> Bonus is one does not have stubble growth, does not have to remove hair again for several weeks, no risk of razor cuts, and skin looks better after using Emjoi.   </li>
            <li> Now I can touchup every few days and my legs always look good.</li>
            <li> I agree with all the positive statements others have made regarding this product - it really works! &lt;</li>
            <li> My corded devices became finicky over time (damaged cord, most likely), and I had to hold the cord a certain way to get them to work.  </li>
            <li> I waited a long time before getting it because I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be worth spending that much on it</li>
            <li> I am always in search of new ways to remove unwanted hair and after reading the reviews here I was so excited to receive my Emjoi AP-9GAR1 Gently</li>
            <li> also really like being able to use this on the face (chin, upper lip).  </li>
            <li> Pulling out hair doesn&#x27;t seem to hurt as much as tugging on it several times so the Emjoi is much better than the Epilady.  </li>
            <li> If keeping your legs smooth is a constant battle, the pain might be worth it for you.</li>
            <li> This particular model I find very effective, easy to clean, doesn&#x27;t look as freaky weird as the other ones I saw, and I like the gold blades better.</li>
            <li> I have very fine blonde leg hair that most other epilators won&#x27;t grab.  </li>
            <li> The positive is it didn&#x27;t hurt and I am a wimp.</li>
            <li> Once you get through the aweful first time it gets much easier because you can use it as you see hair.</li>
            <li> and I tried it immediately-it does much better job than the Braun one,I had for long time/Silk-epil</li>
            <li> In any case, it appears that the blades are on a straight surface, plus it seems to be much higher seeling than the Emjoi.  </li>
            <li> I started at the very top of the hair line and just went over a few hairs.  </li>
            <li> really does hurt the first couple of times but after that the pain isn&#x27;t as noticable.</li>
            <li> It has many more tweezers and it is easier to make sure that no hairs are left behind in the unit.  </li>
            <li> The beauty of the Emjoi is that it is so easy to reach the back of my calves and thighs.  </li>
            <li> I took Advil and promised myself a large whiskey as soon as I finished.  </li>
            <li> it certainly works for me</li>
            <li> It is certainly a lot faster and cleaner than shaving or waxing.  </li>
            <li> Hairs grow back very fine and soft, not prickly.  </li>
            <li> As a former Epilady user, I found this product to be much better, less pain, more hair removed.  </li>
            <li> What a HUGE difference from the last one!  </li>
            <li> I am really looking forward to it.    </li>
            <li> &quot; my whole leg.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used tweezing (no pain, too much time for all my hair),</li>
            <li> and it really did not hurt me that much</li>
            <li> I also use it on my face for my upper lip and it makes it so smooth.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Gently Gold Caress.</li>
            <li> if it is unbearable than just know the speed of the machine helps, but the fact that there are many more hairs being tweezed makes it more painful.  </li>
            <li> Gently Gold Caress Rechargeable Hair Remover.  </li>
            <li> It took me 3 attempts over 2 days to do my whole leg, no bleeding.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because I have very course hair on my legs and underarms.  </li>
            <li> When I purchased it 2 years ago it was over $70, shouldn&#x27;t something that cost that much</li>
            <li> If you just chose a squared area the size of the device and tweeze in all four directions, you&#x27;ll cover a lot of skin real estate in no time.  </li>
            <li> No pain, visually hairless and fairly smooth results to the touch.  </li>
            <li> With eyes watering, I sucked it up and fully completed one whole pit before deciding the 4 minutes of recordable pain</li>
            <li> I used the Gently Gold again.  </li>
            <li> It also will stop the blades/tweezers from rolling if you apply to much pressure</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I just got my Emjoi Gently Gold yesterday and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.  </li>
            <li> Will make a comparison once i get it, but if the above sounds relevant, bear it in mind.</li>
            <li> This epilator works very well.</li>
            <li> really dreaded doing my underarms.  </li>
            <li> It took about 2-3 minutes to do each underarm and it really did not hurt that much.  </li>
            <li> and I really thought I had made a mistake in buying the product, but I persevered.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is very opinionated.  </li>
            <li> and then I might not mind the intense pain so much.</li>
            <li> Nothing gentle about it.</li>
            <li> Well, it hurts so much.</li>
            <li> With the epilator, my face stays smooth for days (not the 4 to 6 weeks promised, but a big improvement!).  </li>
            <li> It does not hurt as much as I thought it would.  </li>
            <li> It really does get the job done, though.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it for underarms because it hurts too much</li>
            <li> I just had no idea how much.  </li>
            <li> I thought that if I just stuck with it for a while, I would get toughened up, and using it wouldn&#x27;t bother me so much.  </li>
            <li> product name is Gently Gold Caress.  </li>
            <li> It also works very well with the charger plugged in to the unit.  </li>
            <li> Does an excellent job and is great for removing the annoying facial fuzz (upper lip and chin), foot and toe hair, and underarm hair.  </li>
            <li> It took about 40 minutes to completely clear the area and within 15 minutes I broke out in blisters that left marks that lasted for more than a month.</li>
            <li> I rarely write Amazon reviews but had to share my experience with the Emjoi Gently Gold Caress because I&#x27;ve been so pleasantly surprised at how well it works.</li>
            <li> You will never be able to get the same silky soft legs that you can with a razor.&lt;BR</li>
            <li> It may also take a couple more days of using the Enjoi after the initial session to completely remove all hair from and area.  </li>
            <li> I strongly recomend the use of this hair removal robot, and to just tough it out the first time, because it is a lot better than shaving.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve found it works best if you use an up and down motion instead of the small circles recommended in the manual.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The process is also much quicker than other home hair removal systems and the results are more complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other epilators and love them (burnt the motor out on my Braun after 3 yrs).  </li>
            <li> Some detractors say the device doesn&#x27;t last long, but, even if I don&#x27;t get more than a year, it was (and will be) worth the price.  </li>
            <li> so he can clean out his ears and such.  </li>
            <li> I am still impressed with it even though the motor slowed down lately.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, I was able to use it on my underarms (although it may take several tries to get the hair totally gone, it&#x27;s already better than if I&#x27;d shaved), and I am gradually working on the bikini line.  </li>
            <li> I MUCH prefer taking care of hair-removal once a week (at an absolute MOST), while sitting watching TV instead of my former daily, fancy-angling-my-foot-in-the-soap-dish-shower-praying-I-don&#x27;t-fall-over-and wreck-the-bathroom routine.</li>
            <li> I only wish it would make my legs a little more smooth</li>
            <li> and i think it all depends on how much it hurts when you tweeze hair normally.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend numbing the area with ice first if you are really sensitive.</li>
            <li> I was not actually crying, but that&#x27;s how much my eyes were watering!  </li>
            <li> Apparently the little ball bearings were falling out of the sides, prohibiting the smooth and easy operation of the device.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I have a higher pain tolerance than most, but I have very little pain using the Emjoi.  </li>
            <li> After 2 years of using the Optima I decided to give this one a try, mainly because of the cordless option.</li>
            <li> Day 2, I attempted my whole bikini area and lower, (I couldn&#x27;t do the whole thing though, way too sensitive)</li>
            <li> I tried using it quickly without prepping and my hair and all the negatives happened like hair not getting pulled out properly, only getting cut.&lt;br</li>
            <li> legs will not be a smooth as they are with shaving, but you also won&#x27;t get the same type of irritation and you won&#x27;t need to remove the hair as frequently as with shaving.  </li>
            <li> My main problem area is some hair on my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> This product really works only if you use it the right way.</li>
            <li> Well...I have a high tolerance to pain</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, although you could save a couple of bucks and get the corded version.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> ok that hurt a little but again</li>
            <li> WOW!!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s effective, just hard to get used to.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to put it near my leg because of how loud it was and the rotating of it was so fast.  </li>
            <li> It did not hurt my legs near as much as waxing.  </li>
            <li> I foolishly purchased this to take care of hair I would normally have waxed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few, but not as many as I&#x27;d get with waxing.  </li>
            <li> I urge you to strongly consider buying an alternate brand of epilator, such as a Braun.</li>
            <li> When I take ball bearing out of the left side to insert them in the right side, they still fall out.  </li>
            <li> It got all of the hairs on my face, with the exception of two that were very stiffly laid back against the skin, but tweezing two hairs instead of two dozen was definitely a good thing.</li>
            <li> I have gotten it down to a habit and it is so easy.  </li>
            <li> This seemed to cut down on the pain, and then it went very quickly after that.  </li>
            <li> applies for their new version.</li>
            <li> Hooray for tank tops (I live in L.A.  </li>
            <li> providing it did not exceed the cost of a new one!).&lt;BR&gt;</li>
            <li> But there was some discomfort, because hey, yanking out hair from sensitive skin hurts, but not as much as razor burn on sensitive skin does.</li>
            <li> Except for a small patch on one ankle and the first pass over either the underarms or bikini line, there really wasn&#x27;t any pain, just the sensation and mild discomfort of hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> if you are only going to use this for your legs than its shape is probably great, but since i have really thin hair on my legs</li>
            <li> I went back 5 days later and achieved really smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> Surprising it doesn&#x27;t hurt much there if your skin is tight and firm.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a quality products that helps to cut down on time spent shaving/waxing and does not get you irritated, which for most of us is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> For intimate curvy areas, it is important to be only one shaft wide.  </li>
            <li> It stings at first but after a second or so the pain goes away.</li>
            <li> It gets irretating after a while, but in the long run, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Wow, the additional tweezers make all the difference in the world too!  </li>
            <li> did!&lt;br /&gt;One thing you need to know is that it does hurt, BUT only at first.  </li>
            <li> first thinking that if I could stand that pain I could definitely do my legs.  </li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Normally to get results like this, you would have to go to a PROFESSIONAL.  </li>
            <li> It was more uncomfortable on my upper thighs because I had more hair because I have not shaved or waxed there in a while.  </li>
            <li> It did take me a while to get up the courage, and my younger sister helped me with that and went first without me knowing.  </li>
            <li> so i&#x27;ll probably order my third one pretty soon.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this a second time because I lost the first one on a vacation trip.  </li>
            <li> My favorite is the fact I have no more underarm pricklies which I used to get from shaving.  </li>
            <li> so you have a clean start, then use Emjoi going forward for maintenance, (2) put a little baby powder on your skin prior to using Emjoi to ensure your skin is dry, and (2) be sure to pull your skin</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants to quit using a shaver daily.</li>
            <li> old one i had for 3 years is Braun - it&#x27;s still in perfict condition, but i just wanted somethng new.</li>
            <li> It was so gentle and fast on my legs that I did what would have been unthinkable in my Epilady days -</li>
            <li> The braun epilator is not as noisy ( the emjoi is kind of scary the first time in term of noise) but creates stubbles on my legs.</li>
            <li> All those horror stories you hear about a woman&#x27;s daily beauty treatments are all true, especially the hair removal ones.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt very much when you are doing it, but later I had red bumps and my legs were VERY sensitve to touch for a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> The first few times you will have to go back over your legs with a razor to get them really smooth.</li>
            <li> I was able to do my upper thighs, which had significantly less hair growth to begin with</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I also must have a higher pain tolerance because it doesn&#x27;t really hurt.</li>
            <li> And if could get use to the pain (however brief) of waxing, I can certain get use to the discomfort of this.   </li>
            <li> Overall, highly recommended if you have a high pain tolerance.</li>
            <li> I do have about a million little red bumps in an almost unmentionable place, but my skin is smooth!  </li>
            <li> They would be clear for one day.  </li>
            <li> No razor burn, no hair, no shadow, Just clear skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;the machine is very noisy and looks kind of scary if you aren&#x27;t used to these kinds of machines, but after my sister ashured me it didn&#x27;t hurt</li>
            <li> It now takes me about 45 minutes to completely remove hair from both legs, bikini area, chin and underarms.    </li>
            <li> I was a frequent waxer, and thought wow look at this</li>
            <li> It removes hair from essentially any area of the body, and you really can use it the day after shaving.  &lt;</li>
            <li> I finally found the Emjoi Gently Gold Caress.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;My advice to anyone that has written negative comments regarding the pain of using the Emjoi is to stick with it more than just a couple of times before you grab your razor.  </li>
            <li> I just used this machine once so far.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of the old days when you had an alarm clock or GHETO BLASTER and it worked for 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My Epilady took at least an hour or more to get the job done, the Emjoi only 30-45 minutes depending if I did my whole leg or just the lower leg.  </li>
            <li> (I also found that margaritas help considerably with numbness).  </li>
            <li> I purchased this hoping that it would be the answer to frequent shaving and waxing.</li>
            <li> As near as I can tell it was snapping my thinner regrowing hairs off at skin level.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, this product is NOT for you.    </li>
            <li> the female body also has curves that are concave, not just convex, eg around the bikini line.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but my skin is really sensitive to begin with -</li>
            <li> you are also on the hairy side, this product will make your personal grooming soooo much easier.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it works as well as if you were to go to a salon and get a professional waxing.</li>
            <li> Some things I don&#x27;t like are that I get the feeling that sometimes it does not pluck the hair completely but instead breaks the hair off.</li>
            <li> more complaint</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is so much cheaper to by this product than spend money regularly in a salon.</li>
            <li> So this morning while Junior was sleeping I took the Emjoi Gently Gold Caress and gave a swipe at his back hair.  </li>
            <li> It does leave hair soft, but still there.</li>
            <li> I got the accessory pack too which gives you a sensitive attachment that covers some of the tweezers.   </li>
            <li> and \\&quot;Caress\\&quot; are descriptive terms that shouldn&#x27;t be allowed anywhere near this product.</li>
            <li> The lower speed is great for beginners as it is less painful than the high speed, but it is also less effective for removing hairs.</li>
            <li> It does pinch the skin if I move it too fast but holding the skin flat prevents this.</li>
            <li> I rarely wore sleeveless tops in the Summer, due to the continuous need to shave.</li>
            <li> Give it at least a couple tries if it hurts at first, and see if it gets better.</li>
            <li> different parts of the body can handle different amounts of pain or rather are more or less sensitive to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This means that instead of grabbing each hair and tugging 5 or 6 times before it pulls it out, the Emjoy actually pulls it out on the first or second attempt, almost every time.  </li>
            <li> This product is decent compared to traditional razor shaving</li>
            <li> My main reason for purchasing was for unwanted facial hair.  </li>
            <li> I only got one leg done at first because I had to be somewhere, but after dreading coming back to it for an hour, I returned home and finished the rest of the torture job.  </li>
            <li> But I personally like to use it on high on my legs &amp; under arms.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item and will be buying another one just as soon as possible.  </li>
            <li> If you are used to waxing it hurts less than that - my wife has a very sensetive skin and she didnt feel much when I did her underarms.</li>
            <li> Other reviews are right: there is a little irritation, but it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> But all this is a small price to pay for reasonably smooth legs every day.</li>
            <li> After the first two or three uses, discomfort is minimal.  </li>
            <li> The key for me is to really pull the skin tight, I even had my husband hold my skin the first time.</li>
            <li> Now, it feels sort of like running a stiff bristle brush over the area, prickly but not painful.  </li>
            <li> It was not holding its charge very long and was not working as fast as before, even when it was plugged.  </li>
            <li> Time: It took about 5 minutes to do what would have taken me 15-25 minutes previously, had more complete hair removal, and hurt a lot less.</li>
            <li> I looked at it for at least 8 months before I finally took the plunge, and am I glad that I</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to wait for that half inch worth of hair before heading to the salon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once you have used it a few times, it doesn&#x27;t hurt much because there isn&#x27;t as much hair.  </li>
            <li> On top of that, Amazon issue the certificate discount 2months late leaving a short period of time before it expired.</li>
            <li> Using this on the bikini area is fine, but I recommend waxing the first time since the long hair is hard for Emjoi to remove properly.  </li>
            <li> Just keep it on high and do it quick if your hair is a little long.</li>
            <li> In addition, I have to rigorously exfoliate, or else I get major ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While it is delightful to note that the makers of this otherwise sturdy little machine have noticed this long-obscure fact about the female body, I do have to point out to them the following two startling observations:&lt;br /&gt;1.  </li>
            <li> i just wax - i like just going over one large area fast quick pain rather than the random plucking feeling.  </li>
            <li> and I loved it so very much, but after a few years it seemed to slow down</li>
            <li> After the first use or two, it doesn&#x27;t hurt (other reviewers gave up too early and didn&#x27;t give them enough time).  </li>
            <li> After a few months (yes, it did take that long), that hair also became so fine that it also removes with ease now.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as painful as waxing and results are great.  </li>
            <li> I still have to epilate at least once a week, and I have to shave every couple of days to feel smooth.</li>
            <li> The skin under my arms is very very white and clear.  </li>
            <li> Waxing kept my legs smooth for 3 weeks, then there were the next 3 weeks spent hairy as I grew it long enough to wax again, all the while hoping that no dress-wearing occasions popped up while I was growing the hair out.</li>
            <li> It has several features I have never seen before that make it clearly</li>
            <li> recently (yes, it&#x27;s about 13 years old)</li>
            <li> Who knew those places were quite that sensitive when ripping out multiple hairs by the root!??!  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m buying this product again after my three year old machine stopped charging last night.</li>
            <li> I am using it on nearly a weekly basis as the hair grows at different paces.</li>
            <li> Last week he ordered up this here product for me and made me cook him his dinner early</li>
            <li> It took me weeks to complete the first round of hair removal in this area as I am one of those unlucky people whose \\&quot;private\\&quot; hair seems to grow to my knees.  </li>
            <li> I used this product for several months, hoping that as time went on the hair on my legs would start growing back more slowly (as promised).</li>
            <li> The design of this gadget is not perfect (curved shape does not make it easy in some areas), but it certainly does the job.  </li>
            <li> It is well worth the money and for new users the discomfort of using a product like this only last a few times.</li>
            <li> I would go over my legs quickly with the Emjoi every few days to get the hairs that were in a different stage of the growth cycle</li>
            <li> (I mean really lightly), but it is nothing compared to the pain of my intestines being removed via my shin bone from two decades ago.  </li>
            <li> It hurts pretty bad the first time but every time after that it&#x27;s not bad at all</li>
            <li> Anyway, as far as performance and overall satisfaction goes, this is definitely a keeper.  </li>
            <li> I was really satisfied with the way it handled underarms, although bikini was a little more painful</li>
            <li> My emjoi barely hurts, but I only use it on legs and armpits.</li>
            <li> surprised how long it&#x27;s lasted.  </li>
            <li> I shaved my legs after the first few times</li>
            <li> When I first purchased this item, I paid about $90 a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> It is not unbearable, however, and the small amount of pain is worth the results.</li>
            <li> it is basically useless on my leg because the hair on my leg is very fine and it just cuts it off rather than pulling it out from the roots.</li>
            <li> It feels like little tiny needle sticks at first</li>
            <li> All reviews said that the first time would be the most painful.</li>
            <li> , I used to wax my legs not anymore, this is much easier and less painfull.</li>
            <li> Another con is that it does not get hairs at odd angles very well.</li>
            <li> My legs look a lot less furry and much smoother than they did a couple of hours ago.  </li>
            <li> After the first few times it gets easier and the red bumps don&#x27;t appear either.  </li>
            <li> I found it useful for underarms, since it is a small area with coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Ok, ripping the hair out of your skin by the roots is never fun, but this has to be the least traumatic device I have used yet.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;The result for me is smoother and less irritating than waxing, as my sensitive skin often becomes burned with even the most cautious waxing pros.&lt;br /&gt;The product does not work as well on my legs, though.  </li>
            <li> It is much easier to do a little at a time.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it under my arms, it was very little pain.</li>
            <li> So, I started researching on this, I read all the reviews, the good and bad ones.</li>
            <li> When the hairs grow back, they are lighter and thinner (good) but they tend to break off instead of pull out (bad).</li>
            <li> the female body also has parts that are flat, like thighs (maybe their models were barbies)&lt;BR&gt;2.  </li>
            <li> At full charge, it&#x27;ll last a few weeks, although, I don&#x27;t use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t shave it because it wasn&#x27;t long enough and would only cause irritation...</li>
            <li> I do find that I have to use the Emjoi every few days to get the new hair growth that is constantly coming in.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t tried a flat one</li>
            <li> , that may be that case, but I can&#x27;t stand to let my hair get long enough to try.</li>
            <li> Long enough for me to do my legs, underarms, bikini area and still have plenty of power before having to recharge.  </li>
            <li> The cord is plenty long enough to move around.</li>
            <li> but the legs would result in hair tangled in the coil, pinched skin, intolerable pain, and generally no hair removal when I tried it.  </li>
            <li> The battery last for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Well, Emjoi AP-9GAR is really gental, less painfull than my Braun or Emjoi Optima, but it seems to be very slow and too gentle ( i don&#x27;t need it).</li>
            <li> I just got tired of having to shave every other day in order to remain totally smooth.  </li>
            <li> However, for large areas it is a little bit more painful than waxing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a faithful Epilady user for the past 15 years, but when I used this for the first time, I felt I was coming out of the dark ages.</li>
            <li> I can go as long as two weeks in the winter.  </li>
            <li> I do have some problems with ingrown hairs in this area, but it is a minor inconvenience.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t speak to the longevity of the product, but I hope is lasts as long as my Epilady, because I plan to be using it forever.</li>
            <li> I never knew how long the hairs are underneath the skin until this machine took them out.</li>
            <li> and it keeps the hair away for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Now it takes as long as the Epilady and is not working as well, like the motor is wearing out or something.  </li>
            <li> And compared with salon waxing, I have control over what area is covered at a given time and can go fast or slow or stop as needed.  </li>
            <li> while you do have to check your legs the next day after using it, this is no different than the product I previously used.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes you have to go over the same spot twice, but other than that</li>
            <li> Better than expensive waxing!</li>
            <li> Just so you know, I only used it every other week or so, not an every day thing.  </li>
            <li> and it is cheaper than waxing in the long run!</li>
            <li> I tried a couple times to use it on legs and while I loved the results, it was just a little too painful.  </li>
            <li> ( not that it takes a very long time.</li>
            <li> Its is rather unless, if you are looking for another dry shaver than this could be the product for you</li>
            <li> Use some powder before doing those areas so they are completely dry.  </li>
            <li> After my first week, I tried the bikini area, again as long as you pull the skin tight, its hardly any pain.</li>
            <li> I seem to be in the minority with my opinion, but this product does not live up to its claims.</li>
            <li> I would recomend this if you have high pain tolerance and thick hair, but personaly for me I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For a start the cost of the unit was about the cost of a single waxing.</li>
            <li> Before this machine I had to shave every single day.</li>
            <li> The next day I would have a dark shadow.  </li>
            <li> I gave it a valiant effort, but it is just not powerful enough for me: it took twice the time of the Optima to get all the hair.</li>
            <li> This just trims the hair down and occasionally pull hair out at the roots.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Verdict: certainly worth the money if you have a high pain tolerance and aren&#x27;t afraid of a little blood</li>
            <li> As for the pain factor, It did sting the first time, but I have actually started to quite like the feeling (weird huh?).</li>
            <li> It was faster, it pulled very short hair out and was a bit less painfull.  </li>
            <li> Epilady never worked there, and wax is such a mess.</li>
            <li> After waiting a week for the hair on my legs to grow long enough, it removed hair unevenly and was more painful than waxing.</li>
            <li> When I saw this in a store, I tried it on the little hair I had on the back of my hand.</li>
            <li> last a little longer?  </li>
            <li> It did leave little red bumps after the hair was pulled out</li>
            <li> It was very painful the first time, but worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Especially, when you put it closer to the skin, it just slows down, almost stops, the hair removal may take for ever!</li>
            <li> That was some of the worst pain I have ever experienced.  </li>
            <li> Those areas are more painful because the hair is coarser.  </li>
            <li> and it was the most painful thing I have ever felt.  </li>
            <li> And the slower speed makes using it under my arms (the most painful area for me</li>
            <li> It is admittedly painful at first, but I only have to use it once every couple of weeks (it takes that long for anything substantial to grow back) and I&#x27;ve gotten use to the feel of the pull.  </li>
            <li> I used it on my underarm and a few days later I saw stubs-</li>
            <li> Absolutely NO PAIN, and no pain eversince.</li>
            <li> but nothing like I expected.  </li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t do what I expected it to do.</li>
            <li> It takes going over the same area a few times before all hairs are removed.</li>
            <li> The hair is pulled out so that should be expected.  </li>
            <li> Also if your hair is a little to long the first time you use it under your arms, the pulling of the hair is a little much at first, but then not to bad.</li>
            <li> It use to take me that long to wax half of my leg.  </li>
            <li> You have to carefully get the hair out with either sharp tweezers or a needle.</li>
            <li> My husband got this for me because he was tired of how gross my leg hair became waiting for it to be long enough to wax.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also on a once-a-week schedule for my legs after about 3 years of using one or the other device.  </li>
            <li> I do recommend the Emjoi AP-9GAR over any other unit.  </li>
            <li> , I just thought I would warn any other girls out there who have hair like I do.</li>
            <li> massage your skin while removing the hair, virtually eliminating the pain other hair removal systems</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as other epilators I&#x27;ve owned and it can be used on practically any body part you can think of.  </li>
            <li> By the next evening, no more stinging.</li>
            <li> If you need to do only small patches like armpits, this is your machine.</li>
            <li> At first when you turn it on it looks and sounds scary</li>
            <li> No more having to drop [money] to go see the cosmetologist everytime the hair grows back!!!!  </li>
            <li> Other customers have said that this thing hurts.  </li>
            <li> Also, I have not tried any other hair &amp;quot;pluckers.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li> I have tried everything from shaving to waxing to other epilators.  </li>
            <li> should note that I have not tried other epilators.  </li>
            <li> I tried waxing, but it was messy and never really got all the hair off -- not to mention living with icky stubble for the hair to grow long enough to re-wax.  </li>
            <li> But the Emjoi is poorly designed -- it&#x27;s curved head means that the entire head does not touch skin at the same time, so it often misses a lot of hairs.  </li>
            <li> With the Emjoi, hair was removed, no skin was pinched, and there was minimal pain - even less than what I experience with salon waxing.  </li>
            <li> The skin left behind is AMAZINGLY soft, and, as a naturally dark brown-haired girl, there&#x27;s no \\&quot;shadow\\&quot; even after SIX days!!  </li>
            <li> It is a little bit scary when you first time use it.</li>
            <li> The high speed setting is no more painful than waxing, so don&#x27;t worry too much about that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had it for about 2 years, and it is not worth what I paid for it.  </li>
            <li> but if I didn&#x27;t shave it, there would be that dark shadow.  </li>
            <li> The cord is long enough to plug in behind the couch and use in all types of contortionist moves.  </li>
            <li> i only have one complaint though...</li>
            <li> For first-time users, it takes a few tries to get used to it</li>
            <li> Not recommended for coarse or thick hairs.  </li>
            <li> He has a very coarse, thick beard that grows way up his face.  </li>
            <li> The tears ran down my face and I had to scream every time I ripped off another strip.  </li>
            <li> But this little machine is a miracle to all women who don&#x27;t like hair on their legs or any other part of your body, it is so effortless in the removal of hair, just as the advertisement says it removes hair even if you shaved the day before.</li>
            <li> I need to shave my underarms everyday, but am not able to because of severe razor burn (can only shave it 2 times a week...gross) and shaving your legs everyday is a grueling process.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money with other gadjets or products.</li>
            <li> I used the Emjoy and had almost complete hair removal in 1 or 2 passes, minimal pain, and very few hairs broken off.  </li>
            <li> This hair was so heavy and thick that I thought my only hope was laser removal.  </li>
            <li> I have never used and epilator before, but I read the previous reviews and they convinced me to try it.  </li>
            <li> She has had it for a year and a half and did not use it until 5 months ago.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;It took less than 20 minutes to do my legs and my under arms.  </li>
            <li> I waxed for 3 months previous to using this product.  </li>
            <li> or you will get a mess).  </li>
            <li> For people who said it&#x27;s painless, it&#x27;s not entirely true.</li>
            <li> Unlike other brands I have used the hair is actually being pulled out rather than broken off.</li>
            <li> , some spots a little bit of pain but nothing unbearable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m done in less than half the time!  </li>
            <li> I remember thinking how little it hurt.  </li>
            <li> Once I got use to it, I moved a little lower, and so on.  </li>
            <li> Just a little heat felt after it was over.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t use it on my underarms (even though I change the little head on it.</li>
            <li> Even if I let the hair grow to be a little longer before using the Emjoi, it still didn&#x27;t remove it all.</li>
            <li> Even though I exfoliate my legs several times a week (which makes it very hard to keep a tan), ingrown hair can be a hassle as well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is because I have A LOT of thick hair on my lower legs, but I am having a hard time going back to finish.  </li>
            <li> It was plenty painful under my arms but the results were worth it.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of my $$$$</li>
            <li> You get used to it after using it for a few months.</li>
            <li> so I bought the Emjoi AP-9GAR from Amazon.com a few years ago</li>
            <li> A few ingrown hairs will not deter me from using this system.  </li>
            <li> take a pair of tweezers and tweeze a few hairs and see how it feels.  </li>
            <li> I have not had any trouble using it and</li>
            <li> I received this hair remover a few days ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been months now and I am still dealing with unslightly ingrown hairs and the scars they leave behind when you finally liberate the hair.  </li>
            <li> I am going to use it again in a few days so the one&#x27;s I missed</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend this product if you are tired of shaving all the time.</li>
            <li> Pop a few Aleve.</li>
            <li> While for some people, the pain is harsh, for me</li>
            <li> when I travel for a few days I don&#x27;t even bother to bring the cord with</li>
            <li> out the first use, and it should be less painful after.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve endured pain in my life (kidney stones &amp;amp; broken bones, etc) with an average to above-average pain threshold, and maybe if this torture device removed all the hairs on a single pass or two, I&#x27;d tolerate it.  </li>
            <li> - it was less painful if done often, and the spring broke off about as much hair as it pulled out.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used this product it was painful</li>
            <li> Perhaps that is why the first couple of times were painful.  </li>
            <li> shaving (have to do it daily, yuck), waxing with mixed results (very messy &amp;amp; time consuming to do-it-yourself) and although the epilady of years past was painful, it at least removed the hairs in a single pass or two.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve played with the angles and motions and my hair is least a half of an INCH (not cm.)</li>
            <li> heck, I wanted to wake up my little brother and take off all of his hair too!  </li>
            <li> , so bad I really could&#x27;nt</li>
            <li> I mean, there is a little tingling and sting, but I use it on my bikini line and underarms without hesitation.  </li>
            <li> Do a small patch at a time and use a \\&quot;post-epilation\\&quot; cream to ease irritation.  </li>
            <li> I used to shave my legs everyday anyway, so I don&#x27;t even see this as a negative aspect to this product.  </li>
            <li> have waxed before, but I usually shave my legs.  </li>
            <li> Usually after shaving, I immediatly have stuble.  </li>
            <li> (The Epilady made me bleed in the past).  </li>
            <li> No more day after stubble, that is so noticeable.</li>
            <li> It usually takes my skin four days to heal</li>
            <li> The noise is also unbelievable with this thing, my roomates think I&#x27;m doing something unmentionable when I&#x27;m in the bathroom with the door shut.</li>
            <li> I usually prefer waxing to using this machine.</li>
            <li> So if you are not sure about it like I was take it from me</li>
            <li> Also, no more \\&quot;spiky\\&quot; feel to the hair regrowth--like after you shave.</li>
            <li> No more shaving!!!Make</li>
            <li> Needless to say, my Emjoi is in the lake, along with my personal effects.  </li>
            <li> but this is unbelievable</li>
            <li> Yes, it helps get closer to the skin in some parts, but it also makes using it over knees and other areas next to impossible.</li>
            <li> When I recieved this in the mail I was shocked to find not only did this not do such a great job of removing hair but hurt real bad horribly bad</li>
            <li> careful about the adapter, it is not ideal for travel because it doesn&#x27;t have a worldwide voltage.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, black hair in my underarms.  </li>
            <li> No more razor stubble and no more itching!  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t hurt if it gets skin, but the curved shape is not ideal for anything other than legs</li>
            <li> That reason could made my skin a little bit tough.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s made of hard core.  </li>
            <li> It was so hard to reach there when waxing.</li>
            <li> And no &amp;quot;5 o&#x27;clock shadow&amp;quot; in the underarm.&lt;br /&gt;As far as pain--I don&#x27;t find epilators painful.  </li>
            <li> I think if you do not have thick hair, this probably works well</li>
            <li> Of course, that assumes you don&#x27;t have really thick hair which I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> And slow on my face</li>
            <li> I hate stubble - and I haven&#x27;t had any for 4 years, thanks to my Emjoi.  </li>
            <li> Regrowth is slow so you don&#x27;t have to shave under your arm as often and the hair comes out thinner (as opposed to shaving it).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have too much trouble using it on my legs, it didn&#x27;t feel any worse than waxing.  </li>
            <li> no more shaving!  </li>
            <li> But no more!  </li>
            <li> If you are like me and not sure if these sort of products work or if they HURT!</li>
            <li> When I finally tried to use it again, I found it too painful, and I&#x27;ve been too lazy to bring out the buffing pad to exfoliate, then put on the numbing gel, then wash it off, and try it again.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t get all of the hair, was extremely painful, and caused major skin irritation.</li>
            <li> No more ugly dark stuble and shaving everyday</li>
            <li> The device barely removed any of the hair I wanted to get rid of, and again was extremely painful and caused skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> Here are some tips for reducing the pain: (1) go to the salon for a professional wax before using Emjoi</li>
            <li> It hurt SO bad that I am having a hard time finishing my lower legs (even after several months).  </li>
            <li> and I still had serious doubts UNTIL I tried</li>
            <li> I see it is less expensive now</li>
            <li> She came back and told me \\&quot;you gave me the bad one.</li>
            <li> but I always wonder if something could be less painful or could be a little bit faster</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less painful, time consuming and messy than waxing</li>
            <li> Finally today, it was making noises of a sick man</li>
            <li> This works so well and causes no pain at all to a hard core user even with 2 months&#x27; growth! &lt;</li>
            <li> I thought wrong, waxing I&#x27;ll admit is extremely painful and can completely understand why someone could not go through with it.</li>
            <li> The first time is the worst.  </li>
            <li> so your hot date on friday doesn&#x27;t know that you&#x27;ve had a horrible rash.</li>
            <li> In terms of pain, which was my biggest concern, I hold my breath and tough it out.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair...</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair on my legs</li>
            <li> it is somewhat uncomfortable but not too bad - especially if you&#x27;re used to waxing.</li>
            <li> Because of these inefficiencies and poor design, I returned the Emjoi and will instead search out another Braun (hopefully a rechargeable one).</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just be clear,there is no joy about it.  </li>
            <li> the razor blade just makes it worse like a tree trunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have tried similar products in the past and was very disappointed with the results.</li>
            <li> I used the Emjoi, it was so painful that tears were running down my face.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t too bad, just made my eyes tear a little!</li>
            <li> The hair that grows in is THICK and jet black, which looks very very bad!!!  </li>
            <li> Anywhere else is truly uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;using for arm pit hair is weird.  </li>
            <li> Knees and ankles are difficult.</li>
            <li> Difficult to use if hair growth is perpendicular to your bone structure.    </li>
            <li> Waxing became too expensive and time consuming.  </li>
            <li> They were RUDE and tried to shoffle me off to the Remington outlet when this is THEIR product!!!</li>
            <li> Some cold cream helped sooth the stinging.</li>
            <li> i am guessing that it would be inconvenient for the bikini area, but i haven&#x27;t tried</li>
            <li> Totally disappointment with their service.</li>
            <li> If you have thin wispy hairs and hate to have to shave because of the prickliness to follow, but still want to remove hair, get an epilator.  </li>
            <li> I use a lot of vitamin e and aloe after using this thing, and it&#x27;s still scary looking!</li>
            <li> The emjoir is very uncomfortable, BUT...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Which means that a curved surface on the blades makes it almost impossible to reach hairs on those surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> really, really bad.</li>
            <li> I knew there would be pain, but this was not as bad as I was expecting.      </li>
            <li> and she said it hurt too bad.  </li>
            <li> It was not that bad there either.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it hurts as badly as people say (but maybe b/c</li>
            <li> When I did my knees and the inside of my thighs, it was painful.  </li>
            <li> After using the Emjoi for a time, it became tingly instead of painful.  </li>
            <li> It is not at all painful.  </li>
            <li> (it came to my attention as a gold box item).&lt;br /&gt;After going 3 weeks without using the Epilady on my legs (getting to the point where using it would have been painful)</li>
            <li> Way too painful on \\&quot;virgin\\&quot; hair.</li>
            <li> Of course it would be painful.</li>
            <li> My husband is a welder-with his calluses, he can&#x27;t feel any stray hairs, anyway!It was too painful for my underarms tho.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m sick of gross-smelling depilators</li>
            <li> I am SOOOOOO disappointed.  </li>
            <li> used to shave every day, which was time-consuming and annoying.  </li>
            <li> It was also completely worthless for underarms or the bikini area, which I would get waxed at a salon.  </li>
            <li> I needed to try this product because I have absolutely hated shaving my underarms.  </li>
            <li> - sometimes it SUCKS IN YOUR SKIN!!!!!</li>
            <li> This shaver is the worst!!!!</li>
            <li> The worst customer Service I had ever encountered in my life.</li>

            <li> I have had it for about 2 years, and it is not worth what I paid for it.  First, while using it on my arm, it grabbed the skin on my elbow and I had to remove the cover to free it.  After that, I left the cover off while shaving.  Now, it stopped working.  When I examined it, I noticed that the ball bearing on the right side have mostly fallen out.  When I take ball bearing out of the left side to insert them in the right side, they still fall out.  I tried to contact the company about the problem over the internet, and for some reason I could not.  You can save your money and buy something cheaper for the quality that you get with this hair remover.</li>
            <li> Maybe I have a higher pain tolerance than most, but I have very little pain using the Emjoi.  I mean, there is a little tingling and sting, but I use it on my bikini line and underarms without hesitation.  I don&#x27;t think it is great for my legs, but am totally happy with the product thus far.  It&#x27;s way cheaper than going to the salon for waxing, and the results are just as effective, plus you have the option of quick at home touch ups which makes it super convenient.</li>
            <li> I just got my Emjoi epilator and I have to say it didn&#x27;t meet my expectations at all. The positive is it didn&#x27;t hurt and I am a wimp. It stings at first but after a second or so the pain goes away. Like another review commented this unit did not pull the hair out at the roots rather it just cut the hair and made it seem like it got the hair out at the roots. I used it on my underarm and a few days later I saw stubs- it is basically useless on my leg because the hair on my leg is very fine and it just cuts it off rather than pulling it out from the roots. I wish I did not make this purchase because if I wanted an alternate shaver I would have gotten a better one. This just trims the hair down and occasionally pull hair out at the roots. Its is rather unless, if you are looking for another dry shaver than this could be the product for you but if you are looking for an epilator I suggest you look elsewhere. The only place that this item works is on the bikini area. Surprising it doesn&#x27;t hurt much there if your skin is tight and firm. I guess back to waxing for me. What a waste of my $$$$</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the epilator for about 4 years now. It gets all the hair out and yes, it makes your legs smooth too. I can&#x27;t wax or shave because I get folliculitus (ingrown hairs) really, really bad. The emjoir is very uncomfortable, BUT... it works. I have to wax once a week, and can&#x27;t afford to do so. It works fantastic, but try to focus on the television or listen to the radio. It gets irretating after a while, but in the long run, it&#x27;s worth it. If you can stand it, go for it. You get used to it after using it for a few months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a faithful Epilady user for the past 15 years, but when I used this for the first time, I felt I was coming out of the dark ages. This works so well and causes no pain at all to a hard core user even with 2 months&#x27; growth! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What I like best about this is the cordless capability. My corded devices became finicky over time (damaged cord, most likely), and I had to hold the cord a certain way to get them to work.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I also really like being able to use this on the face (chin, upper lip).  Epilady never worked there, and wax is such a mess. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I feel mixed about the curved end.  Yes, it helps get closer to the skin in some parts, but it also makes using it over knees and other areas next to impossible. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is a great product, and I am glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> My neighbor gave me a Braun Silk-epil and I loved it so very much, but after a few years it seemed to slow down (I think it has somehow gotten hair wrapped around the shaft).  I wanted more tweezers and a faster unit so I bought the Emjoi AP-9GAR from Amazon.com a few years ago (you can&#x27;t find them for a better price anywhere).  I still use both epilators, but I prefer the Emjoi.  It has many more tweezers and it is easier to make sure that no hairs are left behind in the unit.  I have the Braun at work for touch-ups only.  I use the Emjoi for my legs, my underarms, my chin and my bikini line.  I&#x27;ll admit, at first the pain was quite a deterrant to using it on my underarms, but I was determined.  This has made such a difference.  I mostly wear sleeveless tops, and unsightly underarm hair was a problem.  After a year, I only need to worry about it once a week or so. I&#x27;m also on a once-a-week schedule for my legs after about 3 years of using one or the other device.  I can go as long as two weeks in the winter.  Not because the hair doesn&#x27;t grow (wouldn&#x27;t that be nice), but because it comes in so fine that it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  I never have that \\&quot;stubbly\\&quot; feeling. I am most happy about the bikini line.  It took me weeks to complete the first round of hair removal in this area as I am one of those unlucky people whose \\&quot;private\\&quot; hair seems to grow to my knees.  This hair was so heavy and thick that I thought my only hope was laser removal.  Not so.  After a few months (yes, it did take that long), that hair also became so fine that it also removes with ease now. I do have some problems with ingrown hairs in this area, but it is a minor inconvenience. So, ladies, perservere!  It really is worth it. Do a small patch at a time and use a \\&quot;post-epilation\\&quot; cream to ease irritation.  I do recommend the Emjoi AP-9GAR over any other unit.  For intimate curvy areas, it is important to be only one shaft wide.  It has plenty of tweezers.  It does go faster plugged in than on the batteries, but I use it both ways.  It now takes me about 45 minutes to completely remove hair from both legs, bikini area, chin and underarms.    PS:  I still haven&#x27;t convinced my sister.  She thinks I&#x27;m a masochist after trying my unit one time.  Ha!  What a wimp!    Update Feb 2, 2006:  My Braun finally quit, so I bought another Emjoi AP-9GAR to keep at work for touch ups.  I didn&#x27;t even consider another unit.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair... all over my body.  I refer to myself as JoJo the Jungle Girl.      I cut myself for the last time with a razor and decided that was it... no more shaving!  I let my hair grow out for a couple of weeks and tried waxing my legs.  OH MY GOODNESS!  That was some of the worst pain I have ever experienced.  The tears ran down my face and I had to scream every time I ripped off another strip.  OUCH!  I took Advil and promised myself a large whiskey as soon as I finished.  I was using a sugar wax and it was not removing all the hair by any means.  I decided that was not going to work and went shopping for a hair removal system.  I decided on the Emjoi and sent away for it.      This is not a pain free system.  You cannot rip the hair out of your legs without pain.  It seems to be a great system though.  Since I had already ripped out my hair in big swatches I knew there would be pain, but this was not as bad as I was expecting.      When I was doing the calves of my legs, where I had already waxed, it was not bad.  It was much better than the wax.  When I did my knees and the inside of my thighs, it was painful.  After using the Emjoi for a time, it became tingly instead of painful.  You get used to it.  Since there is no way to cut yourself I just sat on the floor and read a book while running the Emjoi over my legs.    I took a shower, used the loofah, and did under my arms and some of my bikini line.  Use some powder before doing those areas so they are completely dry.  The bikini area was tender so I only did part of it.  I will work on it for a while to get it all done; the underarms were not bad at all.    I got the Emjoi today and used it today.  I will edit my review and post whether or not I start getting ingrown hairs.  I guess every system has problems.  A few ingrown hairs will not deter me from using this system.  I am going on vacation in June and I will not have to pack any razors even though I will be gone for a week!  Doesn&#x27;t thatsound like heaven?  I am really looking forward to it.    EDIT DATE AUGUST 16.  Okay, after using this for a few months I am more in love than ever.  I have gotten it down to a habit and it is so easy.  I will take a shower and use it before putting on my lotion.  I keep it plugged in all the time.  I will use it while sitting in front of the TV.  I use it on my bikini line and I don&#x27;t use the loofah anymore, I just go.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with ingrown hairs.  One thing I love about this is that it doesn&#x27;t make my mosquito bites bleed, I can \\&quot;shave\\&quot; my whole leg.  It is lovely.    This does not keep your legs as smooth as if you shaved with a razor.  The trade off is perfect for me.  I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> this item causes numerous ingrown hairs.  Use at your own risk</li>
            <li> I, and several of my friends, have purchased Emjoi products and they simply do not last. I urge you to strongly consider buying an alternate brand of epilator, such as a Braun. We had wonderful success with Braun products; they perform and they last.</li>
            <li> I thought the previous reviews were helpful and I find this hair remover to be really good. It does hurt as it is an epilator, doesn&#x27;t remove the really fine hairs, but it does a good job overall. I wish it were more angled to the bikini area, but I find it works well for underarms and legs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used for more than 3 years the older version of Emjoi Hair Remover and I was very happy with it. Almost do not feel any pain, very easy to use. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Same applies for their new version. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommend! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd time purchasing this item. I bought the first one about 6 years ago and loved it. Like anything else, you can only recharge something so many times before it needs to be replaced -- in the end, I was able to recharge it, but it would only last for about 10 mins and it wasn&#x27;t very strong. C&#x27;est la vie, six years is still a good run! Found a *really* good deal on my second one ($20 less than the first one) and have been enjoying it ever since. For first-time users, it takes a few tries to get used to it (I *don&#x27;t* recommend using it in the bikini area), but works great and lasts days longer than shaving!</li>
            <li> After using this epilator for 6 months I have mixed feelings about this method of hair removal.  My hope in the beginning was to only have to \\&quot;shave\\&quot; every 4-6 weeks. Not the case!  The hairs on your legs are constantly growing. Even though you have plucked the majority out at once, there will always be strays.  I still have to remove hair several times a week.  When the hairs grow back, they are lighter and thinner (good) but they tend to break off instead of pull out (bad). Even though I exfoliate my legs several times a week (which makes it very hard to keep a tan), ingrown hair can be a hassle as well. You have to carefully get the hair out with either sharp tweezers or a needle. In the end, even though your legs may LOOK hair free, they still do not feel as smooth to the touch as shaving.  So, I still shave for special occasions.  As for the pain factor, It did sting the first time, but I have actually started to quite like the feeling (weird huh?).</li>
            <li> I am always in search of new ways to remove unwanted hair and after reading the reviews here I was so excited to receive my Emjoi AP-9GAR1 Gently Gold Caress Rechargeable Hair Remover before it went on backorder.  I am SOOOOOO disappointed.  The words &amp;quot;gently&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;caress&amp;quot; should NOT be in its title.  I&#x27;ve used tweezing (no pain, too much time for all my hair), shaving (have to do it daily, yuck), waxing with mixed results (very messy &amp;amp; time consuming to do-it-yourself) and although the epilady of years past was painful, it at least removed the hairs in a single pass or two.  NOT THIS ONE! I&#x27;ve played with the angles and motions and my hair is least a half of an INCH (not cm.) and my skin is still whimpering. I&#x27;ve endured pain in my life (kidney stones &amp;amp; broken bones, etc) with an average to above-average pain threshold, and maybe if this torture device removed all the hairs on a single pass or two, I&#x27;d tolerate it.  But it doesn&#x27;t.  It will be the first time I&#x27;ve ever returned an item to Amazon.com since I started shopping here three years ago.  I seem to be in the minority with my opinion, but this product does not live up to its claims. Save your money and your skin and look elsewhere for a hair-removal product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other epilators and love them (burnt the motor out on my Braun after 3 yrs).  After the first use or two, it doesn&#x27;t hurt (other reviewers gave up too early and didn&#x27;t give them enough time).  But the Emjoi is poorly designed -- it&#x27;s curved head means that the entire head does not touch skin at the same time, so it often misses a lot of hairs.  This means you have to go over the same areas again and again.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t handle fine hairs well (after months of epilating, your hairs get very fine).  Because of these inefficiencies and poor design, I returned the Emjoi and will instead search out another Braun (hopefully a rechargeable one).</li>
            <li> I was a frequent waxer, and thought wow look at this it will save me time and money compared with the ever costly salon visit (I&#x27;m including tipping and parking prices). I thought wrong, waxing I&#x27;ll admit is extremely painful and can completely understand why someone could not go through with it. When I recieved this in the mail I was shocked to find not only did this not do such a great job of removing hair but hurt real bad horribly bad, so bad I really could&#x27;nt even use it. I&#x27;ll stick to waxing from now on.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair on my legs so I tried this with some hesitation.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt very much when you are doing it, but later I had red bumps and my legs were VERY sensitve to touch for a couple of days.  I worked on my legs on two different days and still could not get all the hair out.  I think if you do not have thick hair, this probably works well, I just thought I would warn any other girls out there who have hair like I do.</li>
            <li> I just got this 3 days ago. I just LOVE it. As soon as I opened the box I ran into the bathroom to try it out. Pain? Well...I have a high tolerance to pain and it really did not hurt me that much, some spots a little bit of pain but nothing unbearable. Some reviews stated about the time it took to do a leg was about an hour...well, in 5 minutes I had 1/2 a leg done and looked great!! Later I decided to try it out on my underarms...ok that hurt a little but again NOT UNBEARABLE!! WOW!! I think I may just toss out all my razors from now on..</li>
            <li> I love it and it works great!  Sometimes you have to go over the same spot twice, but other than that it&#x27;s very effective.  I used to have a Braun epilator, but it hurt.  My emjoi barely hurts, but I only use it on legs and armpits.</li>
            <li> I needed to try this product because I have absolutely hated shaving my underarms.  They would be clear for one day.  The next day I would have a dark shadow.  I couldn&#x27;t shave it because it wasn&#x27;t long enough and would only cause irritation... but if I didn&#x27;t shave it, there would be that dark shadow.  The skin under my arms is very very white and clear.  The hair that grows in is THICK and jet black, which looks very very bad!!!  After using this product under my arms, I now have that clean look.  No razor burn, no hair, no shadow, Just clear skin.  Same for my bikini line- Gives it a clean look, no razor bumps or ingrown hairs.  It is just a clean line.  I definitely think you should try this out!</li>
            <li> My husband got this for me because he was tired of how gross my leg hair became waiting for it to be long enough to wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried similar products in the past and was very disappointed with the results. He bought this for me and I still had serious doubts UNTIL I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a start the cost of the unit was about the cost of a single waxing. Unlike other brands I have used the hair is actually being pulled out rather than broken off. The process is also much quicker than other home hair removal systems and the results are more complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will obviously not be a product for everyone, but I am impressed by the results I am having.</li>
            <li> This is the second epilator I&#x27;ve owned.  What a HUGE difference from the last one!  Wow, the additional tweezers make all the difference in the world too!  I&#x27;m done in less than half the time!  Great product!</li>
            <li> I read about this in a magazine, and the Amazon reviews were great, so I put it on my wish list.  And I must say, I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;In a word, AWESOME!  I love it!  It works exactly as described - the gold discs massage your skin while removing the hair, virtually eliminating the pain other hair removal systems can cause.  (Granted, you will sense the hair being removed.  It is, after all, taking it out at the root.  But it doesn&#x27;t hurt.) It removes hair from essentially any area of the body, and you really can use it the day after shaving.  &lt;br /&gt;I used it on my legs, underarms, bikini area, fingers, toes...heck, I wanted to wake up my little brother and take off all of his hair too!  (Luckily for him, I didn&#x27;t.)  Two things - it&#x27;s a bit noisy, so be prepared for that, but you shouldn&#x27;t be nervous or associate that with its level of gentleness. And I&#x27;ve found it works best if you use an up and down motion instead of the small circles recommended in the manual.&lt;br /&gt;I used to shave every day, which was time-consuming and annoying.  I tried waxing, but it was messy and never really got all the hair off -- not to mention living with icky stubble for the hair to grow long enough to re-wax.  But no more!  I can now go hair-free for weeks.  This Emjoi is the best present I&#x27;ve ever gotten!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this item!  I waited a long time before getting it because I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be worth spending that much on it but now I wish I had gotten it sooner.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as other epilators I&#x27;ve owned and it can be used on practically any body part you can think of.  I shaved my legs after the first few times I used it but as time passes (and you get used to epilating), the need to do this goes away.  What I love most about it is the way it works on my underarms.  No more ugly dark stuble and shaving everyday I wear sleeveless tops.  Thank goodness!</li>
            <li> I bought this because my sister bought one and I wanted to try it out.  I really love it.  I asked her if she used it on her legs and she said it hurt too bad.  Well I tried it on my legs and it was a prickly sensation but nothing I couldn&#x27;t handle.  Each time I used it things got alot easier.  It takes some work to get all the hairs but to me is well worth it.  I also use it on my face for my upper lip and it makes it so smooth.  I would reccomend this to anyone but will say to just be patient because you do have to get use to it.</li>
            <li> I love this hair remover.  I used to shave my legs every day and now I use only the Emjoi about 1 - 2 times a week.  It is not at all painful.  When I used to shave my legs it would itch because of the dryness it caused, but I do not have that problem now that I use the Emjoi!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I foolishly purchased this to take care of hair I would normally have waxed.  It took about 40 minutes to completely clear the area and within 15 minutes I broke out in blisters that left marks that lasted for more than a month. I guess if you use it on your legs you will be okay. Anywhere else is truly uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I have owned this epilator for almost 5 years and love it.  It has worked great.  I am still impressed with it even though the motor slowed down lately.  Afterall it&#x27;s been so many years and it has worked as promised.  Rechargable option is great as the cord does not get on your way.  Overall, highly recommended if you have a high pain tolerance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything:  hand-held razors, electric razors, waxing . . . I finally found the Emjoi Gently Gold Caress.  I looked at it for at least 8 months before I finally took the plunge, and am I glad that I did!&lt;br /&gt;One thing you need to know is that it does hurt, BUT only at first.  The first time is the worst.  You have to remember that your skin is not used to having the hair pulled out at the roots along with the fact that you are pulling out tons of hair.  I did experience the red bumps on my skin that last about 24 hours.  After the first few times it gets easier and the red bumps don&#x27;t appear either.  I have now been using the Emjoi for three months and I absolutely love it!  I wouldn&#x27;t even think about trading it in for anything else!  No more razor stubble and no more itching!  I do find that I have to use the Emjoi every few days to get the new hair growth that is constantly coming in. I used to shave my legs everyday anyway, so I don&#x27;t even see this as a negative aspect to this product.  &lt;br /&gt;My advice to anyone that has written negative comments regarding the pain of using the Emjoi is to stick with it more than just a couple of times before you grab your razor.  This IS an excellent product!</li>
            <li> I love my emjoi, I never thought I would ever have smooth underarm skin, but I do, thanks to my Emjoi AP-9GAR Gently Gold Caress. I use to shave, but after a day, the hair would start growing back. I rarely wore sleeveless tops in the Summer, due to the continuous need to shave. When I saw this in a store, I tried it on the little hair I had on the back of my hand. It was painless, nothing, no pain. So, I started researching on this, I read all the reviews, the good and bad ones. Ultimately, I remembered how painless the experience was, so I went ahead and bought it. The first time I used it under my arms, it was very little pain. REALLY! It was like tweezing your eyebrows; same thing removing hair from the roots. It was after that I felt the stinging. Some cold cream helped sooth the stinging. By the next evening, no more stinging. After a few days, some hair started showing, but much lighter and finer. I immediately got out my emjoi, and started removing them. Absolutely NO PAIN, and no pain eversince. The key for me is to really pull the skin tight, I even had my husband hold my skin the first time. After my first week, I tried the bikini area, again as long as you pull the skin tight, its hardly any pain. I LOVE MY EMJOI, THE BEST!</li>
            <li> This product works as advertised.  If you don&#x27;t want to shave, but don&#x27;t want hair either, the Emjoi is great.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using an Epilady recently (yes, it&#x27;s about 13 years old) and I needed to use it about twice a week - it was less painful if done often, and the spring broke off about as much hair as it pulled out.  It was also completely worthless for underarms or the bikini area, which I would get waxed at a salon.  I saw another review that compared the Emjoi favorably to the Epilady and decided to give it a try (it came to my attention as a gold box item).&lt;br /&gt;After going 3 weeks without using the Epilady on my legs (getting to the point where using it would have been painful) I used the Emjoy and had almost complete hair removal in 1 or 2 passes, minimal pain, and very few hairs broken off.  Additionally, I was able to use it on my underarms (although it may take several tries to get the hair totally gone, it&#x27;s already better than if I&#x27;d shaved), and I am gradually working on the bikini line.  This additional functionality alone will pay for the tool in a couple months of not needing a salon waxing.&lt;br /&gt;In comparison with an Epilady, or even waxing, the Emjoi wins in every regard -  &lt;BR&gt;  Efficacy: The force of the discs pulling the hair out is greater than the spring used by the Epilady.  This means that instead of grabbing each hair and tugging 5 or 6 times before it pulls it out, the Emjoy actually pulls it out on the first or second attempt, almost every time.  &lt;BR&gt;  Application areas: Using an Epilady anywhere but the legs would result in hair tangled in the coil, pinched skin, intolerable pain, and generally no hair removal when I tried it.  With the Emjoi, hair was removed, no skin was pinched, and there was minimal pain - even less than what I experience with salon waxing.  But there was some discomfort, because hey, yanking out hair from sensitive skin hurts, but not as much as razor burn on sensitive skin does. &lt;BR&gt;  Time: It took about 5 minutes to do what would have taken me 15-25 minutes previously, had more complete hair removal, and hurt a lot less. &lt;BR&gt;  Portability/Convenience: the Emjoi has a rechargable battery and dosen&#x27;t need to be plugged in to work.  And no need for a salon appointment.&lt;BR&gt;  Pain:  Pulling out hair doesn&#x27;t seem to hurt as much as tugging on it several times so the Emjoi is much better than the Epilady.  And compared with salon waxing, I have control over what area is covered at a given time and can go fast or slow or stop as needed.  Except for a small patch on one ankle and the first pass over either the underarms or bikini line, there really wasn&#x27;t any pain, just the sensation and mild discomfort of hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak to the longevity of the product, but I hope is lasts as long as my Epilady, because I plan to be using it forever.</li>
            <li> No pain, no gain has never been more true. But once you get through the first pass with this baby, you&#x27;ll be hooked.   The feeling is something like pulling off thousands of tiny bandaids. And to get all the hair off of your lower legs, you&#x27;ll probably need a couple hours to do a really good job. Of course, that assumes you don&#x27;t have really thick hair which I don&#x27;t. This product is most definitely worth the money and I would recommend to anyone who likes to keep their legs (or wherever else) smooth and hair-free.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic--especially for underarms and bikini line.  If you can tolerate the pain, expense and embarrassment of salon waxing, this product will be a vacation for you.  &lt;br /&gt;The result for me is smoother and less irritating than waxing, as my sensitive skin often becomes burned with even the most cautious waxing pros.&lt;br /&gt;The product does not work as well on my legs, though.  It leaves them hairless looking, and fairly smooth, but not as silky smooth as shaving does.  OK for the workweek grind, but I&#x27;m still shaving my legs on date night [which doesn&#x27;t take long because there&#x27;s barely anything to shave].</li>
            <li> I used this product for several months, hoping that as time went on the hair on my legs would start growing back more slowly (as promised). Well, it didn&#x27;t. I still have to epilate at least once a week, and I have to shave every couple of days to feel smooth. In addition, I have to rigorously exfoliate, or else I get major ingrown hairs. But it&#x27;s still worth it, because it allows me to stretch to 3-4 days between shaving, whereas without the epilator, I felt as if I had to shave every day.</li>
            <li> I have had my emjoi for about 4 weeks now. I absolutely LOVE it. The first time you use it, expect some pain. After that it feels more like a tingling feeling and it isn&#x27;t too discomfortable. I use it all over my body; arms, legs, bikini area. I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants to quit using a shaver daily.</li>
            <li> This shaver is the worst!!!! It hurts to use, and communicating with the manufacter regarding this product is a total joke!!! They were RUDE and tried to shoffle me off to the Remington outlet when this is THEIR product!!! The worst customer Service I had ever encountered in my life. I would NEVER recommend this product to friends or to family members!!!</li>
            <li> if you are only going to use this for your legs than its shape is probably great, but since i have really thin hair on my legs i just wax - i like just going over one large area fast quick pain rather than the random plucking feeling.  however waxing isn&#x27;t for everyone and hurts more for some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;using for arm pit hair is weird.  it doesn&#x27;t hurt if it gets skin, but the curved shape is not ideal for anything other than legs and i guess arms if you do that.  i am guessing that it would be inconvenient for the bikini area, but i haven&#x27;t tried - still prefer waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the machine is very noisy and looks kind of scary if you aren&#x27;t used to these kinds of machines, but after my sister ashured me it didn&#x27;t hurt i tried it and i think it all depends on how much it hurts when you tweeze hair normally.  take a pair of tweezers and tweeze a few hairs and see how it feels.  if it is unbearable than just know the speed of the machine helps, but the fact that there are many more hairs being tweezed makes it more painful.  different parts of the body can handle different amounts of pain or rather are more or less sensitive to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i chose not to use this machine and prefer my old hair removal methods better, but my sister loves it for removing her hair, but isn&#x27;t too keen on its curved shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it says that it is curved because our bodies are curved, but out bodies are curved in many different ways and degrees so just keep that in mind before buying this.  i haven&#x27;t tried a flat one so i can&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> After 2 years of using the Optima I decided to give this one a try, mainly because of the cordless option. I gave it a valiant effort, but it is just not powerful enough for me: it took twice the time of the Optima to get all the hair. It would likely be a worthwhile option for someone with fine or sparse hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to replace the Epilady Mini I have been using for about 14 years.  I was very happy with that but could not find another to replace it with so bought the EMJOY AP-9GAR Gently Gold Caress Rechargeable Hair Remover.  It is certainly more versital than the Epilady was.  I have not had any trouble using it and while you do have to check your legs the next day after using it, this is no different than the product I previously used.  I like it very much and would encourage others to try it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just be clear,there is no joy about it.  But it does work well.  Once you get through the aweful first time it gets much easier because you can use it as you see hair.</li>
            <li> I have never used an epilator, but chose this one because many of the reviews rated it better than others. &lt;br /&gt;I have waxed before, but I usually shave my legs.  In terms of pain, which was my biggest concern, I hold my breath and tough it out.  I just used this machine once so far. All reviews said that the first time would be the most painful. The pain is the same as waxing, except you control when to stop, whichs makes this a much better choice.  Usually after shaving, I immediatly have stuble.  I used this machine yesterday and my legs are still completly smooth. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tough out the first use, and it should be less painful after.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I also used this with the enjoi after epilation cream, which helped with the after burn and ingrown hair. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I recommend this as a means of hair removal.</li>
            <li> I tried it with lidocaine gel (hint, wash it off well or you will get a mess).  It wasn&#x27;t too bad, just made my eyes tear a little! It took me 3 attempts over 2 days to do my whole leg, no bleeding.  (The Epilady made me bleed in the past).  I was so happy to see that I didn&#x27;t need to shave every day.  I would go over my legs quickly with the Emjoi every few days to get the hairs that were in a different stage of the growth cycle and I was keeping up with it and happy with the results.    Then I had midterms and didn&#x27;t do it for a couple of weeks.  When I finally tried to use it again, I found it too painful, and I&#x27;ve been too lazy to bring out the buffing pad to exfoliate, then put on the numbing gel, then wash it off, and try it again.  It&#x27;s been like 6 months and I haven&#x27;t used it.        It&#x27;s less painful, time consuming and messy than waxing and it&#x27;s effective, just hard to get used to.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have very course hair on my legs and underarms.  I need to shave my underarms everyday, but am not able to because of severe razor burn (can only shave it 2 times a week...gross) and shaving your legs everyday is a grueling process.  I have never used and epilator before, but I read the previous reviews and they convinced me to try it.  When I first got it I decided to do my underarms first thinking that if I could stand that pain I could definitely do my legs.  Surprisingly it didn&#x27;t hurt much at all; yes it did cause some bleeding, but very much worth the results!  I started my legs and it brought tears to my eyes (and not tears of joy).  It hurt SO bad that I am having a hard time finishing my lower legs (even after several months).  I don&#x27;t know if it is because I have A LOT of thick hair on my lower legs, but I am having a hard time going back to finish.  I was able to do my upper thighs, which had significantly less hair growth to begin with and I didn&#x27;t get any ingrown hairs, even without exfoliating.  Some reviewers state that it would be easier to wax before starting to use the epilator, that may be that case, but I can&#x27;t stand to let my hair get long enough to try. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I gave this product 4 stars because I LOVE the result it had on my underarms.  For me, it was worth every cent just for that.  If you can get through the pain on your legs, this product would give you great results.  My thighs aren&#x27;t perfectly smooth, but I don&#x27;t have the ingrown hairs I had with shaving.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This machine does work well, however there is pain involved. I am the type of women that hates to have any hair anywhere below the eyelashes!! &lt;br /&gt;Day 1,  I started on my legs and it took more than an hour for both since I had to get used to the pain. Day 2, I attempted my whole bikini area and lower, (I couldn&#x27;t do the whole thing though, way too sensitive) I did do my underarms and I am impressed at how smooth they feel. No more day after stubble, that is so noticeable. I never knew how long the hairs are underneath the skin until this machine took them out. I will continue to use this machine regularly. That&#x27;ll save time. Great product overall!! The pain does go away, just like waxing.</li>
            <li> Life-saver!  If you have thin wispy hairs and hate to have to shave because of the prickliness to follow, but still want to remove hair, get an epilator.  I got this in 2007, and it still works wonderfully.  Not recommended for coarse or thick hairs.  This particular model I find very effective, easy to clean, doesn&#x27;t look as freaky weird as the other ones I saw, and I like the gold blades better.</li>
            <li> I purchased this 5 years ago and it still works great.  Use it twice a month.  It&#x27;s better then using a razor.  Your hair will become finer- the razor blade just makes it worse like a tree trunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m surprised how long it&#x27;s lasted.  I guess it&#x27;s made of hard core.  The last (2) coffee-pots I&#x27;ve had started to burn out after a year and they were designer brands.  It reminds me of the old days when you had an alarm clock or GHETO BLASTER and it worked for 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LA girl</li>
            <li> This does a good job if the hair is sufficiently long. It does however, hurt when the hair is yanked. If you need to do only small patches like armpits, this is your machine. For anything as big as legs, well, I&#x27;m still looking.</li>
            <li> Gently, my ...!  This thing hurts the first couple times FOR SURE! Don&#x27;t give up using it, though.  It does get better.  I would advise not using it on your bikini line though - #1 it is not shaped correctly for that area, and #2 it doesn&#x27;t work well enough to justify the redness and bumps that swell up after you use it.  It usually takes my skin four days to heal so I suggest if you use this on your bikini line, use it on a monday so your hot date on friday doesn&#x27;t know that you&#x27;ve had a horrible rash. I use a lot of vitamin e and aloe after using this thing, and it&#x27;s still scary looking! However, it works great on the legs, but the first few times you will not get all the hairs.  It works best in short, light strokes.  The first few times you will have to go back over your legs with a razor to get them really smooth. The noise is also unbelievable with this thing, my roomates think I&#x27;m doing something unmentionable when I&#x27;m in the bathroom with the door shut. I recommend it, but I don&#x27;t recommend it higher than waxing. If you could wax a day after shaving, I&#x27;d be all over that...</li>
            <li> I received this hair remover a few days ago. I was so scared when I heard the noise. Beside, my husband warned me about the pain that I will get. Well! after I tried it. NO PAIN FOR ME AT ALL. However, it might because i used to plug my hair. That reason could made my skin a little bit tough. The hair came out from the root, but I have to do several times to remove all the hair out. I also need to plug the hair that have left too. Overall, it&#x27;s good tool. I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> I will not compare the epilator to wax or shaving, i&#x27;d better compare it to another epilator.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The old one i had for 3 years is Braun - it&#x27;s still in perfict condition, but i just wanted somethng new. Well, Emjoi AP-9GAR is really gental, less painfull than my Braun or Emjoi Optima, but it seems to be very slow and too gentle ( i don&#x27;t need it). Especially, when you put it closer to the skin, it just slows down, almost stops, the hair removal may take for ever! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A very nice thing is that it cordless - i love this feature. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So, i would recommend Gently Soft for the first time users, but for advanced users i would recommend to try something else - faster and more agressive.</li>
            <li> This product is good for those who need quick hair removal without the mess of waxing. However, for large areas it is a little bit more painful than waxing. It is great for coarse hair, as it only breaks off fine hairs leaving the root intact. I found it useful for underarms, since it is a small area with coarse hair. I would recommend numbing the area with ice first if you are really sensitive. I also purchased the GiGi wax warmer and brazilian hard wax which is awesome. I usually prefer waxing to using this machine. Overall, if you can use this machine while being distracted like watching TV, it is pretty good.</li>
            <li> Definitely not painless but this works great.  It hurts pretty bad the first time but every time after that it&#x27;s not bad at all and it keeps the hair away for a long time.  Better than expensive waxing!</li>
            <li> It is a little bit scary when you first time use it. I used it pluged in and only use it for underarm.  It cannot pull out every hair you want to remove, and it needs experience to make it efficient, like the manual said, the skin should be taut when you work on that area.  Overall, it is a ok product, better than shaving razor because it doesn&#x27;t remove the surface hair, rather, it removes hair from the root. But, removing hair from the root might have a problem for ingrown hair. Regular skin massaging with a massaging glove or loofa, may help reduce the chance or occurrence of ingrown hairs. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Be careful about the adapter, it is not ideal for travel because it doesn&#x27;t have a worldwide voltage.</li>
            <li> As a former Epilady user, I found this product to be much better, less pain, more hair removed.  My Epilady took at least an hour or more to get the job done, the Emjoi only 30-45 minutes depending if I did my whole leg or just the lower leg.  Not bad, but.... that was when I purchased it 2 years ago.  Now it takes as long as the Epilady and is not working as well, like the motor is wearing out or something.  Call me picky, but I thought it would last longer, my Epilady lasted 15 years!  When I purchased it 2 years ago it was over $70, shouldn&#x27;t something that cost that much last a little longer?  I see it is less expensive now but I hestitate to get another, what if it wears out even faster?  Just so you know, I only used it every other week or so, not an every day thing.  Don&#x27;t you think it should have lasted longer?</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, although you could save a couple of bucks and get the corded version. In battery operated mode, it&#x27;s not as powerful and doesn&#x27;t stay charged longer than 15 minutes.  The cord is long enough to plug in behind the couch and use in all types of contortionist moves.  The inconvenience level is kept to a minimum.  Disgusting as it sounds (I do have an end table with a drawer), I leave it plugged in by the couch and perform personal hygiene while watching \\&quot;House\\&quot; once a week.  I&#x27;ve heard thru his publicist that Hugh Laurie is pleased with the news.    Anyway, as far as performance and overall satisfaction goes, this is definitely a keeper.  I gave up the idea of torture devices that rip out hair about 20 years ago (and even irrationally ruled out waxing) when I got an Epilady for Christmas.  I was in tears still sitting under tree and couldn&#x27;t wait to shove it somewhere hairy on Santa.  With added age comes dumbness, so I allowed myself to get sucked in again.  Boy, am I ever grateful!    For me, doing my legs and bikini area was no problem.  You can feel it lightly stinging (I mean really lightly), but it is nothing compared to the pain of my intestines being removed via my shin bone from two decades ago.  The best advice I can give is to not treat it like a razor.  If you just chose a squared area the size of the device and tweeze in all four directions, you&#x27;ll cover a lot of skin real estate in no time.  I did both full legs the first time in under 30 minutes.  No pain, visually hairless and fairly smooth results to the touch.  I went back 5 days later and achieved really smooth skin.  In over 3 weeks I have no ingrown hairs and have yet to use the loofah.  This is good news, because it smells and is too tiny to inspire confidence.  I also haven&#x27;t been able to see a leg hair in all that time.  I just use the thing because I can&#x27;t believe I don&#x27;t have to.    My true test of courage came more recently - under the arms.  Wow!  Who knew those places were quite that sensitive when ripping out multiple hairs by the root!??!  With eyes watering, I sucked it up and fully completed one whole pit before deciding the 4 minutes of recordable pain was worth the reward.  (I also found that margaritas help considerably with numbness).  To heck with Ambesol.    The skin left behind is AMAZINGLY soft, and, as a naturally dark brown-haired girl, there&#x27;s no \\&quot;shadow\\&quot; even after SIX days!!  I used to have shadow by the time I got out of the shower.  Hooray for tank tops (I live in L.A.  This is a BIG deal)!!  Although I have not needed to do anything in the last week, I do look forward to having an easier time of the armpit cycle next time.  Even if I don&#x27;t, though, I&#x27;ll still use it by increasing my Tuesday night margarita consumption.    I MUCH prefer taking care of hair-removal once a week (at an absolute MOST), while sitting watching TV instead of my former daily, fancy-angling-my-foot-in-the-soap-dish-shower-praying-I-don&#x27;t-fall-over-and wreck-the-bathroom routine. Once a week also means you can wear anything, anytime with ZERO fear.  No one can see any hair you don&#x27;t want them to.      Some detractors say the device doesn&#x27;t last long, but, even if I don&#x27;t get more than a year, it was (and will be) worth the price.  I would gladly buy this product again.  Give it a chance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Emjoi AP-9GAR for three years now and love it.  It isn&#x27;t as painful as waxing and results are great.  That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m buying this product again after my three year old machine stopped charging last night.</li>
            <li> Well I thought that I was destined to forever deal with the task of shaving my legs every 2 to 3 days and putting up with the nicks and nacks, and lets not get into the pain of the ingrown hairs. But this little machine is a miracle to all women who don&#x27;t like hair on their legs or any other part of your body, it is so effortless in the removal of hair, just as the advertisement says it removes hair even if you shaved the day before. What I found works best is to use it before I shower, all it takes is 5 minutes and you are done. I have had smooth legs for over a month now, with no effort at all, I highly recommend this product, I used to wax my legs not anymore, this is much easier and less painfull.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money with other gadjets or products. BUY THIS! This is a dream come true.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hoping that it would be the answer to frequent shaving and waxing. It wasn&#x27;t. This product says that you can use it a day after shaving. Untrue. After waiting a week for the hair on my legs to grow long enough, it removed hair unevenly and was more painful than waxing. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> The first use was fine - got all the hairs on my tummy and bikini area just great.  I even expanded its use to my underarms.  It was plenty painful under my arms but the results were worth it.  Then all the problems started.  When my hair started to come back in I used the Gently Gold again.  I remember thinking how little it hurt.  As near as I can tell it was snapping my thinner regrowing hairs off at skin level.  Then the worst, I got raised, horrible, awful bumps along my bikini line and on my tummy! I had never had ingrown hairs. I discontinued use in the area. It&#x27;s been months now and I am still dealing with unslightly ingrown hairs and the scars they leave behind when you finally liberate the hair.  Back to shaving!  I continued it&#x27;s use on my underarms since the hair there was not as thin/frail as the hair elsewhere, then the durn thing burnt itself out after a total of 4 months use.</li>
            <li> If you are like me and not sure if these sort of products work or if they HURT! Well, DO NOT WORRY! It DOES NOT HURT! And It REALLY WORKS! It also will stop the blades/tweezers from rolling if you apply to much pressure (this is great). At first when you turn it on it looks and sounds scary but it&#x27;s NOT BAD! It feels like little tiny needle sticks at first but you get to where it does not bother you. But I personally like to use it on high on my legs &amp; under arms. And slow on my face (this is one area that I just am not use to yet). Also if your hair is a little to long the first time you use it under your arms, the pulling of the hair is a little much at first, but then not to bad. Just keep it on high and do it quick if your hair is a little long. So I recommend shaving the first time then try it. Do not wait a week after shaving like I did. I tought the longer the hair the better it works. But the nice thing with this is you can use it right after you shave, it works great on really tiny hairs. Then get rid of your razors you will not need them again. And for those hairs that are growing just under the skin you can use a tweezer to get them, cause it does not pinch the skin and get those. So if you are not sure about it like I was take it from me it is well worth the money and another great feature is it is rechargable. I hope this helps you to decide. I truly do love mine.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  You do have get use to it, but it does an excellent job of keeping the hair away.   Normally to get results like this, you would have to go to a PROFESSIONAL.  However, this device will soon pay for itself in 3 months or so.   No more having to drop [money] to go see the cosmetologist everytime the hair grows back!!!!  Other customers have said that this thing hurts.  Of course it does!!!  Most hair removal techniques do hurt.  My first time did cause discomfort, but it was nothing compared to waxing (especially when it came to doing my legs).  And if could get use to the pain (however brief) of waxing, I can certain get use to the discomfort of this.   I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I just got my Emjoi Gently Gold yesterday and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.  I turned it on and I have to admit, it scared me to death!!!  I was very hesitant to put it near my leg because of how loud it was and the rotating of it was so fast.  I finally got the courage up and yes it did hurt but nothing like I expected.  I have very fine hair on my legs so I switched it to the lower setting and it seemed to work better.  It got most of my hairs but the shorter ones it didn&#x27;t quite get.  I am going to use it again in a few days so the one&#x27;s I missed will surely be plucked out.&lt;br /&gt;After my legs were done I decided to try it on my under arms and bikini area and it did a fantastic job!  Those areas are more painful because the hair is coarser.  You get used to it after the first minute or so.  It did leave little red bumps after the hair was pulled out but they disappeared overnight.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product if you are tired of shaving all the time.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I have also used a cheaper Emjoi, which didn&#x27;t work too well, and a corded Braun.  The Braun is better at getting all the hairs, BUT has a tendency to pinch the skin painfully if I am not totally careful.  The Emjoi has had no pinching problems.  This epilator gets all the hairs, but I have to use it in a good light to be sure to see them all.  Knees and ankles are difficult. Hairs grow back very fine and soft, not prickly.  And no &amp;quot;5 o&#x27;clock shadow&amp;quot; in the underarm.&lt;br /&gt;As far as pain--I don&#x27;t find epilators painful.  The first time I used one, it was pretty prickly and I wasn&#x27;t sure it would get better.  Now, it feels sort of like running a stiff bristle brush over the area, prickly but not painful.  That includes using it for underarms and bikini line, both totally comfortable.  However, I did give one as a gift to a friend who called it a &amp;quot;terrible torture device&amp;quot;, so obviously experiences vary.  &lt;BR&gt;I do notice some ingrown hairs around the knees, so exfoliating is necessary.  &lt;BR&gt;This is comfortable, easy, takes about 10-20 min to do my whole body, and lasts about 2 weeks for me.  Perfect, in my book, so I recommend this.  Give it at least a couple tries if it hurts at first, and see if it gets better.</li>
            <li> I hate stubble - and I haven&#x27;t had any for 4 years, thanks to my Emjoi.  I recommend it to all my friends.  It is admittedly painful at first, but I only have to use it once every couple of weeks (it takes that long for anything substantial to grow back) and I&#x27;ve gotten use to the feel of the pull.  I love not having stubble or razor-burn (especially on my bikini line).  I&#x27;ll never go back to shaving with a blade.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I will never shave my legs again. I use it maybe twice a week after my shower and the hair dosen&#x27;t grow back for weeks! Also, no more \\&quot;spiky\\&quot; feel to the hair regrowth--like after you shave. The hair comes back softer and easier to take off with the Emjoi.  You really get used to it quickly.</li>
            <li> ...but this product works. The first time is scary and ouchy, especially (mostly) around sensitive bikini and underarm areas--but the product works best on those areas, ironically. I was really satisfied with the way it handled underarms, although bikini was a little more painful and I had to stop.  &lt;br /&gt;I have a high pain tolerance, and so I&#x27;ll use this again (for the price tag, it beats a $40 wax or more every month).  &lt;br /&gt;On legs, though, it tends to leave a bit of stubble (I have mostly fine blonde hairs, so that may be the problem) and will probably stick mostly to shaving (although a combo of the two will work well, especially if one is preparing for a vacation or special occasion sort of deal). &lt;br /&gt;Verdict: certainly worth the money if you have a high pain tolerance and aren&#x27;t afraid of a little blood (yes; yanking your underarm hair out by the roots makes you bleed a tiny bit-same as waxing). Other reviews are right: there is a little irritation, but it goes away quickly. Pop a few Aleve.</li>
            <li> This truly does work!  I can&#x27;t believe it, but it is well worth the money.  I do have about a million little red bumps in an almost unmentionable place, but my skin is smooth!  Buy it, you will be happy!</li>
            <li> I bought this item primarily for use on my face. I&#x27;m sick of gross-smelling depilators and I don&#x27;t want the cost of a salon. &lt;br /&gt;It truly does work well, though as several people have noted, you have to go over an area multiple times to get all the hairs. Also, while the instructions say that the lower speed is better for fine hairs ... don&#x27;t believe it. The lower speed is great for beginners as it is less painful than the high speed, but it is also less effective for removing hairs. The high speed setting is no more painful than waxing, so don&#x27;t worry too much about that.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also tried using the product on my legs ... now THAT hurts! This device is probably best for those with fine hair, or for use on the face.</li>
            <li> When I first purchased this item, I paid about $90 a few years ago.  It worked great for the first year, but after the warranty ran out, I noticed it started to operate funny.  Apparently the little ball bearings were falling out of the sides, prohibiting the smooth and easy operation of the device.  Attempts to contact customer service were futile, and I was willing to send it in to have it repaired at any cost to me (providing it did not exceed the cost of a new one!).&lt;BR&gt;Stay away from it, as I forgot to mention that the power cord died after a year, and I had to resplice the wires in order to have it charge the device.&lt;BR&gt;This was purchased to replace another item that was in an accident, and I will never purchase another.  I always had luck with the Philips devices.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, this product is NOT for you.    When I used it on my legs, it hurt a lot. It&#x27;s 36 tweezers pulling/tugging your hair out. Ouch!    This product is GREAT for underarms. Regrowth is slow so you don&#x27;t have to shave under your arm as often and the hair comes out thinner (as opposed to shaving it). Also, using it for your underarms does not hurt. You may be scared at first, but after the first time, it&#x27;s easy as cake.</li>
            <li> I adore this epilator-I received the cordless one 2 days ago and I tried it immediately-it does much better job than the Braun one,I had for long time/Silk-epil EE110-5306/.Braun is still OK, but this one is much faster and another plus is,that it is cordless-I already tried this option and I&#x27;m very pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> The brochure of the Emjoi responds to the question, &amp;quot;Why is the Emjoi curved&amp;quot;, with the answer, &amp;quot;Because the female body has curves&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;While it is delightful to note that the makers of this otherwise sturdy little machine have noticed this long-obscure fact about the female body, I do have to point out to them the following two startling observations:&lt;br /&gt;1.  the female body also has parts that are flat, like thighs (maybe their models were barbies)&lt;BR&gt;2.  the female body also has curves that are concave, not just convex, eg around the bikini line.&lt;br /&gt;Which means that a curved surface on the blades makes it almost impossible to reach hairs on those surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered the Braun top of the line, which apparently has a a bikini-line special attachment.  In any case, it appears that the blades are on a straight surface, plus it seems to be much higher seeling than the Emjoi.  Will make a comparison once i get it, but if the above sounds relevant, bear it in mind.</li>
            <li> PROS:  1. Seems to be efficient  2. Sturdy looking    CONS:  1. You can not detach the epilator head for cleaning  2. Works better plugged in  3. Battery lasts approx 30 min  4. Difficult to use if hair growth is perpendicular to your bone structure.    SUMMARY:  Use the epilator while it is charging. You have to try various directions before you figure out what works best - yes I did read the manual end to end before using it - no it didnt work always when you keep the logo facing away from you and running it in the direction of hair growth.  If you are used to waxing it hurts less than that - my wife has a very sensetive skin and she didnt feel much when I did her underarms.</li>
            <li> Works as listed, but doesn&#x27;t keep the hair from coming back any better than shaving.  Within a year, it will not charge, but can be used with the cord.  Just didn&#x27;t do what I expected it to do.</li>
            <li> I bought this to get rid  of leg hair. After the initial hair removal, great.  It was very painful the first time, but worth every penny! I used it on my underarms, hurt like **** but so worth it in the end! No more shaving!!!Make sure you scrub well. Use a tweezer to get bad hairs!!</li>
            <li> This item is great as it really does get those short hairs. If you are a fan of waxing and have hair that is lighter than you will love the ease and convenience. If you are a first time user, do yourself a favor and get waxed first, than keep up w/the Emjoi. Way too painful on \\&quot;virgin\\&quot; hair.</li>
            <li> This epilator works very well. For people who said it&#x27;s painless, it&#x27;s not entirely true. You&#x27;re getting hairs plugged from your skin. Of course it would be painful. But the ease of using this product make the process quicker. So, you&#x27;re only in pain for short period of time. The battery last awhile. At full charge, it&#x27;ll last a few weeks, although, I don&#x27;t use it everyday. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I agree with all the positive statements others have made regarding this product - it really works! &lt;br /&gt;I get red bumps on my legs after I use it but my skin is really sensitive to begin with - I get the same thing after I wax. &lt;br /&gt;And it is somewhat uncomfortable but not too bad - especially if you&#x27;re used to waxing. &lt;br /&gt;Try it - I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s ideal for everyone but you never know... it certainly works for me and I have had a heck of a time trying to find a method of hair removal that I am really pleased with.</li>
            <li> My mom turned me on to this product.  She has had it for a year and a half and did not use it until 5 months ago.  She found out my stepfather had been using it for months.  He has a very coarse, thick beard that grows way up his face.  He started using the Emjoi and loved it.  My mom decided that if it did not bother him that much, why not try it, and she loved it.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I got mine today, and quickly bathed and scrubbed my legs and underarms and began to use it.  It was great!!!!  It did not hurt my legs near as much as waxing.  It felt like something hot was prickling my skins as I went over my leg.  I would suggest that if you are using it for the first time, begin on areas that do not have a lot of hair until you get used to the prickling feeling.  It was more uncomfortable on my upper thighs because I had more hair because I have not shaved or waxed there in a while.  The beauty of the Emjoi is that it is so easy to reach the back of my calves and thighs.  It was so hard to reach there when waxing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I really dreaded doing my underarms.  I have only waxed once there and it was the most painful thing I have ever felt.  But I decided to go ahead and try.  I have very thick, black hair in my underarms.  I can never get rid of the shadow when I shave.  It is always there.  I started at the very top of the hair line and just went over a few hairs.  Once I got use to it, I moved a little lower, and so on.  It took about 2-3 minutes to do each underarm and it really did not hurt that much.  It was amazing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It took less than 20 minutes to do my legs and my under arms.  It use to take me that long to wax half of my leg.  I decided to go ahead and try it on my face.  It was not that bad there either.  My face is now red, but no bumps or irritation.  The only problem I encountered is the curve on the Emjoi makes it much more difficult to get the hair on the upper lip below my nose.  Otherwise, it worked great. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THIS THING!!!! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I had an old fashioned Epilady for many years.  It stung enough when I used it on my legs that I never contemplated using it anywhere else.  When it finally died, I started looking for a replacement (and shaved in the meantime).  The Emjoi had good reviews, so I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;In a phrase, I love it!  It was so gentle and fast on my legs that I did what would have been unthinkable in my Epilady days - I used it on my underarms.  I will be honest, it did sting at first, but that went away quickly.  I used to shave my underarms every morning and I would *still* get five o&#x27;clock shadow under there.  Now, my shaving days are entirely over.  Whee!  Freedom!  &lt;br /&gt;If you are also on the hairy side, this product will make your personal grooming soooo much easier.</li>
            <li> This product is decent compared to traditional razor shaving but I don&#x27;t think it works as well as if you were to go to a salon and get a professional waxing. The nice thing about it though is that you can use it within a day of hair growth so you don&#x27;t have to wait for that half inch worth of hair before heading to the salon.&lt;br /&gt;It really does hurt the first couple of times but after that the pain isn&#x27;t as noticable. Some things I don&#x27;t like are that I get the feeling that sometimes it does not pluck the hair completely but instead breaks the hair off. Therefore, after you use it you still do not have a smooth finish. Sometimes I go back over my skin with a razor. Another con is that it does not get hairs at odd angles very well. For example it does not get the hairs around my knees all that well. It takes going over the same area a few times before all hairs are removed. I feel like I am constantly using it!&lt;br /&gt;ONE more complaint - sometimes it SUCKS IN YOUR SKIN!!!!! talk about pain!!! There is an opening on the top and if you don&#x27;t have your skin pulled back taut, there is the chance that your skin will get sucked into that opening. It does not cause lacerations or anything but it does hurt!&lt;br /&gt;Aside from all of these complaints, I would like to say that I like having it as plucking the hairs keeps them away longer than shaving does. Also, I have not tried any other hair &amp;quot;pluckers.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I rarely write Amazon reviews but had to share my experience with the Emjoi Gently Gold Caress because I&#x27;ve been so pleasantly surprised at how well it works. I&#x27;ve been waxing my bikini area and underarms for years. I&#x27;ve used Emjoi for two months now and am so happy that I no longer have to pay for ongoing trips to the salon. Like other reviewers, I also must have a higher pain tolerance because it doesn&#x27;t really hurt. Here are some tips for reducing the pain: (1) go to the salon for a professional wax before using Emjoi so you have a clean start, then use Emjoi going forward for maintenance, (2) put a little baby powder on your skin prior to using Emjoi to ensure your skin is dry, and (2) be sure to pull your skin *taut* while using Emjoi to reduce catching your skin. What a great money-saving beauty tool! I&#x27;m thrilled!</li>
            <li> I waxed for 3 months previous to using this product.  So I was used to &#x27;waxing pain&#x27;.  But the first couples of times using this product really hurt, more so than waxing.  The sound is also intimidating.  Sounds like a weed-wacker!  But I thought I&#x27;d keep using it and that I would get used the sensation.  I&#x27;ve had it now for about 3 months and I&#x27;ve finally gotten used to pain and able to remove all most all the hair.  All in all I&#x27;m glad I bought it and I have saved a lot of money by not having to get a wax weekly.</li>
            <li> Emjoi should include the above words in the ads for this machine. If your hair removal method is working for you, don&#x27;t bother to try this. If keeping your legs smooth is a constant battle, the pain might be worth it for you. True, it doesn&#x27;t get all the hair on the first pass, and you do have to prevent ingrown hairs, it&#x27;s painful(hurts like h*ll the first time)and you have to continually touchup. But all this is a small price to pay for reasonably smooth legs every day. Before this machine I had to shave every single day. Shave in the morning, porcupine legs by noon. Waxing kept my legs smooth for 3 weeks, then there were the next 3 weeks spent hairy as I grew it long enough to wax again, all the while hoping that no dress-wearing occasions popped up while I was growing the hair out. Now I can touchup every few days and my legs always look good. My husband is a welder-with his calluses, he can&#x27;t feel any stray hairs, anyway!It was too painful for my underarms tho. And I wish it didn&#x27;t sound like an &amp;quot;personal massager&amp;quot;! I&#x27;m embarrassed to use it unless I am home alone!If you go in the bathroom to use it, it sounds like you are doing the unmentionable in there! Bottom line, if keeping your legs smooth is a battle, this is the best weapon of choice!</li>
            <li> This product really works only if you use it the right way. Your hair needs to be prep first (read the instructions ladies) and if you do follow all of it, the results are much better. I tried using it quickly without prepping and my hair and all the negatives happened like hair not getting pulled out properly, only getting cut.&lt;br /&gt;It is so much cheaper to by this product than spend money regularly in a salon.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product it was painful and I really thought I had made a mistake in buying the product, but I persevered. It has become much more tolerable.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It seems to work much better on very fine hair, otherwise I get more breaking off than actual extraction.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I use the \\&quot;Emjoi\\&quot; on nearly every part of my body, some parts with more success than others for the reasons I mentioned. I am using it on nearly a weekly basis as the hair grows at different paces. It is much easier to do a little at a time. Perhaps that is why the first couple of times were painful.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this as I love not having to shave every day! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I took this looking at some good reviews. But this doesn&#x27;t seem to work properly. It&#x27;s not even removing bigger hairs let apart the smaller once. Sometimes even blood comes out. Never should go for this product.</li>
            <li> Still works fine after many years of use.</li>
            <li> The design of this gadget is not perfect (curved shape does not make it easy in some areas), but it certainly does the job.  It is certainly a lot faster and cleaner than shaving or waxing.  I don&#x27;t think it hurts as badly as people say (but maybe b/c I&#x27;m not that hairy) however the &#x27;pain&#x27; is definately worth the results.  It does not catch every hair every time, so you will have to go over some spots again and again, but again, its worth it.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is very opinionated.  He&#x27;s always telling me to bring him his keys so he can clean out his ears and such.  Last week he ordered up this here product for me and made me cook him his dinner early so I could get to tweezin&#x27;.  Well the next thing I know I&#x27;m bent over the Camero hacking away at my leg hair.  Damn, did it hurt.  So this morning while Junior was sleeping I took the Emjoi Gently Gold Caress and gave a swipe at his back hair.  Needless to say, my Emjoi is in the lake, along with my personal effects.  I highly recommend this item and will be buying another one just as soon as possible.  For anyone interested, I believe Junior will be placing the Emjoi on ebay once he finds it.</li>
            <li> Like I said, OUCH! I only wish it would make my legs a little more smooth and then I might not mind the intense pain so much. I have been getting waxed for years so I can handle pain pretty well but this is unbelievable, I actually have to take breaks to let the pain subside. I can eventually get my legs pretty smooth but not as smooth as shaving. The only thing that keeps me using it is that it is taking the hair out by the root so I know it won&#x27;t come back anytime soon and it is cheaper than waxing in the long run!</li>
            <li> This epilator was purchased after a lot of research.  I&#x27;ve tried another top brand and was not impressed by the discomfort level.  Many claim to be virtually pain-free, but this one really was pain-free.  Just a little heat felt after it was over.  I don&#x27;t know how it does it, but I would definately recommend this epilator!!!</li>
            <li> I used an epilady for many years and when it died I searched for something simular. I love the Emjoi. There was no pain but I have been using this type of product for about 12 years. It does pinch the skin if I move it too fast but holding the skin flat prevents this. It is well worth the money and for new users the discomfort of using a product like this only last a few times.</li>
            <li> This has to be the worst misnomer for this product. UNBELIEVABLY PAINFUL!!! Nothing gentle about it. It also doesn&#x27;t get enough hair out relative to the pain you are enduring. Go get a waxing and save yourself from what feels like 50 pocket knives tearing into your skin at 100 mph!</li>
            <li> I just got this item yesterday and tried it out as soon as I could get it out of the box.  I have large psoriases patches on my legs, so shaving and waxing are both HUGE no-nos. While for some people, the pain is harsh, for me it&#x27;s way better than slicing off a chunk of my leg with a razor blade or ripping off a bunch of skin with wax.  I also did my chin and upper lip.  It got all of the hairs on my face, with the exception of two that were very stiffly laid back against the skin, but tweezing two hairs instead of two dozen was definitely a good thing. Keep the skin TAUT like the directions say.  You&#x27;ll end up pinching skin if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the emjoi gold caress for a while. I use it for my legs and my underarms. You need to use it with a loofah/buffer to minimize ingrown hairs. I don&#x27;t shave anymore. The fact that it is rechargeable mattered to me when I first bought it but now, I don&#x27;t even use it cordless because it is not as powerful as when it is corded! I liked it a lot... but I always wonder if something could be less painful or could be a little bit faster ( not that it takes a very long time. It doesn&#x27;t hurt ... but maybe there&#x27;s something better. So I bought the Braun 2170 silk-epil after recommendations from a friend who&#x27;s been using it for years ( but only for her legs!). Well, it hurts so much. Gave me red bumps. Couldn&#x27;t use it on my underarms (even though I change the little head on it. the braun comes with two attachments). I even bled from the underarms. Finally told my sister that she has to give me back my emjoi and I lend her my braun. She came back and told me \\&quot;you gave me the bad one. it hurts like hell.\\&quot;.  You can decide what you want to buy. Let me know if there is another epilator that I can try... but for now, I stick with my emjoi gold caress. I found it gave the most painless GOOD results  that I am aware of.   Update: I gave my emjoi to my sister and took back the braun epilator ( I am very nice).  The braun epilator is not as noisy ( the emjoi is kind of scary the first time in term of noise) but creates stubbles on my legs. I like emjoi better.</li>
            <li> Ok, first off I do have to say, this product will hurt in more sensitive areas.  I didn&#x27;t have too much trouble using it on my legs, it didn&#x27;t feel any worse than waxing.  However, working on the underarms was quite painful.  In order to avoid this, I used ice packs on that area first and then went ahead with the epilator.  This seemed to cut down on the pain, and then it went very quickly after that.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Your legs will not be a smooth as they are with shaving, but you also won&#x27;t get the same type of irritation and you won&#x27;t need to remove the hair as frequently as with shaving.  I just got tired of having to shave every other day in order to remain totally smooth.  Waxing became too expensive and time consuming.  This item is wonderful because I can do it at my own pace and on my own schedule.  If you&#x27;re planning on using this item though, be sure to exfoliate both before and after to help prevent ingrown hairs.  I&#x27;ve had a few, but not as many as I&#x27;d get with waxing.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This product is an excellent choice for women with heavier hair growth who need to shave frequently.  If you want that silky smooth you get from a razor, this one isn&#x27;t for you.  It does get even some of the shortest hairs, which is a nice bonus.  You don&#x27;t need to keep going over and over an area in order to get full hair removal. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hope you find this helpful.  It&#x27;s definitely a quality products that helps to cut down on time spent shaving/waxing and does not get you irritated, which for most of us is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator, and I am highly impressed.  My main reason for purchasing was for unwanted facial hair.  I tried waxing, but all the stubborn chin hairs would not come out with waxing.  I then began using hair removal creams, but I would have stubble before the end of the day.  With the epilator, my face stays smooth for days (not the 4 to 6 weeks promised, but a big improvement!).  It DOES hurt, I won&#x27;t lie to you.  It is not unbearable, however, and the small amount of pain is worth the results.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product. It does not hurt as much as I thought it would.  In fact, it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
            <li> Thank you, It&#x27;s wonderful</li>
            <li> This product does remove hair, and it does hurt. I would never dare to use it on my under arms or anywhere but my legs. It does leave hair soft, but still there. You will never be able to get the same silky soft legs that you can with a razor.&lt;BR&gt;I would recomend this if you have high pain tolerance and thick hair, but personaly for me I don&#x27;t like it. (Although my friend uses it on her chin all the time and absolutly loves it)</li>
            <li> Ok, ripping the hair out of your skin by the roots is never fun, but this has to be the least traumatic device I have used yet.  I have tried everything from shaving to waxing to other epilators.  This one is, by far, my favorite.  It has several features I have never seen before that make it clearly the best.&lt;br /&gt;It has two speeds.  I use the slower speed for my underarms and bikini area and the faster speed for my legs.  I have very fine blonde leg hair that most other epilators won&#x27;t grab.  The emjoi gets every last one without tugging.  And the slower speed makes using it under my arms (the most painful area for me) tolerable.  Underarm stubble is really gross so epilating is so much better than shaving and this can&#x27;t burn your skin like wax.   I have a salon waxing system too, and I always manage to burn my underarms when I use it.  OUCH!  I got the accessory pack too which gives you a sensitive attachment that covers some of the tweezers.   It&#x27;s really nice for the bikini area.  I have even used it on my eyebrows in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;This machine is cordless.  This is really nice for travel and convenience.  I actually use it while I watch TV sometimes.  It holds a charge for quite a while too, so when I travel for a few days I don&#x27;t even bother to bring the cord with me.&lt;br /&gt;A word of caution - if you use any type of epilotor you need to exfoliate regularly to prevent ingrown hairs.  I have found that using a moisturiser with alpha hydroxy in it helps a lot too.</li>
            <li> All those horror stories you hear about a woman&#x27;s daily beauty treatments are all true, especially the hair removal ones.  I just finished my first time at the Emjoi, and, man did that thing hurt.  It really does get the job done, though.  My legs look a lot less furry and much smoother than they did a couple of hours ago.  I strongly recomend the use of this hair removal robot, and to just tough it out the first time, because it is a lot better than shaving.  With the Emjoi you don&#x27;t have to bother with  tree trunk hair stubs every day.  &lt;BR&gt;It did take me a while to get up the courage, and my younger sister helped me with that and went first without me knowing.  Well, I then obviously felt like I had to do it,  so I locked the bathroom door and hackded away at it.  I only got one leg done at first because I had to be somewhere, but after dreading coming back to it for an hour, I returned home and finished the rest of the torture job.  From all the stories I have heard, though, it sounds like it gets better every time, like pucking your eyebrows does, so I am going to continue,and I encourage you to continue or start to.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product 2 years ago, after my braun epilator died after 5 years of constant use.  Initially, I was awestruck.  It was faster, it pulled very short hair out and was a bit less painfull.  I also enjoyed being able to recharge it and take it along to trips with me.  But after 1 1/2 years, it definetely started going downhill.  It was not holding its charge very long and was not working as fast as before, even when it was plugged.  It was taking longer each time to groom than ever.  Finally today, it was making noises of a sick man and I decided it had to retire.  So, I will go back to Braun again.  I want my money to stretch for longer.  Even though, initially it is very good, it is not a reliable product.  I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have had my Emjoi for about 6 months now and I love it.  I use it on my legs.  Once you have used it a few times, it doesn&#x27;t hurt much because there isn&#x27;t as much hair.  I do a quick once-over 3-4 times a week and it does the trick.  I don&#x27;t like it for underarms because it hurts too much so I went back to regular waxing there.  It works fine in the bikini area but I was getting too many ingown hairs so I went back to wax strips in that area.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve owned two of these and they&#x27;re great.  easy to use and becomes painless after a while.  i use it primarily on my underarms and after a year of continued use, i noticed much finer hair and very sparse growth.  definitely a great product.  i only have one complaint though...i use it about 2-3 times week and after a year of continued use, it starts to break.  the power gradually dies until the discs don&#x27;t move anymore.  but then, i guess $50/year for taking away unwanted hair painlessly is worth it.  my 2nd one is starting to break so i&#x27;ll probably order my third one pretty soon.</li>
            <li> I knew when I bought this item that some pain would be the price of ripping hairs out by the roots.  I just had no idea how much.  My main problem area is some hair on my face and neck.  I also wanted to use this for underarms. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When I used the Emjoi, it was so painful that tears were running down my face.  I was not actually crying, but that&#x27;s how much my eyes were watering!  I tried it under my arms.  It didn&#x27;t get all of the hair, was extremely painful, and caused major skin irritation. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Next I tried it on the facial areas.  The device barely removed any of the hair I wanted to get rid of, and again was extremely painful and caused skin irritation.  I thought that if I just stuck with it for a while, I would get toughened up, and using it wouldn&#x27;t bother me so much.  No luck. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While I was trying out the Emjoi I wound up having to shave with a regular razor as well to get rid of the hair I needed to remove.  Even if I let the hair grow to be a little longer before using the Emjoi, it still didn&#x27;t remove it all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When I bought this item (not from Amazon), I had a 90-day period within which I could return it.  I tried to use it for most of that time, thinking that things would improve, but in the end I had to send it back. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The product name is Gently Gold Caress.  \\&quot;Gently\\&quot; and \\&quot;Caress\\&quot; are descriptive terms that shouldn&#x27;t be allowed anywhere near this product.</li>
            <li> This product is terrific.  I have purchased this a second time because I lost the first one on a vacation trip.  Initial use is something one has to get used to.  There is some pain/discomfort with the initial use.  The hair is pulled out so that should be expected.  After the first two or three uses, discomfort is minimal.  This product does a very good job in removing the hair.  My favorite is the fact I have no more underarm pricklies which I used to get from shaving.  Using this on the bikini area is fine, but I recommend waxing the first time since the long hair is hard for Emjoi to remove properly.  Then keep the hair removed with the Emjoi.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One note to make...it does take longer than shaving for a hair removal session.  It may also take a couple more days of using the Enjoi after the initial session to completely remove all hair from and area.  This is explained in the product manual.  Bonus is one does not have stubble growth, does not have to remove hair again for several weeks, no risk of razor cuts, and skin looks better after using Emjoi.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The cordless feature is also a plus.  The battery last for a very long time.  Long enough for me to do my legs, underarms, bikini area and still have plenty of power before having to recharge.  It also works very well with the charger plugged in to the unit.  The cord is plenty long enough to move around. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I should note that I have not tried other epilators.  This was recomended by a friend and I have been using it for over five years.</li>
            <li> I ordered this hair remover in Septeber, did not receive it until mid Nov. On top of that, Amazon issue the certificate discount 2months late leaving a short period of time before it expired. After emailed back and forth, Amazon still denied of owning their own mistake on the delay of issuing the certificate. Totally disappointment with their service. Guys, please watch out for their promotional certificate discount, as they will find a cheap way to cheat on their customers!!!</li>
            <li> This product is great!  Yes, it hurts like HECK to use, but it&#x27;s an epilator, and I can&#x27;t imagine one that does NOT hurt.  Does an excellent job and is great for removing the annoying facial fuzz (upper lip and chin), foot and toe hair, and underarm hair.  I tried a couple times to use it on legs and while I loved the results, it was just a little too painful.  Best used on smaller areas, in my opinion.  I love it and will never be without one!  Skin is so much smoother and more hair free than it could ever be with shaving.</li>
