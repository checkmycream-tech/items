            <li>Would have loved free shipping, but as Mick Jaggers says, you can&#x27;t always get what you want!</li>
            <li>When you wake up in a tent with no water, they&#x27;re nice to have handy as part of your gear.</li>
            <li>Nice</li>
            <li>They smell great and overall in my opinion are the best of all the pocket towels.</li>
            <li>Especially useful during cold/flu season.</li>
            <li>Nice dispenser carton.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s great to be able to just order them and be sure to have a supply on hand.</li>
            <li>Great quality and maintains moisture to clean effectively.</li>
            <li>They have a great clean smell.</li>
            <li>These are great when you need to clean up and don&#x27;t have running water.</li>
            <li>smell fresh and great for keeping in the car.</li>
            <li>I FOUND THESE TO BE EXCELLENT WIPES WITH SOFT CLOTH AND AMPLE MOISTURE</li>
            <li>Having tried them, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re suitable for that purpose.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great wipes, large and have plenty of moisture.</li>
            <li>Large in sizie and great to throw in your purse.</li>
            <li>Love these hand wipes.  </li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>Love using them in the office for keyboard and phone</li>
            <li>so that might sound a bit hypochondriac!  </li>
            <li>I just love their softness and scent.  </li>
            <li>Even when restaurants offer free hand wipes, I use my own Germ-X packet.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different types of bacterial wipes, but like this one the best!</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>Love these for travel.</li>
            <li>Now I can but its a better deal from amazon.  </li>
            <li>so she uses them before eating and snack time in class, without the burn of the gel and much more convenient for kids.    </li>
            <li>I carry them around in my purse as well and keep a bunch in the car, I love these :)</li>
            <li>The more I use these the better</li>
            <li>I LOVE them.  </li>
            <li>Carry to use on many surfaces.</li>
            <li>These Germ-X hand wipes are the most convenient way of sanitizing hands when away from home.  </li>
            <li>I just wish they were easier to find, but glad Amazon carries them.</li>
            <li>Love, love these.</li>
            <li>I love these wipes, we carry them with us everywhere.  </li>
            <li>Having used these before, I ran out &amp;amp; needed more.</li>
            <li>I love carrying these in my purse and vehicle.</li>
            <li>Love my wipes, on time shipment</li>
            <li>They are mostly alcohol without any toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li>These have always been my favorite anti-bacterial wipes......</li>
            <li>Love these.  </li>
            <li>I love carrying them in my purse, to cleanup hands on the go.</li>
            <li>Love the scent...</li>
            <li>So much more convenient than the gels and I like how it cleans my hands because of the cloth.  </li>
            <li>I am a mail carrier and I love these can&#x27;t find them in stores anymore</li>
            <li>Nice to be able to clean your hands off before eating some lunch on the boat.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a germophobe, but these are handy to have on hand when you need to clean up a bit.</li>
            <li>Over all, this is a great product that I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>and then I know that I have the ability to clean my hands no matter where I am!  </li>
            <li>Easy.</li>
            <li>It is easy to carry one or two in purse or pocket.  </li>
            <li>Easy to transport.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also a nice large size.</li>
            <li>I discovered these sanitizing wipes one day while for earrings here at Amazon, I decided to search for them and found these huge 100-400 count sets.  </li>
            <li>They easily fit into pants&#x27; pockets or handbags.</li>
            <li>I just wish that they were still available in the store and not just online.</li>
            <li>and you are always germ free.</li>
            <li>They fit well in purse or pocket.  </li>
            <li>The light smell is also tolerable unlike some others that will knock you out and stay on your hands for hours.</li>
            <li>These wipes are great because of their individual packaging.</li>
            <li>Each sheet is a good size so can be used for the child and adult.  </li>
            <li>Very useful product.</li>
            <li>Love this product - the sheets are larger and more durable than most antibacterial wipes.</li>
            <li>The first thing I love about these wipes is the size.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hands feeling clean w/o any residue.</li>
            <li>The wipes have plenty of alcohol on them to completely clean your hands.  </li>
            <li>TO CLEAN AND REFRESH THE SKIN.</li>
            <li>Not too strong but strong enough to be effective.  </li>
            <li>Its quick if I decide to stop for lunch or feel I need to clean my hands during class.  </li>
            <li>This is a really good product when you&#x27;re out and about and especially with a toddler.  </li>
            <li>This one is mild.</li>
            <li>They arrived fairly quickly...</li>
            <li>The came quickly.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to buy smaller packs in the store but not any more please do not stop carrying these.</li>
            <li>However, because of the wipes&#x27; high concentration on sanitizer, I find that they burn chapped hands and cuts significantly more than Germ-x gel.</li>
            <li>I have been using them for several years and am very pleased.</li>
            <li>The larger 6\\&quot;x8\\&quot; size is more \\&quot;hand-friendly\\&quot; than the smaller sizes; the material is cloth-like so wipes better than the paper-like wipes; dries quickly and nicely.</li>
            <li>Just the right combo of fresh scent and clean feel.</li>
            <li>I find them useful around the house and outdoors when the children or I need to quickly wipe our hands.  </li>
            <li>I have tried them all and by far hands down these are the best.</li>
            <li>you are looking for gentle alcohol free wipes, go for &amp;</li>
            <li>These are an important part of my day, keeping my family and friends as safe from germs, and whatever else is out there, as possible.  </li>
            <li>They are a nice size - you can totally cleanse your hands with these.</li>
            <li>Second they have the required 62% of alcohol to be effective at killing 99.9% of bacteria.  </li>
            <li>About the product: Large, non perfume, durable, and clean well besides killing the nastys.  </li>
            <li>These wipes are large, sturdy, and have plenty of moisture to clean objects or hands.</li>
            <li>One wipe is plenty large to clean up my hands after a trip to the gun range.</li>
            <li>Just the right size for all occasions.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered, these come in handy especially in the summer.</li>
            <li>They leave your hands feeling clean and refreshed, but not overly scented like some of the sanitizers and not too much of an alcohol smell like the others.  </li>
            <li>Great fresh smell, wipes are well soaked and do not dry, because they are wrapped in individual packaging.</li>
            <li>These are super convenient to keep a few in my gym and make me feel much more comfortable using the equipment!  </li>
            <li>Individually wrapped alcohol wipes fit easily in pocket.  </li>
            <li>It is much more economical to buy them in this size container than the smaller sizes that are sold in stores.</li>
            <li>They are a nice size and do not tear - nor do they dry my hands.</li>
            <li>Since they are individually wrapped, the box seems huge, specially when packing to travel, however it did the job</li>
            <li>I was so glad I found them, we use them before dining out, after being in public places, etc.</li>
            <li>have these wipes in many different locations throughout the house.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried various similar products, but I&#x27;ve found that the softness of these feel best, especially when out on the camping trail with a pack.  </li>
            <li>I feel confident when I use these that I have sanitized the surface or my hands as much as possible without having soap and water.</li>
            <li>I share the box with my girlfriend who first introduced me to them.  </li>
            <li>I love these wipes and the only place I can find them is on amazon.  </li>
            <li>I intended to put them in a first aid kit for camping.</li>
            <li>Used to be able to purchase these at my Local Sam&#x27;s Club.  </li>
            <li>Best wipes available; especially good for travelers to wipe down disgusting airline seats, armrests, headrests, and trays.</li>
            <li>handy and don&#x27;t dry the skin too much.</li>
            <li>The reaction of my bird/peon feeding has been highly positive with tons of praise.  </li>
            <li>Large, soft cloths to keep hands clean and sanitary.  </li>
            <li>They are easy to put in my purse because they are individually wrapped.  </li>
            <li>Easy open.</li>
            <li>These are large and and have plenty of moisture.  </li>
            <li>The towel is really large and stays moist.</li>
            <li>I wanted a large box</li>
            <li>These little packets are so handy for placing in your purse or the cup holder in your car.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d had a hard time finding individually wrapped wipes, so I was pretty happy at first.</li>
            <li>I gave this item an excellent rating because I know how dirty and germy things are away from home.  </li>
            <li>so you can see what they look like in real life.</li>
            <li>We really like these.  </li>
            <li>It really helps break up the day.    </li>
            <li>I assume its because alcohol is very drying.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient and compact to carry in the car or purse.  </li>
            <li>and I really like them.</li>
            <li>I really like it, though, and will buy some again when my supply runs out.</li>
            <li>They are a generous size and very cloth-like for disposable wipes.  </li>
            <li>I really like having these on hand</li>
            <li>These are great for taking small children potty in public restrooms...</li>
            <li>I also use these to clean surfaces in public places.</li>
            <li>My wife can&#x27;t stand the smell, so I keep these in the tool box and, before I get back into the cab, I use one to clean my hands and all is well.</li>
            <li>Great for traveling to wipe down the phone and tv remote when I get to the hotel.  </li>
            <li>However, these cloths are not as drying at all, there is no unpleasant scent and these individual packettes are very convenient.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna put this out instead of tiny Hershey bars or a box of doughnuts\\&quot; (our clerical area currently sports two boxes of tastey Halloween themed doughnuts, those clerks LOVE doughnuts) and \\&quot;feed the birds\\&quot; as we call it.    </li>
            <li>My child got a super bug in a store last fall and came close to death.  </li>
            <li>They have too strong of a smell, and if they touch the skin around your mouth and you lick your lips with your tongue, it gives a bitter &amp; lingering taste in your mouth.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>Great product, even though it&#x27;s too expensive.</li>
            <li>They are highly saturated with sanitizer, as opposed to many other wipe brands that are just barely dampened with sanitizer.</li>
            <li>This bacterial wipe is wet, strong, and a larger size than many other wipes.  </li>
            <li>I live in Florida and many other brands dry out when I leave them in the car with the hot sun.</li>
            <li>They are very large compared to a lot of other wipes and they are always very, very moist.</li>
            <li>Seriously everyone should own these.  </li>
            <li>Comes in little packages you can easily carry anywhere.  </li>
            <li>It is so easy just to throw a few of these into my purse</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a fairly strong alcohol smell but it fades after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t overpowering, but it&#x27;s kind of like dousing your hands in a weak lemon Pledge solution.</li>
            <li>Besides the hands, they can be used to wipe down grocery cart handles, hospital bed railings, salt and pepper shakers and not so clean tables at restaurants, etc.</li>
            <li>The wipes are soft and large enough for my uses</li>
            <li>It is especially helpful and gentle when trying to cleanse sensitive areas of the skin that are already irritated.</li>
            <li>They are soft and feels like a cloth.  </li>
            <li>They travel well and are ok through TSA, at least in my experience.  </li>
            <li>The singles are more expensive but the convenience makes it worth the difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Especially when traveling, sometimes you want indiviudally-wrapped wipes, and these are superior to Wet Ones and other similar offerings...</li>
            <li>Can easily wipe all three of my small childrens&#x27; hands with one wipe.</li>
            <li>They are really big and last for thoroughly clean hands and even the outside of your cell phone afterwards.  </li>
            <li>They are larger and stronger that the other wipes available.</li>
            <li>Product is as expected - but I did a bad job of surching for the best price - at Sams club</li>
            <li>They are soft and do not dry your hands out.</li>
            <li>Paid way too much for this item (Over $20) - will go through Sam&#x27;s Club next time - for only $9.00</li>
            <li>After seeing all the bad things I saw working in a hospital these wipes are a great thing to have.</li>
            <li>Use on grocery store carts, foreign restrooms, disinfect telephones, computer keyboards and mouse, remote TV controllers, refrigerator doors, doctor&#x27;s waiting room chairs, elevator buttons, rental cars, airplane seats and trays, hotel facilities, periodic hand cleansing, , and so many other things.</li>
            <li>A little more expensive, but will worth it.  </li>
            <li>and since they are in sealed pouches they never dry out like the big plastic containers do.  </li>
            <li>Like the larger size as often can use one instead of two plus they do not dry out like some of the ones in paper type packaging.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great not to have the artificial floral or heavy alcohol scent.</li>

            <li> and they are so handy.</li>
            <li> Would have loved free shipping, but as Mick Jaggers says, you can&#x27;t always get what you want!</li>
            <li> When you wake up in a tent with no water, they&#x27;re nice to have handy as part of your gear.</li>
            <li> Nice</li>
            <li> They smell great and overall in my opinion are the best of all the pocket towels.</li>
            <li> Especially useful during cold/flu season.</li>
            <li> Nice dispenser carton.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s great to be able to just order them and be sure to have a supply on hand.</li>
            <li> Great quality and maintains moisture to clean effectively.</li>
            <li> They have a great clean smell.</li>
            <li> These are great when you need to clean up and don&#x27;t have running water.</li>
            <li> smell fresh and great for keeping in the car.</li>
            <li> I FOUND THESE TO BE EXCELLENT WIPES WITH SOFT CLOTH AND AMPLE MOISTURE</li>
            <li> Having tried them, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re suitable for that purpose.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great wipes, large and have plenty of moisture.</li>
            <li> Large in sizie and great to throw in your purse.</li>
            <li> Love these hand wipes.  </li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> Love using them in the office for keyboard and phone</li>
            <li> so that might sound a bit hypochondriac!  </li>
            <li> I just love their softness and scent.  </li>
            <li> Even when restaurants offer free hand wipes, I use my own Germ-X packet.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many different types of bacterial wipes, but like this one the best!</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> Love these for travel.</li>
            <li> Now I can but its a better deal from amazon.  </li>
            <li> so she uses them before eating and snack time in class, without the burn of the gel and much more convenient for kids.    </li>
            <li> I carry them around in my purse as well and keep a bunch in the car, I love these :)</li>
            <li> The more I use these the better</li>
            <li> I LOVE them.  </li>
            <li> Carry to use on many surfaces.</li>
            <li> These Germ-X hand wipes are the most convenient way of sanitizing hands when away from home.  </li>
            <li> I just wish they were easier to find, but glad Amazon carries them.</li>
            <li> Love, love these.</li>
            <li> I love these wipes, we carry them with us everywhere.  </li>
            <li> Having used these before, I ran out &amp;amp; needed more.</li>
            <li> I love carrying these in my purse and vehicle.</li>
            <li> Love my wipes, on time shipment</li>
            <li> They are mostly alcohol without any toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li> These have always been my favorite anti-bacterial wipes......</li>
            <li> Love these.  </li>
            <li> I love carrying them in my purse, to cleanup hands on the go.</li>
            <li> Love the scent...</li>
            <li> So much more convenient than the gels and I like how it cleans my hands because of the cloth.  </li>
            <li> I am a mail carrier and I love these can&#x27;t find them in stores anymore</li>
            <li> Nice to be able to clean your hands off before eating some lunch on the boat.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a germophobe, but these are handy to have on hand when you need to clean up a bit.</li>
            <li> Over all, this is a great product that I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> and then I know that I have the ability to clean my hands no matter where I am!  </li>
            <li> Easy.</li>
            <li> It is easy to carry one or two in purse or pocket.  </li>
            <li> Easy to transport.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also a nice large size.</li>
            <li> I discovered these sanitizing wipes one day while for earrings here at Amazon, I decided to search for them and found these huge 100-400 count sets.  </li>
            <li> They easily fit into pants&#x27; pockets or handbags.</li>
            <li> I just wish that they were still available in the store and not just online.</li>
            <li> and you are always germ free.</li>
            <li> They fit well in purse or pocket.  </li>
            <li> The light smell is also tolerable unlike some others that will knock you out and stay on your hands for hours.</li>
            <li> These wipes are great because of their individual packaging.</li>
            <li> Each sheet is a good size so can be used for the child and adult.  </li>
            <li> Very useful product.</li>
            <li> Love this product - the sheets are larger and more durable than most antibacterial wipes.</li>
            <li> The first thing I love about these wipes is the size.  </li>
            <li> Leaves hands feeling clean w/o any residue.</li>
            <li> The wipes have plenty of alcohol on them to completely clean your hands.  </li>
            <li> TO CLEAN AND REFRESH THE SKIN.</li>
            <li> Not too strong but strong enough to be effective.  </li>
            <li> Its quick if I decide to stop for lunch or feel I need to clean my hands during class.  </li>
            <li> This is a really good product when you&#x27;re out and about and especially with a toddler.  </li>
            <li> This one is mild.</li>
            <li> They arrived fairly quickly...</li>
            <li> The came quickly.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to buy smaller packs in the store but not any more please do not stop carrying these.</li>
            <li> However, because of the wipes&#x27; high concentration on sanitizer, I find that they burn chapped hands and cuts significantly more than Germ-x gel.</li>
            <li> I have been using them for several years and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> The larger 6\\&quot;x8\\&quot; size is more \\&quot;hand-friendly\\&quot; than the smaller sizes; the material is cloth-like so wipes better than the paper-like wipes; dries quickly and nicely.</li>
            <li> Just the right combo of fresh scent and clean feel.</li>
            <li> I find them useful around the house and outdoors when the children or I need to quickly wipe our hands.  </li>
            <li> I have tried them all and by far hands down these are the best.</li>
            <li> you are looking for gentle alcohol free wipes, go for &amp;</li>
            <li> These are an important part of my day, keeping my family and friends as safe from germs, and whatever else is out there, as possible.  </li>
            <li> They are a nice size - you can totally cleanse your hands with these.</li>
            <li> Second they have the required 62% of alcohol to be effective at killing 99.9% of bacteria.  </li>
            <li> About the product: Large, non perfume, durable, and clean well besides killing the nastys.  </li>
            <li> These wipes are large, sturdy, and have plenty of moisture to clean objects or hands.</li>
            <li> One wipe is plenty large to clean up my hands after a trip to the gun range.</li>
            <li> Just the right size for all occasions.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered, these come in handy especially in the summer.</li>
            <li> They leave your hands feeling clean and refreshed, but not overly scented like some of the sanitizers and not too much of an alcohol smell like the others.  </li>
            <li> Great fresh smell, wipes are well soaked and do not dry, because they are wrapped in individual packaging.</li>
            <li> These are super convenient to keep a few in my gym and make me feel much more comfortable using the equipment!  </li>
            <li> Individually wrapped alcohol wipes fit easily in pocket.  </li>
            <li> It is much more economical to buy them in this size container than the smaller sizes that are sold in stores.</li>
            <li> They are a nice size and do not tear - nor do they dry my hands.</li>
            <li> Since they are individually wrapped, the box seems huge, specially when packing to travel, however it did the job</li>
            <li> I was so glad I found them, we use them before dining out, after being in public places, etc.</li>
            <li> have these wipes in many different locations throughout the house.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various similar products, but I&#x27;ve found that the softness of these feel best, especially when out on the camping trail with a pack.  </li>
            <li> I feel confident when I use these that I have sanitized the surface or my hands as much as possible without having soap and water.</li>
            <li> I share the box with my girlfriend who first introduced me to them.  </li>
            <li> I love these wipes and the only place I can find them is on amazon.  </li>
            <li> I intended to put them in a first aid kit for camping.</li>
            <li> Used to be able to purchase these at my Local Sam&#x27;s Club.  </li>
            <li> Best wipes available; especially good for travelers to wipe down disgusting airline seats, armrests, headrests, and trays.</li>
            <li> handy and don&#x27;t dry the skin too much.</li>
            <li> The reaction of my bird/peon feeding has been highly positive with tons of praise.  </li>
            <li> Large, soft cloths to keep hands clean and sanitary.  </li>
            <li> They are easy to put in my purse because they are individually wrapped.  </li>
            <li> Easy open.</li>
            <li> These are large and and have plenty of moisture.  </li>
            <li> The towel is really large and stays moist.</li>
            <li> I wanted a large box</li>
            <li> These little packets are so handy for placing in your purse or the cup holder in your car.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d had a hard time finding individually wrapped wipes, so I was pretty happy at first.</li>
            <li> I gave this item an excellent rating because I know how dirty and germy things are away from home.  </li>
            <li> so you can see what they look like in real life.</li>
            <li> We really like these.  </li>
            <li> It really helps break up the day.    </li>
            <li> I assume its because alcohol is very drying.  </li>
            <li> Very convenient and compact to carry in the car or purse.  </li>
            <li> and I really like them.</li>
            <li> I really like it, though, and will buy some again when my supply runs out.</li>
            <li> They are a generous size and very cloth-like for disposable wipes.  </li>
            <li> I really like having these on hand</li>
            <li> These are great for taking small children potty in public restrooms...</li>
            <li> I also use these to clean surfaces in public places.</li>
            <li> My wife can&#x27;t stand the smell, so I keep these in the tool box and, before I get back into the cab, I use one to clean my hands and all is well.</li>
            <li> Great for traveling to wipe down the phone and tv remote when I get to the hotel.  </li>
            <li> However, these cloths are not as drying at all, there is no unpleasant scent and these individual packettes are very convenient.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna put this out instead of tiny Hershey bars or a box of doughnuts\\&quot; (our clerical area currently sports two boxes of tastey Halloween themed doughnuts, those clerks LOVE doughnuts) and \\&quot;feed the birds\\&quot; as we call it.    </li>
            <li> My child got a super bug in a store last fall and came close to death.  </li>
            <li> They have too strong of a smell, and if they touch the skin around your mouth and you lick your lips with your tongue, it gives a bitter &amp; lingering taste in your mouth.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Great product, even though it&#x27;s too expensive.</li>
            <li> They are highly saturated with sanitizer, as opposed to many other wipe brands that are just barely dampened with sanitizer.</li>
            <li> This bacterial wipe is wet, strong, and a larger size than many other wipes.  </li>
            <li> I live in Florida and many other brands dry out when I leave them in the car with the hot sun.</li>
            <li> They are very large compared to a lot of other wipes and they are always very, very moist.</li>
            <li> Seriously everyone should own these.  </li>
            <li> Comes in little packages you can easily carry anywhere.  </li>
            <li> It is so easy just to throw a few of these into my purse</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a fairly strong alcohol smell but it fades after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t overpowering, but it&#x27;s kind of like dousing your hands in a weak lemon Pledge solution.</li>
            <li> Besides the hands, they can be used to wipe down grocery cart handles, hospital bed railings, salt and pepper shakers and not so clean tables at restaurants, etc.</li>
            <li> The wipes are soft and large enough for my uses</li>
            <li> It is especially helpful and gentle when trying to cleanse sensitive areas of the skin that are already irritated.</li>
            <li> They are soft and feels like a cloth.  </li>
            <li> They travel well and are ok through TSA, at least in my experience.  </li>
            <li> The singles are more expensive but the convenience makes it worth the difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Especially when traveling, sometimes you want indiviudally-wrapped wipes, and these are superior to Wet Ones and other similar offerings...</li>
            <li> Can easily wipe all three of my small childrens&#x27; hands with one wipe.</li>
            <li> They are really big and last for thoroughly clean hands and even the outside of your cell phone afterwards.  </li>
            <li> They are larger and stronger that the other wipes available.</li>
            <li> Product is as expected - but I did a bad job of surching for the best price - at Sams club</li>
            <li> They are soft and do not dry your hands out.</li>
            <li> Paid way too much for this item (Over $20) - will go through Sam&#x27;s Club next time - for only $9.00</li>
            <li> After seeing all the bad things I saw working in a hospital these wipes are a great thing to have.</li>
            <li> Use on grocery store carts, foreign restrooms, disinfect telephones, computer keyboards and mouse, remote TV controllers, refrigerator doors, doctor&#x27;s waiting room chairs, elevator buttons, rental cars, airplane seats and trays, hotel facilities, periodic hand cleansing, , and so many other things.</li>
            <li> A little more expensive, but will worth it.  </li>
            <li> and since they are in sealed pouches they never dry out like the big plastic containers do.  </li>
            <li> Like the larger size as often can use one instead of two plus they do not dry out like some of the ones in paper type packaging.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great not to have the artificial floral or heavy alcohol scent.</li>
            <li> Sam&#x27;s Club used to stock these indivudually-wrapped Germ-X wipes but then started only stocking the 48-packs (i.e., wipes not individually-wrapped, but packaged like moist toilet wipes).  </li>
            <li> The box of Germ X wipes was shipped in an envelope much too small for the contents.  </li>
            <li> They must be well sealed as they last a long time.  </li>
            <li> They last long and won&#x27;t dry up since they are w rapped individually</li>
            <li> you can order direct fro Sam&#x27;s Club for $38.00 less.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t necessarily prefer the smell of straight alcohol, but at least that evaporates quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Large, thick, durable, convenient, what else can I say.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The 62% ethyl alcohol will disinfect stuff, for sure, but the artificial scent and moisturizing agent are deal breakers for me.</li>
            <li> I will also carry some in my purse for those times when we are not near a bathroom and feel the need to sanitize our hands.</li>
            <li> Especially now with the H1N1 you can never be too careful.</li>
            <li> I had to wash my hands twice with soap to get the stuff off, and it&#x27;s still not completely gone.</li>
            <li> Bigger than a wet wipe, plus the anti germ properties.</li>
            <li> My boss, my boss&#x27;s boss, his boss, about 25 other fellow peons, it&#x27;s a regular candy-a-pallooza here.  </li>
            <li> They are non-sticky and don&#x27;t dry out the hands.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry your hands out.</li>
            <li> Myra seems to like the Germ-X single wipes.   </li>
            <li> The moisturizer leaves your hands feeling a little sticky, and that&#x27;s the opposite of what I expect from an alcohol wipe.</li>
            <li> I am a lifelong customer.  </li>
            <li> I even caught Myra from the other side of the building (you know, the part that has those other people that work here and do something or another.  </li>
            <li> Other fellow peons have mentioned that they appreciate I put something other then candy out</li>
            <li> My gym has the mystery spray bottle of \\&quot;disinfectant\\&quot; that I&#x27;m not really sure actually sanitizes anything.  </li>
            <li> Add the flu pandemic and the fact that I KNOW at least 3-4 other of my fellow male coworker peon types</li>
            <li> We are planning a trip to China and are planning to take these with us on the airplane in order to wipe down the tray table, etc.  </li>
            <li> you can wipe a ton of things down with just one wipe.  </li>
            <li> Theme was A beautful mess</li>
            <li> and sometimes we all need a little germ X.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love these hand wipes.  I carry them everywhere I go and they are so handy. Its quick if I decide to stop for lunch or feel I need to clean my hands during class.  I have been using these wipes for over 12 years.  I find them useful around the house and outdoors when the children or I need to quickly wipe our hands.  They are soft and do not dry your hands out.</li>
            <li> These are hard to find in my area.  I was so glad I found them, we use them before dining out, after being in public places, etc. These are an important part of my day, keeping my family and friends as safe from germs, and whatever else is out there, as possible.  Would have loved free shipping, but as Mick Jaggers says, you can&#x27;t always get what you want!</li>
            <li> Perfect for backpack and purse.  They last long and won&#x27;t dry up since they are w rapped individually</li>
            <li> I love these. They are a nice size - you can totally cleanse your hands with these. I always keep them in the car, purse, cooler etc.  They have a great clean smell.</li>
            <li> I gave this item an excellent rating because I know how dirty and germy things are away from home.  It is so easy just to throw a few of these into my purse and then I know that I have the ability to clean my hands no matter where I am!  Thank you Germ-X!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product - the sheets are larger and more durable than most antibacterial wipes. Great value too with this size box.</li>
            <li> These are great antibacterial wipes, use them at home or out, they are perfect wallet or purse size, and you will stay much healthier, I like that with asthma!</li>
            <li> Easy. To carry in purse orpocket</li>
            <li> I go nowhere without these wipes.  These are large and and have plenty of moisture.  They easily fit into pants&#x27; pockets or handbags. Besides the hands, they can be used to wipe down grocery cart handles, hospital bed railings, salt and pepper shakers and not so clean tables at restaurants, etc. They are non-sticky and don&#x27;t dry out the hands.  This is an excellent product. I order from Sam&#x27;s Club online as they are cheaper.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo10Q7ILGN39QX6]]Video of me using wipes so you can see what they look like in real life.</li>
            <li> have these wipes in many different locations throughout the house. Love using them in the office for keyboard and phone</li>
            <li> These sanitizing wipes are great. They have 62% Ethyl Alcohol in them . Great for killing germs. I worked in a hospital and hospitals use alcohol to kill germs.     Its neatly boxed also. You get 100 wipes in a box that has a flap on it. You can open the flap to get your wipes out.     After seeing all the bad things I saw working in a hospital these wipes are a great thing to have. Keep some in your car, home , trips, etc.      Its hard to find wipes like this. I will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> These arrived on time.  We are planning a trip to China and are planning to take these with us on the airplane in order to wipe down the tray table, etc.  I will also carry some in my purse for those times when we are not near a bathroom and feel the need to sanitize our hands.</li>
            <li> Husband overpaid. you can order direct fro Sam&#x27;s Club for $38.00 less. (4 boxes) won&#x27;t make this mistake again.</li>
            <li> We really like these.  I will order them again.</li>
            <li> Product is as expected - but I did a bad job of surching for the best price - at Sams club I got 3 boxes for about the same price as here</li>
            <li> O.k. so that might sound a bit hypochondriac!  Still, with Halloween the week of this review being written and the H1N1 pandemic maybe put this package out for your hypochondriac coworkers.  Basically people such as myself.  There&#x27;s candy out in my office freaking EVERYWHERE.  My boss, my boss&#x27;s boss, his boss, about 25 other fellow peons, it&#x27;s a regular candy-a-pallooza here.  And I just lost 40 pounds over the last 18 months.    Add the flu pandemic and the fact that I KNOW at least 3-4 other of my fellow male coworker peon types do NOT wash their grimy greasy paws after taking a wizz at the urinal.  My workwife who share my tiny office tells me the ladys room is gross and that there is also a sizeable share of female peons who do not wash hands.    So anyways I am lurking the web on my netbook (instead of working, I know) when I see this product.  I think to myself \\&quot;Holy smokes!  I&#x27;m gonna put this out instead of tiny Hershey bars or a box of doughnuts\\&quot; (our clerical area currently sports two boxes of tastey Halloween themed doughnuts, those clerks LOVE doughnuts) and \\&quot;feed the birds\\&quot; as we call it.    The reaction of my bird/peon feeding has been highly positive with tons of praise.  I even caught Myra from the other side of the building (you know, the part that has those other people that work here and do something or another.  I know Myra since she&#x27;s friends with my work wife Jenn.) taking 2-3 at the same time.  Either a glutton or a germaphobic. Myra seems to like the Germ-X single wipes.   Other fellow peons have mentioned that they appreciate I put something other then candy out and now I have 6-7 people stop by every day to chat me up.  It really helps break up the day.    About the product: Large, non perfume, durable, and clean well besides killing the nastys.  I also put one in my fanny pack when I go running.  Our public restrooms are gross.</li>
            <li> I carry 8 of these in my purse at all times.  I just love their softness and scent.  Even when restaurants offer free hand wipes, I use my own Germ-X packet.  I will continue to buy Germ-X packets only.</li>
            <li> Just the thing for decontamination of your hand after needing to shake hands with diseased scum that NEVER seem to wash their hands.  I don&#x27;t want whatever they have.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I keep these in my backpack, boat, trailer, truck and garage.  I&#x27;ve tried various similar products, but I&#x27;ve found that the softness of these feel best, especially when out on the camping trail with a pack.  When you wake up in a tent with no water, they&#x27;re nice to have handy as part of your gear.</li>
            <li> Great wipes. They do not leave residue, however price a little steep!</li>
            <li> This bacterial wipe is wet, strong, and a larger size than many other wipes.  I have tried many different types of bacterial wipes, but like this one the best!</li>
            <li> These are the best wipes ever.  They are soft and feels like a cloth.  I use them regularly.  Especially now with the H1N1 you can never be too careful.</li>
            <li> These towelettes are excellent.  They are very handy.  I keep them in my purse and in my book bag.  They come in very handy when you are out to dinner and want to wipe your hands before eating.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product!</li>
            <li> The larger 6\\&quot;x8\\&quot; size is more \\&quot;hand-friendly\\&quot; than the smaller sizes; the material is cloth-like so wipes better than the paper-like wipes; dries quickly and nicely.</li>
            <li> Great.  Always use them at restaurants.  The singles are more expensive but the convenience makes it worth the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We never leave home without them.</li>
            <li> These wipes are large, sturdy, and have plenty of moisture to clean objects or hands. I have been using them for several years and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> The first thing I love about these wipes is the size.  They are very large compared to a lot of other wipes and they are always very, very moist. Second they have the required 62% of alcohol to be effective at killing 99.9% of bacteria.  It&#x27;s difficult to find sanitizing wipes with alcohol.  I assume its because alcohol is very drying.  However, these cloths are not as drying at all, there is no unpleasant scent and these individual packettes are very convenient.  I will never go back to the alternative.  IMHO, for sanitizing, you have to have alcohol.  I feel confident when I use these that I have sanitized the surface or my hands as much as possible without having soap and water. I discovered these sanitizing wipes one day while for earrings here at Amazon, I decided to search for them and found these huge 100-400 count sets.  Now I&#x27;m a happy camper!  I also use them at the gym i keep them in my car, basically I use these whenever I need to sanitize a surface or my hands.  I&#x27;m back to restock as my supply is getting low and I never want to be without them. I hope the manufacturer of this product never changes it.  They are a must have if you are a person who needs to sanitize surfaces often at work, the gym, for kids or if you&#x27;re a bit of a germaphobe.</li>
            <li> Love these. Somewhat expensive.</li>
            <li> Love these for travel. Keep in my purse and in my cars. Hard to find these in the store. Nice</li>
            <li> These wipes are a must for travel in the car or for carry in your purse.</li>
            <li> I can no longer seem to buy these locally.  Also, the Germ-x site no longer shows them as a product. I am sad.</li>
            <li> Purchased and used these to make welcome packets for attendees of a mommy group (MOPS). Theme was A beautful mess and sometimes we all need a little germ X.</li>
            <li> Excellent hand wipe! Can easily wipe all three of my small childrens&#x27; hands with one wipe. Leaves hands feeling clean w/o any residue. Will buy again and again!</li>
            <li> I share these with my children for my grandchildren.  Very convenient and compact to carry in the car or purse.  Always stay moist.  Just the right size for all occasions.  My husband also carries them in his track bag when he goes to officiate at a track event.</li>
            <li> These are excellent. I keep some in my car and purse.  I put them in my twenty-something daughters&#x27; stockings at Christmas. I share the box with my girlfriend who first introduced me to them.  I take one with me when I walk the dog.  I just wish that they were still available in the store and not just online.</li>
            <li> They have too strong of a smell, and if they touch the skin around your mouth and you lick your lips with your tongue, it gives a bitter &amp; lingering taste in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I have tried them all and by far hands down these are the best. The towel is really large and stays moist. I live in Florida and many other brands dry out when I leave them in the car with the hot sun. They smell great and overall in my opinion are the best of all the pocket towels.</li>
            <li> Great product to travel with</li>
            <li> Good product, us it all the time!</li>
            <li> These are great. You can keep them in your pocket or purse and you are always germ free.</li>
            <li> Sam&#x27;s Club used to stock these indivudually-wrapped Germ-X wipes but then started only stocking the 48-packs (i.e., wipes not individually-wrapped, but packaged like moist toilet wipes).  Especially when traveling, sometimes you want indiviudally-wrapped wipes, and these are superior to Wet Ones and other similar offerings...the wipes are larger, the cloth is softer, Germ-X is a known-good sanitizing product.  Looks like this Amazon offering is the only place to get these now.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> These are great for taking small children potty in public restrooms... Wiping seats or cleaning hands.  They fit well in purse or pocket.  Don&#x27;t use on faces.  I&#x27;ve grown to not want to leave home without them!</li>
            <li> I use to find them at WalMart, but they stopped stocking them.&lt;br /&gt;They smell fresh and great for keeping in the car.</li>
            <li> My wife and I always take these when we are camping  and fishing on our boat.  Nice to be able to clean your hands off before eating some lunch on the boat.  Great size and since they are in sealed pouches they never dry out like the big plastic containers do.  Use to get at Walmart, but they quit carrying the boxed pouches.  I ordered the 100 pack.  That will last me a while.  Great product.  Gets that fish slime off before you stick your hand in that bag of chips.</li>
            <li> Vey moist wipes.  No Fragrance. Individual packets keep well in my car.&lt;br /&gt;No residue after use. Don&#x27;t use on iPhone - leaves film.</li>
            <li> Paid way too much for this item (Over $20) - will go through Sam&#x27;s Club next time - for only $9.00</li>
            <li> This is a really good product when you&#x27;re out and about and especially with a toddler.  I brought this to Hawaii and used it on the plane, in the car, at the beach.  Each sheet is a good size so can be used for the child and adult.  There&#x27;s a fairly strong alcohol smell but it fades after a few minutes.  Will buy again after I&#x27;m done with the 100 packs.</li>
            <li> I found these online after I got a sample wipe and could not find them anywhere in stores.  Now I can but its a better deal from amazon.  These are wonderful, I pack them in my daughters lunchbox and backpack so she uses them before eating and snack time in class, without the burn of the gel and much more convenient for kids.    I carry them around in my purse as well and keep a bunch in the car, I love these :)</li>
            <li> Not too strong but strong enough to be effective.  Comes in little packages you can easily carry anywhere.  I always use them before eating in restaurants.  Some of the stronger antibacterial lotions are irritating to skin.  This one is mild.</li>
            <li> awesome option to liquid hand cleaner.  They travel well and are ok through TSA, at least in my experience.  They arrived fairly quickly... (I have Prime) and in good condition. I will say that they are a bit expensive though.  I keep trying to find a cheaper option to buy them.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  The more I use these the better I LOVE them.  They are really big and last for thoroughly clean hands and even the outside of your cell phone afterwards.  Doesn&#x27;t dry your hands out. I am solid believer and user.</li>
            <li> Very useful product. Carry to use on many surfaces. Use on grocery store carts, foreign restrooms, disinfect telephones, computer keyboards and mouse, remote TV controllers, refrigerator doors, doctor&#x27;s waiting room chairs, elevator buttons, rental cars, airplane seats and trays, hotel facilities, periodic hand cleansing, , and so many other things.</li>
            <li> I put these in my car and lunch box.&lt;br /&gt;I do building maintenance and can&#x27;t always get to soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;When you shake a lot of hands during cold and flu season these are a must.</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel and for taking with you in your purse or backpack.</li>
            <li> These are great when you need to clean up and don&#x27;t have running water.</li>
            <li> These Germ-X hand wipes are the most convenient way of sanitizing hands when away from home.  It is easy to carry one or two in purse or pocket.  If one handles money, use before handling food.  A wipe AFTER returning a restaurant menu to the waiter insures that the menu&#x27;s germs won;t be transferred to your food.  Also, when I have a cold, I wipe my hands before entering a group where I might normally shake someone&#x27;s hand.&lt;br /&gt;It is comforting to know that these hand wipes are within my reach when I am away from home.</li>
            <li> These sanitizing wipes are great for travel. I take them on trips to Mexico all the time. They are larger and stronger that the other wipes available. I just wish they were easier to find, but glad Amazon carries them. I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I wanted these wipes to cleanse hands before handling any food but if you use them before consuming food, the chemicals can get on the food or your lips and the taste/effect is absolutely terrible. The wipes are soft and large enough for my uses but I wish the scent and chemical residue wasn&#x27;t so offensive. It depends what use you need them for but these don&#x27;t quite work well for pre-eating.</li>
            <li> Great for a person on the go. Cleans your skin without drying it out. I also use these to clean surfaces in public places. It&#x27;s great not to have the artificial floral or heavy alcohol scent.</li>
            <li> I have gotten this before and I really like them. I have in my vehicle and in my purse so they are always&lt;br /&gt;ready to use. The came quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dog handler. Love, love these.</li>
            <li> These are the best.  Large, thick, durable, convenient, what else can I say.  A little more expensive, but will worth it.  They seem to last forever...you can wipe a ton of things down with just one wipe.  I am a lifelong customer.  Hopefully they will keep making them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m immuno suppressed due to chemo, I think these have prevented me from getting sick, haven&#x27;t had a cold or flu in years.</li>
            <li> I love these wipes, we carry them with us everywhere.  I like to use them after touching shopping carts (they are so disgusting).  I also like to use them at restaurants after going through the buffet.  It is much more economical to buy them in this size container than the smaller sizes that are sold in stores.</li>
            <li> Having used these before, I ran out &amp;amp; needed more. I shopped around for the best deal &amp;amp; the one that was the best was Amazon&#x27;s...free shipping too!! Very pleased.....</li>
            <li> Great product. Performed as advertised. Good price. Prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> Excellent product- we take on trips and also always have a few in my handbag.  Like the larger size as often can use one instead of two plus they do not dry out like some of the ones in paper type packaging.</li>
            <li> Great Product!  The wipes have plenty of alcohol on them to completely clean your hands.  Because of that they probably should not be used by children but they are perfect for adults.  They are easy to put in my purse because they are individually wrapped.  My child got a super bug in a store last fall and came close to death.  So, I always wipe my hands with these when I leave a store.</li>
            <li> I love these wipes and the only place I can find them is on amazon.  I used to be able to buy smaller packs in the store but not any more please do not stop carrying these.</li>
            <li> I love carrying these in my purse and vehicle.</li>
            <li> Love my wipes, on time shipment</li>
            <li> These are great for travel, keeping in a purse, in the car. I&#x27;m not a germophobe, but these are handy to have on hand when you need to clean up a bit. Especially useful during cold/flu season.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered, these come in handy especially in the summer.</li>
            <li> IT IS OF EXCELLENT HELP FOR WHEN YOU LEAVE ONE AT HOME AND HAVE TO EAT FOOD BECAUSE WITH THIS PRODUCT cleans and disinfects THE HANDS THAT ARE GOING TO TOUCH THE FOOD.</li>
            <li> Large, soft cloths to keep hands clean and sanitary.  Keep a supply in purse, car console, gym bag.  Easy to transport.</li>
            <li> I FOUND THESE TO BE EXCELLENT WIPES WITH SOFT CLOTH AND AMPLE MOISTURE TO CLEAN AND REFRESH THE SKIN. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong.  I never leave home without them.</li>
            <li> Great wipes, large and have plenty of moisture.</li>
            <li> These little packets are so handy for placing in your purse or the cup holder in your car. When I finish shopping, I not only wipe my hands with them, I wipe my steering wheel and shift gear. They are a nice size and do not tear - nor do they dry my hands. They are mostly alcohol without any toxic ingredients. The light smell is also tolerable unlike some others that will knock you out and stay on your hands for hours. Germ-X hand wipes are a staple item in this house. It&#x27;s convenient to have a box of 100 so you don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s hard to import from Israel or what, but this product is not easily found around my part of the country. I really like it, though, and will buy some again when my supply runs out. It is especially helpful and gentle when trying to cleanse sensitive areas of the skin that are already irritated.</li>
            <li> Seriously everyone should own these.  Kids or no kids, we all touch public areas: door knobs, products on store shelves, counter tops.  I keep these in my car, travel bags, purse.  They come in handy ALL the time!</li>
            <li> I wanted a large box so I could grab what ever I wanted for trips or for use around the hours</li>
            <li> Love having these when traveling! Keep them in the car and in my purse. Husband is sometimes a bit OCD and these come in very handy!</li>
            <li> These have always been my favorite anti-bacterial wipes......handy and don&#x27;t dry the skin too much.</li>
            <li> Individually wrapped alcohol wipes fit easily in pocket.  Easy open. Pleasant scent.  Leave behind no residue.  Nice dispenser carton. Great product.</li>
            <li> I got some of these on sale at a local store. I&#x27;d had a hard time finding individually wrapped wipes, so I was pretty happy at first. I intended to put them in a first aid kit for camping. Having tried them, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re suitable for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 62% ethyl alcohol will disinfect stuff, for sure, but the artificial scent and moisturizing agent are deal breakers for me. The scent isn&#x27;t overpowering, but it&#x27;s kind of like dousing your hands in a weak lemon Pledge solution. The moisturizer leaves your hands feeling a little sticky, and that&#x27;s the opposite of what I expect from an alcohol wipe. I had to wash my hands twice with soap to get the stuff off, and it&#x27;s still not completely gone. I don&#x27;t necessarily prefer the smell of straight alcohol, but at least that evaporates quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like having lotions and artificial smells on you, and I know lots of people do, then these might be just what you&#x27;re looking for. I think I&#x27;ll be giving mine away or tossing them out.</li>
            <li> Since they are individually wrapped, the box seems huge, specially when packing to travel, however it did the job</li>
            <li> We love these hand wipes - I keep them in my purse , my car, and throughout the house - great for wiping the cart handle before  grocery shopping!</li>
            <li> We never know if we can find these at Sam&#x27;s when we go. So it&#x27;s great to be able to just order them and be sure to have a supply on hand. I use them every time I fill up the truck with diesel. I always add cetane boost and inevitably get some on my hands. My wife can&#x27;t stand the smell, so I keep these in the tool box and, before I get back into the cab, I use one to clean my hands and all is well. We go through a bunch of these in the course of a camping trip.</li>
            <li> Great quality and maintains moisture to clean effectively.</li>
            <li> Great for tailgating and outdoors.  Take extra into the stadium.</li>
            <li> Used to be able to purchase these at my Local Sam&#x27;s Club.  Don&#x27;t know why they quit carrying it as these are the best wipes on the market.  Large in sizie and great to throw in your purse.</li>
            <li> Love these.  Take them on walks with my dog, just in case...  and always keep a few on me.  They leave your hands feeling clean and refreshed, but not overly scented like some of the sanitizers and not too much of an alcohol smell like the others.  Just the right combo of fresh scent and clean feel.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT product. Great fresh smell, wipes are well soaked and do not dry, because they are wrapped in individual packaging. You should know that these wipes contain alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for gentle alcohol free wipes, go for &amp;#34;Johnson&#x27;s Baby Hand and Face Wipes&amp;#34;, they are good too, but not as effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Germ X will remain my favorite! I will be buying them again.</li>
            <li> I use one of these wipes at the gym to wipe off the treadmill before and after I use it.  My gym has the mystery spray bottle of \\&quot;disinfectant\\&quot; that I&#x27;m not really sure actually sanitizes anything.  These are super convenient to keep a few in my gym and make me feel much more comfortable using the equipment!  They are a generous size and very cloth-like for disposable wipes.  I&#x27;m a happy customer!</li>
            <li> I love carrying them in my purse, to cleanup hands on the go.</li>
            <li> These smell AMAZING!  Love the scent...Handy, to keep anywhere!</li>
            <li> These wipes are great because of their individual packaging. They are highly saturated with sanitizer, as opposed to many other wipe brands that are just barely dampened with sanitizer. However, because of the wipes&#x27; high concentration on sanitizer, I find that they burn chapped hands and cuts significantly more than Germ-x gel. Over all, this is a great product that I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The box of Germ X wipes was shipped in an envelope much too small for the contents.  As a result, the entire box was in pieces (making dispersing the small packages of wipes in the box impossible...no remains of the box!).</li>
            <li> These will always be carried with us wherever we go.  In today&#x27;s world you can&#x27;t be too careful about the areas you travel in or common surfaces.</li>
            <li> The best hand wipes I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> So glad to find these on Amazon, they are the best. Our SAMs doesn&#x27;t carry them anymore.</li>
            <li> Best wipes available; especially good for travelers to wipe down disgusting airline seats, armrests, headrests, and trays.</li>
            <li> I really like having these on hand I my purse, backpack for hiking and my suitcase when I travel. So much more convenient than the gels and I like how it cleans my hands because of the cloth.  Great for traveling to wipe down the phone and tv remote when I get to the hotel.  They&#x27;re also a nice large size.</li>
            <li> I am a mail carrier and I love these can&#x27;t find them in stores anymore</li>
            <li> Great price and speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> Best hand wipes we have found.  Good size.  Alcohol based.  They must be well sealed as they last a long time.  Should note that they did not come in the box shown, just in a plastic bag.</li>
            <li> Great product, even though it&#x27;s too expensive.</li>
            <li> Bigger than a wet wipe, plus the anti germ properties. I keep these in my range bag. One wipe is plenty large to clean up my hands after a trip to the gun range.</li>
