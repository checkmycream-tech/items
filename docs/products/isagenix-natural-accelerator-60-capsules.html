            <li>It gives you energy, right nutrition, reduces your appetite and helps you keep beautiful body.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a fan of isagenix do buy a lot of this. :-).  </li>

            <li>ok, i dont feel more energy.</li>
            <li>I love it, and will continue to use it.</li>

            <li>Product works pretty good .</li>
            <li>as described fast shipping very satisfied</li>
            <li>Great purchase, needed fast and shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>A great product in the vast line of Isagenix products.  </li>
            <li>Really enjoy this product.  </li>
            <li>I believe these are not the original capsules.</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t worth the price!  </li>
            <li>I am pretty sure it is helping even though I forget to take it twice a day sometimes.</li>
            <li>Good stuff especially when taken with the shakes.</li>
            <li>Everything OK, and I was told by my wife because she and the real beneficiary.</li>
            <li>Love it and well priced and fast</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think they work without the full Isagenix program.</li>
            <li>made my heart race and always super thirsty</li>
            <li>There is no way to save really even when the price comes in cheaper but check the Isagenix website first to be sure.</li>
            <li>Several reviews I read prior to purchase said to drink plenty of water when taking this - however, I discovered that no amount of water would prevent the incredible &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; that would hit 10 minutes or so after taking it.  </li>
            <li>The wife thinks they work, and the price is right with timely delivery.</li>
            <li>These are actually great little pills!</li>
            <li>these are great, not sure if they do what they claim</li>
            <li>I am going to try and start remembering to take this twice a day and update my rating when I know for sure it helps more then just a little.</li>
            <li>Just starting taking them and so far so good</li>
            <li>I am all out of it now, but I will probably buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>Would recommend talking with a representative if you are interested in trying the program.</li>
            <li>really does curb the appetite!</li>
            <li>This is a nutrition complex that is great.</li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t tell any difference of taking them and not taking them!</li>
            <li>but first you need to discuss it with your doctor</li>
            <li>When she started she was hot...</li>
            <li>Try the 9 day plan to see the real difference of cleansing and nutrition.</li>
            <li>it really helps speed things along</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>These really work.  </li>
            <li>Really helps me through my workout and keeps me on track.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any real results.</li>
            <li>All natural with no weird ingredients and non flush niacin.</li>
            <li>feel better about myself and plan to continue taking these on a regular daily basis.  </li>
            <li>This item replenishes what I use daily and love it over other dietary products.  </li>
            <li>No jitters, no icky feeling...totally surprised.</li>
            <li>I can not specifically testify that this natural accelerator helped me lose weight</li>
            <li>Only brought the pills, I guess if I did the whole program I would lose weight.</li>
            <li>I like this all natural product</li>
            <li>Seamless transaction.</li>
            <li>Helps boost metabolism naturally.  </li>
            <li>In fact, it may be the same ingredient because they look exactly the same when compared side by side.</li>
            <li>less expensive with prime and great products.</li>

            <li> Suppresses appetite well but only works with the other supplements in the plan and daily workout.</li>
            <li> For a long time, I couldn&#x27;t find anything to help me.</li>
            <li> I think this stuff really works - using it for little less than a month</li>
            <li> I have taken this for 2 weeks and have noticed only a slight increase in energy and decrease in hunger.  </li>
            <li> not much to say.  </li>
            <li> Seller shipped sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> It wasnt what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> NOT MUCH OF AN ADVANTAGE USING THIS</li>
            <li> Since starting this a few months ago, I have dropped 15 pounds and counting.</li>
            <li> It caused nausea and vomiting, due to B6 component.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m down 14</li>
            <li> and my wife has lost over 10 and gone down 2 dress sizes.</li>
            <li> I used the product few years ago</li>
            <li> did not work, waste of money!</li>
            <li> not sure what that&#x27;s about</li>
            <li> I feel these are not effective at all</li>
            <li> You can use Metamucil, which is a lot less expensive.</li>
            <li> Game changer.</li>
            <li> My husband used this and said it was no good!</li>
            <li> Disappointed</li>
            <li> Another stupid add on.</li>
            <li> This product made me very sick.</li>
            <li> It made me bloat up and feel nasty.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s great as part of a healthy eating plan. All natural with no weird ingredients and non flush niacin. Take as directed twice a day though. Try the 9 day plan to see the real difference of cleansing and nutrition. [...]</li>
            <li> I took it for about 4 days. It caused nausea and vomiting, due to B6 component.&lt;br /&gt;If someone has a hight sensitivity to this component, I would suggest: avoid using this product.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and I have not seen any results.</li>
            <li> I can not specifically testify that this natural accelerator helped me lose weight but I am losing weight and I use this product once a day. The ingredient list contains ingredients that I have read about as &amp;#34;helpful&amp;#34; in promoting weight loss so I will continue taking it until I reach my weight reduction goal which is 50lbs.; I am now at 40lbs gone.</li>
            <li> It was great.  If you&#x27;re a fan of isagenix do buy a lot of this. :-).  I am all out of it now, but I will probably buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> Only brought the pills, I guess if I did the whole program I would lose weight.</li>
            <li> This product made me very sick.</li>
            <li> made my heart race and always super thirsty</li>
            <li> A great product in the vast line of Isagenix products.  Would recommend talking with a representative if you are interested in trying the program.</li>
            <li> I believe these are not the original capsules.</li>
            <li> love this stuff it really helps speed things along</li>
            <li> This is a great product but even on Amazon you don&#x27;t save when it comes to shipping.... Isagenix is also pricey with shipping. There is no way to save really even when the price comes in cheaper but check the Isagenix website first to be sure.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t that impressed that this supplement really makes any difference.</li>
            <li> regular on/off buyer  .. like the product</li>
            <li> not much to say.  Got it to use with IsaLean Shakes, it did not work for me. Gave it a 2 because shipping and packaging was very good, just didn&#x27;t like the product.</li>
            <li> I like this all natural product</li>
            <li> I heard a lot good things about this product, shakes etc... Unless you starve yourself.. It doesnt work..</li>
            <li> Does help appetite suppression</li>
            <li> Good stuff especially when taken with the shakes. really does curb the appetite!</li>
            <li> I started the Skinny Up diet plan and ordered these to go with.  I noticed I have much more energy, feel better about myself and plan to continue taking these on a regular daily basis.  Seller shipped sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> I think this stuff really works - using it for little less than a month and I feel like its helping the process -- I am taking 2 capsules per day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying four supplements from this company once a months. This is a nutrition complex that is great. It gives you energy, right nutrition, reduces your appetite and helps you keep beautiful body. If you want to see what is it click on my name and read my reviews. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> These really work.  Seamless transaction.</li>
            <li> I didnt like it. It made me bloat up and feel nasty.  It wasnt what I expected.  Didnt work for me.</li>
            <li> This item replenishes what I use daily and love it over other dietary products.  Recommend exercising when taking this product to maximize weight loss.</li>
            <li> It did not do a thing for me.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected. The product was sealed &amp; delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> Everything OK, and I was told by my wife because she and the real beneficiary. So, if she is happy ..... I more.</li>
            <li> Great purchase, needed fast and shipping was very fast. Thank you</li>
            <li> I have been usin this with the Isagenix program. Geat to take that will burn calories witht eh Isagenix Progam</li>
            <li> These are actually great little pills! No jitters, no icky feeling...totally surprised.</li>
            <li> I have taken this for 2 weeks and have noticed only a slight increase in energy and decrease in hunger.  No weight change - yet. Several reviews I read prior to purchase said to drink plenty of water when taking this - however, I discovered that no amount of water would prevent the incredible &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; that would hit 10 minutes or so after taking it.  I did, though, find that simply 8 oz of milk kept the burn away.</li>
            <li> Not a fan...just another add-on that really isn&#x27;t necessary. I like Isagenix shakes &amp; the Ionic Supreme vitamin drink but I don&#x27;t think these do anything.</li>
            <li> Great service . Product works pretty good .</li>
            <li> These are nothing to brag about, they are a vitamin supplement, they do not work at all.&lt;br /&gt;I have been to the gym daily and eating low cal and these were supposed to &amp;#34;accelerate&amp;#34; weight loss,&lt;br /&gt;NOT.  THEY DO NOTHING.</li>
            <li> Helps boost metabolism naturally.  I love this product!</li>
            <li> as described fast shipping very satisfied</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just okay.  Wasn&#x27;t able to meet my goal.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only taken for a couple days but i have noticed a much more controlled appetite and a bit more energy.  I would advise not taking too close to bed as it seems to have a bit of an insomnia effect.</li>
            <li> Curbs my hunger and tastes great.</li>
            <li> product works ok, i dont feel more energy. i do get heartburn from the spices in it.</li>
            <li> Good price for the product</li>
            <li> I feel these are not effective at all</li>
            <li> These pills definitely &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; you out.</li>
            <li> My husband used this and said it was no good!</li>
            <li> Love it and well priced and fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Henry, The Wedeatermna,LLC.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother. You can use Metamucil, which is a lot less expensive. In fact, it may be the same ingredient because they look exactly the same when compared side by side.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t worth the price!  I really couldn&#x27;t tell any difference of taking them and not taking them!</li>
            <li> Helped keep up my energy</li>
            <li> Love it! Arrive on time!</li>
            <li> I do not notice the product accelerating any loss of weight.</li>
            <li> Work great when part of the 30 day weight loss program. Check out [...]</li>
            <li> Just starting taking them and so far so good</li>
            <li> The wife thinks they work, and the price is right with timely delivery.</li>
            <li> The Isagenix accelerator is perfect for me. It gives me an energy boost without making me jittery or jumpy. Really helps me through my workout and keeps me on track.</li>
            <li> Another stupid add on.</li>
            <li> I have been taking it to lose weight and it works,  but first you need to discuss it with your doctor</li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t seem to work for me</li>
            <li> did not work, waste of money!</li>
            <li> I like this. I am pretty sure it is helping even though I forget to take it twice a day sometimes. I am going to try and start remembering to take this twice a day and update my rating when I know for sure it helps more then just a little.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any real results. Disappointed</li>

            <li> The substance in this capsule looks, smells and taste very different from the one if bought from the Isagenix website. it does not seem to work either.</li>
            <li> Made no impact for me.</li>
            <li> I believe these are. Game changer. Wife and I statted P90X-3 8 months ago. We added isagenix supplements to the exercise. I&#x27;m down 14 and my wife has lost over 10 and gone down 2 dress sizes. When she started she was hot... Now she blows my mind.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy this product.  Feel that it gives me an energy boost.  Will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t lose any weight</li>
            <li> Suppresses appetite well but only works with the other supplements in the plan and daily workout.</li>
            <li> less expensive with prime and great products.</li>
            <li> I have been using these capsules along with drinking the French vanilla shake for over a year now.  Have dropped approx. 50lbs of unwanted weight using the combo, combined with a very healthy eating plan as well.  I can&#x27;t &amp;#34;prove&amp;#34; they work - also can&#x27;t prove that they don&#x27;t....  all I know is that I feel and look a whole lot better!!!  Only oddity I have noticed is that sometimes my urine smells a bit different. I have and plan to continue to recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a boost in energy of metabolism.  Would definitely see a rep if I was to pursue the Isagenix line.</li>
            <li> NOT MUCH OF AN ADVANTAGE USING THIS</li>
            <li> I used the product few years ago and I had great result!</li>
            <li> I did not notice any change. Perhaps product is not compatible with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li> For a long time, I couldn&#x27;t find anything to help me. Since starting this a few months ago, I have dropped 15 pounds and counting. It&#x27;s wonderful. No jitters too!  I love it, and will continue to use it. Honestly, it&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li> I bought this and the Berry powder cleanse as a cleanse on their own. I don&#x27;t think they work without the full Isagenix program. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great working all together but not on their own.</li>
            <li> these are great, not sure if they do what they claim but they do take away my appetite and that helps and gives me more energy and a better attitude....not sure what that&#x27;s about</li>
