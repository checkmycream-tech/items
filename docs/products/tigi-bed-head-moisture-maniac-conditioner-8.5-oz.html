    <ol>
            <li>What a great surprise!!!</li>
            <li>For a lower priced salon brand product, Moisture Maniac is an excellent choice.</li>
            <li>I have been very impressed with the permanent improvement in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>2 pumps and its a perfect amount for my hair.</li>
            <li>This is THE BEST conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to be returning this conditioner &amp; continue the hunt for the perfect moisturizing conditioner.</li>
            <li>This is the BEST CONDITIONER that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>The seller, however, was awesome and on time with delivery!</li>
            <li>VERY GOOD CONDITIONER.</li>
            <li>(It also doubles great for shaving and smells wonderful).</li>
            <li>my hair has never looked so good!</li>
            <li>The best part is it feels good too.</li>
            <li>beautiful product.</li>
            <li>I am really happy with this stuff, however Bed Head exaggerates</li>
            <li>I could tell over time, and with each shampoo that my hair texture and moisture level was improving greatly.</li>
            <li>Great conditioner.</li>
            <li>Oh my gosh, i honestly think that this is the best conditioner known to man..</li>
            <li>also it is great as a curl clumping agent.</li>
            <li>Works great and good price</li>
            <li>I bought the large bottle for 13 dollars or so from fragrance.net and it is excellent and it smells great!     </li>
            <li>IT MAKES YOUR HAIR FEEL REALLY GOOD</li>
            <li>Bed head makes great products, and this is my favorite conditioner of theirs.</li>
            <li>You will love it!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite conditioner of all times!</li>
            <li>I tried this conditioner, and it is AMAZING for my hair.</li>
            <li>, i just had to share my experience with this because it is simply amazing.</li>
            <li>Smells great too, which is almost just as important.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simply amazing.</li>
            <li>SO NICE</li>
            <li>I have went everywhere to find it and they never carry this kind.</li>
            <li>Really nice for my hair, and I love the smell of the product.  </li>
            <li>SMELLS GREAT, WORTH EVERY CENT.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and I will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li>I still use a clarifying shampoo and deep hydrating mask twice/week, but this is an excellent in between solution!</li>
            <li>LOVE these products, I will use NOTHING else on my hair.</li>
            <li>I asked for a refund and have not been able to get any return service on this order.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never looked so shiny and healthy than with the Moisture Maniac product line.</li>
            <li>Many products build up in your hair and make it greasy and unmanageable.</li>
            <li>It has saved my curls! :)</li>
            <li>This has been a family favorite for years.  </li>
            <li>it is ok and you can get it anywhere and save on sales and shipping</li>
            <li>price here at Amazon is the best anywhere, especially with the Subscribe and Save option.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for the better part of 20 years.  </li>
            <li>Try all of the different types to find the one that works the best for you.  </li>
            <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>YOU WILL LOVE IT TOO.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I could go through many bottles during a month.</li>
            <li>My $5 Pantene ProV leave in hair treatment is better than this conditioner that I paid $16 for.</li>
            <li>but when I wash it out my hair feels even more destroyed.</li>
            <li>I was introduced to this product and fell in love.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but JUST ok and nothing more.</li>
            <li>It would probably work a lot better on someone with a looser curl pattern, just didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m reminded how much I love it whenever I travel and don&#x27;t lug any conditioner with me and end up using the hotel provided stuff.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s too hot will strip all the good stuff away.  </li>
            <li>i find that it does this best on my dry hair though.</li>
            <li>After years of hating my hair, I actually enjoy looking at and touching it.</li>
            <li>For the first time that I can remember, i LOVE the feel of my hair, it is just like silk!</li>
            <li>Leave on for 2-3 mins, rinse and comb thru EASILY.</li>
            <li>This is the best way to get it hands down.</li>
            <li>It always leaves my hair smooth.</li>
            <li>A tiny dab of it scrunched into the ends of my hair looks and feels great as a leave in conditioner on the days</li>
            <li>but it is worth every drop!</li>
            <li>Now don&#x27;t get excited and buy the shampoo too...</li>
            <li>If you use this product I would recommend either using a good hair scrub  at lease weekly or use it one week on one week off(use a different product line)</li>
            <li>finally it is good for slicking the hair back.</li>
            <li>For me it&#x27;s too sweet.</li>
            <li>Got my item quickly and all in tact.  </li>
            <li>Best conditioner I&#x27;ve found for long hair that likes to tangle easily and is dry from coloring and swimming - recommended!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair smooth soft and shiny, and doesn&#x27;t fade my bright copper red.</li>
            <li>I bought this along with bed head self absorbed shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair dresser asked me what I use on my hair because of how soft and healthy it looks.  </li>
            <li>I have never reviewed a hair care product because i had never used one that was worth raving about</li>
            <li>I leave it in for the right amount of time</li>
            <li>and I must say that the first time I used it, it seemed like I had to use alot to really get my hair detangled and smooth feeling.</li>
            <li>I have fought with damaged dry hair for many years, and this has ended the fight!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get 3 times more shampoo and conditioner for the same exact price!</li>
            <li>if i rake it in and let it dry my hair becomes wonderfully defined curls,something i could not do with other conditioners as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy, smells very nice, and keeps the entire family&#x27;s hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Try it once, you won&#x27;t want to go back  :)</li>
            <li>Trust me on this one, I know conditioner, and the real Bed Head Moisture Maniac is the bomb!</li>
            <li>But after letting this set in my hair for 1-2 minutes in the shower and really working it into my curls, I can run my fingers through my hair with ease and the tangles will come undone without damaging my hair!</li>
            <li>While we might use different shampoos, this conditioner is something we always have available in our home!</li>
            <li>The first time i used this, i had to use a lot.</li>
            <li>So I will be ordering again very soon!</li>
            <li>and I was having to use a good amount of leave in treatment everyday.</li>
            <li>Nice scent, and definitely leaves your hair very soft.</li>
            <li>And I used a great variety of products - many of which were expensive, highly rated by others, and raved about on curly hair styling websites.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner that I been been using regularly before this was double the price with not as good results.</li>
            <li>First of all you don&#x27;t need much to receive the moisture from this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried cheaper conditioners and nothing else gives the same combination of easy manageability and</li>
            <li>This combined with the Moisture Maniac is a great solution to my thin hair.  </li>
            <li>It appears Ladies, that this is a knockoff, close but not the real product.  </li>
            <li>did&#x27;nt work as well as the real stuff.</li>
            <li>And very shiney.  </li>
            <li>came fast.</li>
            <li>when i would use cheapies like v05,suave or herbal essences i would have to pack so much conditioner on my hair just to get it feeling moisturized</li>
            <li>i just pull back my hair and smooth about a pump of conditioner and my hair becomes shiny and wavy as if i had slicked it with gel.</li>
            <li>The thing that bothers me about this is that it doesn&#x27;t have much slip at all.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t figure out if that means I&#x27;m using too much or what.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing and smells like mango.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price by far...</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t know that it does much better than other conditioners for me.  </li>
            <li>I ALWAYS had to use a leave-in detangler after conditioning just to brush or comb through my long, fine, and processed hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Shampoo is also fantastic - none of that stiff, waxy feel on my hair -just shiny, smooth, and very soft, touchable.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally review products, but I have to leave a review for this conditioner.</li>
            <li>The shed hair knots at the end of a few strands of healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s products (humorous marketing tactic?), so this is not the ultimate cure for dry hair.  </li>
            <li>hair is extremely dry on the ends and tangles easily, yet I need no other conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have long, bleached and bright pink colored hair, and use a straightening iron daily.</li>
            <li>I love this product because I live in a very dry climate and have very curly hair- which can easily dry out and become damanged or break.  </li>
            <li>My stylist recommended this product after checking out my super dry hair.</li>
            <li>Prior to using this for the first time (introduced by my stylist)</li>
            <li>I love the TIGI products, and when ye ol&#x27; Walmart started carrying it, I bought a small bottle to try.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not good to use over time as it will cause build-up, but is great for when your hair is very dry.</li>
            <li>maybe....the lack of slippage is important when you&#x27;re talking about black hair.</li>
            <li>The dry winter weather and heat and sun in the summer just ruin my hair, so I need a daily shampoo and conditioner that actually keeps my hair healthy.  </li>
            <li>I have temporarily tried other conditioners in order to see if theres &amp;#34;something better&amp;#34; and I very quickly change back every time.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft, shiny and resilient.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say enough about this product, and I hope TIGI keeps it around forever!</li>
            <li>All of them do different things FOR REAL.  </li>
            <li>Moisture Maniac kept it feeling soft.</li>
            <li>This is the ONE that finally feels like it is really conditioning my hair.  </li>
            <li>A cosmetologist friend of mine once told me &amp;#34;Cheap shampoo, expensive conditioner,&amp;#34; and I&#x27;ve found that to be good advice.  </li>
            <li>I tried this after reading reviews here because I was hunting for something really hydrating/moisturinzing and detangling for my dry hair.  </li>
            <li>This worked better on my hair than Dumb Blond.  </li>
            <li>i have thrown out all my old conditioner and gels and i only use this along with kids organics moisturizer!</li>
            <li>This conditioner is one of the few products that I have found is able to keep my hair hydrated without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>I am African American with natural 4A/4B hair and this conditioner moisturize and detangles my hair effortlessly.  </li>
            <li>I recently moved from a very dry state to a very humid one - my VERY thick and VERY curly hair (I&#x27;m part Hispanic) was so frizzy and absolutely parched every day no matter which products I used.</li>
            <li>It also leaves my hair hydrated and VERY soft - sometimes my curls are a little more on the fluffy side, but that&#x27;s nothing a little styling can&#x27;t fix!</li>

            <li> This combined with the Moisture Maniac is a great solution to my thin hair.  </li>
            <li> It appears Ladies, that this is a knockoff, close but not the real product.  </li>
            <li> did&#x27;nt work as well as the real stuff.</li>
            <li> And very shiney.  </li>
            <li> came fast.</li>
            <li> when i would use cheapies like v05,suave or herbal essences i would have to pack so much conditioner on my hair just to get it feeling moisturized</li>
            <li> i just pull back my hair and smooth about a pump of conditioner and my hair becomes shiny and wavy as if i had slicked it with gel.</li>
            <li> The thing that bothers me about this is that it doesn&#x27;t have much slip at all.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t figure out if that means I&#x27;m using too much or what.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing and smells like mango.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price by far...</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t know that it does much better than other conditioners for me.  </li>
            <li> I ALWAYS had to use a leave-in detangler after conditioning just to brush or comb through my long, fine, and processed hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Shampoo is also fantastic - none of that stiff, waxy feel on my hair -just shiny, smooth, and very soft, touchable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally review products, but I have to leave a review for this conditioner.</li>
            <li> The shed hair knots at the end of a few strands of healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s products (humorous marketing tactic?), so this is not the ultimate cure for dry hair.  </li>
            <li> hair is extremely dry on the ends and tangles easily, yet I need no other conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have long, bleached and bright pink colored hair, and use a straightening iron daily.</li>
            <li> I love this product because I live in a very dry climate and have very curly hair- which can easily dry out and become damanged or break.  </li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this product after checking out my super dry hair.</li>
            <li> Prior to using this for the first time (introduced by my stylist)</li>
            <li> I love the TIGI products, and when ye ol&#x27; Walmart started carrying it, I bought a small bottle to try.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not good to use over time as it will cause build-up, but is great for when your hair is very dry.</li>
            <li> maybe....the lack of slippage is important when you&#x27;re talking about black hair.</li>
            <li> The dry winter weather and heat and sun in the summer just ruin my hair, so I need a daily shampoo and conditioner that actually keeps my hair healthy.  </li>
            <li> I have temporarily tried other conditioners in order to see if theres &amp;#34;something better&amp;#34; and I very quickly change back every time.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft, shiny and resilient.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say enough about this product, and I hope TIGI keeps it around forever!</li>
            <li> All of them do different things FOR REAL.  </li>
            <li> Moisture Maniac kept it feeling soft.</li>
            <li> This is the ONE that finally feels like it is really conditioning my hair.  </li>
            <li> A cosmetologist friend of mine once told me &amp;#34;Cheap shampoo, expensive conditioner,&amp;#34; and I&#x27;ve found that to be good advice.  </li>
            <li> I tried this after reading reviews here because I was hunting for something really hydrating/moisturinzing and detangling for my dry hair.  </li>
            <li> This worked better on my hair than Dumb Blond.  </li>
            <li> i have thrown out all my old conditioner and gels and i only use this along with kids organics moisturizer!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is one of the few products that I have found is able to keep my hair hydrated without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I am African American with natural 4A/4B hair and this conditioner moisturize and detangles my hair effortlessly.  </li>
            <li> I recently moved from a very dry state to a very humid one - my VERY thick and VERY curly hair (I&#x27;m part Hispanic) was so frizzy and absolutely parched every day no matter which products I used.</li>
            <li> It also leaves my hair hydrated and VERY soft - sometimes my curls are a little more on the fluffy side, but that&#x27;s nothing a little styling can&#x27;t fix!</li>
            <li> Although I have yet to figure out how to completely tame the frizz (I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s possible with humidity), my hair remains very soft, and is not dry, using this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> The results are long lasting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not funny to have messy, hard to comb hair more often than without using it.</li>
            <li> (my hair is not super dry, just &#x27;normal&#x27; dry for curly hair???</li>
            <li> Even other conditioners in the Bed Head line have left my long blonde locks feeling and looking like straw.  </li>
            <li> so long as I use a coolish water rinse.  </li>
            <li> Since I have very curly and thick hair</li>
            <li> This is indeed expensive conditioner, but if you have long hair (especially if it&#x27;s not stick-straight), it&#x27;s completely worth it.  </li>
            <li> My hair had been a bit damaged and dry</li>
            <li> My hair is no longer feeling dry.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely dry hair.</li>
            <li> I 100% recommend this product for anyone with dry hair.</li>
            <li> It has never left my hair heavy or greasy, even after using it for months, and putting the extra bit on my hair after getting out of the shower.</li>
            <li> BedHead is prefect for hair that is dyed and REAL dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long, thick, curly, and blonde.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have used only Bed Head moisture maniac shampoo and conditioner for the past 7 years.  </li>
            <li> When you rinse it out, you are not rinsing out the conditioning qualities as with some other conditioners.</li>
            <li> I use a color depositing shampoo, and it doesn&#x27;t strip it out like other conditioners did.</li>
            <li> it rinses out with tons of bubbles compared to other conditioners.</li>
            <li> Each time after, i could use less and less and noticed that this was giving me long term and continuous results!</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair</li>
            <li> I HAVE THICK WAVY COARSE HAIR</li>
            <li> Each time after that though, I used less and less.</li>
            <li> So if a coily hair sheds from my scalp while conditioning my hair it WILL not slip down past the other hairs and out of my head.</li>
            <li> Plus when i would wash the others out my hair would feel dried out.</li>
            <li> It  makes my hair heavy and limp.</li>
            <li> I see few benefits when using it.</li>
            <li> it literally takes about a quarter sized amount(or less) per section to make the hair feel conditioned!     </li>
            <li> My whole life it has been nearly impossible to have shinny moisturized hair.</li>
            <li> Though I usually change up my shampoo</li>
            <li> Doing so would leave it a dull frizzy mass of hair.    </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very hard on it (</li>
            <li> Man I am so sad/confused to read all the positive reviews because this conditioner is just so horrible.</li>
            <li> Its a bit on the expensive side</li>
            <li> But my hair clumping up at the wrong time</li>
            <li> I stopped using it because it had horrible buildup which led to my hair being greasy and weighed down.</li>
            <li> I am so afraid that the company will either stop making it, or change the formula.  </li>
            <li> If youve given up hope of ever having silk like hair, try this..you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> the shampoo is awful, I wouldn&#x27;t take it if someone was giving it away</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works great and good price</li>
            <li> I love this product because I live in a very dry climate and have very curly hair- which can easily dry out and become damanged or break.  This conditioner is one of the few products that I have found is able to keep my hair hydrated without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I cannot do without this conditioner! Prior to using this for the first time (introduced by my stylist) I ALWAYS had to use a leave-in detangler after conditioning just to brush or comb through my long, fine, and processed hair.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is extremely dry on the ends and tangles easily, yet I need no other conditioner. Leave on for 2-3 mins, rinse and comb thru EASILY. (It also doubles great for shaving and smells wonderful). The Shampoo is also fantastic - none of that stiff, waxy feel on my hair -just shiny, smooth, and very soft, touchable. After years of hating my hair, I actually enjoy looking at and touching it.</li>
            <li> I used to used the moisture manic shampoo and conditioner.  I stopped using it because it had horrible buildup which led to my hair being greasy and weighed down. If you use this product I would recommend either using a good hair scrub  at lease weekly or use it one week on one week off(use a different product line)</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this conditioner.  I am African American with natural 4A/4B hair and this conditioner moisturize and detangles my hair effortlessly.  It smells wonderful and I will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> BedHead is prefect for hair that is dyed and REAL dry. I had purchased it two years ago and when I ran out of my regular conditioner ;I used it as a last resort. What a great surprise!!! It makes my hair soft, shiny and resilient. This is the best way to get it hands down.</li>
            <li> This combined with the Moisture Maniac is a great solution to my thin hair.  The dry winter weather and heat and sun in the summer just ruin my hair, so I need a daily shampoo and conditioner that actually keeps my hair healthy.  I am really happy with this stuff, however Bed Head exaggerates it&#x27;s products (humorous marketing tactic?), so this is not the ultimate cure for dry hair.  I still use a clarifying shampoo and deep hydrating mask twice/week, but this is an excellent in between solution!</li>
            <li> I have used only Bed Head moisture maniac shampoo and conditioner for the past 7 years.  LOVE these products, I will use NOTHING else on my hair. Try it once, you won&#x27;t want to go back  :)</li>
            <li> If I had known I was going to receive this stuff I would have paid the in salon price that I was trying to avoid.  It appears Ladies, that this is a knockoff, close but not the real product.  It does not have the same scent or bottle labeling and it did&#x27;nt work as well as the real stuff. And I would guess all of the products from this merchant are the same.  Trust me on this one, I know conditioner, and the real Bed Head Moisture Maniac is the bomb! This is not even a runner up. I asked for a refund and have not been able to get any return service on this order.  So i will contact my credit card company and request a refund.  These days, I am just not having it.</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this product after checking out my super dry hair. I have always been open to using any brand whether that be salon brands or grocery store brands. I have tried everything from Pantene to Redken to Matrix and nothing has worked for me. My hair has never looked so shiny and healthy than with the Moisture Maniac product line. The best part is it feels good too. Many products build up in your hair and make it greasy and unmanageable. This product works. Get it! You will love it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally review products, but I have to leave a review for this conditioner. I recently moved from a very dry state to a very humid one - my VERY thick and VERY curly hair (I&#x27;m part Hispanic) was so frizzy and absolutely parched every day no matter which products I used. And I used a great variety of products - many of which were expensive, highly rated by others, and raved about on curly hair styling websites. Nothing seemed to be working, and I was so discouraged. I tried this conditioner, and it is AMAZING for my hair. Everyone is so different - I understand that what works for me may not work for you, but this stuff is wondrous for my curls! I used to have to wrestle with my tangles - trying to get them undone with every type of technique and product. But after letting this set in my hair for 1-2 minutes in the shower and really working it into my curls, I can run my fingers through my hair with ease and the tangles will come undone without damaging my hair! It also leaves my hair hydrated and VERY soft - sometimes my curls are a little more on the fluffy side, but that&#x27;s nothing a little styling can&#x27;t fix! I really can&#x27;t say enough about this product, and I hope TIGI keeps it around forever! It has saved my curls! :)</li>
            <li> This has been a family favorite for years.  While we might use different shampoos, this conditioner is something we always have available in our home!</li>
            <li> it is ok and you can get it anywhere and save on sales and shipping</li>
            <li> My hair had been a bit damaged and dry and I was having to use a good amount of leave in treatment everyday. I bought this conditioner and I must say that the first time I used it, it seemed like I had to use alot to really get my hair detangled and smooth feeling. Each time after that though, I used less and less. I could tell over time, and with each shampoo that my hair texture and moisture level was improving greatly. This conditioner definitely moisturizes and improves the quality and texture of your hair. The results are long lasting. When you rinse it out, you are not rinsing out the conditioning qualities as with some other conditioners. For a lower priced salon brand product, Moisture Maniac is an excellent choice. I have been very impressed with the permanent improvement in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price here at Amazon is the best anywhere, especially with the Subscribe and Save option. I will continue to purchase this conditioner (and the matching shampoo). The shampoo and conditioner that I been been using regularly before this was double the price with not as good results.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner. I bought this along with bed head self absorbed shampoo. It always leaves my hair smooth. I like the pump. 2 pumps and its a perfect amount for my hair. I definitely recommend this conditioner</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the better part of 20 years.  It&#x27;s not too heavy, smells very nice, and keeps the entire family&#x27;s hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I love the TIGI products, and when ye ol&#x27; Walmart started carrying it, I bought a small bottle to try.  This worked better on my hair than Dumb Blond.  It has a lighter scent and didn&#x27;t over condition my hair.  I have color treated hair, and I fried part of it.  This made even the fried part bouncy.  Bouncy!!  And very shiney.  Try all of the different types to find the one that works the best for you.  All of them do different things FOR REAL.  And try to catch them when they go on sale.  Get several of the ones you like then.</li>
            <li> beautiful product. came fast.</li>
            <li> Why not buy this product from Amazon instead of the grocery store?  You&#x27;ll get 3 times more shampoo and conditioner for the same exact price!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  IT MAKES YOUR HAIR FEEL REALLY GOOD AND IT SMELLS SO NICE TOO. YOU WILL LOVE IT TOO.</li>
            <li> This is a 5+ review.  This is THE BEST conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  I am so afraid that the company will either stop making it, or change the formula.  I have curly hair, so I have to battle not only dryness (my hair is not super dry, just &#x27;normal&#x27; dry for curly hair??? I don&#x27;t know how to describe it), but also humidity.  Although I have yet to figure out how to completely tame the frizz (I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s possible with humidity), my hair remains very soft, and is not dry, using this conditioner.  My hair dresser asked me what I use on my hair because of how soft and healthy it looks.  She thought I was using some sort of hair serum, and wanted to know what it was.  No hair product, or serum, just this conditioner.  After I get out of the shower, instead of putting hair products in my hair (trying to avoid the alcohols), I put a TINY bit of the conditioner on my hair, especially on the ends, as an added &#x27;layer&#x27; of protection against the frizz.  It has never left my hair heavy or greasy, even after using it for months, and putting the extra bit on my hair after getting out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Bed head makes great products, and this is my favorite conditioner of theirs. I have thick, coarse hair and I&#x27;m very hard on it (Japanese straightening twice a year, copper red dye once a month, blow dryers, straightening, curling, the works). This conditioner saves me! It makes my hair smooth soft and shiny, and doesn&#x27;t fade my bright copper red. I use a color depositing shampoo, and it doesn&#x27;t strip it out like other conditioners did. Love it.</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh, i honestly think that this is the best conditioner known to man..and ive probably TRIED every conditioner known to man! I have long, bleached and bright pink colored hair, and use a straightening iron daily. I have fought with damaged dry hair for many years, and this has ended the fight! For the first time that I can remember, i LOVE the feel of my hair, it is just like silk! The first time i used this, i had to use a lot. Each time after, i could use less and less and noticed that this was giving me long term and continuous results! I have never reviewed a hair care product because i had never used one that was worth raving about, i just had to share my experience with this because it is simply amazing. If youve given up hope of ever having silk like hair, try this..you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This has been my go-to conditioner for years.  Though I usually change up my shampoo this remains in my arsenal.  I have temporarily tried other conditioners in order to see if theres &amp;#34;something better&amp;#34; and I very quickly change back every time.  Even other conditioners in the Bed Head line have left my long blonde locks feeling and looking like straw.  Smells great too, which is almost just as important.</li>
            <li> Got my item quickly and all in tact.  This is my favorite conditioner of all times!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is the bomb! Its a bit on the expensive side but it is worth every drop! I bought the large bottle for 13 dollars or so from fragrance.net and it is excellent and it smells great!     First of all you don&#x27;t need much to receive the moisture from this product. Since I have very curly and thick hair i wash it in 5 sections. it literally takes about a quarter sized amount(or less) per section to make the hair feel conditioned!     when i would use cheapies like v05,suave or herbal essences i would have to pack so much conditioner on my hair just to get it feeling moisturized I could go through many bottles during a month. Plus when i would wash the others out my hair would feel dried out. Moisture Maniac kept it feeling soft. i like to leave in a bit of it in my hair because of this.     also it is great as a curl clumping agent. if i rake it in and let it dry my hair becomes wonderfully defined curls,something i could not do with other conditioners as well. Doing so would leave it a dull frizzy mass of hair.    finally it is good for slicking the hair back. i find that it does this best on my dry hair though. i just pull back my hair and smooth about a pump of conditioner and my hair becomes shiny and wavy as if i had slicked it with gel. This stuff is a keeper. i have thrown out all my old conditioner and gels and i only use this along with kids organics moisturizer! my hair has never looked so good!</li>
            <li> My hair still was still moisturized days later!!</li>
            <li> Best conditioner I&#x27;ve found for long hair that likes to tangle easily and is dry from coloring and swimming - recommended!</li>
            <li> A cosmetologist friend of mine once told me &amp;#34;Cheap shampoo, expensive conditioner,&amp;#34; and I&#x27;ve found that to be good advice.  This is indeed expensive conditioner, but if you have long hair (especially if it&#x27;s not stick-straight), it&#x27;s completely worth it.  I&#x27;ve tried cheaper conditioners and nothing else gives the same combination of easy manageability and *not* looking like my hair is already greasy/dirty by the time it dries.</li>
            <li> As a rinse out conditioner:  It softens my hair. There&#x27;s no doubt. But I don&#x27;t know that it does much better than other conditioners for me.  The thing that bothers me about this is that it doesn&#x27;t have much slip at all.  So if a coily hair sheds from my scalp while conditioning my hair it WILL not slip down past the other hairs and out of my head. The shed hair knots at the end of a few strands of healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve learned not to panic and just leave it until I&#x27;m putting my aloe spray and leave in conditioner.  The shed hair will loosen up and fall away later. But my hair clumping up at the wrong time sans slip is problematic to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it rinses out with tons of bubbles compared to other conditioners. I can&#x27;t figure out if that means I&#x27;m using too much or what.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I do like how it leaves my hair feeling....so long as I use a coolish water rinse.  Water that&#x27;s too hot will strip all the good stuff away.  I&#x27;d give a 3.5 if I could....maybe....the lack of slippage is important when you&#x27;re talking about black hair.</li>
            <li> Man I am so sad/confused to read all the positive reviews because this conditioner is just so horrible. My $5 Pantene ProV leave in hair treatment is better than this conditioner that I paid $16 for. I leave it in for the right amount of time but when I wash it out my hair feels even more destroyed. I&#x27;m going to be returning this conditioner &amp; continue the hunt for the perfect moisturizing conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST CONDITIONER that I&#x27;ve ever used. It detangles my shoulder length curly African American hair (3b) effortlessly and in minutes! It&#x27;s very moisturizing and smells like mango. Well worth the price by far...nothing compares to it&#x27;s conditioning power. Some friends tried it while visiting and all 3 switched to this brand. A little goes a long way. Now don&#x27;t get excited and buy the shampoo too...the shampoo is awful, I wouldn&#x27;t take it if someone was giving it away but this conditioner is the TRUTH!</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product and fell in love. I have went everywhere to find it and they never carry this kind. So I will be ordering again very soon!</li>
            <li> Nice scent, and definitely leaves your hair very soft. Sometimes you can find it on sale in a value pack. It&#x27;s not good to use over time as it will cause build-up, but is great for when your hair is very dry.</li>
            <li> I am an African American woman with course 4b hair, growing out my relaxer. I came across this product because of a youtube video that suggested it for a twa. It&#x27;s ok, but JUST ok and nothing more. It would probably work a lot better on someone with a looser curl pattern, just didn&#x27;t do anything for me. The seller, however, was awesome and on time with delivery!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell. For me it&#x27;s too sweet. It  makes my hair heavy and limp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not funny to have messy, hard to comb hair more often than without using it. I see few benefits when using it.</li>
            <li> Really nice for my hair, and I love the smell of the product.  I don&#x27;t rinse it entirely out, and it makes my hair moist and tangle-free without being greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I tried this after reading reviews here because I was hunting for something really hydrating/moisturinzing and detangling for my dry hair.  This is the ONE that finally feels like it is really conditioning my hair.  I&#x27;m reminded how much I love it whenever I travel and don&#x27;t lug any conditioner with me and end up using the hotel provided stuff.  Nothing else is as softening or detangling. My hair is no longer feeling dry.  A tiny dab of it scrunched into the ends of my hair looks and feels great as a leave in conditioner on the days I don&#x27;t wash my hair.  I like this product a lot!</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry hair. It&#x27;s long, thick, curly, and blonde. My whole life it has been nearly impossible to have shinny moisturized hair. When I started using this conditioner it all changed! It&#x27;s simply amazing. I 100% recommend this product for anyone with dry hair.</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD CONDITIONER. I HAVE THICK WAVY COARSE HAIR AND THIS TAMES IT BIG TIME.  SMELLS GREAT, WORTH EVERY CENT.</li>
