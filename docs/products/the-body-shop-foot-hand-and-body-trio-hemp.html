            <li>I absolutely love the hemp line from the Body Shop and was so thrilled to see this on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Pretty great deal IMO</li>

            <li>most prizes</li>

            <li>Love all the products.  </li>
            <li>Will buy more for sure.</li>
            <li>I love this hand cream.  </li>
            <li>The lotions are all wonderful and extra moisturizing but leave no greasy feel.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, though earthy, patchouli-like.</li>
            <li>Very rich and moisturizing to the skin.  </li>
            <li>He loved it and the scent is really great…I love it.</li>
            <li>Overall very good product.</li>
            <li>The lotion alone cost this much at most places, &amp; the tin is pretty rad too!</li>
            <li>I enjoy it though.</li>
            <li>these would make great gifts and they come in a nice heavy duty quality tin.</li>
            <li>The tin it comes in is super cool &amp; nifty!</li>
            <li>in quality wise, I have drye skin that can sometimes be flaky if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
            <li>The Hemp Hand Protector is by far the best product I have found for my dry hands.</li>
            <li>well worth it</li>
            <li>It makes my skin look cleaner and fresh.</li>
            <li>The Hand Protector cream is quickly absorbed.  </li>
            <li>The body butter is okay, but I keep coming back for the hand cream.</li>
            <li>First of all let me disclose that I had to return the first trio I got because it was rancid.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but my second favorite was the foot cream.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to buy some more of that in a larger container.  </li>
            <li>Great scrub, have purchased multiple times before, highly recommend and would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The second one was just fine</li>
            <li>so I really don&#x27;t mind paying $20 each time I do so.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so bvery much</li>
            <li>but I did end up adding aromatic oils to the body butter because&lt;br /&gt;the smells was just too much for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a very distinct smell, similar to patchouli</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to describe but think earthy and healthy.</li>
            <li>this comes with other goodies for the same price as buying the hand cream at full price at the store.  </li>
            <li>once this was opened on Christmas day, everyone was fighting over who would get to keep the really cool green tin.</li>
            <li>it super soft after this long hard winter.</li>
            <li>It has a very natural and herbal smell but it moisturizes my hands like none other.</li>

            <li> I would not expect this for a product over one year old, much less five or ten years!</li>
            <li> I had a feet problem for a long time.</li>
            <li> no old, off rancid smell, no separation!</li>
            <li> and it works awesomely fr dry hands.</li>
            <li> it is labeled for very dry skin</li>
            <li> I have a tube of the hand protector that is at least 10 years old, and it smells / works as well as it did when I bought it -</li>
            <li> The little lotions were half empty..</li>
            <li> The heels of my feet had small cuts, no matter what I applied nothing worked.</li>
            <li> My hands were red and raw from the severe cold this year and this product did the trick.  </li>
            <li> would definitely recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s struggling with the cold and the toll it takes on your skin!</li>
            <li> The tin IS cool,...but not nearly as impressive as the products.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> The little lotions were half empty..</li>
            <li> Saw this and purchased as a gift for a &amp;#34;hippie&amp;#34; type. She loved it and the lotions smell great!  Shipping was fast and was a great deal for the money.</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for my sis, she loved it. It smells great, most prizes well and the nice tin box has been put to great use. Overall very good product.</li>
            <li> once this was opened on Christmas day, everyone was fighting over who would get to keep the really cool green tin.</li>
            <li> This is great and for the price well worth it I recently discovered the hemp hand protector i use it all over even my face it super soft after this long hard winter. I will be purchasing more of these and some for each of my family members these would make great gifts and they come in a nice heavy duty quality tin.</li>
            <li> The Hemp hand lotion alone is 20, so for 20 you get a get to store stuff in and then some body butter and some foot protector. Pretty great deal IMO and it works awesomely fr dry hands.</li>
            <li> Has a very nice gift box&lt;br /&gt;But you cannot use it as a gift&lt;br /&gt;As it is labeled for very dry skin</li>
            <li> I had a feet problem for a long time. The heels of my feet had small cuts, no matter what I applied nothing worked. I applied the hemp cream and in 2 days my feet started healing, also the pain of the cuts went away instantly. I love this product and will buy it again, and again. The seller is amazing!!!. The price is very cheap too!!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!! Will be buying more asap.</li>
            <li> Love the tin box this came in.  Love all the products.  Very rich and moisturizing to the skin.  Will buy more for sure.</li>
            <li> Amazing product and very cheap too!!!</li>
            <li> I love this hand cream.  I buy a tube and it lasts about a year so I really don&#x27;t mind paying $20 each time I do so.  Bonus: this comes with other goodies for the same price as buying the hand cream at full price at the store.  The body butter is okay, but I keep coming back for the hand cream.</li>
            <li> Gave as a christmas gift the recipient loved it! Smelled great and the packaging was attractive. Thanks so bvery much</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for someone and they absolutely loved it. The tin it comes in is super cool &amp; nifty! The lotions are all wonderful and extra moisturizing but leave no greasy feel. The scent may be a deal breaker for some people. It&#x27;s hard to describe but think earthy and healthy. I enjoy it though.</li>
            <li> Great scrub, have purchased multiple times before, highly recommend and would definitely purchase again.It makes my skin look cleaner and fresh.</li>
            <li> Hand cream is the best. I do not care for the foot or body.</li>
            <li> Great value, if you love the product. It has a very distinct smell, similar to patchouli so if you don&#x27;t like that smell, avoid this product. But its a great value compared to the price in the stores.</li>
            <li> The Hemp Hand Protector is by far the best product I have found for my dry hands. The body butter and foot protector are just an awesome bonus. The lotion alone cost this much at most places, &amp; the tin is pretty rad too! This is the best deal I have found on the best product in my opinion. I love it!</li>

These&lt;br /&gt;products work expremely well!</li>
            <li> I love this product from Body Shop! This was a great value - I bought two of them - one for a gift, one for me, but now, I am considering to keep both for myself! I have a tube of the hand protector that is at least 10 years old, and it smells / works as well as it did when I bought it - no old, off rancid smell, no separation! I would not expect this for a product over one year old, much less five or ten years! I love the smell, though earthy, patchouli-like. There is also a body and foot application, in addition to the hand, so I have tried two more in this line of awesomeness!</li>
            <li> The tin IS cool,...but not nearly as impressive as the products.  The Hand Protector cream is quickly absorbed.  But you can tell it&#x27;s still doing it&#x27;s job.  My hands were red and raw from the severe cold this year and this product did the trick.  Also it&#x27;s kind of a huge tube!  The Body Butter is also great,...but my second favorite was the foot cream.  I&#x27;ll have to buy some more of that in a larger container.  But this set was perfect in allowing me to try everything!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s struggling with the cold and the toll it takes on your skin!</li>
            <li> What a great gift for my husband. He loved it and the scent is really great…I love it. This was an amazing price.</li>
            <li> Best lotion on the market</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the hemp line from the Body Shop and was so thrilled to see this on Amazon. It is a great deal, the shipping speed was incredible and the products are wonderful. The hand creme is especially wonderful. It has a very natural and herbal smell but it moisturizes my hands like none other. Definitely recommend this product!</li>
