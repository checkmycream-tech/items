            <li>First introduced to it on a Disney cruise</li>
            <li>but overall I&#x27;ve used much better shampoo.</li>

            <li>Hair is clean soft and shiny&lt;</li>
            <li>Came fast, makes me think nim still on the Alaska Disney Member Cruise.</li>
            <li>But the $15.95 shipping charge was way too much.  </li>

            <li>wash my hair everyday and find this shampoo is gentle to my hair but effectively cleans my hair of&lt;br /&gt;hair spray residue.  </li>
            <li>I, too, tried this at a hotel many years ago (in 2006, to be exact) and vowed to hunt it down afterward.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to stumble upon an H2O+ store in San Francisco on a biz trip and picked up some more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have a decent smell</li>

            <li>The price is a lot more than what I&#x27;m used to paying for a bottle of shampoo, but a little drop goes a long way and the smell and feel of my hair is worth every penny.</li>

            <li>I was first introduced to it while taking a Disney Wonder cruise in 2007, but it wasn&#x27;t until last year that I sought it out online and bought a bottle.</li>
            <li>I leaves my hair clean and full (and I have thin hair), and the smell is the best1</li>

            <li>This shampoo leaves hair soft and does not leave a buildup.</li>
            <li>A little bit pricey, but it&#x27;s thick enough to where you don&#x27;t need to use too much and it smells amazing!</li>

            <li> Pretty expensive but really works well.  </li>
            <li> When we were at Disney they had the H2O2 shampoo in the room and it was great, so when I got home I ordered it, but was confused when I seen it in a green bottle the Disney was in a white bottle, but very small</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, as long as the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t reduce their product to 3 oz.</li>

            <li> It does not feel and a little bit of shampoo goes a long way.</li>
            <li> There are other types and scents but we have not tried those.</li>
            <li> Alas, I don&#x27;t actually live in SF.</li>
            <li> I actually water it down a little because it is so thick.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the only shampoo I found that doesn&#x27;t give me angry red bumps on my scalp and hair line</li>
            <li> Thick shampoo - a little goes a long way and lathers well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems to strip moisture a little</li>
            <li> the product was green</li>
            <li> My daughter has a very thick hair that tangles after being washed.</li>
            <li> and I never get tired of it!  </li>
            <li> The smell makes you feel like you are in an expensive salon getting a hair treatment !!!</li>

            <li> I, too, tried this at a hotel many years ago (in 2006, to be exact) and vowed to hunt it down afterward. I was pleasantly surprised to stumble upon an H2O+ store in San Francisco on a biz trip and picked up some more. Alas, I don&#x27;t actually live in SF. Amazon to the rescue! Worth it to pay the shipping and have it delivered. I *LOVE* this shampoo and it keeps my hair shiny and healthy, even when it&#x27;s color-treated. Get the matching conditioner!</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and it cleans my hair completely without stripping my color. A fan forever.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok shampoo in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to strip moisture a little but it does clean.&lt;br /&gt;It does have a decent smell but overall I&#x27;ve used much better shampoo.</li>
            <li> Tried this product on a recent Disney Cruise.  It was as amazing as the cruise.  Just another touch of class provided by Disney.  Love the texture and fragrance and the way it left my hair feeling.  Amazing product and so happy it is available on Amazon as I have been searching for it locally.</li>
            <li> Nice scent and good lather.  Overall a very good shampoo.  A bit pricey, however.</li>
            <li> I first used this shampoo on a Disney Cruise.  I feel in love with it and have been using it ever since.&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hair everyday and find this shampoo is gentle to my hair but effectively cleans my hair of&lt;br /&gt;hair spray residue.  I highly recommend this product.  It lasts a long time and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I was first introduced to it while taking a Disney Wonder cruise in 2007, but it wasn&#x27;t until last year that I sought it out online and bought a bottle. Im hooked now. Not only does it leave my hair feeling better than any other shampoo I have used, but the awesome smell of this stuff instantly brings me back to beng aboard our unforgettable Disney cruise. The price is a lot more than what I&#x27;m used to paying for a bottle of shampoo, but a little drop goes a long way and the smell and feel of my hair is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific product. It is the same shampoo that  is provided to guests at a 5 star hotel (name withheld)</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. I have really oily hair and this shampoo makes it feel so clean without drying it out! I first bought this at Kohls but was happy to find it for the same price on Amazon but don&#x27;t have to drive the 2 hours to the closest Kohls!</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells wonderful</li>
            <li> Disney Cruise Lines introduced us to H2O.  We bought a bottle last cruise but needed the shampoo before our next cruise. Love shampoo, conditioner, and bath products. Smells great too!</li>
            <li> One of the best shampoos I have ever used</li>
            <li> Excellent shampoo, make you hair stronger and looks better.</li>
            <li> This shampoo was on our Disney cruise and I fell in love with it. Glad I found it on Amazon at such a low price and with my Amazon Chase points I get additional discounts.</li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves hair soft and does not leave a buildup. It is not harsh either, I really like it. Because it is concentrate, it will last longer.</li>
            <li> My daughter has a very thick hair that tangles after being washed. This shampoo cleans her hair gently and it is easy to comb through afterwards. Plus it smells great.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my hair so shiny and happy. It is the same kind featured in the rooms at Disney&#x27;s Grand Californian Hotel. The classic container is also a great reason to get it and the matching conditioner and body wash. Looks great in the shower!</li>
            <li> I do like the shampoo it&#x27;s the only shampoo I found that doesn&#x27;t give me angry red bumps on my scalp and hair line however I&#x27;m really not a fan of the smEll it&#x27;s more of a light masculine sent nothing fruity or floral about it my husband doesn&#x27;t like it when I use it</li>
            <li> Hair is clean soft and shiny&lt;br /&gt;My hair is baby fine and this shampoo brought it to life&lt;br /&gt;Fabulous results</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.The smell makes you feel like you are in an expensive salon getting a hair treatment !!!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo (but fear it may be discontinued).  It is a perfect thickness so you only need a little.  It leave my hair clean and strong.</li>
            <li> This is the same brand that makes the Disney line shampoos. We went on a Disney Cruise and we really enjoyed this shampoo. Every time we use it we like to think about the spa on the ship and how wonderful it was. It always leaves my wife and daughter&#x27;s hair soft and it really smells good. It does not feel and a little bit of shampoo goes a long way. There are other types and scents but we have not tried those. This has eucalyptus in it and is a fresh clean scent. You can buy the shampoo at the Disney resorts as well for more money.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and the way it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li> The shampoo was great. But the $15.95 shipping charge was way too much.  Better to order directly from H2O.  My fault for not checking the order confirm.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but made my hair like a dessert.</li>
            <li> I know it may seem like a lot to spend on one bottle of shampoo, but it &#x27;s worth it.  It is very thick, so you don&#x27;t need to use very much of it, and so it lasts a long time.  Plus, I really like how it makes my hair feel/look!</li>
            <li> Found this shampoo on a recent Disney cruise and wanted to have some at home.  Love it.  Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd time I have ordered this and love it! My husband does too so we&#x27;re using it faster.</li>
            <li> This is a reorder -- that&#x27;s how much we like it!</li>
            <li> When we were at Disney they had the H2O2 shampoo in the room and it was great, so when I got home I ordered it, but was confused when I seen it in a green bottle the Disney was in a white bottle, but very small so I thought i bought the same, when it came the product was green so i knew it was different, it was a different style of H2O2  so I returned it...</li>
            <li> First used this shampoo when at the Fantasy Disney Cruis, I found it very good because leaves the hair sooth, clean and smell great. It is very thick, so you don&#x27;t need to use very much of it. It may seem like a lot of money to spend on one bottle of shampoo, but it &#x27;s worth it. I am glad being able to get it from Amazon. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying H2O for a couple of years now and I never get tired of it!  I leaves my hair clean and full (and I have thin hair), and the smell is the best1</li>
            <li> Tried this shampoo for the first time on my first Disney Cruise. Love it. Don&#x27;t use all the time. But nice to treat yourself occassionally.</li>
