            <li>Loving this cream!</li>

            <li>Nice smell and have already noticed smoother skin!</li>
            <li>Customer service is very nice and good followup.</li>
            <li>This cream is very nice, feels good and firms up the skin.</li>
            <li>It is very light but wasn&#x27;t very pleasant to me.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell and after I apply it, I can feel it working on the areas where I applied it.  </li>
            <li>it reduce my cellulite significantly !!!</li>
            <li>Smells great, and goes on very smooth not greasy!</li>
            <li>It has a creamy texture and a fairly neutral fragrance, so it is pleasant to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I can tell you it is creamy, has a pleasant aroma and feels good on your skin.</li>
            <li>( my advice : take a Good pic of ur self then compare u</li>
            <li>I do look forward to see the results of this great effective product.</li>
            <li>Works really good at smoothing out the bumps on my legs</li>
            <li>how smooth this product is is just wonderful.</li>
            <li>that caffeine is good for cellulite.</li>
            <li>so I hoped I would notice  a difference with all the good reviews on here.  </li>
            <li>I used product for one month, good absorption, smell  good, but I didn&#x27;t feel any change in my skin.</li>
            <li>Already seeing good results after two weeks--just in time for bikini season.</li>
            <li>good product,</li>
            <li>My skin tingled and felt like it was tightening up (in a good way), w/in a minute of applying it.  </li>
            <li>So far..so good..</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t smell to good.</li>
            <li>They recommend to apply a good amount when massaging your areas of concern.</li>
            <li>Good stuff&lt;br /&gt;But</li>

            <li>:)</li>
            <li>and it was full to the very top?  </li>
            <li>Love the smell and texture of the product also.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>Thanks for he great product</li>
            <li>I just love this product.</li>
            <li>and I love what is contains.</li>
            <li>I was given the wonderful opportunity to sample this product at a very low cost and I might say I love this stuff no lie..</li>
            <li>I love it .</li>
            <li>It is very creamy and non greasy and feels great on your skin.  </li>
            <li>It is for sure making my skin softer</li>
            <li>I am really enjoying this cream.  </li>
            <li>I would love to buy her some for mother&#x27;s day.  </li>
            <li>I plan to add more to my review  as I use more of this cream.</li>
            <li>This product worked better than I anticipated that it would.</li>
            <li>Will update in 30 days when I have some more substantial evidence :)</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The product does not smell, which is what I love about</li>
            <li>With continuous use, Nivea&#x27;s results seemed to be a bit more permanent than this.</li>
            <li>if for better results, it is not meant to be washed off, then I&#x27;ll have to use Nivea when I go swimming or something of that</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>jergens firming lotion works so much better</li>
            <li>I love the smell too</li>
            <li>I love Andre Lorent products and this is no exception.</li>
            <li>I was concerned I would break out becaue I have so many allergies.  </li>
            <li>I am optimistic that with continued use I will see even better results.</li>
            <li>I use the cellulite massager brush mitt to rub it in most of the time.</li>
            <li>but i think i need more time to determine if it works.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products that claim to be &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34; but just didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m sure it could be more if I used it twice a day that the instructions recommend.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased with Amazon many times but have never given a review.</li>
            <li>I also love how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>it self is ok,</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use anti cellulite creams very often but this one was great.</li>
            <li>You can tell the company really cares for their customers and are happy to answer any questions.</li>
            <li>I am also exercising and watching what I eat which I am sure</li>
            <li>Love it.....</li>
            <li>I love it  </li>
            <li>Have to say as a side note, I LOVE the Andre Lorent eye cream as well.</li>
            <li>I love the creme...</li>
            <li>i will most def recommend to anyone with cellulite.</li>
            <li>I love this brand.</li>
            <li>I really love this cellulite cream.</li>
            <li>so I feel this makes the cream better.</li>
            <li>I am sure the longer</li>
            <li>Im sure with continue use and exercise</li>
            <li>(I have a sensitivity to many smells).  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I just sort of rub it into my hands and my hand feel like they have a layer of protection, almost better then</li>
            <li>Love the consistency of this cream</li>
            <li>great product and works real well</li>
            <li>Moisturizing for sure.</li>
            <li>I love that is</li>
            <li>The reddish color had diminished to more of a skin tone.</li>
            <li>The skin was smoother, softer and more even.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>Like most creams, the more you use it, the better your results.  </li>
            <li>is better.</li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li>It is smooth and has a nice smell.</li>

            <li>This is a top quality product.</li>
            <li>I just received this cream couple days ago,  but I already love it.  </li>
            <li>I recommend trying this product because I know you will love it.</li>
            <li>To feel more weightless.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait for more time to pass to see greater changes.</li>
            <li>Refreshing scent</li>
            <li>Better than the Jergens firming lotion I was using.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>But I am getting another jar :)</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my skin feel after using it.</li>

            <li>I will continue to use and give it time to do it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, too.</li>
            <li>It is much smoother and it looks great.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many anti cellulite creams  </li>
            <li>Love this cream....</li>
            <li>Not so sure yet,</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li>I am sure it might be soon</li>
            <li>but I love it and will continue to use it.....</li>
            <li>I just started using this cream love the texture and smell</li>

            <li>(maybe better.)</li>
            <li>Fabulous stuff!  </li>
            <li>but hopefully the more</li>
            <li>I use it the more noticeable it will be</li>

            <li>I LOVE this cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smoother, looks moisturized, and has even made my skin look more even.</li>
            <li>and i absolutely love it</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>but I am in love with it.  </li>
            <li>(so many creams feel like they&#x27;re just sitting on top of the skin).  </li>
            <li>I love the way this cream absorbs into the skin.  </li>
            <li>Love this cream.</li>
            <li>Thighs looking better</li>

            <li>I swear this has made the magically disappear...</li>
            <li>Love this company.</li>
            <li>I liked the way it made my skin feel smooth, however, I did not notice a change in the appearance of cellulite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and I don&#x27;t have to use a lot!</li>
            <li>I am sure I would have given this product 5 stars if I had received it.  </li>
            <li>It feels more like a lotion than a cream and does not feel greasy.  </li>
            <li>One more incentive to use this product.</li>
            <li>I love how it doesn&#x27;t have a scent.  </li>
            <li>I wish I had more time to use the product before writing this review, but I will try to update it if anything changes.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it and highly recommend it!!!!!</li>
            <li>Has a wonderful clean fragrance and the skin on my 55 year old thighs</li>
            <li>I am very excited to try this item out.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>I waited a full week of use before posting because I wanted to be sure I was giving a fair and accurate review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>I received this cream for $1 plus shipping and so far so good!</li>
            <li>Silky smooth, spreads very easily.</li>
            <li>Love the clean smell!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a thicker cream that easily is absorbed into your skin and has a light pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>The creme is very smooth and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>The cream itself is very nice no bad smell and readily absorbed.</li>
            <li>More than anything, it works great at making skin extremely soft!</li>
            <li>At first the thing I loved about this cream  was the smell and the feel on my skin.</li>
            <li>It is working pretty good for me.</li>
            <li>I will say, the company seems to really care about customer satisfaction and wants to do everything they can to make sure you are happy and the product is doing what it is supposed to do!</li>
            <li>- just feels good - treating yourself.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I do have the dreaded cellulite in a few places - and the creams is wonderful and non-greasy - it feels good massaging it in, it soaks in and leaves your skin feel soft - and it does not have any scent!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m excited to see results!</li>
            <li>Great new product.  </li>

            <li>Nice packaging and arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Great results so far, my skin is so smooth!</li>
            <li>I am also sensitive to some scents and this had a very pleasant, mild and almost unnoticeable scent out of the jar.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very important that  I  maintain a healthy weight, as  I used to have full blown Type 2 Diabetes.</li>
            <li>Works best for very dry skin.</li>
            <li>Very light scent, which is important as a nurse, strong scents are forbidden.</li>
            <li>and so far I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s free from parabans, which I love.  </li>
            <li>I love the smooth feel to this cream.</li>
            <li>No bad odors and feels nice and smooth when applying it.</li>
            <li>I have just started using this product and as results take time, I can review what I have experienced so far.  </li>
            <li>I love that this product is 100% free from Parabens, and any additives.  </li>
            <li>I love it skin really smooth out</li>
            <li>This smells good and while I don&#x27;t have much noticeable cellulite</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping, great quality product.</li>
            <li>It has a very light clean fragrance&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Even though I&#x27;m aware I need to do certain exercises for a more permanent solution I am definitely happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>My skin was soft and the lotion smells very nice, too.</li>
            <li>, I recieved a very nice email after purchase that surprised me.</li>
            <li>really to early to tell if it works goes on absorbs very nicely</li>
            <li>Very clean and light scent.</li>
            <li>must be true!)</li>
            <li>Was so upset due to all the great reviews and ratings!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product and so worth the money!  </li>
            <li>Not a bad price either!</li>
            <li>It has a very mild fragrance that does not linger.</li>
            <li>No result seen yet, but very mild and comfortable, not irritating, good recipe</li>

            <li>So far, so good :)</li>
            <li>The odor was not too strong either,I will keep trying this and see if I see any results from it or not.</li>
            <li>I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.</li>
            <li>does not have some sort of strong smell to it.  </li>
            <li>So far so good:)</li>
            <li>I am much more healthy right now</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;This product is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>The cream is also a very good moisturizing cream as I tend to have dry skin and with the Andre Lorent cream this is not the case.  </li>
            <li>the container is actually completely full all the way to the top, and overall it&#x27;s pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>Very pleasant smell and a really nice thick cream that isn&#x27;t greasy or oily feeling.</li>
            <li>and I feel fine.</li>
            <li>Which basically means the wrinkles go away quickly :)</li>
            <li>I also love how quickly it rubs in.</li>
            <li>As I put the cream on my thighs felt a tightening sensation feels soft has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>And boy does it work quickly, too!</li>
            <li>I am delighted with this product thus far!</li>
            <li>I think for me I have never used caffeine in the form of a cream, so it is very interesting to see this ingredient as one of the main ingredients in this</li>
            <li>I immediately loved how light this moisturizer is and could tell it was going to be fine for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I am super excited to keep using it to see even better results.</li>
            <li>Feels great on the skin without feeling too heavy or oily and absorbs into the skin nicely.</li>
            <li>so I cannot accurately say it has changed the texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li>My arms have become MUCH firmer, the sag is &amp;#34;leaving the building!&amp;#34; In addition, my skin is MUCH softer and my stretch marks are lightening a great deal.</li>
            <li>After two days I noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Within a week I saw a huge difference.</li>
            <li>It is also free of petro-chemical derivatives, parabens and sodium lauryl</li>
            <li>This cream is light and not greasy.</li>
            <li>Light, not over powering which means it doesn&#x27;t fight with my perfume.  </li>
            <li>I was really hoping for amazing results</li>
            <li>It helps smooth things out some of the lumps &amp; bumps that are a bit unsightly in the form of cellulite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and light.  </li>
            <li>and they genuinely seem to care about their product as well as customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li>have received this product for free for a review.</li>
            <li>Some of those companies even offered me free products if I were to reorder.  </li>
            <li>The wrinkles on my neck disappeared and looks quite smooth.</li>
            <li>This cream goes on smooth, isn&#x27;t oily.  </li>
            <li>The cream leaves my skin feeling silky smooth, not sticky at all.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel smooth and firmer.  </li>
            <li>I also like that it is free from Parabens, sodium Laurel Sulfate and petroleum based derivatives.</li>
            <li>Creamy, silky smooth, moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>being said, this product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>if it really works, it&#x27;s a nice cream</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a popular spa brand meant for eliminating cellulite that costs triple the price of this, and didn&#x27;t work as fast or as well as this does.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s another thing that is important to me.</li>
            <li>Another plus is that it is paraben free.  </li>
            <li>The application of the product went on smooth and evenly</li>

            <li>I am not the most consistent with lotions, creams, etc.  </li>
            <li>I am seeing an excellent result in just the few weeks I have been using it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to continue using it.</li>
            <li>When I first opened the jar, the smell was odorless which is a plus because most of these creams are overpowering.  </li>
            <li>and I am excited for the results.</li>
            <li>cant wait to see what a whole jar does to my skin! :)</li>

            <li>It goes on so smoothly and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I bought this because of the many positive reviews this product has</li>
            <li>It also makes my skin feels so smooth &amp; the  Co-Founder Emily Cummings is super sweet, who emailed me for a follow up.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing and that is also very important.</li>

            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>Priced right!  </li>

            <li>Super excited about this product and will continue to use.  </li>
            <li>I notice a small, pleasant scent unlike so many creams which I refuse to use because of their strong scents.</li>
            <li>That is all I can ask, and so far, I am seeing AMAZING results.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft AMAZING...</li>
            <li>The cream goes on smoothly and is quickly absorbed by the skin.</li>
            <li>Also love the feel, very silky and smells yummy too.</li>
            <li>The cream doesn&#x27;t leave you sticky/tacky; glides on smoothly and is immediately absorbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li>I need to use more to see results but this product feels very well made.</li>
            <li>but i have to say that one tub probably wouldn&#x27;t show much effect, might get 2 more tubs to try and see if it works.</li>
            <li>too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The safety-sealed jar holds a full 4 oz.  </li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li>The container is a good size – 118 ml or 4 oz, so it will last a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how full the jar was too - brimming with cream.  </li>
            <li>While 72 hours does not give me a lot of time to talk about how this product works, I can tell you it is a nice cream and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>They are much smoother in appearance and my skin feels more toned.</li>

            <li>The cream is packaged nicely and easy to open.  </li>
            <li>but it does seem like your skin becomes smooth right away.  </li>
            <li>This cream is very smooth and it sinks into your skin pretty good.</li>
            <li>It spreads onto your skin very smoothly and evenly so you can really get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>It feels very light, is not greasy at all, but at the same time it is able to soften my skin on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However, I have such a large area to cover, I&#x27;ll need another one, lol.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to the great results that the other reviewers are raving about.</li>
            <li>It smells great, is smooth going on and does not feel heavy.</li>
            <li>The active ingredients are Retinol and Caffeine which are known to be great in fighting cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I appreciate that the scent is extremely mild.</li>
            <li>It contains Retinol, which I believe you cannot use while you are pregnant or nursing.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly - will follow up with whether or not it makes a difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the results can only get better as i continue to use it</li>
            <li>This cream overall has a nice smell and goes on smoothly.  </li>

            <li>Looking forward to seeing great results as it is already improving my skin in these few days.</li>
            <li>And Feels great on the skin without feeling too heavy or oily and absorbs into the skin nicely.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>The lotion itself is very cream and light.</li>
            <li>and I love it,great moisturizer,and completely odorless.</li>
            <li>Well worth a try.</li>
            <li>and I am more self conscious of my thighs and stomach.  </li>
            <li>I lost a considerable amount of weight through eating healthy and exercising.</li>
            <li>But this cream is well worth the money</li>
            <li>so far I&#x27;m pleased and see benefits as time goes on, This cream seem to work with cumulative use....</li>

            <li>I will  have to determine its success after a month or so.</li>
            <li>So far I feel my thighs are looking better.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth trying</li>
            <li>I love the Andre Lorent Crazy beautiful cellulite cream!</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive nose and many products with fragrance give me a headache.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and am happy to say no reaction from this productm am starting ti see a difference in the texture of my skin</li>
            <li>It is easily absorbed by skin and is not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>As soon as the product is absorbed, you can feel the difference in the skin.  </li>

            <li>It is definitely worth the money-</li>
            <li>Like it has many natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>So far I love everything about this product.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t sticky or oily but leaves skin soft with more firmness than before.</li>
            <li>Just received and I love it so far.</li>
            <li>This is a nice cream only problem for me is I can smell the caffeine!</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>The thing that surprised me most was the fact that, when applied, the cream was instantly absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>Worth it for ALL you women who have \\&quot;cottage cheese\\</li>
            <li>It is nice that a portion of the proceeds go to local charities.  </li>
            <li>I have gone through tubes and jars of other products without any great results, but this one really seems to do the job.</li>
            <li>My main purpose was to try it on significant stretch marks and mild cellulite dimpling.</li>
            <li>Exercise greatly reduces problem areas due to muscle building and strengthening and is required in order to really see results.</li>
            <li>The cream is light and quickly absorbs into the skin leaving it very soft.  </li>
            <li>This cream is just the opposite - so silky smooth &amp; very easy to spread-a little goes a long way, which makes this an excellent value!</li>
            <li>Nice and light, fluffy and not bad smelling.  </li>
            <li>which means i can put clothes on right away.  </li>
            <li>I started to notice smoother skin right away</li>
            <li>I tried this right after receiving it and could feel the tightening in my skin.  </li>
            <li>The texture is just right, not too greasy.  </li>
            <li>But like goldilocks,  this was just right.  </li>
            <li>the scent is very minimal and is good.  </li>
            <li>While I haven&#x27;t used it long term, I&#x27;m very impressed with how it feels and the fact that there is really no smell to it</li>
            <li>Having tried many cellulite products in the past, I really liked the consistency of the cream and even after one application the skin on my thighs and buttocks appeared smoother.  </li>
            <li>Those bumps and dimples really seem to fade away right before your eyes!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this cream is free from parabens and only uses pure ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still too early to see results from this cream, but just had to write an early review because of how much I love the consistency of this product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rich and absorbs easily and is scentless which BIG for me.</li>
            <li>The cream is rich and thick with a pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>The first time i used it i noticed a tightening of my skin right away.</li>
            <li>I have immediately noticed the cellulite on my thighs improve, and I honestly haven&#x27;t had it very long yet.</li>
            <li>After reading all of the positive feedback about results, I was very hopeful and excited to try this cream.  </li>
            <li>I am always skeptical of products with great benefit claims but tried this one because of the caffeine and retinol combination and now I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and leaves my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li>I received the cream super fast after processing my order.</li>
            <li>Shipped and delivered super fast.</li>
            <li>I usually am hesitant of skin creams because many cause me to break out but that didn&#x27;t happen with this cream!!  </li>
            <li>It looks very promising.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m beginning to see some results already, very promising.</li>
            <li>My wife likes the product very much.</li>
            <li>The cram though is rich and has a fresh soft fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent its really subtle but its amazing.</li>
            <li>The cream was also very creamy which left it very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I love that Andre Lorent has multiple creams.</li>
            <li>The cream is also so very moisturizing!</li>
            <li>My first purchase of cellulite cream</li>
            <li>My skin felt smoother after the first application.</li>
            <li>This product works as it says it does,I could feel my skin fighting after the first application.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>I could feel my skin tightening after the first application of the cream on my thighs.  </li>
            <li>When I was going to order another one this Summer, I first decided to browse around to see what else is out there.</li>
            <li>will keep using it and add more feedback later, if there&#x27;s any changes to what I have said here.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>For a cellulite cream I feel that it does pretty well.  </li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference after the first jar.  </li>
            <li>I also have the standard cellulite on the backs (top) of my legs.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>To my surprise, It really works!</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m already startling to see results very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Although it is very moisturizing it does nothing for cellulite or stretch marks!</li>
            <li>This is my first anticellulite lotion, and I hoped for some result</li>
            <li>and I think it really works!, complemented it with a cellulite massager brush and Im seeing results</li>
            <li>I used it consistently as directed until the product was gone with no results.</li>
            <li>I could tell it was working from the first use.  </li>
            <li>I also really love how they have retinol as one of its ingredient since retinol are suppose to goes deep into your skin</li>
            <li>I used a pressure massage to rub in this product making sure to rub it deep into the skin</li>
            <li>i use it the more i will see lasting results!!</li>
            <li>I really like this cream!</li>

            <li>I am looking forward to smoother thighs very soon!</li>

            <li>I can see that the stretch marks ard generally much lighter !</li>
            <li>And the fact that you have been able to donate money to small underfunded charities here in America makes the purchase even better.</li>

            <li>We will see if it works on the cottage cheese look of the cellulite (yuck) -- but in the meantime the skin on my legs is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>what with all those lotions and creams :)&lt;br /&gt;I will come back in about 4 weeks and give an update -&lt;br /&gt;Give</li>
            <li>It has really helped my cellulite!  </li>
            <li>On first application I found my skin to feel tighter.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>Very excited for the future of my legs!</li>
            <li>It firms the skin right up and makes it look much smoother.</li>
            <li>but it has the right ingredients and the price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Really made my skin soft and smooth and will likely order more after this is gone.  </li>
            <li>Cream smells nice, not like other  products.</li>
            <li>Unlike other creams, it absorbs really nicely and does not leave a greasy film on your skin.  </li>
            <li>It does not have a fragrant smell, which I liked because it doesn&#x27;t conflict with perfumes, or other body scents.  </li>
            <li>Wow, what a nice, thick cream that rubs easily into skin!  </li>
            <li>First I am very excited, the cream is soft and makes your skin just as soft.  </li>
            <li>And there is not much of a smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for making such a great product.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is a product made in the USA, not too many of those lately.  </li>
            <li>This product is very creamy, not greasy and has no odor which I like very much.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one week in and seeing positive changes.</li>
            <li>Thanks ;)</li>
            <li>What a relief, I&#x27;m not a young&#x27;un any more.  </li>
            <li>I really noticed a difference IMMEDIATELY after using this the first time.  </li>
            <li>Pretty much like everyone else</li>
            <li>Well the first couple days there was  no improvement and was ready to say it just does not work for me.</li>
            <li>The lotion was nice, I liked the smell, not too strong but It didnt do anything about my cellulite :(</li>
            <li>From first use, I noticed the skin on the areas applied (glutes and thighs) were super soft and really toned in texture.</li>
            <li>I started using the Andre Lorent CRAZY BEAUTIFUL Cellulite Cream recently and love it!  </li>
            <li>I don’t think it is that easy to get rid of cellulite altogether just with a cream, but it definitely improves the skin tone on my body!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its leaves my skin super soft.  </li>
            <li>Then again, I am super sensitive to fragrance.</li>
            <li>Not only that, there isn&#x27;t a strong scent so you can use it anytime of the day or night.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to get smart lipo like Kim Kardashian.</li>
            <li>Great thick cream!</li>
            <li>Even if it did nothing else, which by the way it does firm up all the lumps and bumps, just the softness itself would have me begging for more!</li>
            <li>I noticed a marked improvement after the first use!  </li>
            <li>The difference is amazing in just a few days</li>
            <li>I also did some looking up of the ingredients, because it seems to work extremely fast at smoothing out skin.</li>
            <li>absolutely will ADORE the result )</li>
            <li>My skin feels much softer and looks smoother.</li>
            <li>and I really  like  </li>
            <li>It absorbs very well, leaving no greasy or oily feeling on skin.  </li>
            <li>Definitely recommend for anyone wanting to smooth out problem areas.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a change.</li>
            <li>She is really seeing a difference on her legs.</li>
            <li>So much of a difference that my dad is now using it with her.</li>
            <li>My under eye area is much clearer</li>
            <li>Used a whole jar already and have not noticed anything.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much cellulite either</li>
            <li>Now I know eliminating cellulite altogether may be too much to ask.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do much for me</li>
            <li>This was really works.</li>
            <li>It really  does eliminate the dimples and lumps....</li>
            <li>and it really seems to be making a difference.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the whole jar, but have not noticed much results...</li>
            <li>I am almost swimsuit ready.</li>
            <li>Really wish this had worked for me for the price, but</li>
            <li>(i&#x27;m very tall</li>
            <li>I have used a whole contain of  this product and am about to purchase another.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much difference.  </li>
            <li>but I can really tell a difference in how my skin looks and feels with this cream.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;Great size</li>
            <li>I have been using this product with hope that it would work because i have tried others that really didn;t help me...</li>
            <li>Very creamy.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for this opportunity.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing,..everybody could be try it, it really work.</li>
            <li>It has no sent, which is really helpful.  </li>
            <li>Successive applications just left my skin feeling taut and smooth.</li>
            <li>I know that is will take prolonged use to really see a difference</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much cellulite</li>
            <li>I am really looking for to trying their face cream.</li>
            <li>Would recommend this to anyone who wants smoother, firmer skin.</li>
            <li>It absorbs really fast without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>This has really helped.</li>
            <li>Really did not see any improvement.</li>
            <li>and I use it where I need it most, but I diet and work out all the time, so not necessarily a real issue with me...</li>
            <li>I but this with hopes of getting some results I don&#x27;t want to say it&#x27;s not working, but I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference, maybe I need longer time using it.</li>
            <li>I feel it didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and skin</li>
            <li>I could feel it absorbing into my skin.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how fast it works.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended purchase!</li>
            <li>Goes on really silky.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft and fresh.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li>It is very creamy and seems to tighten the skin.  </li>
            <li>I was really hoping to see some sort of difference</li>
            <li>It feels like the real deal</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Item arrived fast and is described.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Andre Lorent!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Used this product for 2 weeks straight.</li>
            <li>Plus it really worked well on my stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this product not expecting much since i did not recognize the brand.</li>
            <li>Much to my amazement and absolute delight, after one week there is a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li>loomso much smoother</li>
            <li>It is not greasy which I really like.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This is a real plus as there is no transfer from the skin to any clothing you may be wearing.  </li>
            <li>This was always an important drawback that kept me from even trying a product such as this one.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Have only been using this product for about a week, but goes on smoothly ..</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work for me, I used a whole container already and worked out.</li>
            <li>Really helps to go by the directions and rub in circular motion until dissolved.</li>
            <li>In the areas that I have applied my skin appears to be much smoother.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really say if it&#x27;s removing cellulite</li>
            <li>Well worth the price for the results so far.</li>
            <li>Thanks Andre Lorent.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a softness in my skin and have been using this cream not only on my legs, but on the tops of my hands and elbows because I love the soft feel.</li>
            <li>I purchased this on a whim as I am willing to try new product.  </li>
            <li>Crazy Beautiful Cellulite Cream is NOT greasy, has no unpleasant odor, and you do not need to apply a lot.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see some noticeable changes in the firmness of my skin or reduction in cellulite, but I will continue using it, for sure!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice &amp; smooth and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>I would say that my results with it are also better than the other ones.</li>
            <li>So, if you don&#x27;t eat healthy and have a fitness regimen, you can&#x27;t expect this product or any other to work.</li>
            <li>- you&#x27;ll definitely get your money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Andre Lorent Crazy Beautiful Cellulite Cream!</li>
            <li>I have been using this for 3 days now and so far it has made my skin super soft!</li>
            <li>I am always skeptical of &#x27;to good to be true&#x27; products.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a thicker cream that easily is absorbed into your skin, it has a very faint pleasant smell, almost sweet vanilla like minty...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t start using this product right away when I got it because I wanted to finish losing weight first after having my second baby.</li>
            <li>, this was very clean and did not leave any residue like other creams often do.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this product for a few days, but so far I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
            <li>the arm I put it on is visibly smoother almost instantly which I think has something to do with the methyl nicotinate which works by dilating the the small blood vessels near your skin to allow more blood flow and fill out the skin better.</li>
            <li>My thighs are less dimply and my legs feel sooooo smooth!</li>
            <li>They are all nice and thick and spread very well.</li>
            <li>Product seems to work well for this older lady.  </li>
            <li>and I am getting older.</li>
            <li>No cream is ever going to totally get rid of cellulite without the person working out too, but this does appear to tighten up the problem areas quickly.</li>
            <li>Great stuff - not sure how long term the effects will be</li>
            <li>Love that this cream is free of parabens and unnecessary junk.</li>
            <li>Additionally, exercise helps in reducing fat cell size, stimulate circulation and removing toxins from the body which are the main culprits of cellulite.</li>
            <li>I normally only publish a review if it&#x27;s worthy.</li>
            <li>It made my skin feel very soft, but didn&#x27;t really see a difference</li>
            <li>could actually visually see some difference almost immediately after application (even the very first time).&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I have not used the product long enough to know if it actually reduces the appearance of cellulite, but it is certainly a good moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li>but since I&#x27;ve been using this cream they are slowly but surely fading away !</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone thinking of purchasing this product.</li>
            <li>but I have high hopes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for others.</li>
            <li>It is thick enough to really absorb into your skin in order to work it&#x27;s magic yet light to the touch.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is trying to tighten their skin or getting rid of cellulite.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product because of the high quality ingredients it is made of and it&#x27;s lack of harmful ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that it is free from parabens, SLS, and other chemical derivatives.</li>
            <li>It is non-greasy and I really like the face that it is free from parabens, SLS, and other chemical derivatives.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a little more than a week.</li>
            <li>So far it seems to be working really well</li>
            <li>So far I really like &amp;#34;crazy beautiful&amp;#34; firming cream.  </li>
            <li>I think the real strength in this cream is in how soft it leaves my skin for hours after use.</li>
            <li>I assumed with all the great ratings I couldn&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li>and I really like it so far.</li>
            <li>soft and very smooth.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I really did not see any change as far as the cellulite.</li>
            <li>So far I really like the cream.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any changes yet, but I&#x27;m sure it will take a few weeks for me to notice.</li>
            <li>I will provide an update after a few more weeks of use.  </li>
            <li>After using this cream for a few days I have noticed that my skin is smoothing out and my dimples aren&#x27;t nearly as prominent.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth trying for anyone looking for something similar.</li>
            <li>Hurray - because one thing I always disliked is mixing up too many scents -</li>
            <li>Cellulite cream is orderless with a nice thick luxurious feel.</li>
            <li>Really nice, thick cream.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very subtle and pleasant.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how quick the product made a difference on my face, especially my neck area.</li>
            <li>The product has no scent and is thick without being gooey – allowing for a precise application and quick absorption.  </li>
            <li>I applied it heavily and it absorbed quickly.  </li>
            <li>It goes on thick, smooth and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>It is thick and smooth almost like whipped cream and no unpleasant odor.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product for anyone with stretch marks, cellulite or any other places that need to be smooth.  </li>
            <li>My new fountain of youth in a jar</li>
            <li>I got a new cream by Andre Lorent for a review, and this is a cellulite cream that is firming for the skin.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin very smooth and I can see a small difference in the cellulite area.</li>
            <li>It seems to reduce the appearance of dimples, tighten the skin and has even made my skin very soft in the areas I have used it.  </li>
            <li>While I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to really see any cellulite reduction, my skin is soft, smooth, and supple.</li>
            <li>My skin is very soft after using this for a week.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive sense of smell and can&#x27;t use a lot of products because the smell is too overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin but haven&#x27;t had any problem with this product.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin get irritated!</li>
            <li>After one month I just finished my first jar, and have ordered my second.  </li>
            <li>I am hoping to be consistent with this routine for a couple of months and hoping I see big changes.</li>
            <li>so I just had to guess at one and after reading reviews I decided on Andre Lorent Crazy Beautiful Cellulite Cream</li>
            <li>And I have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Crazy Beautiful Cellulite Cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am encouraged by the early results!</li>
            <li>After three days there was a marked difference!</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>This cream leaves your skin silky soft!  </li>
            <li>I have only been able to use for a few weeks, but I really like it.  </li>
            <li>It is completely grease-less!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m reviewing that it makes my skin soft!</li>
            <li>You apply it like regular lotion and it does dry very quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many, many, many cellulite creams in the past &amp; they&#x27;ve primarily been thick &amp; sticky, difficult to spread.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and am hesitant to try new creams.</li>
            <li>I have been pleasantly surprised by the new firmness in my skin.</li>
            <li>Lorent CRAZY BEAUTIFUL Anti-Cellulite Creme, and as pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this would get rid of it, especially on the front, because my legs are pretty muscular and not fatty.</li>
            <li>The cream has a pleasant, faint smell.  </li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t spend this much on creams but this is so so so worth it!</li>
            <li>A product made from pure ingredients with a 100% money back guarantee - who wouldn&#x27;t want to give this a try?</li>
            <li>Been applying to my tushy and it may be too early to tell</li>
            <li>It is too early to tell if it works on cellulite.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;So far just started using this product, it smells great&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I am usually sensitive to caffeine when ingested, but I thought I would give this a try just to see.</li>
            <li>My skin does feel soft after application.</li>
            <li>This leaves my skin feeling so soft and supple.</li>
            <li>It completely absorbs within seconds.  </li>
            <li>I can notice a considerable softness to my skin</li>
            <li>Just began using the product, so far no results</li>
            <li>feel that Nivea had much longer lasting effect than this, though.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t know if it works or not because I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week, but it did come fast.</li>
            <li>So far..</li>
            <li>So far I like the scent  and texture but its too soon to see any results</li>
            <li>I like it so far ..</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve seen some improvement.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve used three jars and have not seen any results.</li>
            <li>company specializes in natural formulations, and the ingredient list is quite</li>
            <li>I was completely surprised.  </li>
            <li>After reading what everyone has said about it I am suprised that no one has mentioned how INCREDIBLY soft it makes your skin.</li>
            <li>I like this cream so far.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant since I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I will see a difference, plus I will have soft skin.</li>
            <li>I apply on back of upper thighs and buttocks and being fragrance free is a big plus.</li>
            <li>However, I am a person with sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Whenever I apply it, my hands feel so incredibly soft afterward.</li>
            <li>So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>abd have seen no improvement so far...</li>
            <li>I am still trying it out, but so far I can feel the tightening and firming.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and had no problem</li>
            <li>So far it is living up to it&#x27;s expectations.</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s too early to tell.</li>
            <li>but so far it seems to be working.</li>
            <li>It is soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>I am so self conscious about them.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft after applying the cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to use it on just one side for the next week and see if It&#x27;s just wishful thinking on my part or there really is a difference.  </li>
            <li>I like it so far,  </li>
            <li>and I was  so surprised to see smoother even skin.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin  feel so soft.</li>
            <li>Used now for several says, really like the product and how it feels on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too early for me to know if it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely ruining why the review system works.</li>
            <li>if you have sensitive skin like me.  </li>
            <li>Dimples on my thighs are gone and my thighs feel so soft.</li>
            <li>They use natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this cream.  </li>
            <li>but I like what I see so far.  </li>
            <li>May be it is still too early to review.</li>
            <li>Only use this a few days and love it .  </li>
            <li>Only a few uses in and a satisfied customer...</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s just say Mother Nature has not been kind to my behind.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a huge difference in less than a week!</li>
            <li>, this product goes QUICK and does not last long at all.</li>
            <li>I have only been using it a few days, but I am excited to see the results in a couple of weeks!</li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t want a tight butt right?!?</li>
            <li>I decided to use this on my hands because they were really dry and starting to look they were aging quickly.</li>
            <li>Although I skipped a few days here and there, I still saw a significant change in my legs after the 1st 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I love how my skin looks after only using it for a few days !</li>
            <li>This cream has both retinol and caffeine in it which are the two top ingredients usually recommended to reduce/eliminate skin issues such as cellulite etc.</li>
            <li>Smell is a little bit odd, but the cream is nice</li>
            <li>I have tried other cellulite fighting products in the past much longer, and not been able to achieve the results I already have with this.</li>
            <li>and I have had no irritation from this product which is a major plus!</li>
            <li>Some other products have such a strong smell that I can only use them at bedtime.</li>
            <li>I have no complaints regarding my Crazy Beautiful Cellulite Cream that I have recently purchased, and i have NO regrets.  </li>
            <li>I have already used other products that promise similar things, most of them more expensive, and never got any results.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t wait to finish the other half, I&#x27;m ordering new one right now!!</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable given that other cellulite creams can be three times the cost.  </li>
            <li>Especially since it&#x27;s such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>leaving the area smooth.. only a few applications</li>
            <li>Actually some products that deliver real results FINALLY!</li>
            <li>i havent used enough in order to see any results, so i&#x27;ll have to leave a later review after i&#x27;ve the whole container</li>
            <li>Only negative is directions could be more indepth.</li>
            <li>i use it once a day after my workout shower  and msg it for few sec. :)</li>
            <li>Goes on thick and spreads easily.  </li>
            <li>I got more results than long term results from other more expensive products.</li>
            <li>I never expected to see some results this soon!</li>
            <li>I just received this product a couple of days ago, so I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to fully benefit from all that this product has to offer, but so far, I&#x27;m really liking it.  </li>
            <li>Its really thick, but goes on very smoothly and does seem to even out my skin, even after just the first few uses!</li>
            <li>The cream goes on smoothly and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely something I search for when looking for anything that I put directly on my skin.  </li>
            <li>So far i have only used it for 3 days</li>
            <li>It has no smell and it makes skin really soft, but she said it works just like regular lotion, nothing else</li>
            <li>I have only used the cream 3 times so far</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at the lack of fragrance or medical scent.  </li>
            <li>I have only used it a couple of times, but so far I am please with the cream.</li>
            <li>I really never expected my cellulite to &amp;#34;disappear&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Looking forward to seeing how the end results on those &#x27;problem&#x27; areas in the near future.</li>
            <li>what&#x27;s behind me :).  </li>
            <li>This product is VERY reasonably priced compared to other products claiming to improve cellulite areas but this one is actually doing what it says it will do!</li>
            <li>I have also used it with my dermaroller a few times to make sure it can get deep down.  </li>
            <li>It also has a faint minty smell which is pleasant, but does not clash with any perfume or other scent you might be wearing.  </li>
            <li>and I would definitely recommend it to smooth your skin up, at least.</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase again in the near future.</li>
            <li>I have not had it long enough to use it all and see the results but my skin is very soft since using it.\\&quot;ich and creamy with a pleasing scent.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth and I was shocked at how much you get which is a lot!</li>
            <li>After using for a week and a half I really see the difference in my skin</li>
            <li>I have only been using for a few days but already see much smoother skin on my problem areas!  </li>
            <li>I am anxious to use it for a few more weeks to see if there is a change in my cellulite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this cream for a few days, but already I really like it!  </li>
            <li>The cream is thick but soaks in quickly for a lightweight feel.</li>
            <li>The cream is completely odorless, unlike some other creams, and is thick and rich.</li>
            <li>I have only been using the product for a couple of days but my skin really does seem less bumpy.  </li>
            <li>I have not had it long enough to use it all and see the long term results but my skin is very soft since using it.&lt;br /&gt;Non</li>

            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> Thanks for he great product</li>
            <li> I just love this product.</li>
            <li> and I love what is contains.</li>
            <li> I was given the wonderful opportunity to sample this product at a very low cost and I might say I love this stuff no lie..</li>
            <li> I love it .</li>
            <li> It is very creamy and non greasy and feels great on your skin.  </li>
            <li> It is for sure making my skin softer</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this cream.  </li>
            <li> I would love to buy her some for mother&#x27;s day.  </li>
            <li> I plan to add more to my review  as I use more of this cream.</li>
            <li> This product worked better than I anticipated that it would.</li>
            <li> Will update in 30 days when I have some more substantial evidence :)</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The product does not smell, which is what I love about</li>
            <li> With continuous use, Nivea&#x27;s results seemed to be a bit more permanent than this.</li>
            <li> if for better results, it is not meant to be washed off, then I&#x27;ll have to use Nivea when I go swimming or something of that</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> jergens firming lotion works so much better</li>
            <li> I love the smell too</li>
            <li> I love Andre Lorent products and this is no exception.</li>
            <li> I was concerned I would break out becaue I have so many allergies.  </li>
            <li> I am optimistic that with continued use I will see even better results.</li>
            <li> I use the cellulite massager brush mitt to rub it in most of the time.</li>
            <li> but i think i need more time to determine if it works.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products that claim to be &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34; but just didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m sure it could be more if I used it twice a day that the instructions recommend.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased with Amazon many times but have never given a review.</li>
            <li> I also love how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> it self is ok,</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use anti cellulite creams very often but this one was great.</li>
            <li> You can tell the company really cares for their customers and are happy to answer any questions.</li>
            <li> I am also exercising and watching what I eat which I am sure</li>
            <li> Love it.....</li>
            <li> I love it  </li>
            <li> Have to say as a side note, I LOVE the Andre Lorent eye cream as well.</li>
            <li> I love the creme...</li>

            <li> so I feel this makes the cream better.</li>
            <li> I am sure the longer</li>
            <li> Im sure with continue use and exercise</li>
            <li> (I have a sensitivity to many smells).  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I just sort of rub it into my hands and my hand feel like they have a layer of protection, almost better then</li>
            <li> Love the consistency of this cream</li>
            <li> great product and works real well</li>
            <li> Moisturizing for sure.</li>
            <li> I love that is</li>
            <li> The reddish color had diminished to more of a skin tone.</li>
            <li> The skin was smoother, softer and more even.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> Like most creams, the more you use it, the better your results.  </li>
            <li> is better.</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li> It is smooth and has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so amazing and smooth.  </li>
            <li> This is a top quality product.</li>
            <li> I just received this cream couple days ago,  but I already love it.  </li>
            <li> I recommend trying this product because I know you will love it.</li>
            <li> To feel more weightless.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait for more time to pass to see greater changes.</li>
            <li> Refreshing scent</li>
            <li> Better than the Jergens firming lotion I was using.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> But I am getting another jar :)</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel after using it.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite cellulite cream.  </li>
            <li> Got this and love it, I can feel the effect...fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I love this cream</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the feel of the cream...</li>
            <li> Love that it is working</li>
            <li> I will continue to use and give it time to do it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, too.</li>
            <li> It is much smoother and it looks great.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many anti cellulite creams  </li>
            <li> Love this cream....</li>
            <li> Not so sure yet,</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> I am sure it might be soon</li>
            <li> but I love it and will continue to use it.....</li>
            <li> I just started using this cream love the texture and smell</li>
            <li> So now I love th  smell, the way it makes my skin feel AND</li>
            <li> and I do love the softness it gives my skin.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> (maybe better.)</li>
            <li> Fabulous stuff!  </li>
            <li> but hopefully the more</li>
            <li> I use it the more noticeable it will be</li>
            <li> Such a great product!</li>
            <li> I love that they contact you to ask how he product is working</li>
            <li> I LOVE this cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smoother, looks moisturized, and has even made my skin look more even.</li>
            <li> and i absolutely love it</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> but I am in love with it.  </li>
            <li> (so many creams feel like they&#x27;re just sitting on top of the skin).  </li>
            <li> I love the way this cream absorbs into the skin.  </li>
            <li> Love this cream.</li>
            <li> Thighs looking better</li>
            <li> but when I do I will make sure to write a review on it.</li>
            <li> The cream is ok...</li>
            <li> I use the cream the more difference I will see.  </li>
            <li> so I can see if it will give me better results.</li>
            <li> I swear this has made the magically disappear...</li>
            <li> Love this company.</li>
            <li> I liked the way it made my skin feel smooth, however, I did not notice a change in the appearance of cellulite.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth and I don&#x27;t have to use a lot!</li>
            <li> I am sure I would have given this product 5 stars if I had received it.  </li>
            <li> It feels more like a lotion than a cream and does not feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> One more incentive to use this product.</li>
            <li> I love how it doesn&#x27;t have a scent.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had more time to use the product before writing this review, but I will try to update it if anything changes.</li>
            <li> I LOVE it and highly recommend it!!!!!</li>
            <li> Has a wonderful clean fragrance and the skin on my 55 year old thighs</li>
            <li> I am very excited to try this item out.</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> I waited a full week of use before posting because I wanted to be sure I was giving a fair and accurate review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> I received this cream for $1 plus shipping and so far so good!</li>
            <li> Silky smooth, spreads very easily.</li>
            <li> Love the clean smell!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thicker cream that easily is absorbed into your skin and has a light pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> The creme is very smooth and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> The cream itself is very nice no bad smell and readily absorbed.</li>
            <li> More than anything, it works great at making skin extremely soft!</li>
            <li> At first the thing I loved about this cream  was the smell and the feel on my skin.</li>
            <li> It is working pretty good for me.</li>
            <li> I will say, the company seems to really care about customer satisfaction and wants to do everything they can to make sure you are happy and the product is doing what it is supposed to do!</li>
            <li> - just feels good - treating yourself.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I do have the dreaded cellulite in a few places - and the creams is wonderful and non-greasy - it feels good massaging it in, it soaks in and leaves your skin feel soft - and it does not have any scent!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m excited to see results!</li>
            <li> Great new product.  </li>
            <li> There is no scent and it absorbs quickly though which was nice.</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell</li>
            <li> Nice packaging and arrived quickly.  </li>

            <li> &amp;#34;This product is pretty amazing.</li>

            <li> And boy does it work quickly, too!</li>
            <li> I am delighted with this product thus far!</li>
            <li> I think for me I have never used caffeine in the form of a cream, so it is very interesting to see this ingredient as one of the main ingredients in this</li>
            <li> I immediately loved how light this moisturizer is and could tell it was going to be fine for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I am super excited to keep using it to see even better results.</li>
            <li> Feels great on the skin without feeling too heavy or oily and absorbs into the skin nicely.</li>
            <li> so I cannot accurately say it has changed the texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li> My arms have become MUCH firmer, the sag is &amp;#34;leaving the building!&amp;#34; In addition, my skin is MUCH softer and my stretch marks are lightening a great deal.</li>
            <li> After two days I noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Within a week I saw a huge difference.</li>

            <li> This cream is light and not greasy.</li>

            <li> have received this product for free for a review.</li>

            <li> being said, this product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> if it really works, it&#x27;s a nice cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a popular spa brand meant for eliminating cellulite that costs triple the price of this, and didn&#x27;t work as fast or as well as this does.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s another thing that is important to me.</li>
            <li> Another plus is that it is paraben free.  </li>

            <li> The cream doesn&#x27;t leave you sticky/tacky; glides on smoothly and is immediately absorbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li> I need to use more to see results but this product feels very well made.</li>
            <li> but i have to say that one tub probably wouldn&#x27;t show much effect, might get 2 more tubs to try and see if it works.</li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The safety-sealed jar holds a full 4 oz.  </li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li> The container is a good size – 118 ml or 4 oz, so it will last a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how full the jar was too - brimming with cream.  </li>
            <li> While 72 hours does not give me a lot of time to talk about how this product works, I can tell you it is a nice cream and leaves my skin soft.</li>

            <li> This cream is very smooth and it sinks into your skin pretty good.</li>

            <li> It contains Retinol, which I believe you cannot use while you are pregnant or nursing.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly - will follow up with whether or not it makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the results can only get better as i continue to use it</li>
            <li> This cream overall has a nice smell and goes on smoothly.  </li>

            <li> Looking forward to seeing great results as it is already improving my skin in these few days.</li>
            <li> And Feels great on the skin without feeling too heavy or oily and absorbs into the skin nicely.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> The lotion itself is very cream and light.</li>
            <li> and I love it,great moisturizer,and completely odorless.</li>
            <li> Well worth a try.</li>
            <li> and I am more self conscious of my thighs and stomach.  </li>
            <li> I lost a considerable amount of weight through eating healthy and exercising.</li>
            <li> But this cream is well worth the money</li>
            <li> so far I&#x27;m pleased and see benefits as time goes on, This cream seem to work with cumulative use....</li>
            <li> This cream is worth every penny I use it with my waist trainer</li>
            <li> I will  have to determine its success after a month or so.</li>
            <li> So far I feel my thighs are looking better.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth trying</li>
            <li> I love the Andre Lorent Crazy beautiful cellulite cream!</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive nose and many products with fragrance give me a headache.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and am happy to say no reaction from this productm am starting ti see a difference in the texture of my skin</li>
            <li> It is easily absorbed by skin and is not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> As soon as the product is absorbed, you can feel the difference in the skin.  </li>
            <li> So far I love this product.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the money-</li>
            <li> Like it has many natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> So far I love everything about this product.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t sticky or oily but leaves skin soft with more firmness than before.</li>
            <li> Just received and I love it so far.</li>
            <li> This is a nice cream only problem for me is I can smell the caffeine!</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> The thing that surprised me most was the fact that, when applied, the cream was instantly absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> Worth it for ALL you women who have \\&quot;cottage cheese\\</li>
            <li> It is nice that a portion of the proceeds go to local charities.  </li>
            <li> I have gone through tubes and jars of other products without any great results, but this one really seems to do the job.</li>
            <li> My main purpose was to try it on significant stretch marks and mild cellulite dimpling.</li>
            <li> Exercise greatly reduces problem areas due to muscle building and strengthening and is required in order to really see results.</li>
            <li> The cream is light and quickly absorbs into the skin leaving it very soft.  </li>
            <li> This cream is just the opposite - so silky smooth &amp; very easy to spread-a little goes a long way, which makes this an excellent value!</li>
            <li> Nice and light, fluffy and not bad smelling.  </li>
            <li> which means i can put clothes on right away.  </li>
            <li> I started to notice smoother skin right away</li>
            <li> I tried this right after receiving it and could feel the tightening in my skin.  </li>
            <li> The texture is just right, not too greasy.  </li>
            <li> But like goldilocks,  this was just right.  </li>
            <li> the scent is very minimal and is good.  </li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t used it long term, I&#x27;m very impressed with how it feels and the fact that there is really no smell to it</li>
            <li> Having tried many cellulite products in the past, I really liked the consistency of the cream and even after one application the skin on my thighs and buttocks appeared smoother.  </li>
            <li> Those bumps and dimples really seem to fade away right before your eyes!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this cream is free from parabens and only uses pure ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still too early to see results from this cream, but just had to write an early review because of how much I love the consistency of this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rich and absorbs easily and is scentless which BIG for me.</li>
            <li> The cream is rich and thick with a pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> The first time i used it i noticed a tightening of my skin right away.</li>
            <li> I have immediately noticed the cellulite on my thighs improve, and I honestly haven&#x27;t had it very long yet.</li>
            <li> After reading all of the positive feedback about results, I was very hopeful and excited to try this cream.  </li>
            <li> I am always skeptical of products with great benefit claims but tried this one because of the caffeine and retinol combination and now I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and leaves my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li> I received the cream super fast after processing my order.</li>
            <li> Shipped and delivered super fast.</li>
            <li> I usually am hesitant of skin creams because many cause me to break out but that didn&#x27;t happen with this cream!!  </li>
            <li> It looks very promising.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m beginning to see some results already, very promising.</li>
            <li> My wife likes the product very much.</li>
            <li> The cram though is rich and has a fresh soft fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I love the scent its really subtle but its amazing.</li>
            <li> The cream was also very creamy which left it very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> I love that Andre Lorent has multiple creams.</li>
            <li> The cream is also so very moisturizing!</li>
            <li> My first purchase of cellulite cream</li>
            <li> My skin felt smoother after the first application.</li>
            <li> This product works as it says it does,I could feel my skin fighting after the first application.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> I could feel my skin tightening after the first application of the cream on my thighs.  </li>
            <li> When I was going to order another one this Summer, I first decided to browse around to see what else is out there.</li>
            <li> will keep using it and add more feedback later, if there&#x27;s any changes to what I have said here.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> For a cellulite cream I feel that it does pretty well.  </li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after the first jar.  </li>
            <li> I also have the standard cellulite on the backs (top) of my legs.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> To my surprise, It really works!</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m already startling to see results very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Although it is very moisturizing it does nothing for cellulite or stretch marks!</li>
            <li> This is my first anticellulite lotion, and I hoped for some result</li>
            <li> and I think it really works!, complemented it with a cellulite massager brush and Im seeing results</li>
            <li> I used it consistently as directed until the product was gone with no results.</li>
            <li> I could tell it was working from the first use.  </li>
            <li> I also really love how they have retinol as one of its ingredient since retinol are suppose to goes deep into your skin</li>
            <li> I used a pressure massage to rub in this product making sure to rub it deep into the skin</li>
            <li> i use it the more i will see lasting results!!</li>
            <li> I really like this cream!</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and my skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to smoother thighs very soon!</li>
            <li> The first application felt somewhat tingly.</li>
            <li> Overall I am pleased with the product</li>
            <li> Many had disappeared on the outside edges.</li>
            <li> I am glad I sent for this and will use regularly.</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve posted a before and after picture but within the first time</li>
            <li> 2nd time, all gone!:o Would recommend this:) it really works!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s odorless, not greasy and makes skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I can see that the stretch marks ard generally much lighter !</li>
            <li> And the fact that you have been able to donate money to small underfunded charities here in America makes the purchase even better.</li>
            <li> This is the first cellulite cream I have used</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product and plan to continue usage on a daily basis</li>
            <li> This is the first one that does and</li>
            <li> What I noticed first is how soft and smooth</li>
            <li> It feels like it is working when you rub it in for the first time.  </li>
            <li> Love the product and will definitely continue to use!!</li>
            <li> The cream goes on lightly, with no heavy or greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I will most definitely need a second one!:)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped the appearance of my skin so much!</li>
            <li> I will keep purchasing this product most definitely.</li>
            <li> This is the first cellulite cream I have ever used</li>
            <li> I received this cream today and the product is very creamy!</li>
            <li> We will see if it works on the cottage cheese look of the cellulite (yuck) -- but in the meantime the skin on my legs is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> what with all those lotions and creams :)&lt;br /&gt;I will come back in about 4 weeks and give an update -&lt;br /&gt;Give</li>
            <li> It has really helped my cellulite!  </li>
            <li> On first application I found my skin to feel tighter.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> Very excited for the future of my legs!</li>
            <li> It firms the skin right up and makes it look much smoother.</li>
            <li> but it has the right ingredients and the price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li> Really made my skin soft and smooth and will likely order more after this is gone.  </li>
            <li> Cream smells nice, not like other  products.</li>
            <li> Unlike other creams, it absorbs really nicely and does not leave a greasy film on your skin.  </li>
            <li> It does not have a fragrant smell, which I liked because it doesn&#x27;t conflict with perfumes, or other body scents.  </li>
            <li> Wow, what a nice, thick cream that rubs easily into skin!  </li>
            <li> First I am very excited, the cream is soft and makes your skin just as soft.  </li>
            <li> And there is not much of a smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for making such a great product.  </li>
            <li> I love that it is a product made in the USA, not too many of those lately.  </li>
            <li> This product is very creamy, not greasy and has no odor which I like very much.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one week in and seeing positive changes.</li>
            <li> Thanks ;)</li>
            <li> What a relief, I&#x27;m not a young&#x27;un any more.  </li>
            <li> I really noticed a difference IMMEDIATELY after using this the first time.  </li>
            <li> Pretty much like everyone else</li>
            <li> Well the first couple days there was  no improvement and was ready to say it just does not work for me.</li>
            <li> The lotion was nice, I liked the smell, not too strong but It didnt do anything about my cellulite :(</li>
            <li> From first use, I noticed the skin on the areas applied (glutes and thighs) were super soft and really toned in texture.</li>
            <li> I started using the Andre Lorent CRAZY BEAUTIFUL Cellulite Cream recently and love it!  </li>
            <li> I don’t think it is that easy to get rid of cellulite altogether just with a cream, but it definitely improves the skin tone on my body!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its leaves my skin super soft.  </li>
            <li> Then again, I am super sensitive to fragrance.</li>
            <li> Not only that, there isn&#x27;t a strong scent so you can use it anytime of the day or night.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to get smart lipo like Kim Kardashian.</li>
            <li> Great thick cream!</li>
            <li> Even if it did nothing else, which by the way it does firm up all the lumps and bumps, just the softness itself would have me begging for more!</li>
            <li> I noticed a marked improvement after the first use!  </li>
            <li> The difference is amazing in just a few days</li>
            <li> I also did some looking up of the ingredients, because it seems to work extremely fast at smoothing out skin.</li>
            <li> absolutely will ADORE the result )</li>
            <li> My skin feels much softer and looks smoother.</li>
            <li> and I really  like  </li>
            <li> It absorbs very well, leaving no greasy or oily feeling on skin.  </li>
            <li> Definitely recommend for anyone wanting to smooth out problem areas.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a change.</li>
            <li> She is really seeing a difference on her legs.</li>
            <li> So much of a difference that my dad is now using it with her.</li>
            <li> My under eye area is much clearer</li>
            <li> Used a whole jar already and have not noticed anything.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much cellulite either</li>
            <li> Now I know eliminating cellulite altogether may be too much to ask.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do much for me</li>
            <li> This was really works.</li>
            <li> It really  does eliminate the dimples and lumps....</li>
            <li> and it really seems to be making a difference.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the whole jar, but have not noticed much results...</li>
            <li> I am almost swimsuit ready.</li>
            <li> Really wish this had worked for me for the price, but</li>
            <li> (i&#x27;m very tall</li>
            <li> I have used a whole contain of  this product and am about to purchase another.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much difference.  </li>
            <li> but I can really tell a difference in how my skin looks and feels with this cream.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;Great size</li>
            <li> I have been using this product with hope that it would work because i have tried others that really didn;t help me...</li>
            <li> Very creamy.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for this opportunity.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing,..everybody could be try it, it really work.</li>
            <li> It has no sent, which is really helpful.  </li>
            <li> Successive applications just left my skin feeling taut and smooth.</li>
            <li> I know that is will take prolonged use to really see a difference</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much cellulite</li>
            <li> I am really looking for to trying their face cream.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this to anyone who wants smoother, firmer skin.</li>
            <li> It absorbs really fast without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> This has really helped.</li>
            <li> Really did not see any improvement.</li>
            <li> and I use it where I need it most, but I diet and work out all the time, so not necessarily a real issue with me...</li>
            <li> I but this with hopes of getting some results I don&#x27;t want to say it&#x27;s not working, but I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference, maybe I need longer time using it.</li>
            <li> I feel it didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and skin</li>
            <li> I could feel it absorbing into my skin.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how fast it works.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended purchase!</li>
            <li> Goes on really silky.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft and fresh.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li> It is very creamy and seems to tighten the skin.  </li>
            <li> I was really hoping to see some sort of difference</li>
            <li> It feels like the real deal</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Item arrived fast and is described.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Andre Lorent!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Used this product for 2 weeks straight.</li>
            <li> Plus it really worked well on my stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product not expecting much since i did not recognize the brand.</li>
            <li> Much to my amazement and absolute delight, after one week there is a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li> loomso much smoother</li>
            <li> It is not greasy which I really like.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This is a real plus as there is no transfer from the skin to any clothing you may be wearing.  </li>
            <li> This was always an important drawback that kept me from even trying a product such as this one.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Have only been using this product for about a week, but goes on smoothly ..</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me, I used a whole container already and worked out.</li>
            <li> Really helps to go by the directions and rub in circular motion until dissolved.</li>
            <li> In the areas that I have applied my skin appears to be much smoother.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really say if it&#x27;s removing cellulite</li>
            <li> Well worth the price for the results so far.</li>
            <li> Thanks Andre Lorent.</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a softness in my skin and have been using this cream not only on my legs, but on the tops of my hands and elbows because I love the soft feel.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on a whim as I am willing to try new product.  </li>
            <li> Crazy Beautiful Cellulite Cream is NOT greasy, has no unpleasant odor, and you do not need to apply a lot.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see some noticeable changes in the firmness of my skin or reduction in cellulite, but I will continue using it, for sure!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice &amp; smooth and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I would say that my results with it are also better than the other ones.</li>
            <li> So, if you don&#x27;t eat healthy and have a fitness regimen, you can&#x27;t expect this product or any other to work.</li>
            <li> - you&#x27;ll definitely get your money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Andre Lorent Crazy Beautiful Cellulite Cream!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 3 days now and so far it has made my skin super soft!</li>
            <li> I am always skeptical of &#x27;to good to be true&#x27; products.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thicker cream that easily is absorbed into your skin, it has a very faint pleasant smell, almost sweet vanilla like minty...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t start using this product right away when I got it because I wanted to finish losing weight first after having my second baby.</li>
            <li> , this was very clean and did not leave any residue like other creams often do.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a few days, but so far I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
            <li> the arm I put it on is visibly smoother almost instantly which I think has something to do with the methyl nicotinate which works by dilating the the small blood vessels near your skin to allow more blood flow and fill out the skin better.</li>
            <li> My thighs are less dimply and my legs feel sooooo smooth!</li>
            <li> They are all nice and thick and spread very well.</li>
            <li> Product seems to work well for this older lady.  </li>
            <li> and I am getting older.</li>
            <li> No cream is ever going to totally get rid of cellulite without the person working out too, but this does appear to tighten up the problem areas quickly.</li>
            <li> Great stuff - not sure how long term the effects will be</li>
            <li> Love that this cream is free of parabens and unnecessary junk.</li>
            <li> Additionally, exercise helps in reducing fat cell size, stimulate circulation and removing toxins from the body which are the main culprits of cellulite.</li>
            <li> I normally only publish a review if it&#x27;s worthy.</li>
            <li> It made my skin feel very soft, but didn&#x27;t really see a difference</li>
            <li> could actually visually see some difference almost immediately after application (even the very first time).&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I have not used the product long enough to know if it actually reduces the appearance of cellulite, but it is certainly a good moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> but since I&#x27;ve been using this cream they are slowly but surely fading away !</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone thinking of purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> but I have high hopes.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for others.</li>
            <li> It is thick enough to really absorb into your skin in order to work it&#x27;s magic yet light to the touch.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is trying to tighten their skin or getting rid of cellulite.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product because of the high quality ingredients it is made of and it&#x27;s lack of harmful ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that it is free from parabens, SLS, and other chemical derivatives.</li>
            <li> It is non-greasy and I really like the face that it is free from parabens, SLS, and other chemical derivatives.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little more than a week.</li>
            <li> So far it seems to be working really well</li>
            <li> So far I really like &amp;#34;crazy beautiful&amp;#34; firming cream.  </li>
            <li> I think the real strength in this cream is in how soft it leaves my skin for hours after use.</li>
            <li> I assumed with all the great ratings I couldn&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> and I really like it so far.</li>
            <li> soft and very smooth.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I really did not see any change as far as the cellulite.</li>
            <li> So far I really like the cream.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any changes yet, but I&#x27;m sure it will take a few weeks for me to notice.</li>
            <li> I will provide an update after a few more weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> After using this cream for a few days I have noticed that my skin is smoothing out and my dimples aren&#x27;t nearly as prominent.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth trying for anyone looking for something similar.</li>
            <li> Hurray - because one thing I always disliked is mixing up too many scents -</li>
            <li> Cellulite cream is orderless with a nice thick luxurious feel.</li>
            <li> Really nice, thick cream.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very subtle and pleasant.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how quick the product made a difference on my face, especially my neck area.</li>
            <li> The product has no scent and is thick without being gooey – allowing for a precise application and quick absorption.  </li>
            <li> I applied it heavily and it absorbed quickly.  </li>
            <li> It goes on thick, smooth and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> It is thick and smooth almost like whipped cream and no unpleasant odor.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product for anyone with stretch marks, cellulite or any other places that need to be smooth.  </li>
            <li> My new fountain of youth in a jar</li>
            <li> I got a new cream by Andre Lorent for a review, and this is a cellulite cream that is firming for the skin.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin very smooth and I can see a small difference in the cellulite area.</li>
            <li> It seems to reduce the appearance of dimples, tighten the skin and has even made my skin very soft in the areas I have used it.  </li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to really see any cellulite reduction, my skin is soft, smooth, and supple.</li>
            <li> My skin is very soft after using this for a week.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive sense of smell and can&#x27;t use a lot of products because the smell is too overpowering.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin but haven&#x27;t had any problem with this product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin get irritated!</li>
            <li> After one month I just finished my first jar, and have ordered my second.  </li>
            <li> I am hoping to be consistent with this routine for a couple of months and hoping I see big changes.</li>
            <li> so I just had to guess at one and after reading reviews I decided on Andre Lorent Crazy Beautiful Cellulite Cream</li>
            <li> And I have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Crazy Beautiful Cellulite Cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am encouraged by the early results!</li>
            <li> After three days there was a marked difference!</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> This cream leaves your skin silky soft!  </li>
            <li> I have only been able to use for a few weeks, but I really like it.  </li>
            <li> It is completely grease-less!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m reviewing that it makes my skin soft!</li>
            <li> You apply it like regular lotion and it does dry very quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many, many, many cellulite creams in the past &amp; they&#x27;ve primarily been thick &amp; sticky, difficult to spread.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and am hesitant to try new creams.</li>
            <li> I have been pleasantly surprised by the new firmness in my skin.</li>
            <li> Lorent CRAZY BEAUTIFUL Anti-Cellulite Creme, and as pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would get rid of it, especially on the front, because my legs are pretty muscular and not fatty.</li>
            <li> The cream has a pleasant, faint smell.  </li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t spend this much on creams but this is so so so worth it!</li>
            <li> A product made from pure ingredients with a 100% money back guarantee - who wouldn&#x27;t want to give this a try?</li>
            <li> Been applying to my tushy and it may be too early to tell</li>
            <li> It is too early to tell if it works on cellulite.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;So far just started using this product, it smells great&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I am usually sensitive to caffeine when ingested, but I thought I would give this a try just to see.</li>
            <li> My skin does feel soft after application.</li>
            <li> This leaves my skin feeling so soft and supple.</li>
            <li> It completely absorbs within seconds.  </li>
            <li> I can notice a considerable softness to my skin</li>
            <li> Just began using the product, so far no results</li>
            <li> feel that Nivea had much longer lasting effect than this, though.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t know if it works or not because I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week, but it did come fast.</li>
            <li> So far..</li>
            <li> So far I like the scent  and texture but its too soon to see any results</li>
            <li> I like it so far ..</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve seen some improvement.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used three jars and have not seen any results.</li>
            <li> company specializes in natural formulations, and the ingredient list is quite</li>
            <li> I was completely surprised.  </li>
            <li> After reading what everyone has said about it I am suprised that no one has mentioned how INCREDIBLY soft it makes your skin.</li>
            <li> I like this cream so far.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant since I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I will see a difference, plus I will have soft skin.</li>
            <li> I apply on back of upper thighs and buttocks and being fragrance free is a big plus.</li>
            <li> However, I am a person with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Whenever I apply it, my hands feel so incredibly soft afterward.</li>
            <li> So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> abd have seen no improvement so far...</li>
            <li> I am still trying it out, but so far I can feel the tightening and firming.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and had no problem</li>
            <li> So far it is living up to it&#x27;s expectations.</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s too early to tell.</li>
            <li> but so far it seems to be working.</li>
            <li> It is soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> I am so self conscious about them.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft after applying the cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to use it on just one side for the next week and see if It&#x27;s just wishful thinking on my part or there really is a difference.  </li>
            <li> I like it so far,  </li>
            <li> and I was  so surprised to see smoother even skin.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin  feel so soft.</li>
            <li> Used now for several says, really like the product and how it feels on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too early for me to know if it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely ruining why the review system works.</li>
            <li> if you have sensitive skin like me.  </li>
            <li> Dimples on my thighs are gone and my thighs feel so soft.</li>
            <li> They use natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this cream.  </li>
            <li> but I like what I see so far.  </li>
            <li> May be it is still too early to review.</li>
            <li> Only use this a few days and love it .  </li>
            <li> Only a few uses in and a satisfied customer...</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say Mother Nature has not been kind to my behind.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a huge difference in less than a week!</li>
            <li> , this product goes QUICK and does not last long at all.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it a few days, but I am excited to see the results in a couple of weeks!</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t want a tight butt right?!?</li>
            <li> I decided to use this on my hands because they were really dry and starting to look they were aging quickly.</li>
            <li> Although I skipped a few days here and there, I still saw a significant change in my legs after the 1st 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I love how my skin looks after only using it for a few days !</li>
            <li> This cream has both retinol and caffeine in it which are the two top ingredients usually recommended to reduce/eliminate skin issues such as cellulite etc.</li>
            <li> Smell is a little bit odd, but the cream is nice</li>
            <li> I have tried other cellulite fighting products in the past much longer, and not been able to achieve the results I already have with this.</li>
            <li> and I have had no irritation from this product which is a major plus!</li>
            <li> Some other products have such a strong smell that I can only use them at bedtime.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints regarding my Crazy Beautiful Cellulite Cream that I have recently purchased, and i have NO regrets.  </li>
            <li> I have already used other products that promise similar things, most of them more expensive, and never got any results.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t wait to finish the other half, I&#x27;m ordering new one right now!!</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable given that other cellulite creams can be three times the cost.  </li>
            <li> Especially since it&#x27;s such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> leaving the area smooth.. only a few applications</li>
            <li> Actually some products that deliver real results FINALLY!</li>
            <li> i havent used enough in order to see any results, so i&#x27;ll have to leave a later review after i&#x27;ve the whole container</li>
            <li> Only negative is directions could be more indepth.</li>
            <li> i use it once a day after my workout shower  and msg it for few sec. :)</li>
            <li> Goes on thick and spreads easily.  </li>
            <li> I got more results than long term results from other more expensive products.</li>
            <li> I never expected to see some results this soon!</li>
            <li> I just received this product a couple of days ago, so I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to fully benefit from all that this product has to offer, but so far, I&#x27;m really liking it.  </li>
            <li> Its really thick, but goes on very smoothly and does seem to even out my skin, even after just the first few uses!</li>
            <li> The cream goes on smoothly and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely something I search for when looking for anything that I put directly on my skin.  </li>
            <li> So far i have only used it for 3 days</li>
            <li> It has no smell and it makes skin really soft, but she said it works just like regular lotion, nothing else</li>
            <li> I have only used the cream 3 times so far</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the lack of fragrance or medical scent.  </li>
            <li> I have only used it a couple of times, but so far I am please with the cream.</li>
            <li> I really never expected my cellulite to &amp;#34;disappear&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Looking forward to seeing how the end results on those &#x27;problem&#x27; areas in the near future.</li>
            <li> what&#x27;s behind me :).  </li>
            <li> This product is VERY reasonably priced compared to other products claiming to improve cellulite areas but this one is actually doing what it says it will do!</li>
            <li> I have also used it with my dermaroller a few times to make sure it can get deep down.  </li>
            <li> It also has a faint minty smell which is pleasant, but does not clash with any perfume or other scent you might be wearing.  </li>
            <li> and I would definitely recommend it to smooth your skin up, at least.</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase again in the near future.</li>
            <li> I have not had it long enough to use it all and see the results but my skin is very soft since using it.\\&quot;ich and creamy with a pleasing scent.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smooth and I was shocked at how much you get which is a lot!</li>
            <li> After using for a week and a half I really see the difference in my skin</li>
            <li> I have only been using for a few days but already see much smoother skin on my problem areas!  </li>
            <li> I am anxious to use it for a few more weeks to see if there is a change in my cellulite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this cream for a few days, but already I really like it!  </li>
            <li> The cream is thick but soaks in quickly for a lightweight feel.</li>
            <li> The cream is completely odorless, unlike some other creams, and is thick and rich.</li>
            <li> I have only been using the product for a couple of days but my skin really does seem less bumpy.  </li>
            <li> I have not had it long enough to use it all and see the long term results but my skin is very soft since using it.&lt;br /&gt;Non</li>
            <li> thick.. but easily absorbed.</li>
            <li> I have tried other creams and gels before and they never really soaked  in fast enough.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super thick but goes a long way!</li>
            <li> So, Im not sure where all these positive comments come from.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Some other gel formulas just don&#x27;t go as far and seem to vanish before you are even done applying.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few days, but i would highly recommend everyone to try it.</li>
            <li> First and foremost, I&#x27;ve given the product 4 stars only because I haven&#x27;t totally gotten rid of my slight cellulite on my thigh area yet (they&#x27;ve definitely softened and become less noticeable).</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in the past few days but skin is smoother .</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in the past few days but skin is smoother .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost done the whole jAr after a week and this cream is pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using long enough to see results but will update my review in the future.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cream,I just received this cream a few days ago</li>
            <li> this cream goes on smoothly, no smell, no irritation and has left my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of, I have a very petite and slim figure so my &amp;#34;problematic&amp;#34; area is quite small and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much this is helping me.</li>
            <li> Generally after only one or two applications of other brands of cellulite smoothing skin creams, my skin had become red/bumpy, and burned/stinged.  </li>
            <li> I put it on one arm and left the other arm bare,</li>
            <li> With Nivea, the condition of the skin remains the same even after washing (as long as you use the product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to see the results on my cellulite.  </li>
            <li> so it hasn&#x27;t been long enough to see any changes in my cellulite, but I&#x27;ll continue to use it</li>
            <li> Its pretty thick putting it on.  </li>
            <li> After I put it on pretty thick</li>
            <li> It was a pretty subtle odor, so definitely bearable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the pleasure of using other products from this company and find that the consistency with this cream is similar in that you need to rub it in, wait about 30 second for absorption, then rub it in again to prevent a white film.</li>
            <li> It definitely tightened my skin without leaving it dry.  </li>
            <li> it does not have any smell and also it helps me battle with my extra dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry bumpy skin on the back of my legs and this has improved the look and feel of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few days so far.</li>
            <li> I also love that it&#x27;s not filled with unnecessary perfumes, dyes and parabens.</li>
            <li> All it&#x27;s done so far is clear up some little dark marks on my bottom.</li>
            <li> The only reason I can assume it didn&#x27;t work like others praised it did was because my area was not a large enough issue.</li>
            <li> I seriously saw a difference in my skin after the first use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of shocked.  </li>
            <li> I received the cream a few days ago and am really pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> This cream has already improved those areas, so I can&#x27;t wait to see the long term effects.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long, yet, but my skin felt tighter immediately after putting it on.</li>
            <li> I have not had this product long, but a  for the one  </li>
            <li> Followed all directions &amp; used twice daily until the container was empty.</li>
            <li> Ladies if you have suffered a long time with cellulite like I have.</li>
            <li> Regardless, I still expected some type of improvement, so I recommend you trying a different product!</li>
            <li> Looking forward to seeing the difference after long term use.</li>
            <li> I look forward to seeing how this works long term on my legs.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long</li>
            <li> I have tried several and really not noticed results.</li>
            <li> The cream arrived quickly and I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but can already notice a subtle change in appearance.</li>
            <li> Maybe in the long run, it will do something?</li>
            <li> Will post for long term results.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to how well it does after using it long term.</li>
            <li> There was absolutely no greasy reside left after application.  </li>
            <li> made them smoother than they have been in a long time  </li>
            <li> Even though I have not been using it that long I can tell it is going to work</li>
            <li> Waste of money so far.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using that long</li>
            <li> Thick  and very creamy.</li>
            <li> This is a very thick cream with a faint pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> My skin was firmer with less dimpling in such a short time.</li>
            <li> Since I have only been using it for about a week, I can&#x27;t say that it has made my stretch marks and cellulite lines appear any less visible, but my skin definitely feels smoother, softer and firmer than before.  </li>
            <li> The product comes in a cream texture and white in color which is different than others I&#x27;ve tried which have typically been gels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days, and in addition to the cream I&#x27;m using a cellulite massager brush and upping my workouts, but the combined effect is clearly working and results are in part due to the product.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any other results</li>
            <li> I used to use FatGirl Slim but no matter how long I waited for it to dry on my skin, it was always sticky.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, which usually limits my ability to use fancy creams, but I have not experienced any skin irritations with the Andre Lorent Crazy Beautiful Cellulite Cream.  </li>
            <li> I went in to trying this with not very high expectations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little skeptical of cellulite cream, mostly because I have never tried one before.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see long term results!</li>
            <li> Much better than those expensive body wraps, and cheaper too!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see what long term results will be!</li>
            <li> Slowly but surely, I&#x27;m noticing small changes in my trouble areas.</li>
            <li> It has a very smooth texture and does not leave a an unpleasant greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> have cellulite on my thighs (front and back) and my behind, but I workout every day, don&#x27;t eat fast food, sweets or processed food.</li>
            <li> I noticed the different on my legs few days later.</li>
            <li> I just recently received your cream and have only been using a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days and have already seen a noticeable difference in the cellulite on the back of my thighs.</li>
            <li> Unlike some other products of the same type I&#x27;ve tried this one has a minimal odor and no burning sensation.  </li>
            <li> So far I like the cream and notice a small change</li>
            <li> Normally I never write reviews for anyone.</li>
            <li> Once worked in it normally only takes less than 5 minutes to fully absorb before the skin is dry so my clothes don&#x27;t stick.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely check out your other products!  </li>
            <li> Also, a little goes a long way, so it should last.  </li>
            <li> I only put on half of my stomach</li>
            <li> After only using it a couple of times I could tell that my cellulite has less dimples.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t trust reviews - in searching for a thermal firming cellulite cream that works, I&#x27;ve read the same exact reviews verbatim on different products from different manufacturers which leads me to believe that finding which review belongs to which product is nearly impossible.</li>
            <li> I noticed a slight difference after the second use.</li>
            <li> I have only had the product for a week and have seen a slight change.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a little over 2 weeks</li>
            <li> After two little ones, I am looking for any help I can get to get my body back.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a small difference, but nothing major.</li>
            <li> Using this on the outside of my thighs to fix a little cellulite problem.</li>
            <li> Only used a couple of days, but found it smoothed my skin in a little amount of time (must use a couple times a day).  </li>
            <li> but, since I am smell sensitive it makes it hard for me to use.</li>
            <li> Still have huge ugly fat pockets on my inner thighs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also gentle on my crazy sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am so shocked this has not gotten more attention.</li>
            <li> Even the worst area saw great improvement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this only a few days, so</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few days</li>
            <li> There has been some minimal tightening after I use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few days</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about 30 days now, the jar is almost empty</li>
            <li> I have a 6&amp;#34;: scar from a surgery a few years ago and have been purposely applying it to that area as well as the back of my thighs and stomach.  </li>
            <li> I have only used this product a few days but after day 2 my husband make a comment that it was already working.</li>
            <li> I have only had this product for a few days</li>
            <li> and I noticed results after a few days where the unattractive bumps of &amp;#34;you know what&amp;#34; were starting to minimize.  </li>
            <li> I have minimal</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any results yet, but I have only been using for a few days.</li>
            <li> It came in 2 days before expected delivery.</li>
            <li> and I am looking forward to the end results over the next few weeks.</li>
            <li> Only been using a few days</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will see the result before its empty .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times</li>
            <li> After only a few days, there was a noticeable tightening of the skin on my abdomen and thighs.</li>
            <li> After a few days of use the smoothness was definitely noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I have only used it for a few days</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and creamy and leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first, so I only used the cream on one leg</li>
            <li> I used this Créme from 5/22 thru 6/7/2015 with no positive changes on my thighs or buttocks.</li>
            <li> There are some improvements (nothing that happened overnight or that would be ridiculously noticeable), but I like what I see so far.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way with this cream</li>
            <li> My legs and hands feel softer then they have in a long time!!!!</li>
            <li> Since I wanted to &#x27;see&#x27; the results, I&#x27;m using it on my, shall I say, less than firm, upper arms instead of</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to stop using other cellulite creams because of the scent alone.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but I really do think this cream is working!  </li>
            <li> I was expecting it to be greasy like some of the other products like this that I have tried but not at all.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this cream for the past week</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost out already, and I&#x27;ve used probably every other day for three weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product also does not leave my skin greasy or sticky like all other products.  </li>
            <li> I had used other product, but not like this one.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> It is temporary like other creams.  </li>
            <li> Even though I weight train and CrossFit, I still have problem areas like all other women.</li>
            <li> After only a few uses I can already tell the difference in cellulite on my legs!</li>
            <li> I will def purchase again and try other products they offer.</li>
            <li> so I can use it for a while and on any other places</li>
            <li> I anticipate it to continue firming, as expected!</li>
            <li> I will definately purchase this again as well as other creams in this line....</li>
            <li> No irritation as with some other creams I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I know a lot of other people don&#x27;t mind that</li>
            <li> Too small not even enough to use for two to thee weeks .</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue like other creams.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unlike any other product out there.</li>
            <li> Not sure of results since I&#x27;ve only used it once.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for 2 weeks, the jar is just about empty and saw no results at all!</li>
            <li> I have tried other cellulite creams before within this price range and they have done nothing at all.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t smell bad and goes on easy.</li>
            <li> did see some reviews that stated that the cream was sticky or left their skin feeling sticky and personally I have not experienced this.  </li>
            <li> Was a little skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I need to go to Sephora or Ulta reviews to see which product is really recommended by users.</li>
            <li> Second, the creme is thick and non-greasy.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to the other benefits this cream is going provide for me!</li>
            <li> I have this crazy weird dimple directly in the center of my right bum cheek.</li>
            <li> Hello I&#x27;m writing this after i used half of it</li>
            <li> but I am seeing a slight lightning of color and shrinking.</li>
            <li> But, I pray that if I continue using this, it will be less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a slight change after about three weeks of using in the firmness of my skin.</li>
            <li> hope too have less Orange skin after I finish the treatment</li>
            <li> I have a slight amount of cellulite on my thighs.</li>
            <li> but I can already tell a slight difference.  </li>
            <li> i see a slight difference...</li>
            <li> and my thighs do feel slightly firmer.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed my cellulite looks less dimply.</li>
            <li> but I am already amazed that my cellulite is looking like it is less.</li>
            <li> Not real sure</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing a slight improvement to the problem area.</li>
            <li> Less dimples?  </li>
            <li> This is of no use, it has an odd consistency and it made my legs itch</li>
            <li> It helped with my black stretch marks and cottage cheese legs.</li>
            <li> the cellulite is less noticable.</li>
            <li> Can you imagine the mess &amp; staining?  </li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m still not a full week in-</li>
            <li> Also, a little goes a long way and there is hardly any smell.</li>
            <li> After a day it seemed the stretch marks were a little less noticeable.</li>
            <li> You can feel a slight tingle after a few minutes of application.  </li>
            <li> I have been using a little over a week twice a day</li>
            <li> Creamy feel and a little tingle.</li>
            <li> Although I just received this creme a little over a week ago I can tell that it makes my skin feel tighter.</li>
            <li> I have tried other cellulite creams in the past and not seem results.</li>
            <li> I think need a little help.</li>
            <li> had it faded a little.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little messy sticking your fingers in the tub every time.</li>
            <li> It take a little time to incorporate into skin, but does not feel greasy or heavy.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, don&#x27;t pin too many hopes on this product, or you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I only used this product a few times with a roller/massager after my bath/ shower, and I can see results already!!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a  light cream base and little fragrance.</li>
            <li> I expected it to do at least a little something on my cellulite and stretch marks</li>
            <li> The cream is not too heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> I received this cream a few days ago.</li>

            <li> I have used this for a few days now</li>
            <li> It has a faint scent that I cannot completely place.</li>
            <li> and I just wasted my money</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my trouble spots for about a month.</li>
            <li> In a few weeks when I have had longer to see results I will reevaluate.  </li>
            <li> And even after a few uses I think I can see some improvements.  </li>
            <li> Have used this product for a few days.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working on some trouble spots.</li>
            <li> Recieved this creme a few days ago.  </li>
            <li> Pros: felt like after a few of uses that my skin felt tighter.</li>
            <li> I can tell it have firm my thighs and the appearance of cellulite</li>
            <li> This product is suppose to firm and tighten your skin to diminish the cellulite in your body.</li>
            <li> Been using a few days now</li>
            <li> Lines are visibly reduced in just a few days of use.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this cellulite cream for a few days on some of my cellulite.  </li>
            <li> After using it for a few days I can already feel results.  </li>
            <li> and hopefully I&#x27;ll see some results in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I used this product for a month everyday twice a day.</li>
            <li> I just received my cream a few days ago.</li>
            <li> I received the Andre Lorent Cellulite Cream a few days ago.  </li>
            <li> I am seeing a lot less puckering where I used it compared to where I haven&#x27;t used it!  </li>
            <li> With other creams at least I felf heat, tingling...</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t greasy and no strong odor.</li>
            <li> No strong odors when applying or afterwards.</li>
            <li> yes - that&#x27;s how I felt the past few days</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a very nice smell.</li>
            <li> and I think a little smoother, too!</li>
            <li> Saw very little to no improvement.</li>
            <li> I like that it has no scent or very little if that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if the results will improve over time for me.</li>
            <li> I will keep on using it as the results usually improve with time.</li>
            <li> Wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after using the entire jar I&#x27;ve seen no change.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a small difference after a week of use.  </li>
            <li> is a plus that It is made in the US in a small upcoming company.</li>
            <li> Rec&#x27;d a few days ago!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not magic in a jar, so</li>
            <li> using it for a few days and notice a difference!  </li>
            <li> There are no magic</li>
            <li> It has no sticky residue, like some I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Not sure if its my imagination</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update with results in a few weeks!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Will post again in a few weeks for an update!</li>
            <li> Feels like regular lotion to me… very disappointed, not worth the money you could buy a moisturizing cream that does the same thing for less then $5.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smoothly no perfume or dyes.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing.</li>
            <li> I have seen no results, not even any firming usually I see at least that.</li>
            <li> Disappointed, I did have high hopes for this cream</li>
            <li> After I have used it for at least 3 weeks I will update my review</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not nice.</li>
            <li> The texture is thick, it is moisturizing.</li>
            <li> The cream is thick and feels luxurious when you apply it.  </li>
            <li> The product is thick and creamy and almost looks whipped.  </li>
            <li> and although it feels thick, I wasn&#x27;t worried about staining my clothes or anything</li>
            <li> Some were too thick, too smelly, too greasy.  </li>
            <li> The product is thick, creamy and does not leave an oily feel.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!!</li>
            <li> however my skin is no longer dry and itchy, with the cold days coming on.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have an awful lot, just hips thighs and a few dimples.</li>
            <li> Horrible product, does absolutely nothing !!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been very hard to take them away.</li>
            <li> It is a very thick cream, not runny like some.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t look nearly as tired.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for approximately one week</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly thin, but I still have them.</li>
            <li> I purchased this about a week ago, hoping for some dramatic results, that wAs not the case.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any dramatic changes.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very subtle and does not linger.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed  as reading the other reviews</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> The scent is faint which I appreciate.</li>
            <li> Maybe  using it wrong</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the cellulite is still there.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also sometimes leaves a weird residue that makes it look like my legs are peeling.</li>
            <li> My husband said I smell like a dog mouth or something weird..</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry</li>
            <li> When it comes to any cream/beauty product that claims to be &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; I am always skeptical.</li>
            <li> After 3rd time, even that I was never allergic, I had an horrible itch on one leg -</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had to stop applying it because it began causing rashes to the areas I used it on.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and even though I was skeptical I bought it -</li>
            <li> Thankfully it&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t  too expensive!</li>
            <li> my expensive body butters!  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, sorry!</li>
            <li> There is no tingling or unpleasant feeling</li>
            <li> Im very sad</li>
            <li> but they are really bad</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have bad cellulite.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell.</li>
            <li> I used to be so embarrassed to wear shorts during the summer because it was that bad</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> I saw the softness and plumper skin form where those ugly dimples use to be..</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen a difference :((.</li>
            <li> Kinda disappointed..</li>
            <li> Give it a try I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have any annoying perfumy scent.</li>
            <li> I have very bad cellulite on my thighs</li>
            <li> and you should order too - you will not be disappointed in this product!</li>
            <li> she said smell is horrible</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Fast delivery and cream works great!!!</li>
            <li> I love that Andre Lorent has multiple creams. They are all nice and thick and spread very well. I&#x27;m a little skeptical of cellulite cream, mostly because I have never tried one before. I&#x27;ve had this only a few days, so I can&#x27;t tell you how well it works for cellulite just yet... however my skin is no longer dry and itchy, with the cold days coming on. Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Feels great on the skin without feeling too heavy or oily and absorbs into the skin nicely. Been applying to my tushy and it may be too early to tell but so far things are looking good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this 2 times a day for about a week now and I&#x27;m already starting to notice smoother skin. It&#x27;s a thicker cream that easily is absorbed into your skin, it has a very faint pleasant smell, almost sweet vanilla like minty... it&#x27;s hard to explain it smells good, unlike most products like this the container is actually completely full all the way to the top, and overall it&#x27;s pretty awesome. I also did some looking up of the ingredients, because it seems to work extremely fast at smoothing out skin. I put it on one arm and left the other arm bare, the arm I put it on is visibly smoother almost instantly which I think has something to do with the methyl nicotinate which works by dilating the the small blood vessels near your skin to allow more blood flow and fill out the skin better. Which basically means the wrinkles go away quickly :) All in all it is pretty good stuff!</li>
            <li> Hello I&#x27;m writing this after i used half of it… it really works I&#x27;m gonna buy it agn for sure !!!  it reduce my cellulite significantly !!! can&#x27;t wait to finish the other half, I&#x27;m ordering new one right now!! love it love it love it !! ( my advice : take a Good pic of ur self then compare u absolutely will ADORE the result ) i use it once a day after my workout shower  and msg it for few sec. :)</li>
            <li> I am loving this cellulite cream. I Love the way it feels on my skin. The cream is not too heavy or oily. My skin does feel a bit smoother and firmer since I&#x27;ve been using it. I do look forward to see the results of this great effective product. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 3 days now and so far it has made my skin super soft! It absorbs nicely. I haven&#x27;t seen a big difference in my stretch marks yet but they are really bad so I want to try it for awhile longer. So far it seems to be working really well though and I would definitely recommend it to smooth your skin up, at least.</li>
            <li> arrived as stated, no complaints</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for almost a week and I can see a difference!  Totally recommend!  I am going to try their face moisturizer next!!  :)</li>
            <li> I received the cream a few days ago and am really pleasantly surprised. The cream is completely odorless, unlike some other creams, and is thick and rich. It spreads onto your skin very smoothly and evenly so you can really get your money&#x27;s worth. Some other gel formulas just don&#x27;t go as far and seem to vanish before you are even done applying.  The cream is also so very moisturizing! I didn&#x27;t even need my regular lotion, so in fact it&#x27;s doing double duty! The results are also very impressive. Those bumps and dimples really seem to fade away right before your eyes! There is no tingling or unpleasant feeling if you are wondering how the caffeine might feel on your skin. I have gone through tubes and jars of other products without any great results, but this one really seems to do the job. Yippie! The cream is also non-greasy so you do not feel tacky or sticky after use.  Another plus so you don&#x27;t have to wrestle your jeans or leggings on. It is also free of petro-chemical derivatives, parabens and sodium lauryl sulfate - all nice bonuses!</li>
            <li> I have not used the product long enough to know if it actually reduces the appearance of cellulite, but it is certainly a good moisturizing cream. I appreciate that the scent is extremely mild. It is absorbed quickly and leaves skin supple.</li>
            <li> This cream is light and not greasy. It has a very mild fragrance that does not linger. The cream goes on smoothly and is quickly absorbed by the skin. One can actually feel the skin tightening after the cream&#x27;s application. I have had several pregnancies and this cream tightened the skin on my abdomen. I look forward to continued use of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the fact that a percentage of the purchases are donated to underfunded research agencies. The company is family owned and operated in the US.</li>
            <li> I have only used this cream for a couple of days, but I&#x27;m looking forward to using it to see how it works over time.  I was immediately impressed with the full to the top of the jar product!  When was the last time you opened a jar of cream and it was full to the very top?  Love the smell and texture of the product also.  I will be happy to come back after using it for a full month and let you know what I think.  So far, so good :)</li>
            <li> So far I really like &amp;#34;crazy beautiful&amp;#34; firming cream.  It has a very pleasant  scent, it is not too greasy, and I&#x27;ve noticed some changes in my skin with just a few uses.</li>
            <li> Purchased last week and have been applying to stretch marks from having two kids. Not enough to see drastic results but I am seeing a slight lightning of color and shrinking. Also love the feel, very silky and smells yummy too.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I saw a difference the next day. I will telling all my friends about this great product</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. I love it. It goes on very smoothly no perfume or dyes. It contains Retinol, which I believe you cannot use while you are pregnant or nursing. Check with your doctor. It is too early to tell if it works on cellulite. I will update. It looks very promising.</li>
            <li> My first purchase of cellulite cream I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. I have sensitive skin and am hesitant to try new creams. No problems! No redness, itching or irritation. Very light scent, which is important as a nurse, strong scents are forbidden. My skin felt smoother after the first application.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cream,I just received this cream a few days ago and I love it,great moisturizer,and completely odorless.This product works as it says it does,I could feel my skin fighting after the first application.I will definitely be buying more.I would highly recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> This in one of the best cellulite creams I have ever used.  I will recommend this to all my friends.  Thanks for he great product</li>
            <li> This is really nice. I use it twice a day. A little goes a long way. I am using it on my thighs and bottom. My skin feels much softer and looks smoother. I am looking forward to increased results as I continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Product seems to work well for this older lady.  I wish a product like this existed in my younger days.  Well worth a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for two days but I am already seeing results. It is like my skin has been smoothed over in a photoshop app. I rub this creme all over once in the morning and again in the evening. Its not only working on celulite, it is even working on my stretch marks! I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after I use this for a week.</li>
            <li> Great product, wonderful ingediants. Feels awesome!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  My new fountain of youth in a jar</li>
            <li> I just love this product. Have been using it since I received it about a week ago and it is just wonderful. Absorbs wonderfully. Can&#x27;t wait to see the results in another week or so.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly - will follow up with whether or not it makes a difference.</li>
            <li> This cream is quite amazing.  I have used many cellulite cream and this is my favorite so far. It is a very thick cream, not runny like some.  The scent is nice too. Light, not over powering which means it doesn&#x27;t fight with my perfume.  I&#x27;ve had to stop using other cellulite creams because of the scent alone.  It&#x27;s not sticky which means i can put clothes on right away.  The first time i used it i noticed a tightening of my skin right away. I&#x27;ve only used this a few days, but i would highly recommend everyone to try it. Especially since it&#x27;s such a reasonable price. I will update this post after i use this cream a while longer.  I&#x27;m sure the results can only get better as i continue to use it</li>
            <li> Have tried the product for 4 days; The consistency is perfect, there is no fragrance which is a bonus and I love what is contains. Can&#x27;t wait to see what it can do.</li>
            <li> Works really good at smoothing out the bumps on my legs</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;So far just started using this product, it smells great&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was given the wonderful opportunity to sample this product at a very low cost and I might say I love this stuff no lie.. I feel my skin tightening for some reason and how smooth this product is is just wonderful. I love it .</li>
            <li> This is Ms. Foster and I&#x27;m so happy with this product! The only downside is the packageing I&#x27;d rat her it be in some kind of squeeze tube. It&#x27;s a little messy sticking your fingers in the tub every time. But otherwise I&#x27;m excited to see even my stretch marks are fading.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but I really do think this cream is working!  It is very creamy and non greasy and feels great on your skin.  It is for sure making my skin softer and I think a little smoother, too!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t impressed. Didn&#x27;t see any difference at all.</li>
            <li> I used it 3 times  already  and I really  like  how my face feels after using it. So for I&#x27;ve  seen no change  yet (but I feel it will). I like it!</li>
            <li> I have never used a product like this before. I guess after having 2 babies so close together, I&#x27;m learning that my body has changed. I was very impressed with the packaging. It comes in a nice box that looks like something you would purchase from a spa or specialty store like Sephora. I opened it up and tried it out. It&#x27;s very lightly but pleasantly scented. The smell reminds me of a spa or nice salon. I read that the product is made with retinol and caffeine. I am usually sensitive to caffeine when ingested, but I thought I would give this a try just to see. I&#x27;ve never heard of using caffeine in lotions, but thought it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try. I&#x27;ve used it twice and I feel fine. The lotion goes on very nicely and leaves your skin feeling smooth. I haven&#x27;t noticed any drastic changes yet, but I will update my review in a couple weeks if it works and change it to 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This cream is very light and does not have a heavy perfume scent, both are great for me. I have been using this product now for about 10 days. It makes my skin very smooth and I can see a small difference in the cellulite area. It is very moisturizing and that is also very important. I would buy this product again!</li>
            <li> Just what my post baby body needed! I held off on my review to see how it worked. I&#x27;m one week in and seeing positive changes. I will definitely check out your other products!  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I have tried the&lt;br /&gt;Andre Lorent CRAZY BEAUTIFUL Anti-Cellulite Creme, and as pleasantly surprised. I was expecting it to be greasy like some of the other products like this that I have tried but not at all. The odor was not too strong either,I will keep trying this and see if I see any results from it or not. I will keep you updated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Lynn Sheets</li>
            <li> I received this cream a few days ago.While it is too soon to see results in cellulite reduction, I do notice a tightness and tingling feeling after application.  This cream overall has a nice smell and goes on smoothly.  My skin does feel soft after application. I really like the fact that it is free from parabens, SLS, and other chemical derivatives. I will update to 5 stars after time if results are seen.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, great quality product.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this cream.  It has a pleasant smell and after I apply it, I can feel it working on the areas where I applied it.  I have only been using it a few days, but I am excited to see the results in a couple of weeks!</li>
            <li> The cream is nice and nongreasy. Didn&#x27;t have any annoying perfumy scent. Didn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin get irritated! Will continue to use this awesome product!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in the past few days but skin is smoother .</li>
            <li> This product works as it says.  I could feel my skin tightening after the first application of the cream on my thighs.  I then decided to try it on the inner side of my upper arms too.  I took pictures before and again after two days of applications.  I was amazed to see the difference when comparing the pictures. My skin was firmer with less dimpling in such a short time. I will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Only use this a few days and love it .  Will buy this again when I run out ...Great prduct.</li>
            <li> I love that it is a product made in the USA, not too many of those lately.  I have only been using it for a few days but it is very easy to use.  The cream doesn&#x27;t leave you sticky/tacky; glides on smoothly and is immediately absorbed into the skin.  Looking forward to seeing great results as it is already improving my skin in these few days.</li>
            <li> I love this cream!  I have only been using for a few days but already see much smoother skin on my problem areas!  This is a very thick cream with a faint pleasant smell.  It absorbs very well, leaving no greasy or oily feeling on skin.  I am amazed that I have already seen a difference in my skin.  I just turned fifty this year and I am more self conscious of my thighs and stomach.  This cream has already improved those areas, so I can&#x27;t wait to see the long term effects.  Definitely recommend for anyone wanting to smooth out problem areas.</li>
            <li> This cream is so nice and smooth! It has a nice pleasant scent but isn&#x27;t over powering. I also love how quickly it rubs in. I have tried other creams and gels before and they never really soaked  in fast enough. Or left me feeling sticky. This leaves my skin feeling so soft and supple. I have also noticed a difference in the way my things and stomach already looks. And it&#x27;s only been 3 days! I usually don&#x27;t spend this much on creams but this is so so so worth it! Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Very nice cream. I haven&#x27;t used it long, yet, but my skin felt tighter immediately after putting it on. My skin was soft and the lotion smells very nice, too.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping for amazing results but I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a change. I&#x27;m still going to use it because I&#x27;m still am hopeful.</li>
            <li> I have not had this product long, but a  for the one  I have use  it I am loving it. Cream smells nice, not like other  products. I use  2 times  a day, and  always apply in the morning at at night. Can&#x27;t wait to finish th  product so I can add  to my review.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Does not leave a greasy residue on your hands.  It helps with the area that you apply the cream to.  Results are quick too.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my mom. She is really seeing a difference on her legs. So much of a difference that my dad is now using it with her. Can you please bring this product back to amazon. I would love to buy her some for mother&#x27;s day.  Thanks ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this cream and I like the idea that it has retinol and caffine and hoping it works well on my problem areas. Will provide an update soon!</li>
            <li> I like this product. Nice consistency. I haven&#x27;t seen any changes yet, but I&#x27;m sure it will take a few weeks for me to notice.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this cream for the past week so I cannot accurately say it has changed the texture of my skin.  The cram though is rich and has a fresh soft fragrance.  It completely absorbs within seconds.  I plan to add more to my review  as I use more of this cream.</li>
            <li> Great Cream-so rich &amp; feels good!  I have seen on the Internet(it must be true!) that caffeine is good for cellulite. And to stand in the tub &amp; put coffee grounds on your thighs.  OK! Can you imagine the mess &amp; staining?  Great idea in this cream-no mess-no bath tub staining. Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> I started using the cream and a cream in conjunction with a toner spray, &amp; I can&#x27;t believe how much younger I look. My under eye area is much clearer and I don&#x27;t look nearly as tired. It&#x27;s affordable, so I&#x27;m buying it for my mother too. I&#x27;m 51, and she&#x27;s 75.</li>
            <li> Disappointed. It&#x27;s been almost a month and haven&#x27;t a difference at all. Thankfully it&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t  too expensive!</li>
            <li> No result seen yet, but very mild and comfortable, not irritating, good recipe</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product. I like that it&#x27;s a  light cream base and little fragrance. I works well I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> After three weeks of continues daily use, I have noticed improvement in the area applied.</li>
            <li> Great thick cream! I need to use more to see results but this product feels very well made. The scent is faint which I appreciate.</li>
            <li> This product worked better than I anticipated that it would. It is a short term thing though so it will not keep it&#x27;s effects when you stop using the product. Keep this in mind. It is not a a substitute for exercise or diet or anything &amp; does not give plastic surgery type results so please don&#x27;t expect that. It helps smooth things out some of the lumps &amp; bumps that are a bit unsightly in the form of cellulite. If you expect this you will be pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple months. I have seen a wonderful improvement in  my legs and stomach.  It has tightened the skin where applied. I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> this cream is great I started to notice smoother skin right away</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! It works just like it should. Lines disappear.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  Bikini season can&#x27;t get here soon enough!  Will order again and you should order too - you will not be disappointed in this product!</li>
            <li> This cream is very smooth and it sinks into your skin pretty good. Slowly but surely, I&#x27;m noticing small changes in my trouble areas. However, I have such a large area to cover, I&#x27;ll need another one, lol.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice. Not greasy. Works best for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I can notice a considerable softness to my skin and I can see firmness starting to happen</li>
            <li> well It is not working out for me any more not 100% happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Just began using the product, so far no results but it&#x27;s been 4 days!  Will update in 30 days when I have some more substantial evidence :)</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s smooth and light.  It does leave you all sticky.  I can recommend this cream and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Just ordered this, used for 2 days now and I swear it already seems to be working!  Nice and light, fluffy and not bad smelling.  I had a follow up email from supplier and am very impressed with customer service,</li>
            <li> I use a cellulite reducing product occasionally and I have used the Nivea serum last Summer and it did have a very good results on me. When I was going to order another one this Summer, I first decided to browse around to see what else is out there. After seeing so many good reviews about this product, I went ahead and ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of, I have a very petite and slim figure so my &amp;#34;problematic&amp;#34; area is quite small and the cellulite there, although visible, is not bad.&lt;br /&gt;So I guess my case would be easy, esp. if the product works. And comparing this product with Nivea, here&#x27;s what I have seen so far:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The product does not smell, which is what I love about it.&lt;br /&gt;It appears to have simpler ingredients than Nivea... and the label says no parabens, so definitely a plus.&lt;br /&gt;You could actually visually see some difference almost immediately after application (even the very first time).&lt;br /&gt;But I started seeing some improvements after a week of use (twice daily)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I feel that Nivea had much longer lasting effect than this, though. With continuous use, Nivea&#x27;s results seemed to be a bit more permanent than this.It appears that the texture of your skin changes when you wash it off. With Nivea, the condition of the skin remains the same even after washing (as long as you use the product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if the results will improve over time for me. It&#x27;s only been a little over 2 weeks since I got this.&lt;br /&gt;But if for better results, it is not meant to be washed off, then I&#x27;ll have to use Nivea when I go swimming or something of that sort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still gave it 4 stars because the results are almost the same as Nivea (except when I wash it off), and I like its ingredients better.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using it and add more feedback later, if there&#x27;s any changes to what I have said here.&lt;br /&gt;But I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> The texture is thick, it is moisturizing. I just started using it, I will update when I finish the jar</li>
            <li> The cream smells good and it feels cool on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints regarding my Crazy Beautiful Cellulite Cream that I have recently purchased, and i have NO regrets.  It absorbs well, I use it along with my Cellulite Massager Brush Mitt by Scala Beauty.  After a couple weeks of use, I have noticed my &amp;#34;dimples&amp;#34;&#x27; diminishing!  What a relief, I&#x27;m not a young&#x27;un any more.  I will definitely purchase again in the near future.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t know if it works or not because I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week, but it did come fast.</li>
            <li> Literally amazing! You will have tighter skin after one use!</li>
            <li> This is a great product to minimize the appearance of cellulite.</li>
            <li> I have seen no results, not even any firming usually I see at least that.</li>
            <li> Saw very little to no improvement. I bought the massager brush with it. Still have huge ugly fat pockets on my inner thighs. Used it twice a day.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the many positive reviews this product has but i have to say that one tub probably wouldn&#x27;t show much effect, might get 2 more tubs to try and see if it works.</li>
            <li> Used a whole jar already and have not noticed anything.  I applied it twice a day,  work out 4 times a week with no results. I don&#x27;t have much cellulite either so I hoped I would notice  a difference with all the good reviews on here.  There is no scent and it absorbs quickly though which was nice. Overall, I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> After one month I just finished my first jar, and have ordered my second.  For a cellulite cream I feel that it does pretty well.  My legs are firmer and the dimples are filling in.  Even though I&#x27;m aware I need to do certain exercises for a more permanent solution I am definitely happy with this product.  Unlike some other products of the same type I&#x27;ve tried this one has a minimal odor and no burning sensation.  I would say that my results with it are also better than the other ones.</li>
            <li> I have used this product a few times now and I am now a fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T Well, I am a size 4/6 and I am getting older. Let&#x27;s just say Mother Nature has not been kind to my behind. I have used this for a few days now and I have seen some results. I do the following massage the product into my thighs and buttocks twice a day and doing 10 crunches and pli&amp;eacute;s. It could be because I am now exercising but I am noticing a difference. I see that the cellulite is not as dimply. I can definitely see something happening! Now I know eliminating cellulite altogether may be too much to ask. But, I pray that if I continue using this, it will be less noticeable. That is all I can ask, and so far, I am seeing AMAZING results.</li>
            <li> Everything perfect. good deal!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for two days and I can se some improvement on my legs. The cream is not greasy at all (wich I love) and dries out very fast. I am using it twice a day with a massage mitten. And I can see improvement. I am hoping to be consistent with this routine for a couple of months and hoping I see big changes. So far.. The best cream I have used...</li>
            <li> This product is a miracle and it works wonderfully.Love this product.</li>
            <li> No results yet.  I also bought this company&#x27;s eye creme.  Both products absorb well.  Perhaps my wrinkles and/or cellulite are not severe enough to make any noticable difference.  Customer service is very nice and good followup.</li>
            <li> Love it! ....It works and there&#x27;s no mediciney smell. This is my second order!</li>
            <li> I did not see a change.</li>
            <li> This cream has multiple ingredients that soften and tighten skin to improve its appearance.  It has a creamy texture and a fairly neutral fragrance, so it is pleasant to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions are to rub it into the skin on the problem areas with a circular motion once or twice a day.  Massaging the skin promotes circulation, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The safety-sealed jar holds a full 4 oz.  Some cellulite creams come in much smaller containers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andre Lorent Lifestyles provided cream for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:  Aqua (water), Helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, glyceryl stearate, cetearyl glucoside, cetearyl alcohol, glycerin, caffeine, xanthan gum, Butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter, methyl nicotinate, retinol, phenoxyethanol, potassium sorbate.</li>
            <li> I lost a considerable amount of weight through eating healthy and exercising. It&#x27;s very important that  I  maintain a healthy weight, as  I used to have full blown Type 2 Diabetes. I am much more healthy right now but I have cellulite on some areas of my body that bugged me for the longest time! I was very happy that I was given the opportunity to try Andre Lorent&#x27;s Cellulite Cream. It&#x27;s also gentle on my crazy sensitive skin and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> I work out, clean diet and drink lots of water. I used product for one month, good absorption, smell  good, but I didn&#x27;t feel any change in my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a week and so far I am happy with the results. I will keep on using it as the results usually improve with time. I hope they develop the same formula in a gel, which are easier to apply</li>
            <li> Using for 2mc with diet,gym 5 times a week and massage. No changes on my skin what&#x27;s so ever.Disappointed, I did have high hopes for this cream</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product does not work I have been using a little over a week twice a day and there has been no difference at all jergens firming lotion works so much better and it&#x27;s only 5 dollars at walmart</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days, and in addition to the cream I&#x27;m using a cellulite massager brush and upping my workouts, but the combined effect is clearly working and results are in part due to the product. No cream is ever going to totally get rid of cellulite without the person working out too, but this does appear to tighten up the problem areas quickly. Which, in the middle of summer, is a godsend. I would definitely recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> This cream did not seem to make any visible difference in appearance of cellulite after 4 weeks (the time it took to use all that was in a jar). When contacted for information, the seller/maker would not disclose if the percentage of retinol was at the level (or above) recommended by Mayo clinic.  The seller also makes a point that they give a percentage of their profits to charities, but when asked, would not disclose which charities it gave money to.</li>
            <li> I just finished the jar, and didn&#x27;t notice any difference from before I started using it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting, nor have I received, a miracle in a jar when I purchased this. There has been some minimal tightening after I use it. I think the real strength in this cream is in how soft it leaves my skin for hours after use. It has a faint scent that I cannot completely place. (Cinnamon and something else???) I&#x27;ve had the pleasure of using other products from this company and find that the consistency with this cream is similar in that you need to rub it in, wait about 30 second for absorption, then rub it in again to prevent a white film. I will keep using this product and will report back if I notice better results with more time.</li>
            <li> I think this stuff is great. I&#x27;ve only used it a few days but my legs already feel smoother. I love the smell too, it&#x27;s somewhat minty- it makes me feel like I&#x27;m at a spa. Great customer service too, I recieved a very nice email after purchase that surprised me. Pleasant experience all around!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen a difference :((. Maybe  using it wrong</li>
            <li> I do have cellulite and I have been using this cream to give me a boost into getting rid of the cellulite. I love Andre Lorent products and this is no exception. Don&#x27;t forget to try out their makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of cellulite creams and this One is really awesome I just wish they would come out with a bigger jar But this cream is well worth the money</li>
            <li> My skin has shown improvement since using this cream.  One jar one month of use FYI.  I was concerned I would break out becaue I have so many allergies.  No reaction to is.  It goes on nice and smooth and is absorbed right away.  I noticed a difference after the first jar.  Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> I can feel this product work!  I have been using this for 50 days and I see a difference.  I like it!</li>
            <li> Followed all directions &amp; used twice daily until the container was empty. Saw no results at all. Wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 4 days now and have noticed definite improvements already.  It seems to reduce the appearance of dimples, tighten the skin and has even made my skin very soft in the areas I have used it.  I am optimistic that with continued use I will see even better results. I will provide an update after a few more weeks of use.  I am very happy that I went with this cream in comparison to the others because it is a small business and they genuinely seem to care about their product as well as customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Great product. Already seeing good results after two weeks--just in time for bikini season. When used with the scala beauty massager, it works even better!</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;m on day 6 using Andre Lorent Cellulite cream 2x a day.....so far I&#x27;m pleased and see benefits as time goes on, This cream seem to work with cumulative use....so we&#x27;ll see how it goes. Will keep you posted at day 30!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for 2 weeks now and I am seeing results. Scent is great. Will be ordering again</li>
            <li> I got this cream 2 days ago and have been putting it on 2 times a day on my stomach and stretch marks (I had a baby in December) and I&#x27;m hoping to reduce the visability of them. So far I like the scent  and texture but its too soon to see any results but my skin feels moisturized. I will be buying it again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a new user, but it&#x27;s a good product!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do much for me I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference. Not to happy.with product.</li>
            <li> Well, didn&#x27;t see any impact</li>
            <li> I like it so far .. my skin look firmer .</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet bc I&#x27;ve only had the creame a few days but the creame is very smooth and smells great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much this is helping me. I use the cellulite massager brush mitt to rub it in most of the time. I have noticed a slight change after about three weeks of using in the firmness of my skin. Granted, I also work out five days a week. I had issues with birth control that caused me to have weird-looking cellulite on the fronts of my legs. I also have the standard cellulite on the backs (top) of my legs. I was hoping this would get rid of it, especially on the front, because my legs are pretty muscular and not fatty. Unfortunately, the cellulite is still there.&lt;br /&gt;Also, this product goes QUICK and does not last long at all. I&#x27;m almost out already, and I&#x27;ve used probably every other day for three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;It also sometimes leaves a weird residue that makes it look like my legs are peeling. I probably won&#x27;t be reordering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for about 4 days now.  So far I&#x27;ve seen some improvement.  The cream has a pleasant, faint smell.  Once you rub it on, it absorbs and does not leave any oils on your skin.  Will continue to use this jar with hopes of alot of improvement.</li>
            <li> Updating in the second purchase: still buying it! It is great!   Very good product! I have already used other products that promise similar things, most of them more expensive, and never got any results. This was really works. On the top of that, the smell is great! I recommend.</li>
            <li> I read someone&#x27;s comment before I order she said smell is horrible but I bought it bcz I didn&#x27;t know that smell was really horrible. My husband said I smell like a dog mouth or something weird.. I won&#x27;t buy it again and I just wasted my money</li>
            <li> A truly amazing  product! Ladies if you have suffered a long time with cellulite like I have. ....you no longer have to. It really  does eliminate the dimples and lumps....leaving the area smooth.. only a few applications and you see results. ..I can wait to order again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend this product. So far I&#x27;ve used three jars and have not seen any results. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference...</li>
            <li> great customer service. good product, but i think i need more time to determine if it works. doesn&#x27;t smell bad and goes on easy.</li>
            <li> Great stuff - not sure how long term the effects will be but if you have an event or are prepping for summer I&#x27;d recommend a container or two, I&#x27;m on my second and it feels great and makes sense</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! My thighs are less dimply and my legs feel sooooo smooth! My husband even noticed!</li>
            <li> Still using it and seeing improvement love it! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I got a new cream by Andre Lorent for a review, and this is a cellulite cream that is firming for the skin. The container is a good size – 118 ml or 4 oz, so it will last a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream can be applied 1-2 times a day to the areas where you have cellulite – leg/thigh/buttocks areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream contains retinol and caffeine. Retinol is great in diminishing the appearance of dimpled skin. Caffeine aids in reducing fat content in cells if you apply it on the skin. I think for me I have never used caffeine in the form of a cream, so it is very interesting to see this ingredient as one of the main ingredients in this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company specializes in natural formulations, and the ingredient list is quite straightforward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this cream for some time now on my legs where I have some cellulite, and I think that the skin tone improved a lot on the legs. I don’t think it is that easy to get rid of cellulite altogether just with a cream, but it definitely improves the skin tone on my body!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the texture of the cream, it feels like butter or whipped cream when I apply it on my skin. It feels very light, is not greasy at all, but at the same time it is able to soften my skin on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product for free for a review.</li>
            <li> seems to work pretty quickly, very light weight but you definitely need to rub it in for a minute or so</li>
            <li> I have had this for about a week now and I use this every night with Scala Beauty Body Slimmer brush. I have also used it with my dermaroller a few times to make sure it can get deep down.  I am seeing great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been working out for about a year now and just couldn&#x27;t get rid of my cellulite.  I have tried so many products that claim to be &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34; but just didn&#x27;t work.  Some of those companies even offered me free products if I were to reorder.  But I didn&#x27;t since they DID NOT work.  But this Andre Lorent Cellulite Cream lives up to the title of THE BEST!!!!  10 Stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course there is the fact that I am seeing results in a week, I&#x27;m sure it could be more if I used it twice a day that the instructions recommend.  This product also does not leave my skin greasy or sticky like all other products.  Once worked in it normally only takes less than 5 minutes to fully absorb before the skin is dry so my clothes don&#x27;t stick.  That is one of the best things that I look for in a lotion.  And there is not much of a smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for making such a great product.  Can&#x27;t recommend it enough, I am now a loyal customer!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this cream on my thighs, especially the outer, upper portion of my thigh and it really seems to be making a difference.  It also faded the stretch marks on my stomach and inner thighs as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the whole jar, but have not noticed much results...</li>
            <li> will try it this week, just arrived today, excited to see how it will work.</li>
            <li> Been using this cream twice a day for a week now and it definitely deserves 5 stars. I am almost swimsuit ready.</li>
            <li> Works great and a great price!</li>
            <li> I only used this product a few times with a roller/massager after my bath/ shower, and I can see results already!!! This really works!!!</li>
            <li> Does nothing at all. I don&#x27;t even have bad cellulite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased with Amazon many times but have never given a review. I had to share my opinion of this product. To my surprise, It really works! I used it once a day (twice when I remembered) for 30 days . Although I skipped a few days here and there, I still saw a significant change in my legs after the 1st 2 weeks. I was completely surprised.  It&#x27;s been about 30 days now, the jar is almost empty but I love the results! Definitely will reorder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few days now and I have to say I&#x27;m pretty impressed! I never expected to see some results this soon! I also love how it feels on my skin. It&#x27;s nice &amp; smooth and a little goes a long way and it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue, which I love! It smells great too!</li>
            <li> This cream is worth every penny I use it with my waist trainer I will honestly keep buying it over and over I loved the results!!!! Oh and excellent presentation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my trouble spots for about a month. It does seem to tighten you up. I&#x27;ll keep using this because it&#x27;s about the only one I&#x27;ve found that works.</li>
            <li> I really noticed a difference IMMEDIATELY after using this the first time.  My skin tingled and felt like it was tightening up (in a good way), w/in a minute of applying it.  I have a 6&amp;#34;: scar from a surgery a few years ago and have been purposely applying it to that area as well as the back of my thighs and stomach.  I am hooked on this product and have started to see a noticeable improvement in all areas including where the scar is.  It feels like the dimpling is not as deep and that i will continue to see improvements with ongoing use.  This product is VERY reasonably priced compared to other products claiming to improve cellulite areas but this one is actually doing what it says it will do!</li>
            <li> Love this product line! You won&#x27;t be sorry</li>
            <li> So far..so good..this cream goes on smoothly, no smell, no irritation and has left my skin very soft. I am anxious to use it for a few more weeks to see if there is a change in my cellulite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this cream for a week now &amp; I&#x27;m already startling to see results very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> nope nope nope. does not work. Although it is very moisturizing it does nothing for cellulite or stretch marks! Feels like regular lotion to me… very disappointed, not worth the money you could buy a moisturizing cream that does the same thing for less then $5.</li>
            <li> Really wish this had worked for me for the price, but oh well, now I know.</li>
            <li> I used this Créme from 5/22 thru 6/7/2015 with no positive changes on my thighs or buttocks. However, I used it on my neck and to my surprise the results were amazing.  The wrinkles on my neck disappeared and looks quite smooth. I wish it had worked as well on my thighs &amp; buttocks.</li>
            <li> I purchased this about a week ago, hoping for some dramatic results, that wAs not the case. The directions say to use it twice a day which I&#x27;ve been doing and have seen no results, I&#x27;m also dissappointed with the size. I&#x27;m almost done the whole jAr after a week and this cream is pretty expensive. It also doesn&#x27;t smell to good. I prob won&#x27;t be purchasing this again</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t work with me</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t start using this product right away when I got it because I wanted to finish losing weight first after having my second baby. But once I did start using this I definitely noticed a difference! I love it and will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li> So, Im not sure where all these positive comments come from.&lt;br /&gt;I have cellulite on my thighs (front and back) and my behind, but I workout every day, don&#x27;t eat fast food, sweets or processed food. This cellulite got built up during college. This is my first anticellulite lotion, and I hoped for some result but I can&#x27;t say that I see any. If you have good stubborn amount of cellulite, its better to go to a salon, because this won&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;The cream it self is ok, no smell, no grease, very light. They recommend to apply a good amount when massaging your areas of concern. I tried not to tho (i&#x27;m very tall so i thought this cream will be gone in a day). There were also couple of days I didn&#x27;t have time to put it on, anyway this lasted me about three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t reorder again</li>
            <li> I have used a whole contain of  this product and am about to purchase another. After reading what everyone has said about it I am suprised that no one has mentioned how INCREDIBLY soft it makes your skin. Even if it did nothing else, which by the way it does firm up all the lumps and bumps, just the softness itself would have me begging for more!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I noticed the different on my legs few days later. I had used other product, but not like this one. Great lotion, fast result, worth the money.</li>
            <li> did not see any results</li>
            <li> Good stuff&lt;br /&gt;But i ran out too quickly...,</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use anti cellulite creams very often but this one was great. It smells good and it gives your skin a boost. It doesn&#x27;t last forever (no cream does) but it&#x27;s good for the summer.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much difference.  Also, make sure you wash your hands after application because if you get any on your face, it burns!</li>
            <li> After reading all of the positive feedback about results, I was very hopeful and excited to try this cream.  Unfortunately, after using the entire jar I&#x27;ve seen no change.</li>
            <li> So far so good! You can tell the company really cares for their customers and are happy to answer any questions. I have been using it on my stretch marks and have noticed an improvement!</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing.  I seriously saw a difference in my skin after the first use.  After turning 50 I noticed my skin starting to look 50, sagging, dimpled and wrinkled.  I read in one of my magazines that a cream with caffeine and retinol would help.  I went to Amazon and started searching.  There are a ton of creams out there that say they help with cellulite so I just had to guess at one and after reading reviews I decided on Andre Lorent Crazy Beautiful Cellulite Cream and so glad I did!  I use it on my upper arms, belly, bottom and thighs.  I am also exercising and watching what I eat which I am sure are helping also but I can really tell a difference in how my skin looks and feels with this cream.  I will not let myself run out.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a week now, so far I love what I see!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have only been using Andre Laurent for a couple of weeks . I love the texture of the cream and the scent is light and fresh. I am delighted with this product thus far! I will  have to determine its success after a month or so.</li>
            <li> Thick  and very creamy. Makes my skin feel great.</li>
            <li> Ive been using it for just 2 weeks and I think it really works!, complemented it with a cellulite massager brush and Im seeing results</li>
            <li> Love it.....saw results about a week of using! I&#x27;m a fitness competitor... Definitely recommend for anyone stepping on stage.....</li>
            <li> I love it  Will buy it again</li>
            <li> I have been pleasantly surprised by the new firmness in my skin. I am always skeptical of products with great benefit claims but tried this one because of the caffeine and retinol combination and now I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> I have been using the cream for only 5 days and my skin is smother and firmer, hope too have less Orange skin after I finish the treatment, I will let you know!</li>
            <li> So far so good.  After two little ones, I am looking for any help I can get to get my body back.  This cream goes on smooth, isn&#x27;t oily.  I have noticed a small difference after a week of use.  I will continue with thsi cream for sure!</li>
            <li> I assumed with all the great ratings I couldn&#x27;t go wrong with this product. I was looking for something to use while exercising to boost my results in addition to motivate me to keep going. This cream did NOTHING for me. I used it consistently as directed until the product was gone with no results. I have a slight amount of cellulite on my thighs. The only reason I can assume it didn&#x27;t work like others praised it did was because my area was not a large enough issue. Regardless, I still expected some type of improvement, so I recommend you trying a different product!</li>
            <li> The lotion was nice, I liked the smell, not too strong but It didnt do anything about my cellulite :( Im very sad</li>
            <li> I ordered this and the eye cream from Andre Lorent, and I have to say...his products ROCK! Actually some products that deliver real results FINALLY! I have immediately noticed the cellulite on my thighs improve, and I honestly haven&#x27;t had it very long yet. I think with continued use this may be my Holy grail product for fighting cellulite. I have tried other cellulite fighting products in the past much longer, and not been able to achieve the results I already have with this.Have to say as a side note, I LOVE the Andre Lorent eye cream as well. I had not heard of Andre Lorent before a friend of mine introduced me to it, and with how good I look and feel with his products so far..I am so shocked this has not gotten more attention. Well Andre Lorent, you have certainly made a believer out of me, consider me a lifetime customer, VERY pleased!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice cream, smells good. I&#x27;ll update when I&#x27;ve used it longer to report on any cellulite reduction.</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to really see any cellulite reduction, my skin is soft, smooth, and supple.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product a few days but after day 2 my husband make a comment that it was already working. I am super excited to keep using it to see even better results.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in the past few days but skin is smoother .</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this cream is free from parabens and only uses pure ingredients.  This is definitely something I search for when looking for anything that I put directly on my skin.  I have only had this product for a few days but I can already tell a slight difference.  Retinol cream and caffeine are considered to be the key ingredients in any cellulite cream.  Looking forward to seeing the difference after long term use.</li>
            <li> I love the creme... it smells good and has a nice consistency to it... thick.. but easily absorbed. So far i have only used it for 3 days but i only used it on 1 leg so i could compare them... i see a slight difference... this makes me happy... i will most def recommend to anyone with cellulite.</li>
            <li> I like this cream so far. In a few weeks when I have had longer to see results I will reevaluate.  Pretty much like everyone else I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell. And even after a few uses I think I can see some improvements.  I love this brand.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing well worth the price which is also amazing</li>
            <li> I received it a week ago and i usted it immediately ! I love how my skin looks after only using it for a few days ! And Feels great on the skin without feeling too heavy or oily and absorbs into the skin nicely.&lt;br /&gt;And is a plus that It is made in the US in a small upcoming company.</li>
            <li> I have used this every night for a week and it appears to be making my skin softer and smoother</li>
            <li> Love this  stuff!!!  I could tell it was working from the first use.  Everyone that has any cellulite should give this a try, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I like the texture. It&#x27;s rich and absorbs easily and is scentless which BIG for me. I recently started using this cream and see a difference already! Btw..My name is Valerie!</li>
            <li> I really love this cellulite cream. I have some cellulite on my thighs so I use this on my thighs. So far I feel my thighs are looking better. I also really love how they have retinol as one of its ingredient since retinol are suppose to goes deep into your skin so I feel this makes the cream better.</li>
            <li> Great packaging!  Fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;Great size product!&lt;br /&gt;Feels great and I can feel it working!&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend! !!</li>
            <li> I love this Company!! I have purchased another item from this company and was very impressed and happy! I have been using this product with hope that it would work because i have tried others that really didn;t help me...WELL this one does!!! I am in shock how well this product worked on my Cellulite. I used a pressure massage to rub in this product making sure to rub it deep into the skin and i use it twice a day. I saw the softness and plumper skin form where those ugly dimples use to be.. I am sure the longer i use it the more i will see lasting results!! If i could bathe in this stuff i would lol that is how great it is!!</li>
            <li> Rec&#x27;d a few days ago! Love it already! Goes on smooth and absorbs quickly. I am beginning to see results too, with only 4 applications. Can&#x27;t wait to see long term results!</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery, safe secure packaging. Very creamy. No perfume odor. Have used this product for a few days. I was hesitant since I have sensitive skin. Feels great! Creamy feel and a little tingle. There is a definite tightening of skin. Great 4 oz jar with a good price. With these results, why pay $80+ for 1 oz?</li>
            <li> I really like this cream! It is very nice and seems to work!!</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and my skin feels so soft. I&#x27;ve noticed a small difference, but nothing major. Im sure with continue use and exercise I will see a difference, plus I will have soft skin.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. The texture is amazing, I can see results as my skin is already smoothing out.</li>
            <li> Wow, what a nice, thick cream that rubs easily into skin!  I was amazed at how full the jar was too - brimming with cream.  And it&#x27;s free from parabans, which I love.  While I haven&#x27;t used it long term, I&#x27;m very impressed with how it feels and the fact that there is really no smell to it (I have a sensitivity to many smells).  I look forward to seeing how this works long term on my legs.</li>
            <li> I just received my product today. I am very excited to try this item out. I&#x27;ve never used a firming product before and I can&#x27;t wait.&lt;br /&gt;. A  lot of items contain  perfumes, which I cannot use and this product does not have any. Thank you so much for this opportunity.</li>
            <li> Great product! Seems to be working on some trouble spots. Excited to keep using it for even better results!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Very happy I tried it</li>
            <li> Looks like this will be wonderful addition to my beauty routine. Smells good too.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Isn&#x27;t greasy and no strong odor. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Feels amazing on the skin! And I have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> The cream absorbs well, it is not greasy, I will use it twice a day and see if it helps diminish the cellulite.  I will post another review in a month.  I have been using it for two days now.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing,..everybody could be try it, it really work.</li>
            <li> Recieved this creme a few days ago.  Its pretty thick putting it on.  It has no sent, which is really helpful.  After I put it on pretty thick and I rub it in using a circular motion.  Its leaves my skin super soft.  In fact with the extra from my hands I just sort of rub it into my hands and my hand feel like they have a layer of protection, almost better then my expensive body butters!  My legs and hands feel softer then they have in a long time!!!!</li>
            <li> Day 5 of applying two times a day as suggested and already see visible results! I apply on back of upper thighs and buttocks and being fragrance free is a big plus. I&#x27;m really excited to see results after a month. Very pleased with purchase :)</li>
            <li> I am enjoying the Andre Lorent Cellulite cream very much. The cream leaves my skin feeling silky smooth, not sticky at all. There is no odor either , so it does not compete with your perfume. I highly recommend it to anyone thinking of purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> This cream is like silk in a jar! It goes on so smoothly and absorbs quickly. I am looking forward to smoother thighs very soon!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;This product is pretty amazing. I have used it 4 times now and I am very impressed. I used it on my thigh and bum area. I only did one side so I could compare the two thighs. The first application felt somewhat tingly. Successive applications just left my skin feeling taut and smooth. I was skeptical at first but I am a believer now. I will continue to use this product.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, which usually limits my ability to use fancy creams, but I have not experienced any skin irritations with the Andre Lorent Crazy Beautiful Cellulite Cream.  Generally after only one or two applications of other brands of cellulite smoothing skin creams, my skin had become red/bumpy, and burned/stinged.  Not with this one!  The cream is thick and feels luxurious when you apply it.  Unlike other creams, it absorbs really nicely and does not leave a greasy film on your skin.  Since I have only been using it for about a week, I can&#x27;t say that it has made my stretch marks and cellulite lines appear any less visible, but my skin definitely feels smoother, softer and firmer than before.  It&#x27;s not magic in a jar, so I don&#x27;t expect those lines to just disappear after only a week, but I definitely plan on continuing to use this cream.</li>
            <li> I never thought there could be a miracle for my sagging underarm skin after losing over 100lbs, but this is it! My arms have become MUCH firmer, the sag is &amp;#34;leaving the building!&amp;#34; In addition, my skin is MUCH softer and my stretch marks are lightening a great deal. I have only used this product a bit over a week, therefore, I can&#x27;t even begin to imagine what will happen after continued usage of Andre Lorent Crazy Beautiful Cellulite Cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More positives: Andre Lorent Crazy Beautiful Cellulite Cream is NOT greasy, has no unpleasant odor, and you do not need to apply a lot.</li>
            <li> I started using the Andre Lorent CRAZY BEAUTIFUL Cellulite Cream recently and love it!  After applying the creamy lotion you can almost feel your skin tingling and I noticed results after a few days where the unattractive bumps of &amp;#34;you know what&amp;#34; were starting to minimize.  While I&#x27;m still not a full week in- I am encouraged by the early results!</li>
            <li> My skin is very soft after using this for a week.</li>
            <li> Although I just received this creme a little over a week ago I can tell that it makes my skin feel tighter. I know that is will take prolonged use to really see a difference but i think I will give it a shot. Thank you.</li>
            <li> As I put the cream on my thighs felt a tightening sensation feels soft has a pleasant scent. It did not burn or itch my skin I don&#x27;t have much cellulite I have minimal so lets see the result because you do have to give everything time but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product now for a week and my thighs do feel slightly firmer.  The cream goes on smoothly and a little goes a long way.  My skin is noticeable softer after using the cream. The product has a neutral smell which is nice because scented products tend to trigger my allergies.  Overall I am pleased with the product and I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Smells and feels good.  Haven&#x27;t used it long but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Love the consistency of this cream</li>
            <li> Feels sooooo good on my skin..Can&#x27;t wait for good results :)</li>
            <li> great product and works real well</li>
            <li> Moisturizing for sure. Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any other results</li>
            <li> I started using this cream 2 days ago and I can already see a difference.  I love that is does not have some sort of strong smell to it.  It makes my skin feel smooth and firmer.  I cannot wait to see what happens after a longer period of time.  I recommend this to anyone wanting to try a cellulite cream.  The price is really good too!!</li>
            <li> I love this cream! It&#x27;s thick and creamy and leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Love that this cream is free of parabens and unnecessary junk. I am really looking for to trying their face cream.</li>
            <li> After using this cream for only a day I noticed visible results. When it comes to any cream/beauty product that claims to be &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; I am always skeptical. I have tried several and really not noticed results. To my surprise here is one that actually works! My main purpose was to try it on significant stretch marks and mild cellulite dimpling. After a day it seemed the stretch marks were a little less noticeable. I only put on half of my stomach so I could compare the sides. After three days there was a marked difference! The reddish color had diminished to more of a skin tone. Many had disappeared on the outside edges. Even the worst area saw great improvement. The skin was smoother, softer and more even. Can&#x27;t wait to see the improvement after using for a longer period. The moisturizing properties were amazing! I also like that it is free from Parabens, sodium Laurel Sulfate and petroleum based derivatives. I am also sensitive to some scents and this had a very pleasant, mild and almost unnoticeable scent out of the jar. Once applied, there was no noticeable scent. I also appreciate that it is in a tub so I can only use the amount I want.</li>
            <li> I tried this right after receiving it and could feel the tightening in my skin.  It is thick and smooth almost like whipped cream and no unpleasant odor.  Really made my skin soft and smooth and will likely order more after this is gone.  Would recommend this to anyone who wants smoother, firmer skin.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. It absorbs really fast without feeling greasy. I love the scent its really subtle but its amazing.</li>
            <li> Pros: felt like after a few of uses that my skin felt tighter. This product also a good moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I did not care for the smell. It was a pretty subtle odor, so definitely bearable.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> LOVEEEE it!!! It is amazing and I would recommend anyone to get it!</li>
            <li> Cellulite cream is orderless with a nice thick luxurious feel. I have not noticed any results yet, but I have only been using for a few days. However, I am a person with sensitive skin and I have had no irritation from this product which is a major plus!</li>
            <li> I am always skeptical of &#x27;to good to be true&#x27; products.  It works!  I noticed a marked improvement after the first use!  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have cellulite patches on my thighs that I used to be embarrassed to show but since I&#x27;ve been using this cream they are slowly but surely fading away ! I will continue to use and come back with an update in 1 month !</li>
            <li> Creamy, silky smooth, moisturizing.  It does not have a fragrant smell, which I liked because it doesn&#x27;t conflict with perfumes, or other body scents.  I have not used it long enough to see the results on my cellulite.  I have quite a bit of cellulite for it to work on.  I will continue using the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for approximately one week and I&#x27;ve been very pleased with it so far.  It is advertised as a cellulite cream, helping to hide the cellulite wherever you have an issue.  I waited a full week of use before posting because I wanted to be sure I was giving a fair and accurate review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say with certainty now that it works as described.  You won&#x27;t get amazing results on day one.  Like most creams, the more you use it, the better your results.  After one full week of daily use I&#x27;m very pleased with the look of my thighs, which is my biggest problem area.  It has also helped to visibly reduce the stretchmarks I have after my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I have seen some improvement in my stretch marks which I think will increase as I continue using it. More than anything, it works great at making skin extremely soft! Whenever I apply it, my hands feel so incredibly soft afterward. It is definitely worth trying</li>
            <li> Been using this cellulite cream for a week once a day. I can tell it have firm my thighs and the appearance of cellulite is better. Maybe I should use twice a day for quicker results. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I liked this cream. Very mosturizing easy to use. Worked well.</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Been using it for a few days and notice a difference!  Amazing product!! Reduces dimples, cellulite and my stretch marks. Will be ordering more soon! Thank you for this awesome cream!</li>
            <li> I am not the most consistent with lotions, creams, etc.  I always forget to use them.  When I have used this product, I have noticed a bit of smoothing of the skin.  It is temporary like other creams.  The smell is nice and it absorbs very well and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I just recently received your cream and have only been using a few days. I love that there is no odor as most creams a&lt;br /&gt;have fragrances and are very overpowering with their scents. I have been putting it on my skin and immediately felt a difference. My  skin is smoother and softer already. I am glad I sent for this and will use regularly.</li>
            <li> Luxurious creamy!  Pleasant light scent.  Goes on thick and spreads easily.  Energizing</li>
            <li> I love the Andre Lorent Crazy beautiful cellulite cream! It rubs in awesomely! It is smooth and has a nice smell. It does not dry up on the skin because it soaks in beautifully! I am seeing an excellent result in just the few weeks I have been using it!</li>
            <li> Nice cream. It&#x27;s moisturizing and has a nice consistency.</li>
            <li> I applied 3 times. After 3rd time, even that I was never allergic, I had an horrible itch on one leg - I had to wash it to stop it. I will throw away this cream.</li>
            <li> While 72 hours does not give me a lot of time to talk about how this product works, I can tell you it is a nice cream and leaves my skin soft. I have noticed my cellulite looks less dimply. It absorbs into your skin well and does not have a scent. After I have used it for at least 3 weeks I will update my review but I am already amazed that my cellulite is looking like it is less. Thank you</li>
            <li> Cream doesn&#x27;t do a thing. Saw no change</li>
            <li> This has really helped. I can already see a difference. Thank you</li>
            <li> This product was fantastic!!  Amazing how well it worked!!!  I will keep buying for sure!!!</li>
            <li> OMG! this is great:D I would&#x27;ve posted a before and after picture but within the first time I used this it made a big difference. 2nd time, all gone!:o Would recommend this:) it really works!</li>
            <li> Waiting for resulatats .</li>
            <li> First and foremost, I&#x27;ve given the product 4 stars only because I haven&#x27;t totally gotten rid of my slight cellulite on my thigh area yet (they&#x27;ve definitely softened and become less noticeable). Even though I weight train and CrossFit, I still have problem areas like all other women. Exercise greatly reduces problem areas due to muscle building and strengthening and is required in order to really see results. Additionally, exercise helps in reducing fat cell size, stimulate circulation and removing toxins from the body which are the main culprits of cellulite. So, if you don&#x27;t eat healthy and have a fitness regimen, you can&#x27;t expect this product or any other to work. There are no magic potions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this product is fantastic. From first use, I noticed the skin on the areas applied (glutes and thighs) were super soft and really toned in texture. The product comes in a cream texture and white in color which is different than others I&#x27;ve tried which have typically been gels. The active ingredients are Retinol and Caffeine which are known to be great in fighting cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it is a cream, it&#x27;s best to massage your problem area with a cellulite brush/roller after bathing and then applying the cream. You apply it like regular lotion and it does dry very quickly. Not only that, there isn&#x27;t a strong scent so you can use it anytime of the day or night. Some other products have such a strong smell that I can only use them at bedtime. So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this cellulite cream from the company for review purposes</li>
            <li> Really did not see any improvement. Kinda disappointed..</li>
            <li> I liked this cream alot, it wasnt sticky or greasy. It helped make stretch marks fade, and cellulite area&#x27;s disappear.</li>
            <li> I just bought this product and I really like it so far. I used to use FatGirl Slim but no matter how long I waited for it to dry on my skin, it was always sticky. I was skeptical at first about Andre&#x27;s product because it goes on like a cream, not a lotion, but it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky even when it&#x27;s really hot and humid. And my skin just drinks it in. I can&#x27;t comment on the &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; results yet since it&#x27;s only been a week but I have high hopes.</li>
            <li> I have been using about a week abd have seen no improvement so far... I&#x27;ll update this if that changes but if you are reading this then i have still saw no difference... It smells good though</li>
            <li> Not real sure if it really works, it&#x27;s a nice cream and I use it where I need it most, but I diet and work out all the time, so not necessarily a real issue with me...just wanted to &amp;#34;touch up&amp;#34; some areas and thought I&#x27;d give it a try! I don&#x27;t really believe in any miracle cream or pill!! But I do believe in eating right, exercising, and looking the best you can!</li>
            <li> got it for my wife. It has no smell and it makes skin really soft, but she said it works just like regular lotion, nothing else</li>
            <li> I bought this product about a month ago. I have very bad cellulite on my thighs it&#x27;s not nice. I&#x27;m fairly thin, but I still have them. It&#x27;s been very hard to take them away. I but this with hopes of getting some results I don&#x27;t want to say it&#x27;s not working, but I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference, maybe I need longer time using it. I feel it didn&#x27;t do much. But I will see if I continue using it.</li>
            <li> Started using this product  the day I received  it twice a day, I haven&#x27;t seen any results yet....</li>
            <li> I am holding my opinion since I just started.  Please ask me in about two or three weeks than I&#x27;ll give you my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Feels great and nice light clean scent. Happy about my purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with this cellulite cream so far! I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days and have already seen a noticeable difference in the cellulite on the back of my thighs. This cream has both retinol and caffeine in it which are the two top ingredients usually recommended to reduce/eliminate skin issues such as cellulite etc. I&#x27;ve used a popular spa brand meant for eliminating cellulite that costs triple the price of this, and didn&#x27;t work as fast or as well as this does. Everything about this cellulite cream came as a good surprise to me and I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I decided to use this on my hands because they were really dry and starting to look they were aging quickly. The cream softened my hands and they look smoother and younger than before .</li>
            <li> I have only used one time but I am already amazed.  Very moisturizing and skin felt refreshed immediately.  I could feel it absorbing into my skin.  Super excited about this product and will continue to use.  I highly recommend</li>
            <li> Very smooth formula &amp; easily absorbs into skin! Great product!!</li>
            <li> I normally only publish a review if it&#x27;s worthy. This is stuff is amazing! I have noticed a huge difference in less than a week!</li>
            <li> This product is suppose to firm and tighten your skin to diminish the cellulite in your body. I am still trying it out, but so far I can feel the tightening and firming. I think this product is going to work great.</li>
            <li> I have tried other cellulite creams in the past and not seem results. I went in to trying this with not very high expectations. WOW! After two days I noticed a huge difference. My skin was softer, smoother and strech marks were already lighter. I highly recommend for others.</li>
            <li> This is the best cellulite cream I&#x27;ve ever tried.  My skin feels so amazing and smooth.  I can&#x27;t believe how fast it works.</li>
            <li> This is a top quality product. I couldn&#x27;t believe the results in such a short period of time. Highly recommended purchase!</li>
            <li> I just received this cream couple days ago,  but I already love it.  It&#x27;s not too fragrant,  not greasy at all.  Goes on really silky.  I&#x27;m excited to continue using it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a week now and i must say it is simply amazing! I can already see the difference in the appearance of my thighs. They are much smoother in appearance and my skin feels more toned. I will definitely continue this product and i have told my family and friends about it, great job Andre...its.crazy beautiful results!!!😁</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Not greasy easy to use. I have sensitive skin and had no problem</li>
            <li> After using this cream for a few days I have noticed that my skin is smoothing out and my dimples aren&#x27;t nearly as prominent. I have noticed that they are starting to disappear all together. I recommend trying this product because I know you will love it.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive nose and many products with fragrance give me a headache. Very pleasant smell and a really nice thick cream that isn&#x27;t greasy or oily feeling. That&#x27;s another thing that is important to me. To feel more weightless. Seeing results already. Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> This cream leaves your skin silky soft!  I also love that it&#x27;s not filled with unnecessary perfumes, dyes and parabens. Works great on stretch marks and cellulite.  Will definitely be purchasing again</li>
            <li> The cream arrived quickly and I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but can already notice a subtle change in appearance. It&#x27;s odorless, not greasy and makes skin soft and smooth. I use it along with exercising and drinking lots of water which helps to see results.  Can&#x27;t wait for more time to pass to see greater changes.</li>
            <li> Refreshing scent, this was very clean and did not leave any residue like other creams often do.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft and so far works great. Only been using it for about a week now.</li>
            <li> Nice consistency, and is odorless. Been using a few days now and I am starting to notice a difference. So far so good:)</li>
            <li> I was thrilled with this product.  I have tried similar cellulite creams but didn&#x27;t get the results I was looking for. This product works!!  In the 3 days I used Andre Lorent cellulite cream I got more results than long term results from other more expensive products.</li>
            <li> The cream smells really nice to me and has a good consistency. It provides a nice protective barrier and moisturizes. It does nothing for the cellulite. I don&#x27;t really have an awful lot, just hips thighs and a few dimples. It doesn&#x27;t do anything. But as a moisturizer its great. I use it for my hands also. Maybe in the long run, it will do something? I doubt it, but if it does, I will revise the review.</li>
            <li> This cream is wonderful. It works great used as directed, but it also does wonders when you slather it on, and make a &amp;#34;wrap&amp;#34; with some plastic wrap. Much better than those expensive body wraps, and cheaper too!</li>
            <li> Great Product!! Just received it and already can tell a difference. Very smooth. Better than the Jergens firming lotion I was using. Bonus is it is odorless.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Great Product ! I love the smooth feel to this cream. It has no sticky residue, like some I have used in the past. It leaves my skin feeling soft and fresh. It has a very light clean fragrance&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a few days, but so far I&#x27;m happy with the results. My skin is noticeably softer and smoother. The cream absorbs quickly and is not greasy or sticky. It has a very light, almost unnoticeable scent which for me is great. Another plus is that it is paraben free.  So far it is living up to it&#x27;s expectations.</li>
            <li> I did see some small results in the first day. The cream is thick but soaks in quickly for a lightweight feel. It doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell. It contains two of the best ingredients for combating cellulite, retinol and caffeine. Only been using for two days. Will post for long term results.</li>
            <li> Silky smooth, spreads very easily. I see improvement in skin firmness.</li>
            <li> Great product!  No bad odors and feels nice and smooth when applying it. Feels good on my skin. I have sensitive skin and am happy to say no reaction from this productm am starting ti see a difference in the texture of my skin</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see a difference. But it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> When I first opened the jar, the smell was odorless which is a plus because most of these creams are overpowering.  The application of the product went on smooth and evenly and I could feel it working.  After one day, I noticed a difference in the tightening of my skin.  I recommend this product for anyone with stretch marks, cellulite or any other places that need to be smooth.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> This was a very effective cream. Combined with a few herbal supplements to tackle the fat from the inside, it really helped me get rid of the cellulite.</li>
            <li> I have only been able to use for a few weeks, but I really like it.  It is very creamy and seems to tighten the skin.  I would recommend it and look forward to continued use of this product.</li>
            <li> I use this along with my work out to get rid of this baby belly. My skin seems a bit smoother but I think it&#x27;s too early to tell. But I am getting another jar :)</li>
            <li> Received this cream this week and LOVE it!  It isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; and feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li> I just got this cream last week and started using it immediately. I have already noticed a change in how the skin on my thighs looks after just 7 days. Definitely going to keep using.</li>
            <li> Just received this and am still trying it out but so far it seems to be working. Love the way it makes my skin feel after using it. Will reevaluate once I&#x27;ve used it for awhile.</li>
            <li> Priced right!  This cream actually does what it says!  Reduce that cellulite!  Yep!  I&#x27;m all over this one!  Love!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this about a week now and I&#x27;m beginning to see some results already, very promising. The cream itself is very nice no bad smell and readily absorbed. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smooth and I was shocked at how much you get which is a lot! Also very nice smell.</li>
            <li> Great! The customer service alone deserves 5 stars</li>
            <li> Great results so far, my skin is so smooth! Can&#x27;t wait to see what long term results will be!</li>
            <li> I have just started using this product and as results take time, I can review what I have experienced so far.  The product is thick and creamy and almost looks whipped.  It is easily absorbed by skin and is not greasy at all.  As soon as the product is absorbed, you can feel the difference in the skin.  It is soft and silky.  There is a very mild, pleasant aroma, with an underlying hint of cinnamon maybe. Overall I am pleased with this product and will continue to use it, goodbye cellulite!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I am very happy with the Andre Lorent Cellulite Cream. My skin feels plumped up&lt;br /&gt;and soft and very smooth.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The creme is very smooth and easy to apply. the scent is very minimal and is good.  I have used it for over a week now.  It is a good product</li>
            <li> Not my favorite cellulite cream.  It doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly</li>
            <li> This product is great! Within a week I saw a huge difference. It firms the skin right up and makes it look much smoother. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Normally I don&#x27;t review things until I have used them for a while, but I was SO happy and impressed with this, I couldn&#x27;t help but share my experience.&lt;br /&gt;I have stretch marks on my sides and stomach from gaining weight. I am so self conscious about them. I actually put this on and within ONE DAY my stretch marks started to fade. I had actually only put them on only one side just to see the difference. I could not believe it. I will faithfully buy this cream until I die with results like these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you have cellulite OR stretchmarks, this stuff works! And boy does it work quickly, too!</li>
            <li> So far I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> i havent used enough in order to see any results, so i&#x27;ll have to leave a later review after i&#x27;ve the whole container</li>
            <li> This is a great product! Its really thick, but goes on very smoothly and does seem to even out my skin, even after just the first few uses! It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, which is really nice!</li>
            <li> This cream I have also used for abt a week now.  The difference is amazing in just a few days I can see that the stretch marks ard generally much lighter !</li>
            <li> Another great product from an excellent company.</li>
            <li> Great product! LOVE!!!</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me. I was really hoping to see some sort of difference but i didnt</li>
            <li> I have only used the cream 3 times so far and I must say I love it! It feels like the real deal and I am excited for the results. I am already showing signs of improvement. This cream with a healthy diet and the right amount of exercise is a wonderful combination! And the fact that you have been able to donate money to small underfunded charities here in America makes the purchase even better.Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> I do believe I&#x27;f I continued to use this product it would&#x27;ve helped my cellulite because I started seeing some improvement. Unfortunately I had to stop applying it because it began causing rashes to the areas I used it on. I am not allergic to anything and there was nothing labeled on the container that stated what was in the actual cream. I had to throw it away. Dissapointed</li>
            <li> Really nice, thick cream. I like that it&#x27;s sealed inside the box. I&#x27;ve worked in retail before and seen people stick their fingers into jars to try the product but with the seal, you know it&#x27;s untouched.&lt;br /&gt;No scent and although it feels thick, I wasn&#x27;t worried about staining my clothes or anything I touched.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m excited to see results!</li>
            <li> Got this and love it, I can feel the effect...fast shipping. Thanks</li>
            <li> This is the first cellulite cream I have used and I&#x27;m rather impressed. I noticed results within three days of using.</li>
            <li> I love this cream it is NOT greasy but creamy and it goes on smooth. It rehydrates your skin and makes your skin feel great!</li>
            <li> So far I love this product. It smells great, is smooth going on and does not feel heavy. Makes my skin feel tighter and I can&#x27;t wait till I use this product for a couple of weeks!</li>
            <li> After using for a week and a half I really see the difference in my skin&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this cream for a few days, but already I really like it!  The smell of it is great - I have a very sensitive sense of smell and can&#x27;t use a lot of products because the smell is too overpowering.  The scent of this is perfect - very light and clean smelling!  It goes on easily and leaves my skin so soft.  I&#x27;ve already noticed a difference in the feel of my skin - I update the review after I been using it a bit to see if I notice a difference in the appearance of my skin.  And a little goes a long way with this cream - you&#x27;ll definitely get your money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and makes my skin feel freat</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the feel of the cream... It is not to greasy ... My skin looks softer and SMOOTHER ... Thus far awesome results!</li>
            <li> I just started using this product. I love that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, it&#x27;s very subtle and pleasant. The lotion itself is very cream and light. Absorbs easily.  Can&#x27;t wait to see results!</li>
            <li> I just received this product a couple of days ago, so I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to fully benefit from all that this product has to offer, but so far, I&#x27;m really liking it.  The texture is just right, not too greasy.  Also, a little goes a long way, so it should last.  I can&#x27;t wait to how well it does after using it long term.</li>
            <li> Item arrived fast and is described.  Customer service was quick and helpful with a question I had.  No smell to cream which is great.  Will update later with results.</li>
            <li> Love this cream! Love the clean smell! Love that it is working and I&#x27;m seeing results!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve used this cream for 3 days. I&#x27;m seeing a slight improvement to the problem area. It&#x27;s enough of an improvement to keep me using this product. Love the fact that there are no parabens, petro-chemicals or SLS! Thanks Andre Lorent!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! After only a few uses I can already tell the difference in cellulite on my legs! You have to try this product!</li>
            <li> I just recently received this product and have started using it.  The cream is packaged nicely and easy to open.  The packaging colors are vibrant and refreshing.  The cream itself has very little fragrance which is great!  I am very impressed by the texture of the cream - light and whipped.  It spreads easily on the skin and absorbs fairly quickly.  I apply the cream in the morning after my shower and at night before bedtime to my butt, thighs and stomach areas.  Since it has only been a couple days of use, I of course do not see an overnight miracle but will be reporting back after 30 days with an update with results I hope to see.  I love that this product is 100% free from Parabens, and any additives.  A product made from pure ingredients with a 100% money back guarantee - who wouldn&#x27;t want to give this a try?</li>
            <li> Used this product for 2 weeks straight. You can feel the skin tighten and a change in appearance where you apply the cream. Must massage in circular or upward motion</li>
            <li> Lines are visibly reduced in just a few days of use.  My skin feels softer already.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I received the product on October 30, 2014 and started the regime on Nov. 1, 2014.  I was pleasantly surprised at the lack of fragrance or medical scent.  The product has no scent and is thick without being gooey – allowing for a precise application and quick absorption.  No tingling during or after application and I have seen some difference in the 4 days of usage.  I am pleased with this product and plan to continue usage on a daily basis</li>
            <li> Love it! Have been using it for over a week now and can already tell a difference</li>
            <li> I purchased this on a whim as I am willing to try new product.  I have used this creme twice a day for three days and I like it!  First it is fragrance free and does not compete with my scented products. Second, the creme is thick and non-greasy. I applied it heavily and it absorbed quickly.  Third and final...I think my thighs look better!  I will continue to use and give it time to do it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! My bumps, dimples, stretch marks and cellulite are already vanishing after just a week! Great product! I love the smell, too. It is definitely worth the money- best product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I am loving the face cream. Makes my skin feel so smooth. Awesome</li>
            <li> I usually am hesitant of skin creams because many cause me to break out but that didn&#x27;t happen with this cream!!  Plus it really worked well on my stretch marks.  Within a day I noticed a difference in the appearance of my skin.  It is much smoother and it looks great.  Plus its a great moisturizer.  It absorbs easily and is not greasy.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product not expecting much since i did not recognize the brand. I was surprised how quick the product made a difference on my face, especially my neck area. It is thick enough to really absorb into your skin in order to work it&#x27;s magic yet light to the touch. The smell is neutral, which i prefer. I will def purchase again and try other products they offer. Only a few uses in and a satisfied customer...cant wait to see what a whole jar does to my skin! :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream now for a about a week and it actually does seem to be smoothing out the appearance of my skin.  It is very creamy and feels nice on my skin.  It does not leave an oily or sticky feeling afterward.  There is little to no scent which is nice if you don&#x27;t want all of the perfumy smells :)</li>
            <li> Using this on the outside of my thighs to fix a little cellulite problem. It also leaves my skin feeling smooth. Doesn&#x27;t feel oily or greasy. Big jar so I can use it for a while and on any other places I think need a little help.</li>
            <li> Nice packaging and arrived quickly.  The cream smells nice and leaves your skin feeling very smooth.  Time will tell if it reduces the cellulite.</li>
            <li> I initially bought this item for using on cellulite, but found the added benefit of minimizing stretch marks! Great product!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this cream,subtle and light.goes on silky,soaks into skin right away.leaves my skin noticeably softer</li>
            <li> Smells great, and goes on very smooth not greasy!</li>
            <li> It is to soon to tell how effective this cream is but I can tell you it is creamy, has a pleasant aroma and feels good on your skin. Looking forward to results!</li>
            <li> *Rich and creamy with a pleasing scent. I have not had it long enough to use it all and see the results but my skin is very soft since using it.\\&quot;ich and creamy with a pleasing scent. I have not had it long enough to use it all and see the long term results but my skin is very soft since using it.&lt;br /&gt;Non greasy**</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for one week and have definitely noticed a difference.  I must say...I was a little skeptical at first, so I only used the cream on one leg so I could visibly compare the two.  Much to my amazement and absolute delight, after one week there is a noticeable difference.  I am 100% satisfied and would highly recommend Andre Lorent Cellulite Cream.</li>
            <li> Only used a couple of days, but found it smoothed my skin in a little amount of time (must use a couple times a day).  Like it has many natural ingredients.  It goes on very smoothly, almost velvety.  It take a little time to incorporate into skin, but does not feel greasy or heavy.  Once on you forget about it.  Only negative is directions could be more indepth.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and even though I was skeptical I bought it - IT REALLY WORKS!!! This is the first one that does and I‘ve bought plenty.  It has a pleasant smell and absorbs quickly.  Bye Bye Cellulite!!!</li>
            <li> So far I love everything about this product. The packaging is great. The cream feels nice, not at all greasy when applied to the skin. I notice a small, pleasant scent unlike so many creams which I refuse to use because of their strong scents. My skin feels soft after applying the cream. I haven&#x27;t been using long enough to see results but will update my review in the future. So fat I life this product.</li>
            <li> I have had cellulite forever. I have tried so many anti cellulite creams  Some were too thick, too smelly, too greasy.  But like goldilocks,  this was just right.  It goes on smooth, no fragrance and is already working  I will use this always!</li>
            <li> This is a revolutionary product! I love how soft and supple it leaves my skin feeling, not to mention giving my skin an even texture after just 3 days of use! Would HIGHLY recommend this wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY love this product! It came in 2 days before expected delivery. It is completely grease-less! It feels amazing on your skin. You can feel a slight tingle after a few minutes of application.  I anticipate it to continue firming, as expected! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Lisa Jones</li>
            <li> The cream is working great.y legs loomso much smoother</li>
            <li> First I am very excited, the cream is soft and makes your skin just as soft.  Not sure if its my imagination but it does seem like your skin becomes smooth right away.  Love this cream....thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the cream for a week or so but I like it! I find the scent to be pleasant and the cream is not greasy...absorbs quickly. I&#x27;ll update with results in a few weeks!</li>
            <li> Just received mine today and couldn&#x27;t wait to try.  Having tried many cellulite products in the past, I really liked the consistency of the cream and even after one application the skin on my thighs and buttocks appeared smoother.  It&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> I have only been using the product for a couple of days but my skin really does seem less bumpy.  I&#x27;m kind of shocked.  It definitely feels smoother and tighter.  I&#x27;m going to use it on just one side for the next week and see if It&#x27;s just wishful thinking on my part or there really is a difference.  I&#x27;ll get back to you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m beginning my second week of using this cream.  Since I wanted to &#x27;see&#x27; the results, I&#x27;m using it on my, shall I say, less than firm, upper arms instead of what&#x27;s behind me :).  What I noticed first is how soft and smooth my skin feels.  Less dimples?  Not so sure yet, but I&#x27;ll update and let you know.  Overall, though, I like the aroma.  And the way my skin feels is really nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this 2 times a day for about a week now and I&#x27;m already starting to notice smoother skin. It&#x27;s a thicker cream that easily is absorbed into your skin and has a light pleasant smell.  It is not greasy which I really like.  I can&#x27;t wait to see my results after 2-3 weeks of use!</li>
            <li> I think the product is great! It feels like it is working when you rub it in for the first time.  Very excited for the future of my legs!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I just recently received the cream and I am looking forward to the end results over the next few weeks. I have a sensitivity to perfumes and was happy that the scent was almost non-existent. The cream is non-greasy and is absorbed easily leaving your skin feeling silky and smooth without leaving any residue behind.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I  somehow missed out &amp; did not get this one</li>
            <li> Very good cream.  It definitely tightened my skin without leaving it dry.  The cream was also very creamy which left it very easy to apply.  After only using it a couple of times I could tell that my cellulite has less dimples.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is trying to tighten their skin or getting rid of cellulite.  Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> I did leave a review for the cellulite cream.  I like it so far,  I am sure it might be soon but I love it and will continue to use it.....</li>
            <li> I just started using this cream love the texture and smell hopefully it gets rid of the cellulite</li>
            <li> At first the thing I loved about this cream  was the smell and the feel on my skin. I really did not see any change as far as the cellulite. I continued to use it 2 times a day on just one thigh. Well the first couple days there was  no improvement and was ready to say it just does not work for me. But today I went to put my morning cream on and I was  so surprised to see smoother even skin. So now I love th  smell, the way it makes my skin feel AND how it makes my skin look.</li>
            <li> This is of no use, it has an odd consistency and it made my legs itch-I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Cream is a dream. Decadent without the grease</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.Was a little skeptical at first.But within days I was noticing a firmness in the area was applying the cream to.Love the product and will definitely continue to use!!</li>
            <li> I really loved this product.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product.  It isn&#x27;t sticky or oily but leaves skin soft with more firmness than before.</li>
            <li> Just received and I love it so far. The cream rubs in so nicely and isn&#x27;t greasy. It makes your skin  feel so soft. Not expecting results over night, so I can&#x27;t wait to see results after a couple weeks .</li>
            <li> Used now for several says, really like the product and how it feels on my skin.  Not greasy or smelly.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for about a week now, twice a day and have noticed a visible difference in my thigh and back side area.  Very smooth formula, non greasy and a nice light fragrance. I will definately purchase this again as well as other creams in this line.... Also makes skin very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I received the cream super fast after processing my order. The cream goes on lightly, with no heavy or greasy feeling. I like that it has no scent or very little if that. It does lessen the appearance of dimpled skin on my stomach and upper thighs. I would recommend this as a good product that does what it describes.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I have been using this product for a few days now and really like it. There is no scent which I like and I do love the softness it gives my skin.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a couple of days, but I do notice that my skin is noticeable smoother when I use it.  The creme is non-greasy and absorbs quickly without leaving your skin slippery.  It also has a faint minty smell which is pleasant, but does not clash with any perfume or other scent you might be wearing.  I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing how my skin looks after several weeks.</li>
            <li> Just received this product. It goes on thick, smooth and absorbs quickly.  No irritation as with some other creams I&#x27;ve tried.  Noticed a difference this morning!  Could not believe that my skin was visibly smoother this morning!  Can&#x27;t wait to see the results after a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a loyal Amazon customer and rely a lot on customer reviews. This product is very creamy, not greasy and has no odor which I like very much.  I have very sensitive skin but haven&#x27;t had any problem with this product. It&#x27;s too early for me to know if it&#x27;s working but it has the right ingredients and the price is reasonable.  I would definitely recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cellulite cream for a few days on some of my cellulite.  I am seeing a lot less puckering where I used it compared to where I haven&#x27;t used it!  It is smoothing out my skin!  --Libby Beier</li>
            <li> This cream is very nice, feels good and firms up the skin. I will order it again.</li>
            <li> Love this cream!  Has a wonderful clean fragrance and the skin on my 55 year old thighs look 25. (maybe better.). It isn&#x27;t sticky and I don&#x27;t have to wait to put on my clothes.  Fabulous stuff!  I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again and again.</li>
            <li> This is a nice cream only problem for me is I can smell the caffeine! I know a lot of other people don&#x27;t mind that but, since I am smell sensitive it makes it hard for me to use.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel! Only been using a few days but I look forward to the results!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product and noticed a change in the needed areas.  I believe that with continued use this product will have great results.  Because my biggest area of concern is my thighs this is definitely something I had ordered over the summer so I could enjoy the results more frequently.  Thank you for an amazing product.</li>
            <li> So far I like the cream and notice a small change but hopefully the more I use it the more noticeable it will be</li>
            <li> Nice product. Goes on smooth. Appears to be a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Such a great product! I&#x27;ve only been using a couple of days, but I already feel a firmness.  Also, a little goes a long way and there is hardly any smell.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product!  My skin feels amazing after I use it.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see some noticeable changes in the firmness of my skin or reduction in cellulite, but I will continue using it, for sure!</li>
            <li> Amazing!! I never trust in &amp;#34;miracle cream&amp;#34; but my skin feels really smooth using this one, thanks for the opportunity to try, YES I recommended with my eyes close, Thank you!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because of the high quality ingredients it is made of and it&#x27;s lack of harmful ingredients.  I have only used it a couple of times, but so far I am please with the cream.</li>
            <li> I like the way this makes my skin feel. It came packaged beautifully, and the seller&#x27;s communication couldn&#x27;t be better.  I am very pleased so far.</li>
            <li> Normally I never write reviews for anyone. But I wanted to let the whole world know that this is the best cream ever. Your search is finally over! It helped with my black stretch marks and cottage cheese legs. I used to be so embarrassed to wear shorts during the summer because it was that bad and I wanted to get smart lipo like Kim Kardashian. But now I am so happy and is feeling better than ever. It also makes my skin feels so smooth &amp; the  Co-Founder Emily Cummings is super sweet, who emailed me for a follow up. I will most definitely need a second one!:)</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t trust reviews - in searching for a thermal firming cellulite cream that works, I&#x27;ve read the same exact reviews verbatim on different products from different manufacturers which leads me to believe that finding which review belongs to which product is nearly impossible. When writing a review we should all name the product in the review so that they can&#x27;t put them on everything. Amazon should add a section where you have to write the product name so this doesn&#x27;t happens. It&#x27;s completely ruining why the review system works. Needless to say I need to go to Sephora or Ulta reviews to see which product is really recommended by users.</li>
            <li> Too small not even enough to use for two to thee weeks . I use it twice a day after shower to put on leg , arm and butt . I don&#x27;t think I will see the result before its empty .</li>
            <li> Waste of money!! I used the product as directed, and saw no difference in the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see any results as of yet</li>
            <li> Very good cream does what it says.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been doing the job I apply it 2 times a day and use a corset with it . I love that they contact you to ask how he product is working and if they need to improve on anything.</li>
            <li> Only used a couple times. Use in conjunction with a brush. Seems like the cellulite is less noticable.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this cream. It&#x27;s helped the appearance of my skin so much! It&#x27;s smoother, looks moisturized, and has even made my skin look more even. I LOVE it and highly recommend it!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have only had the cream for about 5 days and i absolutely love it, i use mine on my thighs arms and tummy. With plastic wrap and waist trainer, and i can see how its toning and firming my body after two girls i thought i wouldnt find something affordable, plus it works.!!great deal. Thank you for this great product.</li>
            <li> This smells good and while I don&#x27;t have much noticeable cellulite i do have SOME cheese. It&#x27;s too soon to tell if this is taking it away but it IS making my skin smoother! I recommend EVERYTHING by Andre Lorent!</li>
            <li> After 3 days of use this cream is wonderful. It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue like other creams. You don&#x27;t even know you applied it after a couple minutes. I will keep purchasing this product most definitely. It&#x27;s unlike any other product out there.</li>
            <li> I just started using this cream and my skin feels smoother. I like it becomes it does not have any smell and also it helps me battle with my extra dry skin. Looking forward for future results.</li>
            <li> Loving this cream! Well worth the price. My skin feels amazing.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars since I have just started using it, but have to say it goes on very smoothly. The skin feels really good and moisturized. It didn&#x27;t cause any irritations which is a big plus if you have sensitive skin like me.  Looking forward to the great results that the other reviewers are raving about.</li>
            <li> I immediately loved how light this moisturizer is and could tell it was going to be fine for my sensitive skin.  After using it for a few days I can already feel results.  It makes your skin feel tighter and smoother and yet the cream is light.  Definitely worth trying for anyone looking for something similar.</li>
            <li> This is the first cellulite cream I have ever used so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. It went on smoothly and felt tingly as it soaked in and began to appear to tighten the skin. It seemed to make my skin look smoother and tighter. I&#x27;ve only used it a few days so far. The reason for only 4 stars is the scent. It is very light but wasn&#x27;t very pleasant to me. Then again, I am super sensitive to fragrance.</li>
            <li> This cream arrived quickly and in perfect condition. It makes my skin feel soft and not sticky or wet. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so I can&#x27;t say if it will be successful in getting rid of celulite yet but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I have only used it for a week but I am in love with it.  I will update my review after I have used it for a couple of months.</li>
            <li> This cream has a great consistency and feel to it.  It absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy (so many creams feel like they&#x27;re just sitting on top of the skin).  The price is very reasonable given that other cellulite creams can be three times the cost.  I&#x27;ve only been using it a couple of days so it hasn&#x27;t been long enough to see any changes in my cellulite, but I&#x27;ll continue to use it and hopefully I&#x27;ll see some results in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference...would buy again. I have been using it for 3 months now.</li>
            <li> I received this cream today and the product is very creamy! The thing that surprised me most was the fact that, when applied, the cream was instantly absorbed into the skin. There was absolutely no greasy reside left after application.  This is a real plus as there is no transfer from the skin to any clothing you may be wearing.  This was always an important drawback that kept me from even trying a product such as this one.  I am looking forward to the other benefits this cream is going provide for me!</li>
            <li> I love the way this cream absorbs into the skin.  It will take a bit of time to see how well it works, but so far I have good feelings about it.  I will repost in about a week to see how well it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> This cream is really awesome! Dimples on my thighs are gone and my thighs feel so soft. The part I love best is that a little goes a long way. I highly recommend Andre Lorent Crazy Beautiful Cellulite Cream!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for problem areas on my post-baby body. I am very pleased so far. The product is thick, creamy and does not leave an oily feel. After only a few days, there was a noticeable tightening of the skin on my abdomen and thighs. I will continue to use the cellulite creme to help in those areas!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little more than a week. Cellulite is still very obvious. I haven&#x27;t seen it shrink or fade.....or do anything. I can&#x27;t explain the smell. It&#x27;s not a very nice smell. My husband has been asking me constantly (since I&#x27;ve been using this product) ;&amp;#34;What is that smell?&amp;#34; It also has a tacky feeling too it. I immediately wash my hands because my fingers &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; together. Then my panties stick to my skin. I was a little disappointed with this product. I really never expected my cellulite to &amp;#34;disappear&amp;#34; BUT, it would have been nice had it faded a little. Seriously, don&#x27;t pin too many hopes on this product, or you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still too early to see results from this cream, but just had to write an early review because of how much I love the consistency of this product! I&#x27;ve used many, many, many cellulite creams in the past &amp; they&#x27;ve primarily been thick &amp; sticky, difficult to spread. This cream is just the opposite - so silky smooth &amp; very easy to spread-a little goes a long way, which makes this an excellent value! Willl write a second review once I&#x27;ve given it a chance to give results!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve use this product twice and found that there is a decrease in the appearance of cellulite. There is a lite pleasant scent and absorbs quickly with no sticky residue. I look forward to continued use.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is a nice cream. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a smell. It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily. I can feel it working and I have only been using it for a week.</li>
            <li> This a great product. My skin looks and feels amazing.  I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Great product. Smooth and silky. Goes on easy. Absorbs nicely. No strong odors when applying or afterwards.Looking forward to seeing how the end results on those &#x27;problem&#x27; areas in the near future.</li>
            <li> So far so good! Really like the results. :)</li>
            <li> Tried this as soon as it arrived  I immediately saw the difference on my legs and even the upper part of my arms  made them smoother than they have been in a long time  I will recommend this to all my friends  I am so excited to get a product that does what it advertised. Thanks</li>
            <li> Great new product.  Even though I have not been using it that long I can tell it is going to work just as they say.  Give it a try I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I started using this cream 2 days ago and I already can see the difference in the smoothness of my face. Best part is that it doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I am almost finished with my jar! I do like it enough to repurchase again in the future. There are some improvements (nothing that happened overnight or that would be ridiculously noticeable), but I like what I see so far. I use it with a cellulite massage brush at night and rub it in by hand in the morning.</li>
            <li> Not sure of results since I&#x27;ve only used it once. But I figured I just need something as lubrication for when I use the cellulite massager brush mitt.</li>
            <li> Love this cream. Seeing results after a week. Thighs looking better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only just receive it so I haven&#x27;t noticed any different yet but when I do I will make sure to write a review on it.</li>
            <li> The cream is ok...I used it for several months.but didn&#x27;t like the product well enough to continue purchasing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually seeing some improvement after only two weeks!</li>
            <li> I have only been using the cream for about 1 1/2 weeks but have noticed a difference in the depth of the cellulite dimples.  I hope the longer I use the cream the more difference I will see.  I will update after a month of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did see some reviews that stated that the cream was sticky or left their skin feeling sticky and personally I have not experienced this.  The cream is light and quickly absorbs into the skin leaving it very soft.  So far I really like the cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed and loving the way this cream is erasing my imperfections like cellulite and dimples on my thighs. Thank you so much for an excellent product! 😍👍🏼</li>
            <li> I like the cream.  We will see if it works on the cottage cheese look of the cellulite (yuck) -- but in the meantime the skin on my legs is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Have only been using this product for about a week, but goes on smoothly .. This product did come quickly, and customer service at Andre Lorent Lifestyles is very good! Would buy this product again..</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me, I used a whole container already and worked out. It made my skin feel very soft, but didn&#x27;t really see a difference</li>
            <li> Horrible product, does absolutely nothing !!  Was so upset due to all the great reviews and ratings! I have had this product for 2 weeks, the jar is just about empty and saw no results at all! Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Waste of money so far. Jar is almost gone, &amp; haven&#x27;t seen one difference.</li>
            <li> I did not see results after using this product.</li>
            <li> Great product and great customer service! I use it on my stomach and noticed a difference within a couple of days. I definitely would recommend</li>
            <li> I used this product for a month everyday twice a day. I haven&#x27;t seen any dramatic changes. All it&#x27;s done so far is clear up some little dark marks on my bottom. I expected it to do at least a little something on my cellulite and stretch marks but it didn&#x27;t. The product is already almost gone and I wished it lasted longer so I can see if it will give me better results.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, sorry!</li>
            <li> This cream is AMAZING. I play soccer but have had 2 kids and had some dimples... I swear this has made the magically disappear... It makes my skin so soft AMAZING... I use it in the AM an PM before bed...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell bad. I noticed a slight difference after the second use. I have this crazy weird dimple directly in the center of my right bum cheek. Lol. So I have my bf rub this in with a cellulite massager brush when I get out of the shower. Really helps to go by the directions and rub in circular motion until dissolved. It is working pretty good for me. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Nothing special. Maybe I need more time and to buy new one.</li>
            <li> Smell is a little bit odd, but the cream is nice and I can already see it starting to tighten.  Not a bad price either!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this Cellulite Cream! In the areas that I have applied my skin appears to be much smoother.</li>
            <li> Out of the box, the &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; made me think I dunno. But once it was applied there was NO ODOR TO SPEAK OF!!! This product is almost gone simply because I have made it a part of my daily routine. Great product from a great company. I would DEFINITELY order products from them again.</li>
            <li> Love this company. They use natural ingredients. My favorite is their face cream!</li>
            <li> I liked the way it made my skin feel smooth, however, I did not notice a change in the appearance of cellulite.</li>
            <li> Being it does take a while to see any results, I will give a preliminary review - simply because I already like it! You know that feeling of pampering yourself and spending time with lotions, potions and creams, alone and content - relaxed - yes - that&#x27;s how I felt the past few days - just feels good - treating yourself.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I do have the dreaded cellulite in a few places - and the creams is wonderful and non-greasy - it feels good massaging it in, it soaks in and leaves your skin feel soft - and it does not have any scent!! Hurray - because one thing I always disliked is mixing up too many scents - what with all those lotions and creams :)&lt;br /&gt;I will come back in about 4 weeks and give an update -&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try!</li>
            <li> Great product! Have only been using it for a week but so far so good. Smells great too!</li>
            <li> Product seems like sure thing! We&#x27;ll see how it goes!</li>
            <li> Andre Lorent cellulite cream is the most effective cellulite fighter I have tried on the market. The cream is silky smooth and I saw a noticeable improvement in the areas I have cellulite. I am so thankful to have found  a product that actually works. This is now a staple in my beauty routine!</li>
            <li> My wife likes the product very much. It has made her skin smoother and softer.</li>
            <li> I just started using this and can honestly say my skins feels better!&lt;br /&gt;I love the texture of this cream!  It&#x27;s smooth and I don&#x27;t have to use a lot!</li>
            <li> I just received my cream a few days ago. I haven&#x27;t noticed immediate results in cellulite reduction, but I believe it will take time and consistency (as with everything). I have noticed a softness in my skin and have been using this cream not only on my legs, but on the tops of my hands and elbows because I love the soft feel. This cream has a pleasant scent that is mild and not over-powering to the senses. It is non-greasy and I really like the face that it is free from parabens, SLS, and other chemical derivatives. I look forward to seeing results.</li>
            <li> The cream has a non-powering sent which is good. I have only had the product for a week and have seen a slight change. With consistent use and exercise the results will be awesome.</li>
            <li> OMG! I have only been using this product for about a week and I can already see a different on my thighs and booty. I can&#x27;t wait to see the continued results using this product.</li>
            <li> I am sure I would have given this product 5 stars if I had received it.  Disappointed  as reading the other reviews I had looked forward to trying it.  Hope to try it in the future, then I am sure I will be able to give it 10 stars.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using that long so I can&#x27;t really say if it&#x27;s removing cellulite but I&#x27;m reviewing that it makes my skin soft! So I am enjoying it as a cream so far! Will post again in a few weeks for an update!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:e2dc900d86bc7b73445a9c9d09ba8d27]] I LOVE this product and so worth the money!  It has really helped my cellulite!  Worth it for ALL you women who have \\&quot;cottage cheese\\&quot; thighs after children!!!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful cream, makes skin feel so much smoother!  It&#x27;s unscented, so will not clash with any fragrances that you may wear.</li>
            <li> This cream works great.  I just got it but I&#x27;m already seeing results.  Shipped and delivered super fast.</li>
            <li> Smells good I don&#x27;t have a lot of cellulite so what I do have seems to be fading</li>
            <li> Had this product for almost a week, using as directed twice a day in my &#x27;problem&#x27; areas. Ingredients are superb and I appreciate that chemicals that are NOT in this cream. I haven&#x27;t see results to judge the effectiveness of the purpose of this cream however. I will update this review again next week.</li>
            <li> Nice smell and have already noticed smoother skin!</li>
            <li> Left my skin feeling softer and firmer.  The fragrance is very subtle and does not linger.  It feels more like a lotion than a cream and does not feel greasy.  I like this cream and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this cream.  I have tried other cellulite creams before within this price range and they have done nothing at all.  While I am hesitant to say it eliminates cellulite...I don&#x27;t think any product can actually do that regardless of price...I do find benefits to this product.  On first application I found my skin to feel tighter.  After a few days of use the smoothness was definitely noticeable.  I have dry bumpy skin on the back of my legs and this has improved the look and feel of my skin.  Definite plus!  Well worth the price for the results so far.</li>
            <li> Very clean and light scent. Goes on smoothly. Works great!!! Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> Received this cream and its very smooth and creamy.  Has helped tighten my skin.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> really to early to tell if it works goes on absorbs very nicely</li>
            <li> I received the Andre Lorent Cellulite Cream a few days ago.  The cream was beautifully packaged and was filled right to the brim.  The cream is rich and thick with a pleasant smell.  I have used the cream twice a day for the last 3 days and my skin feels smoother and firmer.  The cream is also a very good moisturizing cream as I tend to have dry skin and with the Andre Lorent cream this is not the case.  Thanks Andre Lorent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy and impressed with this product. I have stretch marks on my stomach from my pregnancy and I put this on and within 2 days my stretch marks started to fade. The cream is also non-greasy or sticky after use it is a great cream.</li>
            <li> I received the cream quickly and it was well packaged.  It has a very smooth texture and does not leave a an unpleasant greasy feeling.  The scent was a bit underwhelming but not in a way that would prevent me from using in the future.  I have only used it for a few days but I like what I see so far.  It is nice that a portion of the proceeds go to local charities.  One more incentive to use this product.</li>
            <li> Very creamy and lovely. Unscented is a plus too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so in love with this cream! It&#x27;s super thick but goes a long way! It leaves my skin feeling moisturized.  I love how it doesn&#x27;t have a scent.  I did notice right away that my skin felt tighter! Who doesn&#x27;t want a tight butt right?!?</li>
            <li> I received this cream for $1 plus shipping and so far so good! I wish I had more time to use the product before writing this review, but I will try to update it if anything changes. I will say, the company seems to really care about customer satisfaction and wants to do everything they can to make sure you are happy and the product is doing what it is supposed to do!</li>
            <li> I also use this on my neck and it has tighten my skin up.</li>
            <li> I love it skin really smooth out and I can see a differences</li>
            <li> I cannot see any difference after using this cream. With other creams at least I felf heat, tingling... With this one , nothing. May be it is still too early to review.</li>
