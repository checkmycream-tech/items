            <li>I have been using this oil for 2 weeks now, I really love it</li>
            <li>I love this, my skin has never felt or looked better.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>My face feels nice and smooth</li>
            <li>I prefer the Aura Cacia, this goes  on lighter and the oil smells OK</li>
            <li>Good quality oil and reasonably priced!</li>
            <li>This bottle has a easy pump and it will not leave any oil on the bottle.</li>
            <li>I have fair and aging skin with sun damage and using Inflora Bontanica has made a noticeable difference giving my complexion a vibrant and youthful glow.  </li>
            <li>Great product, will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li>I did see a more even, youthful glow after a month of use, but I also experienced more clogged pores than usual, even after upping my exfoliating regiment to balance out the oil.</li>
            <li>Great oil for people who lives in dry climate.</li>
            <li>No bad smell.</li>
            <li>This is great - put some on your face when damp and after it soaks in (give it a little time)</li>
            <li>This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product.</li>
            <li>Knowing that oil is often the cause of my acne, I was hesitant to put even more oil on my already sensitive skin.    </li>
            <li>This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product and has not been influenced in any way.</li>
            <li>This product works amazing well on extremely dry sun damaged skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far from greasy and is easily absorbent.</li>
            <li>The item arrived quickly and I really like the size of the jar and the ease of the pump.</li>
            <li>I love it and definitely recommend using this product.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I had different product at home, and this one is much better.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li>My first order smelled rancid</li>
            <li>I purchased this after using a natural health store generic brand of rose hip seed oil.</li>
            <li>My face just feels so hydrated and smooth the next day.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality product!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>but they wouldn&#x27;t do much</li>
            <li>My skin feels so much softer, it&#x27;s moisturized</li>
            <li>The smell is very earthy.</li>
            <li>and it really does improve my skin</li>
            <li>And it is very concentrated, so I recommend diluting it with another oil like grapeseed.</li>
            <li>When I wake up in the morning and rinse off my face it is so soft and it has a shine to it that I haven&#x27;t seen in years!!!</li>
            <li>I have oily skin, I&#x27;ve used similar products in the past which worked great, but this one didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>After using it for a month, i noticed that the new surgical scars that I had from some spot removals have faded into my normal skin color.</li>
            <li>I feel so soft!  </li>
            <li>I also use it in the all natural skin care products I make and sell!  </li>
            <li>the smell is incredibly pungent and impossible to ignore.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t break out my skin and makes me look very glowy the next day.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see if extended use will make it completely disappear.</li>
            <li>and once you put on your skin it sinks right in making your face soft.</li>
            <li>This oil is much more serum-like and absorbs well, but still left a slightly thick film atop my face.</li>
            <li>The formula is not extremely oily even when rubbing in between your hands</li>
            <li>This oil  makes my skin so soft and I have a youthful shine back!</li>
            <li>-a on since oil is absorbed extremely deep into the skin pulling the other products down with it.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I been using it on my dry hands and my feet, and I already feel the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is not overly oily, it is definitely a dry oil.</li>

            <li> This particular oil seems to have a base of sesame oil, not sure if it is</li>

            <li> something is wrong-</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this oil! I put it on my face at night after I put my serum or retin-a on since oil is absorbed extremely deep into the skin pulling the other products down with it. It doesn&#x27;t break out my skin and makes me look very glowy the next day. I sometimes put this on my legs after shaving to reduce irritation. will continue to purchase</li>
            <li> Great company to work with; item arrived on time and as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No scent and great for use at night.</li>
            <li> Great product! I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I received this product a few days ago and used it a few times. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;m not saying this product doesn&#x27;t work.. I&#x27;m just saying it didn&#x27;t work for me. I have oily skin, I&#x27;ve used similar products in the past which worked great, but this one didn&#x27;t. Everybody&#x27;s different, so what didn&#x27;t work for me, doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work for you!</li>
            <li> I like this oil, it smells good. The company gave us a tip on how to use this oil. I use it after cleaning my face at night. I mix it with other serum. My face just feels so hydrated and smooth the next day. I have been using this oil for 2 weeks now, I really love it and I will buy again.  I received a discount in exchange for an hones, unbiased review. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product.</li>
            <li> Works and works well. This is a high quality product! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I love rosehip seed oil! This is a great price, as well. It arrived quickly and the packaging is very attractive. I alternate nightly use of vitamin C serum and rosehip seed oil and it gives me a glowing complexion! I will never buy rosehip seed oil anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Pump seems to be stocked at times ... But nonetheless product is what I have expected. I&#x27;m happy with this one</li>
            <li> This is great - put some on your face when damp and after it soaks in (give it a little time) I feel so soft!  No bad smell.</li>
            <li> I love this product works great on my skin</li>
            <li> I love this, my skin has never felt or looked better. I suffer from really dry skin and I have tried different types of cremes and lotions but they wouldn&#x27;t do much si I decided to try this and I&#x27;ve never been happier. My skin feels so much softer, it&#x27;s moisturized 24/7 and doesn&#x27;t dry out nor does it leave my skin feel oily like some oils do. My skin tone is evening out and clearing up. I love it and definitely recommend using this product. I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after using a natural health store generic brand of rose hip seed oil. This oil is much more serum-like and absorbs well, but still left a slightly thick film atop my face. I did see a more even, youthful glow after a month of use, but I also experienced more clogged pores than usual, even after upping my exfoliating regiment to balance out the oil. For me, it was too expensive to continue to use, but I&#x27;m sure that long-term users would see the effects. Also, it smells like fish oil and that was a little gross for me to smear across my face.</li>
            <li> The Inflora Bontanica Rosehip Oil is by far the best moisturizer that I have ever used for my face.  I have fair and aging skin with sun damage and using Inflora Bontanica has made a noticeable difference giving my complexion a vibrant and youthful glow.  It feels good on my skin and it is not too oily.  I&#x27;m so happy I chose the 4 ounce bottle!</li>
            <li> This is a product I use on my face daily. I love it!</li>
            <li> Works just like she said and she&#x27;s so helpful with questions as well!</li>
            <li> Feels great. Smells a little different!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have had a red spot on my face for years, tried everything and it remained. I&#x27;ve been using this faithfully for about a month and the spot is almost gone. My face feels nice and smooth, all my dry patches are gone It feels kind of greasy going on but it absorbs after a bit. The smell is very earthy. I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> This oil  makes my skin so soft and I have a youthful shine back! The formula is not extremely oily even when rubbing in between your hands and once you put on your skin it sinks right in making your face soft. Perfect so you don&#x27;t have to go to bed feeling like your face is all oily. When I wake up in the morning and rinse off my face it is so soft and it has a shine to it that I haven&#x27;t seen in years!!! The bottle is a very nice size for the price.</li>
            <li> Good product!! I been using it on my dry hands and my feet, and I already feel the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sonia Miller</li>
            <li> I had different product at home, and this one is much better. This bottle has a easy pump and it will not leave any oil on the bottle. Great oil for people who lives in dry climate.</li>
            <li> beautiful bottle, prompt service. mild neutral odor, feels great. i look forward to improvement on my face and neck and on scars.</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff I seen it on dr.Oz and it really does improve my skin</li>
            <li> This product works amazing well on extremely dry sun damaged skin.  I&#x27;ve bought lotion after lotion, but this product actually works without leaving an oily look to your skin.</li>
            <li> My sister is the one who turned me on to rosehip oil. I had never heard of it before until she purchased a bottle for herself after claiming that Miranda Kerr swears by it. Not one to ever turn down potentially looking like Miranda Kerr, I had to get myself a bottle of rosehip oil as well. Admittedly, I was at first a bit wary of it since I have combination, acne-prone skin that can get oily at times. Knowing that oil is often the cause of my acne, I was hesitant to put even more oil on my already sensitive skin.    It was definitely not greasy as I expected it to be. It reminds me of tea tree oil, if you have ever used that. It&#x27;s far from greasy and is easily absorbent. I&#x27;ve been using it on an acne scar on the side of my face, and although it has only been a couple of days, I am already starting to see that the scar is fading away. I can&#x27;t wait to see if extended use will make it completely disappear. My sister loves her rosehip oil and now buys it before she even runs out just so she can always have a bottle by her side, so I have all the faith that this product will be amazing. So far, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!    I received a discount on this product in exchange for an honest, unbiased review. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product and has not been influenced in any way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just begun using this product but have had no issues with it on my skin.  The item arrived quickly and I really like the size of the jar and the ease of the pump.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Great product - will buy again!</li>
            <li> Good quality oil and reasonably priced! Will keep buying!</li>
            <li> This was the third time I&#x27;ve bought this product - and this time it smells really weird.  I feel like something is wrong- the smell is incredibly pungent and impossible to ignore.  Maybe they changed something in the formula but I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> I keep buying this over and over, it&#x27;s wonderful!  I use it as a moisturizer in the morning beneath my makeup and it works wonders.  I also use it in the all natural skin care products I make and sell!  Great product, will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I read about rosehip seed oil to help with my oily skin and hyperpigmentation issues. After using it for a month, i noticed that the new surgical scars that I had from some spot removals have faded into my normal skin color. This product is not overly oily, it is definitely a dry oil. And it is very concentrated, so I recommend diluting it with another oil like grapeseed. Overall, I&#x27;m glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li> This particular oil seems to have a base of sesame oil, not sure if it is but it smells like it.  It is not something I want to put on my face. I will use on body where I do not have to smell it.  My first order smelled rancid so I returned it.  I prefer the Aura Cacia, this goes  on lighter and the oil smells OK, it is in Vitamin E oil base.</li>
