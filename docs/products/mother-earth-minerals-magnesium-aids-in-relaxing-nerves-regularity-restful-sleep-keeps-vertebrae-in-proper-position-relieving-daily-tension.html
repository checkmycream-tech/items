    <ol>
            <li>(although it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found).</li>
            <li>Product works awesome!  </li>
            <li>Awesome job</li>
            <li>its been perfect.  </li>
            <li>Impressive product!</li>
            <li>Mother Earth is the best no matter what the others say.</li>
            <li>Angstrom Magnesium is the best!</li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with this product and fully recommend it.</li>
            <li>Then I read about colloidal minerals and how they enter your blood stream when held under the tongue increasing the bioavailability greatly.</li>
            <li>Helps greatly for  pain ( TMJ, Planters Faccitis, Bursitis, Muscle Cramps in toes and legs)  </li>
            <li>This is a great source of magnesium.</li>
            <li>I am extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li>the importance of sufficient magnesium is to good health and longevity.</li>
            <li>This is a good product, but it is not from Angstrom minerals.</li>
            <li>fair product, just wasn&#x27;t what I needed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found the RIGHT product an excellent addition to my coffee.  </li>
            <li>All the benefits of magnesium without swallowing many pills!</li>
            <li>I love using angstroms magnesium!  </li>
            <li>, I feel calmer, I&#x27;m no longer getting heart palpitations before bed, and I&#x27;m sleeping so much better!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is truly amazing.  </li>
            <li>I honestly believe this to have saved my mobility.</li>
            <li>Is there anything more valuable than good health ?</li>
            <li>Taste not too strong, seems to be of good quality.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are too many benefits of magnesium to mention them all here -- but you can check out [ [...] ] for more information!</li>
            <li>My muscles are not as sore and I have more flexibility.  </li>
            <li>Pleased.</li>
            <li>No awful side effects (ex: diarrhea that others complain about)..</li>
            <li>and I feel so much better.  </li>
            <li>and he&#x27;s able to focus and function better.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this</li>
            <li>I have noticed a VERY significant reduction in heart palpitations, and my sleep is better.</li>
            <li>Meaning most leaves the body and doesn&#x27;t enter the bloodstream so the cheap vitamin pills you buy in the store wouldn&#x27;t cut it for what I needed.</li>
            <li>Easy way to take magnesium.  </li>
            <li>This product is easy to consume with no side effects.</li>
            <li>and it has been fine since.  </li>
            <li>This is very gentle to the stomach but very strong to stop the pain caused by magnesium depletion.</li>
            <li>You will, also, enjoy the well written education pages on each of the Angstrom minerals that they offer.</li>
            <li>When you chelate magnesium by binding it to an amino like taurate, it increases the up-take to your blood-stream significantly, removing the flushing effect.</li>
            <li>After about 3 months I was walking normally again with little to no pain, and after six months of taking this wonderful supplement I was running again and able to work out again.</li>
            <li>This particular magnesium isn&#x27;t being assimilated which is what causes this flushing in many people.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re battling chronic migraines, its worth a shot to see if it helps you as well.</li>
            <li>It seems to be well absorbed and utilized by my body.</li>
            <li>Good, it works as expected</li>
            <li>I took 1/2 teaspoon, held it under my tongue for 15 minutes right before bed.</li>
            <li>Nice to pivet again and not have throat stretched anymore !</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the investment of a few dollars to retain good health or recover what they may have had, and lost.</li>
            <li>Any reader would be amazed,(like me), to be educated on how very important and underrated by the medical profession</li>
            <li>I like these minerals very much.</li>
            <li>I think this is a good product, but seems like it made me feel a little bit funny when I first took it.  </li>
            <li>After doing more research on Magnesium I discovered that the oral bioavailability when taken in pill form is very low.</li>
            <li>This is the same reaction I&#x27;ve had with many magnesium products.</li>
            <li>I only seem to be able to semi-tolerate magnesium taurate.</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle of magnesium and I love this brand.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to spend this much on something we have in good supply for much less $$$.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion there is no other magnesium supplement out there that delivers the same kind of positive results.</li>
            <li>This is easy to swallow liquid and he has been taking it for 3 months daily without a stomach ache</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to take and doesn&#x27;t interfere with digestion like a lot of other magnesium products, because it gets absorbed under the tongue.  </li>
            <li>This really seems to be helping with the permanent side effects encountered from taking Cipro.  </li>
            <li>Came fast.  </li>
            <li>I have used almost a whole bottle of this, taken 1/2 tsp morning and at suppertime.</li>
            <li>This reversed my cipro damage and really helped me and the wifes hip pains .</li>
            <li>I immediately feel much calmer and relaxed.</li>
            <li>I have been taking it two or three weeks now and there does not seem to be much change.  </li>
            <li>After trying Epsom Salt soaks and various creams to no avail I finally stumbled upon some medical literature online which mentioned a study on rats who after given the antibiotic and then developed tendon toxicity and eye problems were given magnesium supplements and vitamin E with great results.</li>
            <li>Greatly reduced overall stress both mental and physical</li>
            <li>I highly recommend&lt;br /&gt;it to my friends.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>If there is, this 85 yr old man has never found it !</li>
            <li>When I take this regularly,  I get a great night&#x27;s uninterrupted sleep and over the long term,  have much less muscle aches and leg cramps.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see the difference yet, but I guess its early to see.</li>
            <li>However, I am experiencing steady improvement in chronic hip spasm with radicular pain as result of magnesium supplementation orally and topically.</li>
            <li>It is hard to determine an appropriate dosage as it is not consistent with tablet dosages, and absorption rates should be higher than tablets.</li>
            <li>I will definitely repurchase this prod,uct and highly recommend it to others.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend that you give this a chance if you are having a similar issue.</li>
            <li>I am also taking the Angstrom Minerals \\&quot;minerals of life\\&quot; just to make sure I&#x27;m getting all the trace amounts of other minerals that may be missing from my diet.  </li>
            <li>And no loose stools!  </li>
            <li>Recommend EXACT  same product from other manufactures label.</li>
            <li>It has little to no flavor and seems to be doing exactly what I hoped it would.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been magnesium deficient for the past six years -- two doctors have told me I need to take magnesium supplements, but I have not been able to tolerate even low doses of magnesium without getting severe uncontrollable diarrhea.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s virtually tasteless) for one minute and it will mostly be absorbed into your bloodstream -- then you swallow the rest -- the particles are so small that even if you swallow it, it is immediately absorbed into your body and doesn&#x27;t make it through your digestive tract to cause problems.  </li>
            <li> As received bottle was almost half empty; had read reviews of similar occurrences thought they were flukes, but got same treatment.  </li>
            <li> A few weeks ago my big toes started cramping up, so I surfed the net yet again looking for a magnesium supplement that would not cause diarrhea, and I came across the angstrom magnesium.  </li>
            <li> If there is anyone out there suffering from tendon toxicity or other side effects of Cipro or other antibiotics of the same family I urge you to try Angstrom Magnesium.</li>
            <li> Have recently added magnesium oil (which stings for a few minutes after application).</li>
            <li> After going to the doctor various times and only getting other random medications to take (some which even hurt my liver) I decided to go the natural route.</li>
            <li> This type of magnesium delivery seems to fulfill the promise of other reviewers to get through the systems without disrupting the gut.  </li>
            <li> 2/18/16: Due to the comments I&#x27;ve had, I decided to add some additional info.</li>
            <li> It did not cause any &amp;#34;bowel issues&amp;#34;, like other magnesium supplements I have used.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice a difference, but I&#x27;m also not consistent...</li>
            <li> What I notice is his anxiety goes way down</li>
            <li> The whole next day I had bad diarrhea</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with labeling as there is no nutritional facts statement for comparing &amp;#34;dosage&amp;#34; like other forms of magnesium that are measured in milligrams per &amp;#34;serving.&amp;#34;  From my understanding of Dr. Dean&#x27;s book on magnesium most oral forms are so poorly utilized that consumers are not getting the labeled dosaging anyway.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced constipation in my life, so people who do may not have the same experience as me.</li>
            <li> Very slight mineral taste when taken as directed -- sublingually.</li>
            <li> it has very little taste.</li>
            <li> I had a few disastrous experiences and was afraid to take it again, and so I just decided I would have to live with the joint pain, irregular heartbeats, and other symptoms of low magnesium.  </li>
            <li> (I know its gross, sorry).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sad that I can&#x27;t find one that will work at a regular dosage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also added product to a small glass of water which works for me  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for the past month</li>
            <li> The disturbing and painful nightly leg cramps are few and far between since taking Angstrom&#x27;s Magnesium.  </li>
            <li> Can be broken up throughout the day or taken all at once.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I was ecstatic.</li>
            <li> Lasted about one month, so it is expensive for trial and error supplementation.</li>
            <li> Sent wrong product -- magnesium oil.  </li>
            <li> Taking this at the 1/2tsp doseage was initially undoable for me, it gave nasty headaches..</li>
            <li> I tried two other kinds and they tasted TERRIBLE--</li>
            <li> This one is almost tasteless to me and doesn&#x27;t cause digestibility issues.</li>
            <li> Did not experience any unpleasant digestive symptoms from adding this to my regime.</li>
            <li> My fatigue is not as bad, and the pain from tendinitis has eased off some.  </li>
            <li> I started purchasing Angstrom Magnesium after I had a bad reaction to the antibiotic Ciprofloxacin.</li>
            <li> The antibiotic did terrible damage to my Achilles Tendon leaving me almost unable to walk.</li>
            <li> I was having terrible ankle pain after taking Cipro antibiotic.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This type of magnesium delivery seems to fulfill the promise of other reviewers to get through the systems without disrupting the gut.  I may in future switch to angstrom calcium as well.</li>
            <li> Tried 1/4 the dose and still got the big &amp;#34;D&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This really seems to be helping with the permanent side effects encountered from taking Cipro.  My fatigue is not as bad, and the pain from tendinitis has eased off some.  I will definitely keep taking this!</li>
            <li> The disturbing and painful nightly leg cramps are few and far between since taking Angstrom&#x27;s Magnesium.  I highly recommend&lt;br /&gt;it to my friends.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my son who suffered from migraines for 5 years.  He takes this along with a chelated magnesium with zinc.  It works great. He takes it daily.  Frequency of headaches is decreasing.  He takes a quarter teaspoon at a time 4 times per day.&lt;br /&gt; If he starts to get a headache, I give him a boost of magnesium along with two tall waters and an Epsom salts bath.  The headaches are getting further and further apart.  I am so happy with this product and fully recommend it.</li>
            <li> I started purchasing Angstrom Magnesium after I had a bad reaction to the antibiotic Ciprofloxacin. The antibiotic did terrible damage to my Achilles Tendon leaving me almost unable to walk. After going to the doctor various times and only getting other random medications to take (some which even hurt my liver) I decided to go the natural route. After trying Epsom Salt soaks and various creams to no avail I finally stumbled upon some medical literature online which mentioned a study on rats who after given the antibiotic and then developed tendon toxicity and eye problems were given magnesium supplements and vitamin E with great results. The Magnesium actually acts like a chelation agent and binds to the antibiotic and allows it to leave the body. Needless to say I was ecstatic. After doing more research on Magnesium I discovered that the oral bioavailability when taken in pill form is very low. Meaning most leaves the body and doesn&#x27;t enter the bloodstream so the cheap vitamin pills you buy in the store wouldn&#x27;t cut it for what I needed. Then I read about colloidal minerals and how they enter your blood stream when held under the tongue increasing the bioavailability greatly. That led me here. After about a month of taking this every day my pain subsided. After about 3 months I was walking normally again with little to no pain, and after six months of taking this wonderful supplement I was running again and able to work out again. All this happened to me when I was 21, I am now 23 and still take it religiously every night even though I probably don&#x27;t need to anymore. If there is anyone out there suffering from tendon toxicity or other side effects of Cipro or other antibiotics of the same family I urge you to try Angstrom Magnesium. It doesn&#x27;t even have to be this brand (although it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found). I honestly believe this to have saved my mobility.</li>
            <li> As received bottle was almost half empty; had read reviews of similar occurrences thought they were flukes, but got same treatment.  Recommend EXACT  same product from other manufactures label.</li>
            <li> Have not had magnesium levels rechecked, so I cannot comment on how well this product is assimilated in the body. I was already taking oral magnesium citrate and using Epsom lotion. Did not experience any unpleasant digestive symptoms from adding this to my regime. I am disappointed with labeling as there is no nutritional facts statement for comparing &amp;#34;dosage&amp;#34; like other forms of magnesium that are measured in milligrams per &amp;#34;serving.&amp;#34;  From my understanding of Dr. Dean&#x27;s book on magnesium most oral forms are so poorly utilized that consumers are not getting the labeled dosaging anyway. Lasted about one month, so it is expensive for trial and error supplementation. However, I am experiencing steady improvement in chronic hip spasm with radicular pain as result of magnesium supplementation orally and topically. Have recently added magnesium oil (which stings for a few minutes after application).</li>
            <li> Came fast.  Product works awesome!  Thank you!  My muscles are not as sore and I have more flexibility.  Awesome job</li>
            <li> I have used almost a whole bottle of this, taken 1/2 tsp morning and at suppertime. It seems to be helpful.  I tried two other kinds and they tasted TERRIBLE--so salty I would never want to take them.  This one is almost tasteless to me and doesn&#x27;t cause digestibility issues.</li>
            <li> Easy way to take magnesium.  Pleased.</li>
            <li> I had sever wrist and thumb pain--De Quervain&#x27;s Tenosynovitis-- that I either had to go through surgery or take a lot of medication.  A friend told me to take this and another spray form of magnesium.  My pain has almost vanished.  I am on my third bottle.</li>
            <li> Item NOT as advertised. I took 1/2 teaspoon, held it under my tongue for 15 minutes right before bed. The whole next day I had bad diarrhea (I know its gross, sorry). This is the same reaction I&#x27;ve had with many magnesium products. I only seem to be able to semi-tolerate magnesium taurate. It&#x27;s sad that I can&#x27;t find one that will work at a regular dosage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/18/16: Due to the comments I&#x27;ve had, I decided to add some additional info. I have found that I can tolerate magnesium taurate without any side effects at all whatsoever. This particular magnesium isn&#x27;t being assimilated which is what causes this flushing in many people. I&#x27;ve never experienced constipation in my life, so people who do may not have the same experience as me. This form of magnesium is sub-optimal proven by the flushing effect is has. When you chelate magnesium by binding it to an amino like taurate, it increases the up-take to your blood-stream significantly, removing the flushing effect.</li>
            <li> I battle chronic migraines and after doing some research decided to try this supplement.  After almost 3 weeks of using it, no migraines.  This is a record for me.  A fluke perhaps, but I&#x27;m not going to stop taking it anytime soon.  It has little to no flavor and seems to be doing exactly what I hoped it would.  No awful side effects (ex: diarrhea that others complain about).. its been perfect.  If you&#x27;re battling chronic migraines, its worth a shot to see if it helps you as well.</li>
            <li> Impressive product! It seems to be well absorbed and utilized by my body. Very slight mineral taste when taken as directed -- sublingually. I&#x27;ve also added product to a small glass of water which works for me  I will definitely repurchase this prod,uct and highly recommend it to others.  All the benefits of magnesium without swallowing many pills!</li>
            <li> Any reader would be amazed,(like me), to be educated on how very important and underrated by the medical profession the importance of sufficient magnesium is to good health and longevity. This product is easy to consume with no side effects. For anyone doubting the importance of Magnesium in our daily diet, I would encourage them to obtain a copy of  &amp;#34;The Magnesium Solution by Jay S. Cohen,MD. from a local bookstore, or &amp;#34;Amazon, on line. It&#x27;s well worth the investment of a few dollars to retain good health or recover what they may have had, and lost. Is there anything more valuable than good health ?If there is, this 85 yr old man has never found it !</li>
            <li> Helps greatly for  pain ( TMJ, Planters Faccitis, Bursitis, Muscle Cramps in toes and legs)  I take 2000 mg of ginger along with 2 tsp of Angstrom Mother Earth Magnesium to help with pain from TMJ.  I have microscopic colitis and I can not take regular magnesium.  This is very gentle to the stomach but very strong to stop the pain caused by magnesium depletion.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but it is not from Angstrom minerals. Please take a moment and go to the Angstrom mineral website and you will see that the bottles are not the same. You will, also, enjoy the well written education pages on each of the Angstrom minerals that they offer. Buyer Beware.</li>
            <li> Buy chelated magnesium from Swanson before springing big bucks on this stuff. There was a time I thought this stuff would &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; me. You don&#x27;t need to spend this much on something we have in good supply for much less $$$.  Thankfully I finally figured that out.</li>
            <li> fair product, just wasn&#x27;t what I needed. neutral</li>
            <li> I love using angstroms magnesium!  I keep it by my bedside and it&#x27;s easy to take and doesn&#x27;t interfere with digestion like a lot of other magnesium products, because it gets absorbed under the tongue.  When I take this regularly,  I get a great night&#x27;s uninterrupted sleep and over the long term,  have much less muscle aches and leg cramps.</li>
            <li> Mother Earth is the best no matter what the others say.</li>
            <li> I like these minerals very much. I&#x27;ve been using a set of these minerals that I purchased from the Mother Earth Minerals site (but I bought them because I had bought the magnesium on here) and my energy level has gone up noticeably. I&#x27;ve only been taking them for a couple of weeks, but I haven&#x27;t done anything else that would give me energy--on the contrary. So I heartily recommend these minerals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been magnesium deficient for the past six years -- two doctors have told me I need to take magnesium supplements, but I have not been able to tolerate even low doses of magnesium without getting severe uncontrollable diarrhea.  I had a few disastrous experiences and was afraid to take it again, and so I just decided I would have to live with the joint pain, irregular heartbeats, and other symptoms of low magnesium.  A few weeks ago my big toes started cramping up, so I surfed the net yet again looking for a magnesium supplement that would not cause diarrhea, and I came across the angstrom magnesium.  I tried it, and NO DIARRHEA!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You hold the liquid under your tongue (it&#x27;s virtually tasteless) for one minute and it will mostly be absorbed into your bloodstream -- then you swallow the rest -- the particles are so small that even if you swallow it, it is immediately absorbed into your body and doesn&#x27;t make it through your digestive tract to cause problems.  I&#x27;ve been taking it regularly for a week now and my joint pain is almost gone, I feel calmer, I&#x27;m no longer getting heart palpitations before bed, and I&#x27;m sleeping so much better!  And no loose stools!  Hallelujah!!  I am also taking the Angstrom Minerals \\&quot;minerals of life\\&quot; just to make sure I&#x27;m getting all the trace amounts of other minerals that may be missing from my diet.  These are miracle products!</li>
            <li> This is a great source of magnesium. My Doctor Gabriel Cousesns ( [...] ) recommends it to his patients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are too many benefits of magnesium to mention them all here -- but you can check out [ [...] ] for more information!</li>
            <li> This stuff is truly amazing.  I have been using it for the past month and I feel so much better.  I was having terrible ankle pain after taking Cipro antibiotic. I highly recommend that you give this a chance if you are having a similar issue.</li>
            <li> Sent wrong product -- magnesium oil.  I&#x27;ve found the RIGHT product an excellent addition to my coffee.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be adding magnesium oil to my brew.</li>
            <li> This reversed my cipro damage and really helped me and the wifes hip pains . Nice to pivet again and not have throat stretched anymore !</li>
            <li> I take Mother Earth Magnesium every day for TMJ related clenching pain. In my opinion there is no other magnesium supplement out there that delivers the same kind of positive results. Greatly reduced overall stress both mental and physical, the results can be felt almost immediately after taking a dose. Can be broken up throughout the day or taken all at once. I have not missed a day since i began taking mother Earth magnesium in the fall. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I have had issues with vitamin deficiency, magnesium being one of them. I purchased this product, and started taking a teaspoon of it, under my tongue for a couple of minutes, each night. I have noticed a VERY significant reduction in heart palpitations, and my sleep is better. It did not cause any &amp;#34;bowel issues&amp;#34;, like other magnesium supplements I have used.  I am extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li> This product is as advertised. I had no problems at all with it.</li>
            <li> I like to hold this under my tongue for two minutes before swallowing (the bottle says one minute) and I swear I can feel a difference immediately. I immediately feel much calmer and relaxed. I will be taking this for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good product, but seems like it made me feel a little bit funny when I first took it.  It is hard to determine an appropriate dosage as it is not consistent with tablet dosages, and absorption rates should be higher than tablets.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of magnesium and I love this brand.  I recommend it for anyone wanting to use magnesium.</li>
            <li> Angstrom Magnesium is the best! It works.</li>
            <li> This has virtually gotten rid of all my night time leg cramps!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subjective, but I do feel a calming effect from the recommended dose.</li>
            <li> My son prefers swallowing this Mother Earth Minerals Angstrom Magnesium over the spray magnesium oil (I do both, he doesn&#x27;t like the spray because it burns his skin).  This is easy to swallow liquid and he has been taking it for 3 months daily without a stomach ache (he&#x27;s 13).  What I notice is his anxiety goes way down and he&#x27;s able to focus and function better.  I absolutely love this magnesium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am ordering again.</li>
            <li> it has very little taste. I use it for 2 weeks now. I didn&#x27;t see the difference yet, but I guess its early to see.</li>
            <li> Taking this at the 1/2tsp doseage was initially undoable for me, it gave nasty headaches.. i cut to 1/4tsp, for one week then upped to 1/2 and it has been fine since.  Weather it helps with the problem i actually purchased it for is yet to be seen (I have Cipro damage).  I have been taking it two or three weeks now and there does not seem to be much change.  It does NOT give me bowel issues as some thought it might..</li>
            <li> Taste not too strong, seems to be of good quality.</li>
            <li> Good, it works as expected</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice a difference, but I&#x27;m also not consistent...</li>
