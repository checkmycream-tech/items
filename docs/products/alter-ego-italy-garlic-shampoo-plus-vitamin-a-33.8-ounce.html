            <li>I love this shampoo, it really helps remove product build up and</li>
            <li>Hopefully these products will work for me because I based my purchases on the vast amount of good reviews.</li>
            <li>So the price for the size of the bottle is worth it.</li>
            <li>My hair and scalp felt clean, and I didnt shed too much hair.</li>
            <li>but you have to use this shampoo with a really good conditioner as well because the shampoo alone leaves your hair a little tangled.</li>
            <li>Since this was my first time using both products</li>
            <li>Works better when used with the deep conditioner (or conditioner of choice).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also using the garlic mask hot oil conditioner.</li>

            <li>Very surprised, shampoo does not smell like garlic at all.</li>
            <li>I burned my hair recently with a relaxer and tried many other things.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually pretty soft now and it left a shine.</li>
            <li>I can say that after using this shampoo my hair feels soft before I put the conditioner on it.  </li>

            <li> This shampoo is what my hair was missing.  I can say that after using this shampoo my hair feels soft before I put the conditioner on it.  I am African American and I press my hair.  No more perms for me.</li>
            <li> If I could give this more stars I would. I burned my hair recently with a relaxer and tried many other things. I had told this one woman I loved her hair and wished that I could dye my hair that color. She asked me why I couldn&#x27;t and she happened to be a hair stylist and she recommended  this to me. I ordered it the next day. I got it in three days!  I tried it the other day and I can&#x27;t tell a HUGE difference in my hair. It&#x27;s actually pretty soft now and it left a shine. I would definitely recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> I have long coarse hair and I was experiencing hair loss due to issues with my scalp, which was very dry I think. I read about this shampoo and decided to give it a try. I had already used the Alter Ego hair mask and I was not impressed with the results. With the shampoo, my results were different though. It has stopped the hair loss on its tracks and it is very moisturizing. I was afraid this shampoo would smell like garlic, but one wouldn&#x27;t tell. This big size lasts me for months and it&#x27;s the only shampoo I use.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, it really helps remove product build up and my hair and scalp feel really clean after use. Other reviewers have stated their hair felt hard or dry after washing. I felt as though it was all the product, and oil build up was removed.  I also use the Alter Ego Garlic Hair Mask and my hair de tangled much easier and it smelled fabulous.</li>
            <li> There is something in this product that does not work well for people with relaxed hair.  After using, my hair was dry, tangled and stripped of its natural oils.  Will not use ever again.</li>
            <li> I like  it .Like the way it makes my hair feels</li>
            <li> The smell is great, you feel like you went to the salon. The shampoo really cleans your hair</li>
            <li> My shampoo was so watery that I had to pour it directly on my hair from the bottle, because when I put it in the palm of my hand it would not stay, I was very disappointed</li>
            <li> Makes you hair smooth&lt;br /&gt;Great shampoo</li>
            <li> I use this once a week with the conditioner and it definitely reduces breakage. I would recommend this product and this brand. Have used other alter ego products and have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very surprised, shampoo does not smell like garlic at all. It has a very discreet fragrance.</li>
            <li> I found it lathered way too much and  it left my hair  feeling stripped. It  did seem to slow down my hair shedding, that, and my using opened garlic capsules which made my hair reek.</li>
            <li> I have read many reviews before ordering this product. I was very nervous to buy it, but I decided to give it a chance. I washed my hair with the shampoo a week after my relaxer, and I expected my hair to be soft. But that wasn&#x27;t the case. My hair felt slightly hard and not very manageable. I actually had to use the Alter ego leave-in conditioner to soften my hair, which it didn&#x27;t do much.  My hair and scalp felt clean, and I didnt shed too much hair. I did  notice there was a small amount of hair strands in my comb.Since this was my first time using both products I can&#x27;t say if it will help to decrease hair shedding as of yet. The shampoo does not smell like garlic at all, it does have a slight perfume smell to it, not too strong. I will continue with both products and assess for any changes or improvement. I will update in a month. Hopefully these products will work for me because I based my purchases on the vast amount of good reviews.</li>
            <li> Works better when used with the deep conditioner (or conditioner of choice). Left my hair feeling stripped &amp; tangled when used alone. Overall, I like the shampoo. It works wonders when used with the alter ego conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I have used this shampoo it is a good product ,and it smells really good and doesn&#x27;t cause too much tangling</li>
            <li> I only used out once do far but out seem to have a good impression on my hair.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love love love this product. My hair has grown so much since I&#x27;ve been using this product. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery!  I love this product! My hair health has improved.</li>
            <li> Great product.  My salon used the product for years on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be even better if it came with a &amp;#34;pump&amp;#34;.  Hard to use in the shower :(</li>
            <li> I like the shampoo but you have to use this shampoo with a really good conditioner as well because the shampoo alone leaves your hair a little tangled. Not sure that I would buy this shampoo again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. If you are looking for a good shampoo buy this one. The best out there.</li>
            <li> I like the line of Alter Ego , but this buys Shampoo seems to have water came not as pure as I have purchased other times.</li>
            <li> It is not what I expected from the garlic shampoo. It makes my hair so dry that I can not brush my hair later.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair too hard and appears to be quite harsh on my hair.  I thought using this with the deep conditioner was great but no.  Cleanse the hair well.  That is all.</li>
            <li> Great product. .thank you :)</li>
            <li> I purchased the conditioner and shampoo with the deep garlic treatment a month and a half ago From a local beauty supply store and I have  plenty left So the price for the size of the bottle is worth it. Alter ego really does what it says it will but I have been going insane for a few weeks trying to get my hair curly so I have permed it 3 times which the shampoo stopped breakage but when I permed it for the fourth time and seems as if it&#x27;s not doing much for me which I am kind of worried about because I heard that when this product works for you, it works strongly!! i still love and give it 5 stars out of 5 l.</li>
            <li> Glad to see this product it is great to strengthening your hair ; I need to order more.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  I do notice less breakage since I have been using it. I ordered two bottles and one od them looks like it was mixed with water, but after shaking it is looked a little thicker. I didn&#x27;t have to do anything to the other one.  I don&#x27;t know if anyone else has experience this issue.  I also use the deep treatment conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair has been chemically treated (I did the Japanese Straightening) and I can&#x27;t tell you enough how great this has been for my hair! Even a year later when my natural hair has grown out, this stuff is a miracle worker. It smells like you just walked out of a salon and has made my hair much stronger and shinier. It also defrizzes my hair. I&#x27;ve also tried the conditioner and treatnent; they are all great. Highly recommended! And this is coming from someone with super dry hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I&#x27;m also using the garlic mask hot oil conditioner. Very good line of product. I&#x27;m very glad that my Dominican hair dresser introduced me to this line of product. My hair has never been healthier! I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> Worked well for my wife she will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Alter Ego Garlic shampoo by a friend, so I decided to try it.I have used this shampoo 2 times already and I have noticed some changes; my hair is not shedding as much as it used.Based on my experience I would definitely recommend it to my friends and relatives.</li>
            <li> i  am not really satisfated with the  shampoo because after i used i noticed that gave me a lot itchy</li>
