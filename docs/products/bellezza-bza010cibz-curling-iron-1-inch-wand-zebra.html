            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a wand before but my straightener uses infrared heat just like the bellezza curling iron so I knew it was going to be a product I liked. Since using it I don&#x27;t like it, I absolutely love it! My curls last all day and I can make them lose or big depending on how long I hold my hair on the wand. Also, the shipping was faster than expected by about 3 days and as a first time amazon user, I was very pleased with the overall experience. I will definitely be using amazon again for future purchases :)</li>
            <li> Purchased for my 15 yo daughter.  She loves it! It heats up fast, stays hot, creates perfect curls, and makes hair look great.</li>
            <li> Awesome wand. Love the spiral pattern it makes. Prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> So in love!!! Totally worth the purchase. I use it everyday. It&#x27;s great and I love how quickly it heats up</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my niece and she loves it! It&#x27;s super easy to use and gives you nice long last curls. I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Broke within 60 days of use and never got a reply from the seller NOR the manufacturer. Go witha GVP for $40.00.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and it works great and it looks great. Perfect gift for anyone you know. It works extremely well also</li>
            <li> I use this all the time and it holds the curl for about 3 days! My fiance love it when i use it so that is a plus!</li>
            <li> I got this curling wand from a cart in the mall, not on amazon, but I LOVE LOVE it! it curls my hair so well with no need to make my hair all crunchy with hairspray! actually, it curls my hair better when there is no product in my hair. the only downside, which youre going to have with any wand, no clip so you have to wear a glove or risk burning your hands! again, that happens with ANY curling wand which is why I didn&#x27;t reflect that in my rating.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend for her birthday. She doesn&#x27;t know how to use it, so I, being the guy, awkwardly figured out how to use this thing, and one the first try, this thing curled her hair like a pro when she thought it wouldn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I burned her. Oh well.</li>
            <li> This is a great curling iron, but its tapered. If i would have known it was tapered i wouldn&#x27;t have bought it. Great curling iron otherwise.</li>
            <li> granddaughter just had to have this one, she absolutely loves it.  She uses it almost everyday.  good deal at a good price.</li>
            <li> Works excellent for the ladies, have not heard a bad thing yet and is very stylish as well. Nice iron.</li>
            <li> i brought this product for my girlfriend for Christmas and she loves it. It works great and gloves were include it now she uses it every time we go out and she does her hair. the curls come out just beautiful. i saved a lot and did some shopping online rather than going out and buying product on black friday and everyone is crazy. The zebra print is amazing instead of a solid color it gives it that pretty look. This sure is a girls gift.</li>
            <li> Great product! Works amazing on my hair considering my hair doesn&#x27;t hold a curl and I don&#x27;t even need hair spray</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the wand but soon found great love for the product. I think it&#x27;s a steal of a sale and curls are silky smooth ....like I have never seen. Even my girlfriends all love it!</li>
            <li> My 14 year old grand daughter loves it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the in thing for teenagers to curl their hair and was a great buy!</li>

            <li> I ordered this item for my daughter she has been wanting it for some time this is the exact one they are selling at the mall for 179.00 I got a heck of a deal on this she loves it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never purchased a curling wand, so I was pretty skeptical about buying mine off line, but I jumped on it because it seems like such a good deal.

            <li> I bought for my niece for Christmas. She loves it. It heats up quickly and curls great. Smooth curls that hold all day.</li>
            <li> I love this curling wand! It heats up in second and the curl says for days! Love it! Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this curling wand. It holds my curls forever, even after sleeping on them! Also, I LOVE that it is Zebra!! But, be careful, it&#x27;s really, really scalding hot! I&#x27;ve already burned myself twice!</li>
