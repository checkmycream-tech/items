            <li>Sincerely yours, Georgia</li>
            <li>I began using more readily available products.</li>
            <li>This is worth buying more than once</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li>it has a pleasant aroma and is relatively inexpensive as a set.</li>
            <li>I love these items and find them to work reasonably well...</li>
            <li>Not a bad price, either.  </li>
            <li>I just started, but so far it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t recommend this product to anybody!</li>
            <li>I really love this product, I can see the Growth in my hair in the short time I had this.</li>
            <li>I have Graves Disease (a thyroid disorder)  that can cause hair loss, so I wasn&#x27;t sure if external treatment would work.</li>
            <li>It worked for the first week,</li>
            <li>I used the shampoo and conditioner for the first time about 6 months ago.</li>
            <li>I cut my hair into a super short bob like posh, but regretted it right away!</li>
            <li>However, it is very drying, so I would have to follow up with a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Work very gudd</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo cleans really well and the scalp feels almost renewed!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find that I&#x27;ll just have to pay for this product because it really works</li>
            <li>2 weeks later i began using it, and with in the first 3 months my hair changed dramatically!</li>
            <li>my bald spot is gone, I have new hair growth.  </li>
            <li>I measured my hair length on the first and last days of the month and gained an inch in length!  </li>
            <li>If I continue to see less hair in my comb and more staying on my head, I&#x27;ll definitely purchase this product again and will update this review.</li>
            <li>The only thing that I didn&#x27;t really like, was the fact that the instructions stated that it took around four minutes, (I think.)</li>
            <li>So in august i found an old lady magazine at my grandmaws house, and saw an ad for verseo hair plus.</li>
            <li>Do not expect some wild hair growth out of it.</li>
            <li>Seeing is WOW,</li>
            <li>WOW.  </li>
            <li>Ran out of this product for several months and really noticed the difference when I started using it again.  </li>
            <li>It was nearly alight.</li>
            <li>It made made my hair soft and stronger and reduced fizzing.</li>
            <li>I use it every other day and feel it conditions my hair better than some of the other shampoos &amp; conditioners that I&#x27;m using.  </li>
            <li>its been 8 months and my hair is now more than half way down my back!</li>
            <li>For a woman with thin fine yet lots of it hair, this is my go to to get it longer and thicker.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this made my hair grow, or if it was a combination of the hair vitamins I began taking around the same time and this.</li>

            <li> For me this product didn&#x27;t work, it dries my hair out and makes it difficult to comb, i have lost a lot of hair by using this product and my hair haven&#x27;t grow any faster! I really don&#x27;t recommend this product to anybody! Save your time and your money!</li>
            <li> I decided to wait and see how my hair was after I finished the bottles to review, so here it goes. I&#x27;m not sure if this made my hair grow, or if it was a combination of the hair vitamins I began taking around the same time and this. But I did notice some growth. The only thing that I didn&#x27;t really like, was the fact that the instructions stated that it took around four minutes, (I think.) for the shampoo to sit. It was a slight hassle because the conditioner said that it had to sit also, so my showers ended up taking longer than I had wanted. Also, it said use every other day, but considering this is the only shampoo and conditioner that I had, I used it every day. I did notice that it made my hair feel thicker, but now that I&#x27;m back to using my regular shampoo and conditioner, it&#x27;s gone back to feeling the same as it had been before this shampoo and conditioner. It&#x27;s a little pricy for me to order every time that I run out, so I guess I&#x27;ll see what my hair is like with just the vitamins.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product before, and I am happy with the results l get!  This is worth buying more than once if you want your hair down to your butt.</li>
            <li> This is some really good shampoo and conditioner. I definetely saw less hair shedding and my hair is longer. Need to reorder!! However, it is very drying, so I would have to follow up with a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I cut my hair into a super short bob like posh, but regretted it right away! My hair took forever to grow back!! like 2 years, and it still wasnt past my shoulders. So in august i found an old lady magazine at my grandmaws house, and saw an ad for verseo hair plus. I went online and ordered it. 2 weeks later i began using it, and with in the first 3 months my hair changed dramatically! It was softer and fuller and def. longer. its been 8 months and my hair is now more than half way down my back! incredible bc as i said before, my hair does not grow!! it grew longer in 8 months with hair plus, than in 2 years with all kinds of other products. so, bottom line... hair plus by verseo rocks!</li>
            <li> Seems to make my hair thicker and I do believe it is helping to grow my hair longer</li>
            <li> I could not tell the difference in this shampoo and conditioner than any regular shampoo and conditioner. I will leave this product to someone else.  I did not like it.</li>
            <li> Work very gudd my hair awrdy grew long juz the way I wanted it juz don&#x27;t like the way it smelled but other then that I like it</li>
            <li> Just a Regular Shampoo. Do not expect some wild hair growth out of it. Those who claim so are just believing the product details.</li>
            <li> For a woman with thin fine yet lots of it hair, this is my go to to get it longer and thicker.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner WORKS.  Seeing is WOW, my bald spot is gone, I have new hair growth.  I will be ordering more of this.  Because when I fine something that is good and it works, there is no stopping me from ordering more of this.  WOW.  Look out Oprah my hair is growing and one day, I will have a pony tail like you....Oh Oprah, I am soooooo happy.  Thank You Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;God Bless You.  Sincerely yours, Georgia</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I use it every other day and feel it conditions my hair better than some of the other shampoos &amp; conditioners that I&#x27;m using.  Ran out of this product for several months and really noticed the difference when I started using it again.  Not a bad price, either.  It&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li> This product only made my hair dry and brittle, so I would never recommend it to anyone. It is definitely a waste of both money and time.</li>
            <li> I found this product the best I found so far. My hair comes out so shiny and this product eliminates alot of fall out hair. I bought it to try something that advertised reducing hair loss. This seems to be doing it for me and I recommend it to anyone dealing with hair loss.</li>
            <li> I really love this product, I can see the Growth in my hair in the short time I had this.</li>
            <li> I just started, but so far it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Strengthens hair.</li>
            <li> Followed the directions to the letter and saw NO difference... I would not recommend this to a friend or buy again</li>
            <li> I gave this product 5 stars because my hair has grown faster in 2 mo. that at any other time I can remember. also a good conditioner. I would reccomend this product. It performs.</li>
            <li> Did not make my hair grow at all I have used it when I was in my teens and it worked though just didn&#x27;t this time around will no longer be wasting my money on this product</li>
            <li> Definitely made my hair feel thicker and I do notice less in the comb.  I can&#x27;t wash my hair as often as the product says.  If I continue to see less hair in my comb and more staying on my head, I&#x27;ll definitely purchase this product again and will update this review.</li>
            <li> I have Graves Disease (a thyroid disorder)  that can cause hair loss, so I wasn&#x27;t sure if external treatment would work. I ordered both the shampoo and conditioner. I measured my hair length on the first and last days of the month and gained an inch in length!  My hair also feels stronger and healthier.  I&#x27;m pleased with the results!</li>
            <li> Those two products have been my favorites since the day I tried it! The shampoo cleans really well and the scalp feels almost renewed!!!&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner enhances all of the above + extra \\&quot; run your fingers through \\&quot; feeling !!!&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!!</li>
            <li> It was nearly alight. It worked for the first week, then nothing. I dont understand, maybe it was all in my head. I wont waste my money again.</li>
            <li> All the females in the family uses this product and our hair is long and thick. We love it!</li>
            <li> I love these items and find them to work reasonably well...it has a pleasant aroma and is relatively inexpensive as a set.</li>
            <li> did not work and smell bad</li>
            <li> priced to hight. thank you  if every on sale look me up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Nancy</li>
            <li> I used the shampoo and conditioner for the first time about 6 months ago. I ordered it on line since it was not available in my area. I really liked the results I got when I used it. It made made my hair soft and stronger and reduced fizzing. Because of the price and the inconvenience of having to reorder on line I didn&#x27;t. I began using more readily available products. They did not work on my hair so now I&#x27;m back. I find that I&#x27;ll just have to pay for this product because it really works</li>
