    <ol>
            <li>Perfect for the winter months</li>
            <li>the bed perfectly .&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product!!</li>
            <li>Good product!</li>
            <li>Very nice quality.  </li>
            <li>very nice.</li>
            <li>I always have taken for granted when message sheets say they are cut generously for good coverage.</li>
            <li>but these are really nice and WARM!</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this order.</li>
            <li>the bolster don&#x27;t fit inside if they give more space it will be perfect.</li>
            <li>Tried to make my own</li>
            <li>Kind of deceiving.  </li>
            <li>The flannel is extraordinarily soft to the touch and the perfect complement to a relaxing massage.  </li>
            <li>better the nothing:)&lt;br /&gt;fits</li>
            <li>Yep, what&#x27;s not to love.</li>
            <li>you would not be able to put a pillow underneath.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used one sheet so far, but they fit my massage table perfectly, the cream color&#x27;s a perfect neutral and looks like they&#x27;ll be easy to wash.</li>
            <li>Excellent quality, delivery sooner than expected.</li>
            <li>These fit my table really well and wash up nicely.</li>
            <li>They do seem to lose some softness after 6 or 7 washes but are still comfortable.</li>
            <li>fit well.</li>
            <li>There were very soft and nice.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a comfortable starter set, but high volume washings will reduce longevity.</li>
            <li>got plenty of covers and they fit pretty good, could be a little tighter, however it saved us from buying a new table</li>
            <li>they are comfortable and soft but they are to tide in the massage table</li>
            <li>also they need to specify more that it&#x27;s only 4 covers for the massage table not 4 set of massage sheets</li>
            <li>Lots of lint when laundering, but these were the only sheets I found that fit a 77 x 30 x 4 table.</li>
            <li>If you wash all four sheets for the first time, you can expect to find lint equal to the size of a full skeen of yarn in the dryer lint trap.</li>
            <li>After washing they are a snug fit on the table, and I have a narrow table.</li>
            <li>soft.</li>
            <li>Upon the second use of stretching this mini sheet to fit my standard table, the string broke and now the are essential flat sheets.  </li>
            <li>they do not fit a regular sized table -- they do fit a travel table if you don&#x27;t use the bolster.</li>
            <li>They also are very snug on my 36 in wide table after washing.</li>
            <li>My table is a little large, but thought this was not a good fit.</li>

            <li> There are tiny red and black threads on some of the sheets that I dislike because it could look like a blood spot or a tiny black hair-</li>
            <li> I ordered these fitted sheets thinking that they would have the texture of the majority of flannel sheets I&#x27;ve felt in the past, but was pleasantly surprised when they arrived.  </li>
            <li> These sheets come out of the dryer soft and thick again and again.</li>
            <li> and it is not a large table.  </li>
            <li> These sheet seems to have a small string that borders the sheet instead of proper elastic.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other sheets that didn&#x27;t hold up.</li>
            <li> Quality of fabric/seams seem to be about average.</li>
            <li> However, I like them tight because it smoothes out any wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> The Sheets in not fit the over sized table..</li>
            <li> I bought 2 sets of these and they did shed in the dryer a lot- for a few washes.</li>
            <li> sheets shrunk excessively.  </li>
            <li> The sheets shrank when washed and were too small to cover the arm rests on my table</li>
            <li> Poor quality compared to other options.</li>
            <li> Hard to use twin sheets on the table.  </li>
            <li> After a few washings, they get a bit thin.</li>
            <li> They also shed on my clients (and me)- especially black pants!- until about 4 washes.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Terrible!</li>

            <li> Too snug on the bed, looks like it&#x27;s about to pop off.</li>
            <li> Hard to use twin sheets on the table.  Tried to make my own but these are really nice and WARM!</li>
            <li> These fit my table really well and wash up nicely. They do seem to lose some softness after 6 or 7 washes but are still comfortable.</li>

The flannel is extraordinarily soft to the touch and the perfect complement to a relaxing massage.  Very pleased with this order.</li>
            <li> If you use sheets on a daily basis for a clinic or your biz...don&#x27;t get these.  The elastic snapped and  sheets shrunk excessively.  Poor quality compared to other options.</li>
            <li> If you wash all four sheets for the first time, you can expect to find lint equal to the size of a full skeen of yarn in the dryer lint trap. After a few washings, they get a bit thin. After washing they are a snug fit on the table, and I have a narrow table.</li>
            <li> These sheet seems to have a small string that borders the sheet instead of proper elastic.  Upon the second use of stretching this mini sheet to fit my standard table, the string broke and now the are essential flat sheets.  Terrible!</li>
            <li> Very nice quality.  When I ordered them I was leary, having not seen the quality in person.  My clients have commented on their softness.</li>
            <li> i like those sheets. better the nothing:)&lt;br /&gt;fits the bed perfectly .&lt;br /&gt;As of the name \\&quot; Royal set\\&quot; ..nahhh&lt;br /&gt;I would say simple massage table sheet set .</li>
            <li> The Sheets in not fit the over sized table.. There were very soft and nice.</li>
            <li> I always have taken for granted when message sheets say they are cut generously for good coverage. Never again. These sheets don&#x27;t even cover the edge of the table let alone allow for a bolster. Quality of fabric/seams seem to be about average.</li>
            <li> After two washings the elastic broke. My table is a little large, but thought this was not a good fit.I did like the material, but no elastic makes for a slippery turn over process.</li>
            <li> These sheets come out of the dryer soft and thick again and again. Yep, what&#x27;s not to love. I&#x27;ve had other sheets that didn&#x27;t hold up. These have. I&#x27;d buy them again.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, delivery sooner than expected. Great product!!</li>
            <li> very nice. fit well. soft.</li>
            <li> The sheets shrank when washed and were too small to cover the arm rests on my table and it is not a large table.  Disappointed.  Last set I got were larger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used one sheet so far, but they fit my massage table perfectly, the cream color&#x27;s a perfect neutral and looks like they&#x27;ll be easy to wash. Good product!</li>
            <li> got plenty of covers and they fit pretty good, could be a little tighter, however it saved us from buying a new table</li>
            <li> they are comfortable and soft but they are to tide in the massage table the bolster don&#x27;t fit inside if they give more space it will be perfect.</li>
            <li> Kind of deceiving.  You think you&#x27;re getting a set of sheets and you only get the bottom.</li>
            <li> they do not fit a regular sized table -- they do fit a travel table if you don&#x27;t use the bolster.</li>
            <li> Had the same experience as the 3 star reviewer.  I bought 2 sets of these and they did shed in the dryer a lot- for a few washes. They also shed on my clients (and me)- especially black pants!- until about 4 washes. They also are very snug on my 36 in wide table after washing. Warning- you would not be able to put a pillow underneath. However, I like them tight because it smoothes out any wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;On the upside, I have been using them for about 6 months and they have held up to washing 1-2 times a week. There are some spots where I&#x27;m seeing threads getting thinner.  There are tiny red and black threads on some of the sheets that I dislike because it could look like a blood spot or a tiny black hair- but it&#x27;s not. I would expect my sheets to last about another 6 months until I will start replacing. I am undecided on if I will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;All in all- it&#x27;s a comfortable starter set, but high volume washings will reduce longevity.</li>
            <li> Go to massage warehouse instead prices are cheaper and they are the same quality also they need to specify more that it&#x27;s only 4 covers for the massage table not 4 set of massage sheets</li>
            <li> Lots of lint when laundering, but these were the only sheets I found that fit a 77 x 30 x 4 table.</li>
