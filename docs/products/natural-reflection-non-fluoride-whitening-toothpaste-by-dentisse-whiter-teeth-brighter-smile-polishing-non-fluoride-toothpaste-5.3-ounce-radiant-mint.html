            <li>The taste is wonderful and the freshness lasts longer than I expected.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect product for people who have invested in their smiles with vaneers or other cosmetic dental restorations.  </li>
            <li>The Dentisse rinse is easy to use in the Sonicare AirFloss.  </li>
            <li>Dentisse is fantastic, leaves your mouth feeling refreshed and your teeth smooth as if you just went to the dentist to have them cleaned.</li>
            <li>They were smooth as silk.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic...</li>
            <li>I feel more confident in my oral health because the product is all natural and the results are noticeable.  </li>
            <li>It was very sweet when I first used it</li>
            <li>I was happy with my Aquafresh Extreme Clean plus whitening.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great at cleaning and reversed all of the yellowing that the other toothpaste allowed/caused.</li>
            <li>I have tried all the teeth whitening toothpaste and this beats, super smile, smile brite, opulence&#x27;s, you name it.  </li>
            <li>mouth is minty fresh.</li>
            <li>17 bucks is alot for toothpaste but worth trying.</li>
            <li>This one really cleans, keeps the breath fresh through out the day, whiter and gleaming teeth.  </li>
            <li>Not only do I love the taste and feel of the toothpaste and mouth rinse, but I can see a difference in the whiteness of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Makes teeth feel very ckean and fresh.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean and smooth for hours longer than any other toothpaste I have tried.</li>
            <li>It is gentle and will not scratch your cosmetic restorations.  </li>
            <li>so this stuff is much wiser.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t tried the rinse, but a friend mine absolutely loves it...</li>
            <li>And it really DOES work for teeth whitening.  </li>
            <li>It is so much better than other over the counter brands.  </li>
            <li>teeth are clean and white.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for those who are very OCD with their teeth like myself.</li>
            <li>It is truly the first toothpaste I can say that is close to a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend both Dentisse toothpaste and mouthwash...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and worth the extra price.</li>
            <li>so I thought it was funny that she mentioned it not long after I&#x27;d resumed my affair with Dentisse.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a dental hygienist I am always trying new products to recommend to my patients.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like that &amp;#34;Fake&amp;#34; kind of white tooth thing.. there is a limit to &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; as far as I am concerned.&lt;br /&gt;Too-White teeth are like Huge Fake boobs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>As a dental hygienist I get free toothpaste samples, I recommend different formulas of toothpaste for various issues.  </li>
            <li>It is also very natural looking....</li>
            <li>Dentisse&#x27;s Natural Reflection toothpaste has a long lasting freshness; provides a pleasant cooling effect that lasts long after you have brushed your teeth.  </li>
            <li>From the overall freshness and foaming action to the visible polishing and whitening, I couldn&#x27;t give the product a higher recommendation.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;it is kind of expensive but its a large tube so it lasts quite awhile.</li>
            <li>The price may seem steep, but there&#x27;s a lot more toothpaste because you only need a little each time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is low abrasive/high polish white clay toothpaste; it tastes great and comes in a big tube in which the end screws on properly so none of it is wasted.  </li>
            <li>The toothpaste itself is smooth and not as harsh as Crest.  </li>
            <li>and it is natural....</li>
            <li>like a natural look.</li>
            <li>My teeth felt so smooth and slick.  </li>
            <li>As a Dental Hygienist who is constantly bombarded with requests to try new dental products, I must say I was leary.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical of paying more for another brand of toothpaste but wanted to try something new that was all natural.  </li>
            <li>next time i&#x27;ll go directly to the web site.</li>
            <li>Dentisse company is very responsive, I only hope they do not sell out to Crest or Colgate only to change the formula weekly and put it in smaller packaging!</li>
            <li>I was using a different natural toothpaste but it yellowed my teeth.</li>
            <li>I love the science behind the ingredients.  </li>
            <li>and I have only been using it once a day, and my normal toothpaste the other time.</li>

            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it that long...</li>
            <li> was so surprised when my mother said, &amp;#34;Your teeth look so white&amp;#34; because she doesn&#x27;t usually comment on things like that,</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because I didn&#x27;t feel that I was \\&quot;lacking\\&quot; in the toothpaste department.  </li>
            <li> wont be using any other toothepaste ever again!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> You only need a teaspoon of rinse, push the button and it blows the rinse with forced air between your teeth and then swish and spit the overflow.</li>
            <li> Less than two weeks</li>
            <li> I just wish it was a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> When I returned to Crest after running out of this - the Crest tasted terrible and didn&#x27;t \\&quot;feel\\&quot; as nice as this stuff...</li>
            <li> Highly abrasive toothpaste wears your enamel away, enamel is the whitest part of the tooth gone forever by using the wrong toothpaste!  </li>
            <li> Dentisse does not...at least not for me.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m at least halfway through my tube, and I gotta tell you-</li>
            <li> the tube was loose in the box and had ugly stickers on it.</li>
            <li> So, this one is tough...</li>
            <li> However, after reading the research behind Dentisse, I was eager to try it for myself.  </li>
            <li> Kinda expensive, but you get a lot...</li>
            <li> But the price is crazy.</li>
            <li> my teeth are not all that bad</li>

    <ol>
            <li> this is great toothpaste. it does as promised. teeth are clean and white. mouth is minty fresh. it does contain floride you you need to supplement.&lt;br /&gt;i give Amazon Prime a zero for packing. the tube was loose in the box and had ugly stickers on it. next time i&#x27;ll go directly to the web site.</li>
            <li> I have tried all the teeth whitening toothpaste and this beats, super smile, smile brite, opulence&#x27;s, you name it.  This one really cleans, keeps the breath fresh through out the day, whiter and gleaming teeth.  I&#x27;m very happy that I bought more and stock up on them. Highly recommend for those who are very OCD with their teeth like myself.</li>
            <li> Dentisse is fantastic, leaves your mouth feeling refreshed and your teeth smooth as if you just went to the dentist to have them cleaned. Highly recommend and worth the extra price.</li>
            <li> I have used Crest religiously for 38 years.  I was skeptical of paying more for another brand of toothpaste but wanted to try something new that was all natural.  I did a Google search on products available and after reading good reviews I bought the Dentisse toothpaste and mouthwash.  Immediately I noticed a big difference in the way my teeth felt.  They were smooth as silk.  The toothpaste itself is smooth and not as harsh as Crest.  The radiant mint is a great flavor.  I use the mouthwash daily too.  It is so much better than other over the counter brands.  I highly recommend both Dentisse toothpaste and mouthwash... worth every penny!!!!</li>
            <li> As a Dental Hygienist who is constantly bombarded with requests to try new dental products, I must say I was leary.  However, after reading the research behind Dentisse, I was eager to try it for myself.  Not only do I love the taste and feel of the toothpaste and mouth rinse, but I can see a difference in the whiteness of my teeth.  I am a 3 cups of tea a day girl too. I love the science behind the ingredients.  This is the perfect product for people who have invested in their smiles with vaneers or other cosmetic dental restorations.  It is gentle and will not scratch your cosmetic restorations.  Take it from someone who knows teeth, restorations and smiles.  Dentisse is a great natural toothpaste!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing toothpaste. As a dental hygienist I am always trying new products to recommend to my patients. It is truly the first toothpaste I can say that is close to a professional cleaning. The taste is wonderful and the freshness lasts longer than I expected. My teeth feel clean and smooth for hours longer than any other toothpaste I have tried.</li>
            <li> Dentisse&#x27;s Natural Reflection toothpaste has a long lasting freshness; provides a pleasant cooling effect that lasts long after you have brushed your teeth.  Nice combination of freshness and cooling.</li>
            <li> The price may seem steep, but there&#x27;s a lot more toothpaste because you only need a little each time. Not to mention the fact that it cleans your teeth superbly well. Easily the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it that long...and I have only been using it once a day, and my normal toothpaste the other time. Less than two weeks and someone asked if I had my teeth bleached....then wanted to know what the product was.Mind you I drink a good deal of coffee. It is also very natural looking....doesn&#x27;t look painted on white....and it is natural....remember that bleaching tray stuff is going to eat at your dental work and your enamel so this stuff is much wiser. Each day I see my teeth improving and I plan on continued use.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best toothpaste I have ever used. I just wish it was a little cheaper. Oh well.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m a bit of a toothpaste enthusiast and haven&#x27;t yet found one that truly says what it is going to do. This is the MOTHER of all toothpastes and has done EVERYTHING the product packaging says it will. I wish now I had taken a before and after of my teeth. It has whitened, smoothed the surfaces of my teeth, helps to eliminate plaque buildup and has strengthened my teeth. Never has a toothpaste done everything it was supposed to do. This is worth every penny!!! I will continue to make this my ONLY toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I believe this is one of the best kept secrets. Wish it was in the stores. I bought off their website...It says after 2 weeks you will notice a difference, but I noticed it after just one day, especially the mouth-feel. My teeth felt so smooth and slick.  Kinda expensive, but you get a lot... I am hooked. How do I go back to Walmart and buy off the shelf? Haven&#x27;t tried the rinse, but a friend mine absolutely loves it...</li>
            <li> Pricey but I love it.</li>
            <li> I really feel like a sucker for spending this amount on toothpaste. It is good and does what it claims. Makes teeth feel very ckean and fresh. But the price is crazy. What was I thinking.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine gave me a sample of Dentisse.  I was skeptical at first because I didn&#x27;t feel that I was \\&quot;lacking\\&quot; in the toothpaste department.  I was happy with my Aquafresh Extreme Clean plus whitening. However, after just 2 days of using Dentisse, I realized that I WAS lacking in the toothpaste department!  My teeth are noticeably smoother and feel cleaner.  I love the radiant mint flavor and the freshness lasts all day.  I feel more confident in my oral health because the product is all natural and the results are noticeable.  From the overall freshness and foaming action to the visible polishing and whitening, I couldn&#x27;t give the product a higher recommendation.  I am hooked and will not be going back to Aquafresh!  I have since allowed my family members to try my Dentisse and they are hooked as well!!!</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF is great.  And it really DOES work for teeth whitening.  Feels really effective as a toothpaste to freshen breath and clean teeth.  I&#x27;ve tried other toothpastes, including Therabreath, which I don&#x27;t like at all... by far, this is the best.&lt;br /&gt;I was so surprised when my mother said, &amp;#34;Your teeth look so white&amp;#34; because she doesn&#x27;t usually comment on things like that, so I thought it was funny that she mentioned it not long after I&#x27;d resumed my affair with Dentisse.&lt;br /&gt;And, just so you know, my teeth are not &amp;#34;so white&amp;#34;, that they&#x27;re too white.  I really don&#x27;t like that &amp;#34;Fake&amp;#34; kind of white tooth thing.. there is a limit to &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; as far as I am concerned.&lt;br /&gt;Too-White teeth are like Huge Fake boobs.&lt;br /&gt;I like a natural look.</li>
            <li> As a dental hygienist I get free toothpaste samples, I recommend different formulas of toothpaste for various issues.  I pay for this toothpaste for myself and have started to recommend it often to patients.  Studies are what drives me most and then how I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is low abrasive/high polish white clay toothpaste; it tastes great and comes in a big tube in which the end screws on properly so none of it is wasted.  Highly abrasive toothpaste wears your enamel away, enamel is the whitest part of the tooth gone forever by using the wrong toothpaste!  You want to use a low abrasive toothpaste such as Dentisse to preserve your enamel with years of daily brushing. I am also looking forward to the SLS-Free version for my patients that get cancer sores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Dentisse rinse....put it in a Sonicare AirFloss and start kissing.  The Sonicare AirFloss does NOT have research to back that it works for the health of your gums and teeth, so you still need to use something else between your teeth. The Dentisse rinse is easy to use in the Sonicare AirFloss.  You only need a teaspoon of rinse, push the button and it blows the rinse with forced air between your teeth and then swish and spit the overflow. Personally I think that even if you only used water it would have some therapeutic impact...but I like studies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dentisse company is very responsive, I only hope they do not sell out to Crest or Colgate only to change the formula weekly and put it in smaller packaging!</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic...unlike any toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever tried.  My teeth feel very smooth and it has a great flavor.  When I returned to Crest after running out of this - the Crest tasted terrible and didn&#x27;t \\&quot;feel\\&quot; as nice as this stuff...so I ordered more.  17 bucks is alot for toothpaste but worth trying.</li>
            <li> I was using a different natural toothpaste but it yellowed my teeth. I was actually keeping a box of baking soda in the bathroom and brushing with it after the toothpaste. This stuff is great at cleaning and reversed all of the yellowing that the other toothpaste allowed/caused. It was very sweet when I first used it but i got used to it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and this toothepaste is the best i have ever used.  it whitens and cleans!!!! wont be using any other toothepaste ever again!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is kind of expensive but its a large tube so it lasts quite awhile.</li>
            <li> So, this one is tough...it tastes great and seems to be doing a good job (no cavities!), but I have been using it for about 6 months now and it has literally made zero difference in whiteness.  Granted my teeth are not all that bad and I do drink coffee in the mornings...but, the strips work way better.  Well, the strips work and Dentisse does not...at least not for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased Dentisse after reading multiple amazing reviews promising smoother, whiter, cleaner teeth and fresher breath that would CHANGE MY LIFE!!!!!! Well, I&#x27;m at least halfway through my tube, and I gotta tell you- I will keep buying my Crest toothpaste in the future. There is nothing different about this toothpaste to me. My teeth feel and look the same and I don&#x27;t notice any extra freshness of breath. Not worth the money.</li>
