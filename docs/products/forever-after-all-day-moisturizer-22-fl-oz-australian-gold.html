            <li>My mom really liked this stuff</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice smelling lotion that moisturizes like lotions do</li>
            <li>They loved it and the price is a lot better than at the stores</li>

            <li>I have never used a tanning lotion as an extender, but I sure am glad I decided to!</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin smooth and moisturized in the winter and smooth and shiny during the summer to keep my legs looking good!</li>
            <li>It seems to be a fine product and the smell lasts and is quite good.</li>
            <li>It soaks into your skin very nicely and quickly.</li>
            <li>Smells great, nice large bottle!</li>

            <li>~ my skin felt wonderful and soft for hours after I applied.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion, it smells amazing and makes your skin glow.</li>
            <li>Lotion feels nice, but has an overwhelming odor that doesn&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li>I would say so far this one is the best feeling on my skin and the way it absorbs.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft and smells great!</li>

            <li>the best everyday lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.. great price...</li>
            <li>I love this makes my skin so soft and smells wonderful</li>
            <li>The scent is very light.</li>
            <li>very very light</li>
            <li>The fragrance is a very light vanilla scent.  </li>
            <li>That right there makes this amazing!</li>
            <li>so the quality was good, but doesn&#x27;t feel super hydrating.</li>
            <li>I also noticed it helps heal mild sunburns quickly, I&#x27;d say as good as aloe!</li>
            <li>the best lotion by far, very hydrating and smells amazing!</li>

            <li>It had a good scent and was pretty moisturizing.</li>
            <li>At first I loved this lotion</li>
            <li>Lasts a really long time and moisturizes great!</li>
            <li>The smell is good at first but after hours of smelling it you just want it to go away.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe that is preserves my tan as much as I was expecting, still nice loiton though!</li>
            <li>I first purchased this at a tanning salon after trying a sample; I just loved how it felt and the scent is tasteful and not overbearing.  </li>
            <li>I love the vanilla bean smell, and is not too strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong which I love.</li>
            <li>Went on easy and smooth!</li>
            <li>Love the cover and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly, packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is the best lotion for dry skin, and lasts ALL DAY.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not too strong or overwhelming.</li>
            <li>and I loved it so much I wanted to purchase more.  </li>
            <li>it was a nice size, great smelling, lasting and silky lotion!</li>

            <li>Smells great as well as makes skin feel soft!</li>
            <li>Nothing fruity, just a clean smell!</li>
            <li>Good value in this large bottle as well.  </li>
            <li>I was right, I love it !</li>
            <li>It  softens my skin instantly and leaves a light, very pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Love how silky velvety smooth this lotion makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>This is the most fantastic lotion I have ever had.</li>
            <li>Love the light vanilla scent and the price.  </li>
            <li>But I got this lotion for free with my tanning lotion and fell in love with the smell.</li>
            <li>keeps my skin Fantaxinice and smooth and healthy looking</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin so soft and smells great.</li>
            <li>So far it has been great.</li>
            <li>This lotion is ok; it does help extend your tan and keep your skin feeling smooth.  </li>
            <li>Loved it so much I ordered it here.</li>
            <li>really has alot of ingredients that are good for your skin .makes</li>
            <li>I bought this along with the AG Hot for after tanning, it has a very interesting smell - it isn&#x27;t strong &amp; may not bother others</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really impressed, and will definitely be ordering more when this (surprisingly large) bottle runs out!</li>
            <li>plus it&#x27;s not a bad price!</li>
            <li>My grandma is CHEAP, but used this once when I was at her house, and loved the smell and moisture so much that she requested it for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>Love this lotion  big bottle great price to thank you</li>
            <li>this lotion works very well, it leaves your skin soft and smooth.the smell is not the best for men</li>
            <li>This product vanishes into the skin very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I tan really easily, but i have burned before.</li>
            <li>My clothes stink from this strong vanilla scent, and the odor irritates my sinuses.  </li>
            <li>I love it so much that I searched the internet and was thrilled to find it through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully, the smell won&#x27;t be too strong for her senses.</li>
            <li>the scent isn&#x27;t too strong or overbearing.  </li>
            <li>I would strongly urge eveyone to purchase it - for the cost</li>
            <li>Not too strong.</li>
            <li>This lotion smells like vanilla beans, but not too strong.</li>
            <li>This smells so strong if you were to put it on your body</li>
            <li>It is so strong it is offensive.  </li>
            <li>moisturizes like no other lotion I have used before lol</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth to skin, has a baby soft feel, love the smell and texture, leaves no grease very happy will buy more in the future :)</li>
            <li>The smell is fine even for guys.</li>
            <li>I keep coming back and ordering this lotion, I love the way it feels on your skin and the smell is amazing!</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin smooth all day , and the smell is not too strong, to were it over comes perfume.  </li>
            <li>it has a pleasant smell but not overbearing and my skin stays soft and moisturized all day.</li>
            <li>I personally enjoy strong perfumes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great moisturizer and smells very nice, subtle vanilla scent.  </li>
            <li>so much I bought more and shipped it to friends and family!  </li>
            <li>Use it right after you tan and it will also make your tan last longer and be more beautiful.</li>
            <li>HUGE mistake; smells NOTHING like the product that I buy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a huge bottle and it moisturizes</li>
            <li>The bottle is huge</li>
            <li>The lotion doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I tan on a regular basis, and it is a good moisturizer with a light refreshing fragrance.</li>
            <li>but omg this lotion leaves skin so smooth</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s unreal how amazing this stuff really is..</li>
            <li>There is no color to it - just a wonderfully light scent and all-day softness.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough how great this lotion is.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE the way it smells when it&#x27;s fresh out of the bottle, but I noticed that the scent changed a bit after I rubbed it into my skin.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great for moisturizing my skin in the dryer, winter months but is essential for use on skin if tanning.</li>
            <li>AND, it makes your skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling silky smooth and moisturized, not greasy.</li>
            <li>It is a great deal for how big the bottle is!  </li>
            <li>I question whether or not the lotion I received is genuine.</li>
            <li>I purchased this lotion because it was cheap and the woman at the tanning salon freaked out when I told her</li>
            <li>Is it not crazy smooth?!</li>
            <li>This lotion is amazing and much cheaper on amazon than it is at the tanning salon.</li>
            <li>It does have a nice smell but it really doesn&#x27;t moisturize that well.  </li>
            <li>it also goes on creamy not like cheap stuff like water.</li>
            <li>The product feels smooth coming out of the bottle, upon applying to the skin, and after its applied you skin feels silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>Works great as a daily moisturizer for all over your body.  </li>
            <li>Way to sticky, doesn&#x27;t absorb and like rubbing really cheap stuff on you with no staying power.</li>
            <li>awesome stuff, use all year round</li>
            <li>It arrived promptly and was a much bigger bottle than I thought which was great.</li>
            <li>However it is not paraben free and for me that&#x27;s important.  </li>
            <li>I would give it 5 stars if it were paraben free, but</li>
            <li>My skin has never been as smooth as it is after using this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Then I would know it is the genuine product.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and soaks in.</li>
            <li>I understand its no longer being distributed to tanning salons so grab some while its cheap.</li>
            <li>It now smells like vanilla which still smells great, but it&#x27;s not the same.</li>
            <li>Kid you not -- I&#x27;ve gone from repitilian scales to smooth, healthy-looking skin.</li>
            <li>Does leave skin smooth throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Have used this for a year now and after price checking a few places, Amazon had the best price for the size.</li>
            <li>The smell is not overpowering, just a light scent of vanilla.</li>
            <li>i have used this lotion for about 2 years and its cheap on here.</li>
            <li>Its like someone had described a mix of CHEAP VANILLA and CARMAX.</li>
            <li>Australian Gold products are great, never disapointed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a great every day moisturizer</li>
            <li>It deeply moisturizes and leaves my skin feeling great.</li>
            <li>Works great as a daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I bought this lotion after reading several great reviews about it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overly feminine so guys out there might enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>Not greasy, but smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>Web page, when I started my search for this product, said anything over $25 was free shipping.</li>
            <li>So if you are looking for free shipping, don&#x27;t count on it from this sight.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth &amp; there is no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>This lotion has a nice,pleasant, and light scent that is not over powering at all.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin so soft and smells so good.</li>
            <li>Smells good and keeps my skin soft and hydrated all day.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin glowing, it smells good and it leaves your skin soft.  </li>
            <li>And the scent is my absolute favorite, nothing smells better.</li>
            <li>This product works great as far as moisturizing, but I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s an awesome moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;The seller packaged everything very well &amp; it was shipped before the expected date, which was even better ( &#x3D;</li>
            <li>This product just isn&#x27;t a good match for me and most likely will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li>BUT, as far as keeping good color....</li>
            <li>Just got this lotion and a little goes along way, it smells really good not to strong but most lotions I have bought before smells good when u first put it on</li>
            <li>I love Australian Gold products and was excited to buy Forever After All Day Moisturizer at a good price.</li>
            <li>and I was excited to find it at such a great price.  </li>
            <li>if you are sucked in by the reviews and packaging as I was..I suggest you try to get a sample packet of this first!!</li>
            <li>This is a very nice daily lotion than can also be used after tanning.</li>
            <li>It applies easily and leaves my skin super smooth.</li>
            <li>This lotion smells fantastic and reminds me of summer fun and tans!</li>
            <li>It is so rich, creamy and smooth and never leaves a sticky or shiny residue.  </li>

            <li>the very pleasant fragrance and all day moisture without feeling like I have a film or heavy grease.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S WORTH EVERY PENNY!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit costly, but worth it!</li>
            <li>The first time I used this lotion I was so impressed I threw out every other bottle of lotion I had.</li>
            <li>Smells great and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>It smells great and will keep your skin moisturizer for a long period of time.</li>
            <li>Is is so rich and creamy and not greasy.</li>
            <li>I bought this lotion from the seller &amp;#34;Green Web Inc&amp;#34; and they sent me a knock off of the original lotion.</li>
            <li>Love how much you get for the price!</li>
            <li>This product is so rich and creamy</li>
            <li>and I originally bought this moisturizer because the reviews touted its effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s always better not to rub the product too much into the skin!).</li>
            <li>and I was so excited to smell the lotion I put it on my hands</li>
            <li>Jergen&#x27;s original, Body Drench original, and Hempz original....</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m almost never disappointed.  </li>

            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t think that I would have thought this smelled anything like an old lady if I hadn&#x27;t read about the smell complaints on here before I bought it.</li>
            <li>Our sister-in-law had a bottle of this at our last canoe/kayak outing, my wife loved it</li>
            <li>so thats good enough for me!</li>

            <li>I really can&#x27;t say anything about the anti-aging properties but in my opinion you&#x27;re not going to rid of wrinkles in a lotion bottle anyway, but I do love the way it leaves my skin feeling.</li>
            <li>This has a sweet soft vanilla kind of scent.  </li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>My skin feels amazing after using this and being in Colorado where it&#x27;s extremely dry, it does the job better then any lotion I&#x27;ve tried before.  </li>
            <li>, I even use it occasionally on my dry, peeling face, it really is amazing!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty strong.</li>
            <li>Other than that it is great.</li>
            <li>And it smells so fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>Synergy&#x27;s moisturizer is amazing, thick and creamy and the scent is good.</li>
            <li>I believe that you will see quick results as I did after using this product.</li>
            <li>and it soaks in quick.  </li>

            <li>awesome product definitely buying again should definitely try it if you have not</li>
            <li>It is smooth, last all day and has a nice scent..</li>
            <li>The more I use this product, the more I like it, and I will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li>I first was introduced to this lotion at a tanning salon when it came free with another purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It has a odorless smell is rich and creamy but like magic fast absorbent smith to touch leaving your body glowing and summer ready.</li>
            <li>Ive previously purchased this lotion from a tanning salon and smelled great</li>
            <li>Not my favorite smell but wearable, and the smell fades pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I tried Kisses by Australian Gold and it was pretty good as well, but Designer Skin&#x27;s Guardian Angel is nothing compared to this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even wonderful after regular sun exposure or an all year long skin lotion!</li>
            <li>I will be buying another bottle to get me through the hot Florida summers!</li>
            <li>very gladful with my purchase!!</li>
            <li>First thing that came to mind when I smelled it was buttercream frosting on a cupcake!</li>
            <li>This purchase was my third time purchasing this lotion, and I love it!</li>
            <li>Not only was it great when I used to tan, but I used it on my new, flaky tattoos as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Not only does the lotion help dry skin, it is also has the best fragrance</li>
            <li>This lotion is very moisturizing but the smell of it is very strong and reminds me of an older woman&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li>love this product  use it after indoor tanning smells nice and keeps your skin soft would definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion, it smells fantastic</li>
            <li>It feels as though there&#x27;s a light waxy or chalky residue all over my skin, and it doesn&#x27;t feel very moisturized.  </li>
            <li>This is by far one of my FAVORITE lotions.</li>
            <li>Light vanilla scent leaves skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This lotion is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>And makes me feel fresh.</li>
            <li>but I am not crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li>Love it  makes your skin feel so smooth and your tan will last longer using it ......</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend says it&#x27;s worth every penny and to never stop using it.</li>
            <li>thei lotion not only smells good but is very mosturizing,.</li>
            <li>After 5 years of using this stuff everyday its still the BEST after tan lotion and incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>Love the scent and makes my skin feel soft all day</li>
            <li>In fact, at night before bed I feel as though I need to put on a fresh layer of it.  </li>
            <li>One bottle just lasted me 2-3 years, so be aware that the bottle is very large!</li>
            <li>May be it will ok to use in summer time as a  extremely light moisturizer when it&#x27;s super hot outside.</li>
            <li>Bottle is a pretty biG size, love how it makes my skin baby soft and love the smell!</li>
            <li>I have a hard time finding good moisturizers for winter, and this one does the job !</li>
            <li>though I was a lucky person guess not the lotion smelled funny and was a year expired.......</li>
            <li>But the fragrance also fades pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s other brands that work just as good with a lighter scent that doesn&#x27;t overpower the senses.</li>
            <li>It has such a light sweet fragrance and it keeps my skin smooth for hours if not days.  </li>
            <li>Was at a party when this guy hugged me and kept commenting on how good i smelt due to this lotion,</li>
            <li>Works like it says, helps you stay tan if you use it after right after you tan.</li>
            <li>lotion goes right into skin.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling soft, smooth, and smelling sweet like vanilla but not over powering.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer, leaves skin feeling soft all day long.  </li>
            <li>One of the best lotions I&#x27;ve ever used, it goes on thick and creamy and dries fairly quickly leaving your skin feeling soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell and it isn&#x27;t oily like most other lotions!</li>
            <li>my skin won&#x27;t be dry and prone to as many wrinkles from tanning!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the strangest girliest scent I&#x27;ve ever experienced in a lotion, and I had gotten compliments in the past.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion and it is great for everyday use and does not overpower your perfume and will last all day.</li>
            <li>I felt sick after I used it, way strong, kind of like a strong overpowering perfume, small notes of vanilla, but the best way I can describe the scent is a very STRONG mixture of CARMEX CHAPSTICK mixed with a cheap COCOA BUTTER lotion.......</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually perfect for those long winter months when skin gets especially dry, cracked, and irritated.</li>
            <li>This lotion is great except it is very very heavy.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say that it&#x27;s a simple lotion like any other lotion that smells nice.</li>
            <li>After my trip I continued using it because it was amazing on dry elbows, heels and my eczema.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft instantly and smells so good.</li>
            <li>Smells clean and makes skin super soft.</li>
            <li>Whether I&#x27;m tanning or not, this is by far the most intense moisturizing lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Australian Gold is one of a few companies in the tanning world that always puts out good products!!</li>
            <li>came in fast and was SUPER moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>I do not usually write any comments, bu this is fantastic stuff.</li>
            <li>I noticed it right away when I saw that the Australian Gold label at the top of the bottle was replaced with just an &amp;#34;AG&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
            <li>The scent is a light vanilla which is perfect for me as I hate lotions that are too strong.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend great for winter and improves trouble areas like knees and elbows.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a fresh, clean, airy, vanilla scent, and it is to die for!</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth leaving skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>it is exactly what you get at the salon.</li>
            <li>But it really does help you keep your tan!</li>
            <li>They were very helpful!</li>
            <li>It does contain caffeine, so be aware of that.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it after tanning yet, but I can say that it makes my skin feel so soft and smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion for multiple reasons.</li>
            <li>Forever After leaves your skin feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I bought the playboy daily mostiturizer instead, much better</li>
            <li>Smells cheap, tacky &amp; like it was something I concocted when I was 10 years old.  </li>
            <li>these are my top 2 and then top 3rd is angel regular scent!!!!!  </li>
            <li>It sells for a lot more at the local tanning salon.</li>
            <li>This really is an all day moisturizer!</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and exactly as described.</li>
            <li>So I used it for the first time today</li>
            <li>still feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It is also much cheaper on Amazon than it in in the tanning salons!</li>
            <li>I love Forever After Moisturizer especially after tanning.</li>
            <li>I use it on my entire body. :)</li>
            <li>I have better results with a generic cocoa butter lotion at Target.  </li>
            <li>I use this after I tan or after a shower or before bed and my skin stays soft smooth and my tan starts to glow again</li>
            <li>The product goes on great and soaks into the skin and is not greasy or too thick.</li>
            <li>I personally would rather have a more spreadable lotion.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I got introduced to this lotion working at my first job (a tanning salon) when I was 16.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment!</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is thick and creamy and does a great job</li>
            <li>smooth and soft lotion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s leaves me soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The scent on this has changed since the first time I bought a bottle years ago.  </li>
            <li>They delivered fast too!</li>
            <li>Purchased from Solarium - Had AG at the top instead of the Australian Gold logo shown on the product.  </li>
            <li>and I bought some more for her as a present when she ran out.  </li>
            <li>and I love the moisture it gives especially after a shower!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more of this Australian Gold product.</li>
            <li>Soothing and refreshing especially after tanning.</li>
            <li>ALso...bottle is a very genorous size!</li>
            <li>I have used this lotion for years as I am an avid tanning bed user.</li>
            <li>It is quite economical and you get a very generous amount.  </li>
            <li>If you want to travel and take some, you would want to put it in a smaller container. :)</li>
            <li>Love all the Australian Gold products and this is no exception!!</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion!</li>
            <li>but this allows it to really hydrate your skin!</li>
            <li>No matter how many of these lotions I try I STILL have yet to be swayed from KISSES by Australian Gold.</li>
            <li>It makes my legs feel really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Good everyday lotion.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t tan enough to notice if it makes a difference in the color of my tanned skin, but overall it&#x27;s pleasant and would buy it again.  </li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t think this one is special and does more than other lotions might do</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it isn&#x27;t a thin lotion which I love!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to all who want soft, smooth, skin, with a light fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Nongreasy, GREAT vanilla smell, very moisturizing, and I don&#x27;t lose any tan if I don&#x27;t go for several days as long as I&#x27;m using this.</li>
            <li>I first tried Australian Gold&#x27;s body Kisses because it had such good reviews</li>
            <li>Also the smell is not the same as I remember, it smells good just very dull, almost like it&#x27;s unscented, when normally it has a good lingering vanilla smell...</li>
            <li>Well that same darker glow had been able to stick thanks to this lotion.</li>
            <li>Its so much softer, and I can already see that my tan is lasting and looking much better then the results I was getting from another lotion I was using.</li>
            <li>I have always loved the Australian Gold products, The only place I can find them now is online.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin super soft!</li>
            <li>My skin is super soft!</li>
            <li>It has a nice, powdery smell that is not overwhelming, and it absorbs rather quickly.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe all the positive reviews I&#x27;ve read for this product.  </li>
            <li>Stumbled upon this &amp; decided to try it after reading all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s extremely rare to find in retail stores are normally located in tanning salons however that&#x27;s becoming rare as a result of low quantity and high demand.</li>
            <li>I really like this moisturizer, very soothing after a tanning session, I would recommend to all!  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion, I had received this as a gift a long time ago.  </li>
            <li>First off, can we just talk about how much product you get for your money?</li>
            <li>Seems a nice rich thick product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not greasy but very long lasting with a pleasant scent that is not over empowering at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Hands down, this lotion is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I was a little worried that I might not like the smell based off of some of the reviews, however I personally LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>It has an amazing smell (slightly coconut</li>
            <li>Extends the length of your tan without &amp;#34;wearing the color on your clothing&amp;#34; Just make sure you let the MOISTURIZER dry after application.</li>
            <li>have SUPER sensitive skin and am prone to break outs.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin so soft and isn&#x27;t greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty pricey though, next time I&#x27;ll probably just go with some cheap drug store lotion.</li>
            <li>It is a just a bit too strong for me, but again, this is a matter of individual preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this because of the price, large bottle size, and the rave reviews.</li>
            <li>But for the $ you get a large bottle and if it works to keep the tan</li>
            <li>There certainly may be fakes out there</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really as sweet and warm smelling as I hoped for.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this along with Solid Black bronzing lotion and my tan looks great and isn&#x27;t fading.</li>
            <li>I however have not used a \\&quot;legit\\&quot; forever after lotion before, so I can not be certain that this isn&#x27;t the \\&quot;real</li>
            <li>It is kind of thick to rub on but it leaves your skin smooth and soft!  </li>
            <li>it really does help retain my Suntan and helps with the overall skin appearance even on the face with fine lines.</li>
            <li>my skin was left really silky smooth afterward.</li>
            <li>The bottle is huge, so I think its going to last me a while!</li>
            <li>I give this product 5 starts because it really deserves it...</li>
            <li>This lotion goes on smoothly &amp; really quenches the skin.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really explain it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very creamy without the greasy feeling on your skin and keeps me hydrated all day.</li>
            <li>It also really does keep my tan longer.</li>
            <li>it helps that it soaks in fast.  </li>
            <li>I highly recomend this lotion!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing too and never greasy.</li>
            <li>so much that I started to use it every day after I showered.</li>
            <li>This is NOT the real lotion.</li>
            <li>But I have the real lotion which I get from the tanning store and compared them side-by-side.</li>
            <li>and some people really didn&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li>I really like the ingredients and the hemp seed.</li>
            <li>Also the pump on my bottle broke really fast.</li>
            <li>Very creamy and soothing to the skin..</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so much cheaper</li>
            <li>This lotion really keeps your tan longer and keeps the darkness of your tan as well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>, it evaporates really fast.&lt;br /&gt;great</li>
            <li>your skin very moist and youthful lookings and helps you keep your tan longer</li>
            <li>My shoulders were burnt &amp; this lotion is very soothing they don&#x27;t hurt anymore.</li>
            <li>its alright light vanilla scent that doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>I gave it four stars because the smell was too much for me.</li>
            <li>A guy who wants to smell like a candle or B.)</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really care for the smell</li>
            <li>It is very creamy and spreads well.</li>
            <li>but I am not paying that much.  </li>
            <li>but the lotion in it isnt the real lotion.</li>
            <li>The lotion I received was really liquidy and smelled like something i could get from lupiderm or something.</li>
            <li>and it really helps moisturize and maintain the tan.  </li>
            <li>lotion fast shipping</li>
            <li>Very hydrating with anti-aging benefits ------you do not have to keep  reapplying throughout the day----great moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>My fiance absolutely loves this stuff.</li>
            <li>highly suggest this product!</li>
            <li>Skin feels so much softer even after one application.</li>
            <li>NOT THE REAL</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Thanks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through the whole list of body moisturizers....</li>
            <li>I didnt think a smell would bother me so much</li>
            <li>It moisturizers very well.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery too.</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>but it hasn&#x27;t done much in the holding</li>
            <li>It really hydrates my skin.</li>
            <li>and it really is an all day moisturizer.</li>
            <li>if you burn at all this really helps.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t really feel like I&#x27;m moisturized.</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion although it does contain alcohol</li>
            <li>My skin is much smoother.</li>
            <li>and if it&#x27;s the real thing, but if it is, it smells heavenly.</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>Thank u so much..</li>
            <li>not so much...</li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t done much \\&quot;re-applying\\</li>
            <li>Also, very affordable.</li>
            <li>This lotion is what I expected &amp; more.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>The smell is kind of the a vanilla lotion, but I didn&#x27;t notice the smell after a few minutes of appling it.  </li>
            <li>Smell is good, but the lotion, I feel, is quite thick.</li>
            <li>the sent is a little strong, but it fades really really quick.</li>
            <li>so really i got a better deal due to your shipping price</li>
            <li>however, other lotions at walmart or any convenient store work just as well and even better.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this product to make sure I wasn&#x27;t drying my skin out due to laying in the tanning bed.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion becasue the smell lasts longer than any other lotion that I have been used.</li>
            <li>Not a male friendly product.</li>
            <li>I am currently doing indoor tanning, and originally ordered it for after my tan session.  </li>
            <li>skin must be dry to rub in easy.</li>
            <li>so this caught my eye at just a little over $12 with free super saver shipping.  </li>
            <li>The smell seemed a little strong at first, but after getting a few compliments on it I decided I liked it</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t see anything special about this lotion, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>so my skin stays soft and smooth, not dry and cracked.</li>
            <li>I extremely enjoy how it extends your tan for a long time.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic, fruity, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin pretty soft, as well.</li>
            <li>hands down favorite after tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>I purchased 2 bottles and might end up giving them to the nice little old lady that lives on my street.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin soft all day long, and I can&#x27;t stress enough how much I love the smell!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the whole indoor tannning experience &amp; was searching for a aftercare ltion.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really NEED a new lotion</li>
            <li>Smells amazing,  and leaves my skin soft soft soft all day long!  </li>
            <li>My dry skin is now gone and I have smooth, non flaky skin.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t moisturize any more than a standard generic lotion you could buy at a Walmart.</li>
            <li>okay, I just feel duped by not getting an actual Australian Gold product.</li>
            <li>It smells decent.  </li>
            <li>Ok this stuff clearly isn&#x27;t actually forever after by Australian gold bc</li>
            <li>I use this as regular lotion too.. love it,  totally not greasy</li>
            <li>But I like it for the scent mainly &amp; have ordered it 2 or 3 times.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also not a thin lotion, it&#x27;s pretty thick which I love.</li>
            <li>My hesitation was likely because I&#x27;m not typically a fan of the fruity smell, but if that&#x27;s something you enjoy</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this even for an all around year lotion.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to all tanners!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend ordering this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, and I have tried it all.</li>
            <li>If you are an occasional tanner or an avid tanner this is a must have!</li>
            <li>I mean I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>even though it&#x27;s a little bit pricier than drug stores, you get more.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Pumps could work a little better</li>
            <li>I have seen the bottles before and they seemed better made and the \\&quot;legit\\&quot; product seemed a little thicker than the shipment I received today.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product was worth the low amount that i paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;Unsure if I would reorder this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so soft!&amp;#34; Not thIck or oily and NO  tacky feeling.</li>
            <li>It is very hydrating and leaves your skin feeling silky and soft.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer for all year round.</li>
            <li>and I use this as my everyday lotion I love it</li>
            <li>but with this lotion my skin is so soft and firm and my tan lasts so much longer than with most lotions I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>so you&#x27;re definitely getting your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>I do love the scent, but I if you are wanting/needing a good long lasting moisturizer, I am not sure this is the one for you, unless you want to reapply several times a day.  </li>
            <li>I will use it but it is definitely not what I have used and loved in the past.</li>
            <li>Just tried this for the first time and having used Australian Gold tanning lotion before I really had no doubt</li>
            <li>BIG bottle i think its worth the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick and creamy and applies so nicely.</li>
            <li>Nice thick non greasy texture.</li>
            <li>The lotion has a nice consistency...not too runny and not too thick.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely dry skin so just using this wasn&#x27;t enough to keep my skin healthy</li>
            <li>The fragrance is not strong, but it is potent and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>love this product, had a problem with very dry scaly skin with regular lotions after I began my tanning bed</li>
            <li>Yes, it is slightly reminiscent of an \\&quot;older lady&#x27;s perfume\\&quot;, BUT I also think that it smells very classy, like a higher end perfume.</li>
            <li>so well that I can live with it.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t live with out it.  </li>
            <li>and I was looking for a new, every day moisturizing lotion</li>
            <li>but I like trying new products...</li>
            <li>i heard live my couture</li>
            <li>It does not have a strong smell at all which I was worried about based on other reviews since I have a sensitive nose.</li>
            <li>The smell is SO NICE and subtle.</li>
            <li>I have super dry skin</li>
            <li>I like classic Old Spice deoderant, in fact, my husband uses it.</li>
            <li>but it was too  much of a musky-off scent for me, especially when I was hoping to use it on my whole body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling very soft and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>keeps my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non greasy, very moisturizing and leaves a slight sweet smell on your skin all day.  </li>
            <li>The only positive note is that I feel the lotion prolongs your tan, but it&#x27;s not worth the strong odor.  </li>
            <li>I first purchased this lotion at a tanning salon, it was a tiny bottle.</li>
            <li>it is so soft and NOT GREASY!</li>
            <li>It smells classy and feels luxurious!</li>
            <li>My 73 year old mother uses it every day to keep her skin moist and she loves it!</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t have asked for more abrupt shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Product came unsealed, but overall the product is as described.</li>
            <li>Questionable \\&quot;knock-off\\&quot; as the label on the product isn&#x27;t the most professionally done, seems cheap and imitated.</li>
            <li>Oh wow!</li>
            <li>I am 50 years old and my skin feels like it did when I was 25!</li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t think it does anything to extend your existing tan any more than any other lotion</li>
            <li>Makes my skin so soft and hydrated!</li>
            <li>The lotion is fine but the smell it odd</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>Oh Wow!</li>
            <li>Soft sweet scent, thick cream and leaves your skin super soft.  </li>
            <li>i just did not like the smell and its really think so hard to rub in easy</li>
            <li>Im not usually picky about my lotions and not too sensitive to smells</li>
            <li>bottle is huge and will last a very long time!&#x27;</li>
            <li>The moisturizer lotion is very thick and when applying to the skin seems feels amazing</li>
            <li>If you are going to be selling fraudulent items it should clearly be stated in the description.</li>
            <li>it leaves my body really soft...</li>
            <li>I am 63 years old</li>
            <li>But now knowing how well it makes my skin velvety soft and not flaky</li>
            <li>i use this as an every day lotion, makes my skin sooooooooo soft, i get compliments all the time.</li>
            <li>It keeps my tan moist and soft.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>Do NOT waste your money.</li>
            <li>Keeps me silky soft and smells like awesomeness.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, there is no irritation at all .</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t break me out like most of the moisturizers I&#x27;ve bought lately</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My skin has never been this soft in my life.</li>
            <li>I also like the fragrance, it is not heavy or perfumy.</li>
            <li>However, I completely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I cant testify if it really makes my tan last longer</li>
            <li>The only thing is the pump doesn&#x27;t work so that&#x27;s a real bummer</li>
            <li>so much I gave it out as Christmas gift last year.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable for the size and actually amount of Lotion within the container.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to use as much and this bottle is big!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I get compliments on this whenever I apply it, so soft and</li>
            <li>Still very moisturizing, can&#x27;t fault it there, but this different and stronger scent is going to stop me from buying it ever again.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t personally see too much of a difference</li>
            <li>i have sensitive skin and cant use anything smelly (BBW)</li>
            <li>if i have a day off and use this lotion, my skin is soft all day.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>We use this product after tanning, which helps keeping the skin soft.  </li>
            <li>My skin stays soft all day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy or oily and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s been 8 hours since I applied it, and I can still see the glowing affects of my skin.</li>
            <li>and it keeps my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at the price....</li>
            <li>Plus it extends my tan and keeps my skin looking firm and smooth.</li>
            <li>Green Web Inc. The logo on the top says AG Australian Gold, not the logo with a koala bear.</li>
            <li>You do have to rub it in quite a bit for it to get absorbed, but for me, it still feels it&#x27;s sitting ON my skin and not absorbing INTO my skin.  </li>
            <li>Not too thick not too thin, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>It has a great smell and goes on very thick!!</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is I seem to use more of this to get equal moisturization from sone other lotions I use.</li>
            <li>A little like the Original Hemp lotion in scent and hydration.</li>
            <li>It does not leave a greasy layer like sond moisturizers and sinks right in.</li>
            <li>I tried it first on my hands; which were dry from the winter weather</li>
            <li>I Used it after my shower the following day and it smells like mens classic Old Spice deoderant.</li>
            <li>Smells great and keeps my skin hydrated for a little bit, but a few hours after application I have dry skin flakes again.</li>
            <li>However, the scent (difficult to described, but it reminds me of something my grandmother used in her 80&#x27;s) is much too overpowering and much too strong.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if it was a combination of the AG Hot -or not (see my review for AG Hot),</li>
            <li>I had given only three stars in my initial review because the scent was overpowering when applied for the first time.  </li>
            <li>The only time I tried it, I applied a pea sized drop just to ensure there would be no negative reactions.  </li>
            <li>it really does i have all the tan extender lotions and this one is one of my top choices it is really thick and moisturizing and it sinks in</li>
            <li>You know how dark you look right after you step out of the tanning bed?</li>
            <li>Ultimately, I was very displeased &amp; after using the product only twice</li>
            <li>The pump was one of the major selling points for me</li>
            <li>Amazon would block sellers who sell fake lotions that they claim to be authentic!</li>
            <li>(Major plus)</li>
            <li>Nice thick, long lasting lotion.</li>
            <li>As a super pale person, it keeps my skin moisturized</li>
            <li>and it made my pretty bad burn feel instantly better!</li>
            <li>Also, the bottle is HUGE and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just not what works for me despite all of the positive feedback from other customers.  </li>
            <li>it makes my skin so silky soft and the fragrance last all day and night.</li>
            <li>the barely there scent does not irritate at all.  </li>
            <li>It is the only lotion I can find to use on my sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t make me break out into a rash.</li>
            <li>so maybe it was a different lotion completely.</li>
            <li>Also makes my skin feel soft and silky and think it makes my tan in the summer last longer.</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling soft without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>Old folk perfume, White musk or something funky?</li>
            <li>Not great, not horrible.</li>
            <li>The smell was pretty bland not great but not horrible.</li>
            <li>It is the only moisturizer I have used that has shown results this fast and resolved the dry skin problem.</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY one to which my dry skin has really responded.  </li>
            <li>- I use it everyday and also right after tanning.</li>
            <li>I must admit I was a bit skeptical about the benefits of this lotion, but as I am now on my second day of using it, I love it!</li>
            <li>The second time I ordered it, the top was broken, I complained and they sent me a new one right away.</li>
            <li>As far as moisture is concerned this lotion is excellent even during this awful winter weather😀</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend for people with normal to dry skin (living in CO, my definition of normal to dry might differ).</li>
            <li>my skin was not dry or flaky.  </li>
            <li>Every lotion I have ever bought had harsh alcohol in it that dried out my skin even more.</li>
            <li>Not too strong of a scent but a subtle one to last all day.</li>
            <li>but i do know my skin is never dry.</li>
            <li>so I was a little skeptical, but I am SOOO in love with the smell!!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have the nice vanilla smell as stated in other reviews and isn&#x27;t very thick.</li>
            <li>I have bad skin and for some reason this is the only one that I am able to use !!</li>
            <li>It really does make my tan last longer vs. the other products I have tried.  </li>
            <li>The lotion keeps my skin soft all day long.</li>
            <li>Its thick and creamy and has a plain vanilla sent that leaves your skin silky soft and smelling lovely all day</li>
            <li>It hardly has a scent and is super oily.</li>
            <li>giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because it wasn&#x27;t quite what I expected as far as its moisturizing qualities, but I would highly recommend it for those who don&#x27;t necessarily have dry and problematic skin.</li>
            <li>This product has such a subtle but unique scent.  </li>
            <li>mix this with my Australian Gold dark tanning accelerator lotion and it helps the lotion last so much longer while moisturizing my skin.</li>
            <li>My husband has very very dry and sensitive skin and this is the only lotion that works.</li>
            <li>When I get really dry hands especially in winter, I go straight for this bottle over her other stuff.  </li>
            <li>With tanning my skin dries bad and I have used a lot of lotions and haven&#x27;t found a good one till now.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t bad, but it definitely wasn&#x27;t as good as i was expecting based on what people said.</li>

            <li> ~ my skin felt wonderful and soft for hours after I applied.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, it smells amazing and makes your skin glow.</li>
            <li> Lotion feels nice, but has an overwhelming odor that doesn&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li> I would say so far this one is the best feeling on my skin and the way it absorbs.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft and smells great!</li>
            <li> Forever After is by far the best moisturizer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The scent is very mild and my skin stays hydrated all day even after tanning!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and made my skin feel smooth, hydrated, and healthy!</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and gets skin SUPER SUPER smooth!</li>
            <li> Worth trying for sure!!</li>
            <li> Love how this lotion feels and love the smell (reminds me of bath&amp; body works warm vanilla sugar.)</li>
            <li> the best everyday lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.. great price...</li>
            <li> I love this makes my skin so soft and smells wonderful</li>
            <li> The scent is very light.</li>
            <li> very very light</li>
            <li> The fragrance is a very light vanilla scent.  </li>
            <li> That right there makes this amazing!</li>
            <li> so the quality was good, but doesn&#x27;t feel super hydrating.</li>
            <li> I also noticed it helps heal mild sunburns quickly, I&#x27;d say as good as aloe!</li>
            <li> the best lotion by far, very hydrating and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, it smells wonderful and make my skin super soft!!!</li>

            <li> I love the fell of it, the smell,</li>
            <li> It keeps your skin moisturized to get a better tan and keep it longer, since moisturized skin is a must when tanning.</li>
            <li> so most bot not sticky  </li>
            <li> GoldBond or Jergens is better.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> I used to be able to purchase this in my city but found that the supplier had stopped stocking their shelves with it.  </li>

            <li> It had a good scent and was pretty moisturizing.</li>
            <li> At first I loved this lotion</li>
            <li> Lasts a really long time and moisturizes great!</li>
            <li> The smell is good at first but after hours of smelling it you just want it to go away.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe that is preserves my tan as much as I was expecting, still nice loiton though!</li>

            <li> Good value in this large bottle as well.  </li>
            <li> I was right, I love it !</li>
            <li> It  softens my skin instantly and leaves a light, very pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Love how silky velvety smooth this lotion makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> This is the most fantastic lotion I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Love the light vanilla scent and the price.  </li>
            <li> But I got this lotion for free with my tanning lotion and fell in love with the smell.</li>
            <li> keeps my skin Fantaxinice and smooth and healthy looking</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin so soft and smells great.</li>
            <li> So far it has been great.</li>

            <li> Loved it so much I ordered it here.</li>
            <li> really has alot of ingredients that are good for your skin .makes</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the AG Hot for after tanning, it has a very interesting smell - it isn&#x27;t strong &amp; may not bother others</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed, and will definitely be ordering more when this (surprisingly large) bottle runs out!</li>
            <li> plus it&#x27;s not a bad price!</li>
            <li> My grandma is CHEAP, but used this once when I was at her house, and loved the smell and moisture so much that she requested it for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> Love this lotion  big bottle great price to thank you</li>
            <li> this lotion works very well, it leaves your skin soft and smooth.the smell is not the best for men</li>
            <li> This product vanishes into the skin very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I tan really easily, but i have burned before.</li>
            <li> My clothes stink from this strong vanilla scent, and the odor irritates my sinuses.  </li>
            <li> I love it so much that I searched the internet and was thrilled to find it through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully, the smell won&#x27;t be too strong for her senses.</li>
            <li> the scent isn&#x27;t too strong or overbearing.  </li>
            <li> I would strongly urge eveyone to purchase it - for the cost</li>
            <li> Not too strong.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells like vanilla beans, but not too strong.</li>
            <li> This smells so strong if you were to put it on your body</li>
            <li> It is so strong it is offensive.  </li>
            <li> moisturizes like no other lotion I have used before lol</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth to skin, has a baby soft feel, love the smell and texture, leaves no grease very happy will buy more in the future :)</li>
            <li> The smell is fine even for guys.</li>
            <li> I keep coming back and ordering this lotion, I love the way it feels on your skin and the smell is amazing!</li>

            <li> It makes my skin smooth all day , and the smell is not too strong, to were it over comes perfume.  </li>
            <li> it has a pleasant smell but not overbearing and my skin stays soft and moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> I personally enjoy strong perfumes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great moisturizer and smells very nice, subtle vanilla scent.  </li>
            <li> so much I bought more and shipped it to friends and family!  </li>
            <li> Use it right after you tan and it will also make your tan last longer and be more beautiful.</li>
            <li> HUGE mistake; smells NOTHING like the product that I buy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a huge bottle and it moisturizes</li>
            <li> The bottle is huge</li>
            <li> The lotion doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> I tan on a regular basis, and it is a good moisturizer with a light refreshing fragrance.</li>
            <li> but omg this lotion leaves skin so smooth</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s unreal how amazing this stuff really is..</li>
            <li> There is no color to it - just a wonderfully light scent and all-day softness.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough how great this lotion is.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE the way it smells when it&#x27;s fresh out of the bottle, but I noticed that the scent changed a bit after I rubbed it into my skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great for moisturizing my skin in the dryer, winter months but is essential for use on skin if tanning.</li>
            <li> AND, it makes your skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling silky smooth and moisturized, not greasy.</li>
            <li> It is a great deal for how big the bottle is!  </li>
            <li> I question whether or not the lotion I received is genuine.</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion because it was cheap and the woman at the tanning salon freaked out when I told her</li>
            <li> Is it not crazy smooth?!</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing and much cheaper on amazon than it is at the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> It does have a nice smell but it really doesn&#x27;t moisturize that well.  </li>
            <li> it also goes on creamy not like cheap stuff like water.</li>
            <li> The product feels smooth coming out of the bottle, upon applying to the skin, and after its applied you skin feels silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> Works great as a daily moisturizer for all over your body.  </li>
            <li> Way to sticky, doesn&#x27;t absorb and like rubbing really cheap stuff on you with no staying power.</li>
            <li> awesome stuff, use all year round</li>
            <li> It arrived promptly and was a much bigger bottle than I thought which was great.</li>
            <li> However it is not paraben free and for me that&#x27;s important.  </li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars if it were paraben free, but</li>
            <li> My skin has never been as smooth as it is after using this lotion.  </li>
            <li> Then I would know it is the genuine product.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and soaks in.</li>
            <li> I understand its no longer being distributed to tanning salons so grab some while its cheap.</li>
            <li> It now smells like vanilla which still smells great, but it&#x27;s not the same.</li>
            <li> Kid you not -- I&#x27;ve gone from repitilian scales to smooth, healthy-looking skin.</li>
            <li> Does leave skin smooth throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Have used this for a year now and after price checking a few places, Amazon had the best price for the size.</li>
            <li> The smell is not overpowering, just a light scent of vanilla.</li>
            <li> i have used this lotion for about 2 years and its cheap on here.</li>
            <li> Its like someone had described a mix of CHEAP VANILLA and CARMAX.</li>
            <li> Australian Gold products are great, never disapointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a great every day moisturizer</li>
            <li> It deeply moisturizes and leaves my skin feeling great.</li>
            <li> Works great as a daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion after reading several great reviews about it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overly feminine so guys out there might enjoy it.  </li>
            <li> Not greasy, but smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> Web page, when I started my search for this product, said anything over $25 was free shipping.</li>
            <li> So if you are looking for free shipping, don&#x27;t count on it from this sight.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth &amp; there is no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> This lotion has a nice,pleasant, and light scent that is not over powering at all.</li>

            <li> Smells good and keeps my skin soft and hydrated all day.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin glowing, it smells good and it leaves your skin soft.  </li>
            <li> And the scent is my absolute favorite, nothing smells better.</li>
            <li> This product works great as far as moisturizing, but I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an awesome moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;The seller packaged everything very well &amp; it was shipped before the expected date, which was even better ( &#x3D;</li>
            <li> This product just isn&#x27;t a good match for me and most likely will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> BUT, as far as keeping good color....</li>
            <li> Just got this lotion and a little goes along way, it smells really good not to strong but most lotions I have bought before smells good when u first put it on</li>
            <li> I love Australian Gold products and was excited to buy Forever After All Day Moisturizer at a good price.</li>
            <li> and I was excited to find it at such a great price.  </li>
            <li> if you are sucked in by the reviews and packaging as I was..I suggest you try to get a sample packet of this first!!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit costly, but worth it!</li>
            <li> The first time I used this lotion I was so impressed I threw out every other bottle of lotion I had.</li>
            <li> Smells great and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It smells great and will keep your skin moisturizer for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> Is is so rich and creamy and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion from the seller &amp;#34;Green Web Inc&amp;#34; and they sent me a knock off of the original lotion.</li>
            <li> Love how much you get for the price!</li>
            <li> This product is so rich and creamy</li>
            <li> and I originally bought this moisturizer because the reviews touted its effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s always better not to rub the product too much into the skin!).</li>
            <li> and I was so excited to smell the lotion I put it on my hands</li>
            <li> Jergen&#x27;s original, Body Drench original, and Hempz original....</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m almost never disappointed.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s not only a great aftersun lotion, it&#x27;s a great everyday lotion.</li>
            <li> sweet sent can make my stomach queasy.</li>
            <li> Smells so sweet.  </li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t think that I would have thought this smelled anything like an old lady if I hadn&#x27;t read about the smell complaints on here before I bought it.</li>
            <li> Our sister-in-law had a bottle of this at our last canoe/kayak outing, my wife loved it</li>
            <li> so thats good enough for me!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy, which is nice.</li>
            <li> This is really nice lotion, it makes your skin soft..</li>
            <li> Excellent thick moisturizing lotion.</li>
            <li> I see most of the reviewers really do like the smell, so don&#x27;t let this discourage you.  </li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say anything about the anti-aging properties but in my opinion you&#x27;re not going to rid of wrinkles in a lotion bottle anyway, but I do love the way it leaves my skin feeling.</li>
            <li> This has a sweet soft vanilla kind of scent.  </li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> My skin feels amazing after using this and being in Colorado where it&#x27;s extremely dry, it does the job better then any lotion I&#x27;ve tried before.  </li>
            <li> , I even use it occasionally on my dry, peeling face, it really is amazing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty strong.</li>
            <li> Other than that it is great.</li>
            <li> And it smells so fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> Synergy&#x27;s moisturizer is amazing, thick and creamy and the scent is good.</li>
            <li> I believe that you will see quick results as I did after using this product.</li>
            <li> and it soaks in quick.  </li>
            <li> Lotion absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly with a non greasy feel.</li>
            <li> I have definitely had better moisturizers for sure...</li>
            <li> not greasy soaks in quick but</li>
            <li> The delivery was quick...</li>
            <li> awesome product definitely buying again should definitely try it if you have not</li>
            <li> It is smooth, last all day and has a nice scent..</li>
            <li> The more I use this product, the more I like it, and I will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I first was introduced to this lotion at a tanning salon when it came free with another purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It has a odorless smell is rich and creamy but like magic fast absorbent smith to touch leaving your body glowing and summer ready.</li>
            <li> Ive previously purchased this lotion from a tanning salon and smelled great</li>
            <li> Not my favorite smell but wearable, and the smell fades pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I tried Kisses by Australian Gold and it was pretty good as well, but Designer Skin&#x27;s Guardian Angel is nothing compared to this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even wonderful after regular sun exposure or an all year long skin lotion!</li>
            <li> I will be buying another bottle to get me through the hot Florida summers!</li>
            <li> very gladful with my purchase!!</li>
            <li> First thing that came to mind when I smelled it was buttercream frosting on a cupcake!</li>
            <li> This purchase was my third time purchasing this lotion, and I love it!</li>
            <li> Not only was it great when I used to tan, but I used it on my new, flaky tattoos as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Not only does the lotion help dry skin, it is also has the best fragrance</li>
            <li> This lotion is very moisturizing but the smell of it is very strong and reminds me of an older woman&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li> love this product  use it after indoor tanning smells nice and keeps your skin soft would definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion, it smells fantastic</li>
            <li> It feels as though there&#x27;s a light waxy or chalky residue all over my skin, and it doesn&#x27;t feel very moisturized.  </li>
            <li> This is by far one of my FAVORITE lotions.</li>
            <li> Light vanilla scent leaves skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This lotion is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> And makes me feel fresh.</li>
            <li> but I am not crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li> Love it  makes your skin feel so smooth and your tan will last longer using it ......</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend says it&#x27;s worth every penny and to never stop using it.</li>
            <li> thei lotion not only smells good but is very mosturizing,.</li>
            <li> After 5 years of using this stuff everyday its still the BEST after tan lotion and incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and makes my skin feel soft all day</li>
            <li> In fact, at night before bed I feel as though I need to put on a fresh layer of it.  </li>
            <li> One bottle just lasted me 2-3 years, so be aware that the bottle is very large!</li>
            <li> May be it will ok to use in summer time as a  extremely light moisturizer when it&#x27;s super hot outside.</li>
            <li> Bottle is a pretty biG size, love how it makes my skin baby soft and love the smell!</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding good moisturizers for winter, and this one does the job !</li>
            <li> though I was a lucky person guess not the lotion smelled funny and was a year expired.......</li>
            <li> But the fragrance also fades pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s other brands that work just as good with a lighter scent that doesn&#x27;t overpower the senses.</li>
            <li> It has such a light sweet fragrance and it keeps my skin smooth for hours if not days.  </li>
            <li> Was at a party when this guy hugged me and kept commenting on how good i smelt due to this lotion,</li>
            <li> Works like it says, helps you stay tan if you use it after right after you tan.</li>
            <li> lotion goes right into skin.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling soft, smooth, and smelling sweet like vanilla but not over powering.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer, leaves skin feeling soft all day long.  </li>
            <li> One of the best lotions I&#x27;ve ever used, it goes on thick and creamy and dries fairly quickly leaving your skin feeling soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell and it isn&#x27;t oily like most other lotions!</li>
            <li> my skin won&#x27;t be dry and prone to as many wrinkles from tanning!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the strangest girliest scent I&#x27;ve ever experienced in a lotion, and I had gotten compliments in the past.  </li>
            <li> I love this lotion and it is great for everyday use and does not overpower your perfume and will last all day.</li>
            <li> I felt sick after I used it, way strong, kind of like a strong overpowering perfume, small notes of vanilla, but the best way I can describe the scent is a very STRONG mixture of CARMEX CHAPSTICK mixed with a cheap COCOA BUTTER lotion.......</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually perfect for those long winter months when skin gets especially dry, cracked, and irritated.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great except it is very very heavy.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say that it&#x27;s a simple lotion like any other lotion that smells nice.</li>
            <li> After my trip I continued using it because it was amazing on dry elbows, heels and my eczema.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft instantly and smells so good.</li>
            <li> Smells clean and makes skin super soft.</li>
            <li> Whether I&#x27;m tanning or not, this is by far the most intense moisturizing lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Australian Gold is one of a few companies in the tanning world that always puts out good products!!</li>
            <li> came in fast and was SUPER moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> I do not usually write any comments, bu this is fantastic stuff.</li>
            <li> I noticed it right away when I saw that the Australian Gold label at the top of the bottle was replaced with just an &amp;#34;AG&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
            <li> The scent is a light vanilla which is perfect for me as I hate lotions that are too strong.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend great for winter and improves trouble areas like knees and elbows.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a fresh, clean, airy, vanilla scent, and it is to die for!</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth leaving skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> it is exactly what you get at the salon.</li>
            <li> But it really does help you keep your tan!</li>
            <li> They were very helpful!</li>
            <li> It does contain caffeine, so be aware of that.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it after tanning yet, but I can say that it makes my skin feel so soft and smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion for multiple reasons.</li>
            <li> Forever After leaves your skin feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I bought the playboy daily mostiturizer instead, much better</li>
            <li> Smells cheap, tacky &amp; like it was something I concocted when I was 10 years old.  </li>
            <li> these are my top 2 and then top 3rd is angel regular scent!!!!!  </li>
            <li> It sells for a lot more at the local tanning salon.</li>
            <li> This really is an all day moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> So I used it for the first time today</li>
            <li> still feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It is also much cheaper on Amazon than it in in the tanning salons!</li>
            <li> I love Forever After Moisturizer especially after tanning.</li>
            <li> I use it on my entire body. :)</li>
            <li> I have better results with a generic cocoa butter lotion at Target.  </li>
            <li> I use this after I tan or after a shower or before bed and my skin stays soft smooth and my tan starts to glow again</li>
            <li> The product goes on great and soaks into the skin and is not greasy or too thick.</li>
            <li> I personally would rather have a more spreadable lotion.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I got introduced to this lotion working at my first job (a tanning salon) when I was 16.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is thick and creamy and does a great job</li>
            <li> smooth and soft lotion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s leaves me soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The scent on this has changed since the first time I bought a bottle years ago.  </li>
            <li> They delivered fast too!</li>
            <li> Purchased from Solarium - Had AG at the top instead of the Australian Gold logo shown on the product.  </li>
            <li> and I bought some more for her as a present when she ran out.  </li>
            <li> and I love the moisture it gives especially after a shower!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying more of this Australian Gold product.</li>
            <li> Soothing and refreshing especially after tanning.</li>
            <li> ALso...bottle is a very genorous size!</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for years as I am an avid tanning bed user.</li>
            <li> It is quite economical and you get a very generous amount.  </li>
            <li> If you want to travel and take some, you would want to put it in a smaller container. :)</li>
            <li> Love all the Australian Gold products and this is no exception!!</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion!</li>
            <li> but this allows it to really hydrate your skin!</li>
            <li> No matter how many of these lotions I try I STILL have yet to be swayed from KISSES by Australian Gold.</li>
            <li> It makes my legs feel really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Good everyday lotion.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tan enough to notice if it makes a difference in the color of my tanned skin, but overall it&#x27;s pleasant and would buy it again.  </li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t think this one is special and does more than other lotions might do</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it isn&#x27;t a thin lotion which I love!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to all who want soft, smooth, skin, with a light fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Nongreasy, GREAT vanilla smell, very moisturizing, and I don&#x27;t lose any tan if I don&#x27;t go for several days as long as I&#x27;m using this.</li>
            <li> I first tried Australian Gold&#x27;s body Kisses because it had such good reviews</li>
            <li> Also the smell is not the same as I remember, it smells good just very dull, almost like it&#x27;s unscented, when normally it has a good lingering vanilla smell...</li>
            <li> Well that same darker glow had been able to stick thanks to this lotion.</li>
            <li> Its so much softer, and I can already see that my tan is lasting and looking much better then the results I was getting from another lotion I was using.</li>
            <li> I have always loved the Australian Gold products, The only place I can find them now is online.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin super soft!</li>
            <li> My skin is super soft!</li>
            <li> It has a nice, powdery smell that is not overwhelming, and it absorbs rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe all the positive reviews I&#x27;ve read for this product.  </li>
            <li> Stumbled upon this &amp; decided to try it after reading all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s extremely rare to find in retail stores are normally located in tanning salons however that&#x27;s becoming rare as a result of low quantity and high demand.</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer, very soothing after a tanning session, I would recommend to all!  </li>
            <li> I love this lotion, I had received this as a gift a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> First off, can we just talk about how much product you get for your money?</li>
            <li> Seems a nice rich thick product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not greasy but very long lasting with a pleasant scent that is not over empowering at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Hands down, this lotion is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried that I might not like the smell based off of some of the reviews, however I personally LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li> It has an amazing smell (slightly coconut</li>
            <li> Extends the length of your tan without &amp;#34;wearing the color on your clothing&amp;#34; Just make sure you let the MOISTURIZER dry after application.</li>
            <li> have SUPER sensitive skin and am prone to break outs.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin so soft and isn&#x27;t greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty pricey though, next time I&#x27;ll probably just go with some cheap drug store lotion.</li>
            <li> It is a just a bit too strong for me, but again, this is a matter of individual preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the price, large bottle size, and the rave reviews.</li>
            <li> But for the $ you get a large bottle and if it works to keep the tan</li>
            <li> There certainly may be fakes out there</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really as sweet and warm smelling as I hoped for.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this along with Solid Black bronzing lotion and my tan looks great and isn&#x27;t fading.</li>
            <li> I however have not used a \\&quot;legit\\&quot; forever after lotion before, so I can not be certain that this isn&#x27;t the \\&quot;real</li>
            <li> It is kind of thick to rub on but it leaves your skin smooth and soft!  </li>
            <li> it really does help retain my Suntan and helps with the overall skin appearance even on the face with fine lines.</li>
            <li> my skin was left really silky smooth afterward.</li>
            <li> The bottle is huge, so I think its going to last me a while!</li>
            <li> I give this product 5 starts because it really deserves it...</li>
            <li> This lotion goes on smoothly &amp; really quenches the skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really explain it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very creamy without the greasy feeling on your skin and keeps me hydrated all day.</li>
            <li> It also really does keep my tan longer.</li>
            <li> it helps that it soaks in fast.  </li>
            <li> I highly recomend this lotion!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing too and never greasy.</li>
            <li> so much that I started to use it every day after I showered.</li>
            <li> This is NOT the real lotion.</li>
            <li> But I have the real lotion which I get from the tanning store and compared them side-by-side.</li>
            <li> and some people really didn&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li> I really like the ingredients and the hemp seed.</li>
            <li> Also the pump on my bottle broke really fast.</li>
            <li> Very creamy and soothing to the skin..</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so much cheaper</li>
            <li> This lotion really keeps your tan longer and keeps the darkness of your tan as well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> , it evaporates really fast.&lt;br /&gt;great</li>
            <li> your skin very moist and youthful lookings and helps you keep your tan longer</li>
            <li> My shoulders were burnt &amp; this lotion is very soothing they don&#x27;t hurt anymore.</li>
            <li> its alright light vanilla scent that doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I gave it four stars because the smell was too much for me.</li>
            <li> A guy who wants to smell like a candle or B.)</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really care for the smell</li>
            <li> It is very creamy and spreads well.</li>
            <li> but I am not paying that much.  </li>
            <li> but the lotion in it isnt the real lotion.</li>
            <li> The lotion I received was really liquidy and smelled like something i could get from lupiderm or something.</li>
            <li> and it really helps moisturize and maintain the tan.  </li>
            <li> lotion fast shipping</li>
            <li> Very hydrating with anti-aging benefits ------you do not have to keep  reapplying throughout the day----great moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> My fiance absolutely loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> highly suggest this product!</li>
            <li> Skin feels so much softer even after one application.</li>
            <li> NOT THE REAL</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through the whole list of body moisturizers....</li>
            <li> I didnt think a smell would bother me so much</li>
            <li> It moisturizers very well.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery too.</li>
            <li> fast shipping.</li>
            <li> but it hasn&#x27;t done much in the holding</li>
            <li> It really hydrates my skin.</li>
            <li> and it really is an all day moisturizer.</li>
            <li> if you burn at all this really helps.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t really feel like I&#x27;m moisturized.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion although it does contain alcohol</li>
            <li> My skin is much smoother.</li>
            <li> and if it&#x27;s the real thing, but if it is, it smells heavenly.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> Thank u so much..</li>
            <li> not so much...</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t done much \\&quot;re-applying\\</li>
            <li> Also, very affordable.</li>
            <li> This lotion is what I expected &amp; more.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The smell is kind of the a vanilla lotion, but I didn&#x27;t notice the smell after a few minutes of appling it.  </li>
            <li> Smell is good, but the lotion, I feel, is quite thick.</li>
            <li> the sent is a little strong, but it fades really really quick.</li>
            <li> so really i got a better deal due to your shipping price</li>
            <li> however, other lotions at walmart or any convenient store work just as well and even better.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product to make sure I wasn&#x27;t drying my skin out due to laying in the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion becasue the smell lasts longer than any other lotion that I have been used.</li>
            <li> Not a male friendly product.</li>
            <li> I am currently doing indoor tanning, and originally ordered it for after my tan session.  </li>
            <li> skin must be dry to rub in easy.</li>
            <li> so this caught my eye at just a little over $12 with free super saver shipping.  </li>
            <li> The smell seemed a little strong at first, but after getting a few compliments on it I decided I liked it</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t see anything special about this lotion, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> so my skin stays soft and smooth, not dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> I extremely enjoy how it extends your tan for a long time.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic, fruity, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin pretty soft, as well.</li>
            <li> hands down favorite after tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 bottles and might end up giving them to the nice little old lady that lives on my street.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin soft all day long, and I can&#x27;t stress enough how much I love the smell!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the whole indoor tannning experience &amp; was searching for a aftercare ltion.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really NEED a new lotion</li>
            <li> Smells amazing,  and leaves my skin soft soft soft all day long!  </li>
            <li> My dry skin is now gone and I have smooth, non flaky skin.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t moisturize any more than a standard generic lotion you could buy at a Walmart.</li>
            <li> okay, I just feel duped by not getting an actual Australian Gold product.</li>
            <li> It smells decent.  </li>
            <li> Ok this stuff clearly isn&#x27;t actually forever after by Australian gold bc</li>
            <li> I use this as regular lotion too.. love it,  totally not greasy</li>
            <li> But I like it for the scent mainly &amp; have ordered it 2 or 3 times.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not a thin lotion, it&#x27;s pretty thick which I love.</li>
            <li> My hesitation was likely because I&#x27;m not typically a fan of the fruity smell, but if that&#x27;s something you enjoy</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this even for an all around year lotion.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to all tanners!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend ordering this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, and I have tried it all.</li>
            <li> If you are an occasional tanner or an avid tanner this is a must have!</li>
            <li> I mean I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> even though it&#x27;s a little bit pricier than drug stores, you get more.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Pumps could work a little better</li>
            <li> I have seen the bottles before and they seemed better made and the \\&quot;legit\\&quot; product seemed a little thicker than the shipment I received today.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product was worth the low amount that i paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;Unsure if I would reorder this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so soft!&amp;#34; Not thIck or oily and NO  tacky feeling.</li>
            <li> It is very hydrating and leaves your skin feeling silky and soft.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer for all year round.</li>
            <li> and I use this as my everyday lotion I love it</li>
            <li> but with this lotion my skin is so soft and firm and my tan lasts so much longer than with most lotions I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> so you&#x27;re definitely getting your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I do love the scent, but I if you are wanting/needing a good long lasting moisturizer, I am not sure this is the one for you, unless you want to reapply several times a day.  </li>
            <li> I will use it but it is definitely not what I have used and loved in the past.</li>
            <li> Just tried this for the first time and having used Australian Gold tanning lotion before I really had no doubt</li>
            <li> BIG bottle i think its worth the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and creamy and applies so nicely.</li>
            <li> Nice thick non greasy texture.</li>
            <li> The lotion has a nice consistency...not too runny and not too thick.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin so just using this wasn&#x27;t enough to keep my skin healthy</li>
            <li> The fragrance is not strong, but it is potent and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> love this product, had a problem with very dry scaly skin with regular lotions after I began my tanning bed</li>
            <li> Yes, it is slightly reminiscent of an \\&quot;older lady&#x27;s perfume\\&quot;, BUT I also think that it smells very classy, like a higher end perfume.</li>
            <li> so well that I can live with it.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t live with out it.  </li>
            <li> and I was looking for a new, every day moisturizing lotion</li>
            <li> but I like trying new products...</li>
            <li> i heard live my couture</li>
            <li> It does not have a strong smell at all which I was worried about based on other reviews since I have a sensitive nose.</li>
            <li> The smell is SO NICE and subtle.</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin</li>
            <li> I like classic Old Spice deoderant, in fact, my husband uses it.</li>
            <li> but it was too  much of a musky-off scent for me, especially when I was hoping to use it on my whole body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling very soft and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> keeps my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non greasy, very moisturizing and leaves a slight sweet smell on your skin all day.  </li>
            <li> The only positive note is that I feel the lotion prolongs your tan, but it&#x27;s not worth the strong odor.  </li>
            <li> I first purchased this lotion at a tanning salon, it was a tiny bottle.</li>
            <li> it is so soft and NOT GREASY!</li>
            <li> It smells classy and feels luxurious!</li>
            <li> My 73 year old mother uses it every day to keep her skin moist and she loves it!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t have asked for more abrupt shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Product came unsealed, but overall the product is as described.</li>
            <li> Questionable \\&quot;knock-off\\&quot; as the label on the product isn&#x27;t the most professionally done, seems cheap and imitated.</li>
            <li> Oh wow!</li>
            <li> I am 50 years old and my skin feels like it did when I was 25!</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t think it does anything to extend your existing tan any more than any other lotion</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft and hydrated!</li>
            <li> The lotion is fine but the smell it odd</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> Oh Wow!</li>
            <li> Soft sweet scent, thick cream and leaves your skin super soft.  </li>
            <li> i just did not like the smell and its really think so hard to rub in easy</li>
            <li> Im not usually picky about my lotions and not too sensitive to smells</li>
            <li> bottle is huge and will last a very long time!&#x27;</li>
            <li> The moisturizer lotion is very thick and when applying to the skin seems feels amazing</li>
            <li> If you are going to be selling fraudulent items it should clearly be stated in the description.</li>
            <li> it leaves my body really soft...</li>
            <li> I am 63 years old</li>
            <li> But now knowing how well it makes my skin velvety soft and not flaky</li>
            <li> i use this as an every day lotion, makes my skin sooooooooo soft, i get compliments all the time.</li>
            <li> It keeps my tan moist and soft.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li> Do NOT waste your money.</li>
            <li> Keeps me silky soft and smells like awesomeness.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, there is no irritation at all .</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t break me out like most of the moisturizers I&#x27;ve bought lately</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My skin has never been this soft in my life.</li>
            <li> I also like the fragrance, it is not heavy or perfumy.</li>
            <li> However, I completely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I cant testify if it really makes my tan last longer</li>
            <li> The only thing is the pump doesn&#x27;t work so that&#x27;s a real bummer</li>
            <li> so much I gave it out as Christmas gift last year.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable for the size and actually amount of Lotion within the container.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to use as much and this bottle is big!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I get compliments on this whenever I apply it, so soft and</li>
            <li> Still very moisturizing, can&#x27;t fault it there, but this different and stronger scent is going to stop me from buying it ever again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t personally see too much of a difference</li>
            <li> i have sensitive skin and cant use anything smelly (BBW)</li>
            <li> if i have a day off and use this lotion, my skin is soft all day.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> We use this product after tanning, which helps keeping the skin soft.  </li>
            <li> My skin stays soft all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy or oily and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s been 8 hours since I applied it, and I can still see the glowing affects of my skin.</li>
            <li> and it keeps my skin soft.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at the price....</li>
            <li> Plus it extends my tan and keeps my skin looking firm and smooth.</li>
            <li> Green Web Inc. The logo on the top says AG Australian Gold, not the logo with a koala bear.</li>
            <li> You do have to rub it in quite a bit for it to get absorbed, but for me, it still feels it&#x27;s sitting ON my skin and not absorbing INTO my skin.  </li>
            <li> Not too thick not too thin, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> It has a great smell and goes on very thick!!</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is I seem to use more of this to get equal moisturization from sone other lotions I use.</li>
            <li> A little like the Original Hemp lotion in scent and hydration.</li>
            <li> It does not leave a greasy layer like sond moisturizers and sinks right in.</li>
            <li> I tried it first on my hands; which were dry from the winter weather</li>
            <li> I Used it after my shower the following day and it smells like mens classic Old Spice deoderant.</li>
            <li> Smells great and keeps my skin hydrated for a little bit, but a few hours after application I have dry skin flakes again.</li>
            <li> However, the scent (difficult to described, but it reminds me of something my grandmother used in her 80&#x27;s) is much too overpowering and much too strong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if it was a combination of the AG Hot -or not (see my review for AG Hot),</li>
            <li> I had given only three stars in my initial review because the scent was overpowering when applied for the first time.  </li>
            <li> The only time I tried it, I applied a pea sized drop just to ensure there would be no negative reactions.  </li>
            <li> it really does i have all the tan extender lotions and this one is one of my top choices it is really thick and moisturizing and it sinks in</li>
            <li> You know how dark you look right after you step out of the tanning bed?</li>
            <li> Ultimately, I was very displeased &amp; after using the product only twice</li>
            <li> The pump was one of the major selling points for me</li>
            <li> Amazon would block sellers who sell fake lotions that they claim to be authentic!</li>
            <li> (Major plus)</li>
            <li> Nice thick, long lasting lotion.</li>
            <li> As a super pale person, it keeps my skin moisturized</li>
            <li> and it made my pretty bad burn feel instantly better!</li>
            <li> Also, the bottle is HUGE and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not what works for me despite all of the positive feedback from other customers.  </li>
            <li> it makes my skin so silky soft and the fragrance last all day and night.</li>
            <li> the barely there scent does not irritate at all.  </li>
            <li> It is the only lotion I can find to use on my sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t make me break out into a rash.</li>
            <li> so maybe it was a different lotion completely.</li>
            <li> Also makes my skin feel soft and silky and think it makes my tan in the summer last longer.</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling soft without being greasy.  </li>
            <li> Old folk perfume, White musk or something funky?</li>
            <li> Not great, not horrible.</li>
            <li> The smell was pretty bland not great but not horrible.</li>
            <li> It is the only moisturizer I have used that has shown results this fast and resolved the dry skin problem.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY one to which my dry skin has really responded.  </li>
            <li> - I use it everyday and also right after tanning.</li>
            <li> I must admit I was a bit skeptical about the benefits of this lotion, but as I am now on my second day of using it, I love it!</li>
            <li> The second time I ordered it, the top was broken, I complained and they sent me a new one right away.</li>
            <li> As far as moisture is concerned this lotion is excellent even during this awful winter weather😀</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend for people with normal to dry skin (living in CO, my definition of normal to dry might differ).</li>
            <li> my skin was not dry or flaky.  </li>
            <li> Every lotion I have ever bought had harsh alcohol in it that dried out my skin even more.</li>
            <li> Not too strong of a scent but a subtle one to last all day.</li>
            <li> but i do know my skin is never dry.</li>
            <li> so I was a little skeptical, but I am SOOO in love with the smell!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the nice vanilla smell as stated in other reviews and isn&#x27;t very thick.</li>
            <li> I have bad skin and for some reason this is the only one that I am able to use !!</li>
            <li> It really does make my tan last longer vs. the other products I have tried.  </li>
            <li> The lotion keeps my skin soft all day long.</li>
            <li> Its thick and creamy and has a plain vanilla sent that leaves your skin silky soft and smelling lovely all day</li>
            <li> It hardly has a scent and is super oily.</li>
            <li> giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because it wasn&#x27;t quite what I expected as far as its moisturizing qualities, but I would highly recommend it for those who don&#x27;t necessarily have dry and problematic skin.</li>
            <li> This product has such a subtle but unique scent.  </li>
            <li> mix this with my Australian Gold dark tanning accelerator lotion and it helps the lotion last so much longer while moisturizing my skin.</li>
            <li> My husband has very very dry and sensitive skin and this is the only lotion that works.</li>
            <li> When I get really dry hands especially in winter, I go straight for this bottle over her other stuff.  </li>
            <li> With tanning my skin dries bad and I have used a lot of lotions and haven&#x27;t found a good one till now.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t bad, but it definitely wasn&#x27;t as good as i was expecting based on what people said.</li>
            <li> And I have very normal skin, not super dry, tan about 3 times a week, and I exfoliate.</li>
            <li> Although I have found better moisturizers for less money at the present time I am using this until its exhausted and will buy an over the counter moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend this for everyday when you get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> This is exactly the same product I buy in the salons, but for less than half the price.  </li>
            <li> It will definitely last me a long time.</li>
            <li> The lotion should last you a long time.</li>
            <li> Last a long time on your skin.</li>
            <li> Softens skin and long lasting.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin moisturized for a long period of time and does not leave me feeling coated and gross.</li>
            <li> the other reviews maybe other sellers are actually giving you the real lotion but the one I got was not real</li>
            <li> This lotion feels dry on the skin after multiple applications.</li>
            <li> I brought this  bottle of lotion to the local tanning salon and ask them why it feels so  dry on my skin.</li>
            <li> I  used it as a hand cream, but my hands are still dry after multiple applications.</li>
            <li> I use it daily to help with the itchy dry skin of winter and get compliments on the smell often.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the only lotions I&#x27;ve used that continously out performs anything else I try at helping with my dry patchy eczema in the winter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice, but my skin feels SO moisturized, soft, and firm all day.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to notice a change in my skin (long term)</li>
            <li> I use it after tanning with Millenium Tanning Solid Black Bronzer 100X and Australian Gold Body Kisses Daily Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I started using it when I started tanning to help clear up my skin a few years ago</li>
            <li> I can smell it long after I apply it.</li>
            <li> So although I won&#x27;t be baking on the tan beds long, this lotion will now ALWAYS be my go to one.</li>
            <li> the one I had so long ago didnt have hemp in it</li>
            <li> It also lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The bottle for me lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> The bottle is way bigger than I expected and it smells great!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I feel the moisture all day long</li>
            <li> a long time&lt;br /&gt;LOVE</li>
            <li> A few years ago I probably woulda argued it smelled like a gathering of old ladies.</li>
            <li> Lotion is thick and feels very moisurizing.</li>
            <li> but I felt like it actually &#x27;encouraged&#x27; my skin to burn further rather than cooling my skin down or providing any moisturizing effect.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel SO smooth, and I usually have really dry, hard to retain moisture, skin.</li>
            <li> The smell lasts a really long time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using other lotions after using this one, but always come back to this lotion.  </li>
            <li> I found this brand by buying the other Australian Gold product that is fruity smelling.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see the long term outcome!</li>
            <li> and I have had dry skin all my life.</li>
            <li> Dry skin is a side effect.</li>
            <li> and i wake up with dry skin every morning.</li>
            <li> I use it every morning, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out.  </li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t look dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> They suggested that it may be expired, because of its dry consistency.</li>
            <li> When I am tanning a lot or on the beach a lot my skin gets so dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> The pump got clogged and I had to dump it out of the bottle, but then it started getting dry</li>
            <li> This lotion is so moisturizing for my extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li> This lotion smells divine and works wonders for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I got to work and still felt dry and smelled like a man.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been dry skinned at all.</li>
            <li> after tanning my skin is soo dry..</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> and I never have break outs nor dry or oily skin.</li>
            <li> But still leaves skin dry.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it smells a bit masculine to me.</li>
            <li> this is my 3rd bottle, and they each last like 4-6 months of daily use.&lt;br /&gt;great thick moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li> It arrived unsealed with a loose cap (unscrewed a bit) and the pump wasn&#x27;t locked to prevent accidental depression during shipping.</li>
            <li> So when I applied this morning after tanning last night, this lotion&#x27;s scent changed from a sweet-but-not-too-sweet vanilla bean smell to a slightly burned smelling, bronzer-y, powdery vanilla.</li>
            <li> Even though I have only been using this lotion for alittle less then a month, I can see the difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> The initial smell is like a vanilla-sugar scent, but then it changes slightly as it dries.</li>
            <li> Not sure why, but it really dried out fast.  </li>
            <li> If you have very dry skin</li>
            <li> Moisturizes very dry skin  all day.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin in the winter</li>
            <li> It only takes a little, maybe 3 pumps to moisturize my legs.</li>
            <li> I wanted to find a large bottle of lotion that would last me and wasn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
            <li> The only reason for 4 star rating is that scent was a little heavy for my personal taste.</li>
            <li> Typically, with other lotions, I don&#x27;t feel like this is necessary</li>
            <li> Pink Diamond</li>
            <li> but I did start to fade only after a few days of not tanning.</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than expected.  </li>
            <li> I have spent alot of money on quality department store lotions to the basics from walgreens.</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d try this because for some reason KISSES is not available here only for $99 from another country???  </li>
            <li> Arrived when expected.</li>
            <li> I absolutely do not think that this a counterfeit product, companies change formulations and fragrances all the time.</li>
            <li> so i couldnt use it anymore after only a few times.</li>
            <li> I currently have been rotating through a few moisturizers...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time in the sun this summer.</li>
            <li> It is thick but not heavy like a cream.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by how thick this lotion was.</li>
            <li> With any other lotion, I get rough itchy patches on my arms.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of a fan of the smell and it&#x27;s not as hydrating as some other after tan moisturizers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> But I think its a little watered down personally.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Ultra moisturizing...and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way and it makes your skin feel like silk.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about this product at first, since I can basically buy the same thing off the shelf at the grocery store for about half the price.</li>
            <li> but this keeps my skin from feeling tight, or looking too dry.</li>
            <li> I looked at some other reviews after I ordered it</li>
            <li> The lotion works well but due to the scent I do not plan to purchase this lotion again.</li>
            <li> She has tried other lotions and never found anything to please her until now.</li>
            <li> I PROMISE you can&#x27;t go wrong and will want to buy a whole case for yourself!</li>
            <li> Overall I would recommend it for an everyday lotion!</li>
            <li> Nothing about this lotion helps prolong a tan anymore than any other lotion</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a pungent smell like some other lotions and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> Does not feel greasy like other lotions.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a hugh bottle and will probably never need to buy another bottle as I tan once every other week.</li>
            <li> will not use any other lotion from now on.</li>
            <li> However, the smell is iffy, and it doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly as other lotions.</li>
            <li> Smells a little weird after you first apply it, but that only lasts a few minutes.</li>
            <li> --they have this lotion marked up to $26 at my tanning place--I paid less than half that!!!</li>
            <li> I have gone through at least ten bottles of this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick lotion and will definitely only need to be applied once.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also not a fan of the streaky thick white formulation.</li>
            <li> The lotion is very heavy as well, and is harder to apply than other brands I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I typically order 2 or 3 bottles at a time because I use it so often.</li>
            <li> those who complain about the smell - give it half an hour</li>
            <li> I wanted to switch to something that has less smell and the reviews lead me to believe that.</li>
            <li> this stuff has an odd smell is</li>
            <li> but I wish it had a less synthetic smell and a lighter texture (on skin damaged skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;And now, the less desirable attributes.  </li>
            <li> I used it after bathing which is when I typically use any body lotion.  </li>
            <li> Slight coconut scent.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to try this lotion if you haven&#x27;t&#x27; smelled it first.</li>
            <li> and it is thick and does the job for dry skin</li>
            <li> A little sticky after I apply.  </li>
            <li> I have to wait a little bit to get dress</li>
            <li> It was a little sticky and took a bit to sink into my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin has firmed up a little bit and my tan seems darker when I use this lotion.</li>
            <li> Just got the lotion today and used a little of it</li>
            <li> It is a little thicker</li>
            <li> I have used it for years now, and my dry skin is a thing of the past!</li>
            <li> This company should be shut down and give refunds!</li>
            <li> The vanilla scent is heavy and overpowering, and doesn&#x27;t go away.  </li>
            <li> I didnt notice after a few hours and u needed to apply it every 12 hours.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product quite a few times.</li>
            <li> I used this lotion everyday when I was in the Caribbean for vacation</li>
            <li> I tan everyday and use it immediately after and after showers.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I think I will just leave this out in my pool box as a community lotion for everyone to use but it will not be my everyday lotion.</li>
            <li> I use them in place of perfumes since I have to apply it everyday.</li>
            <li> i have been tanning everyday and my skin started to get flakey..</li>
            <li> After a few days the dryness improves.  </li>
            <li> so it needs to be reapplied a few times a day.</li>
            <li> My everyday lotion</li>
            <li> Will continue using this as an everyday moisturizer.</li>
            <li> However there were a few comments talking about getting expired products......</li>
            <li> Got this about 8 months ago and still have half a bottle!</li>
            <li> maybe help someone i know its hard to pick out lotions and other peoples</li>
            <li> I bought this at my tanning salon last week and of course found it to be less expensive on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> A little thick - have to rub it in a lot.</li>
            <li> It goes on a little thick, which I like.</li>
            <li> I usually purchase this from the salon, but thought I would try on amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use this moisturizer as I have used in the past couple of years.</li>
            <li> My lotion isnt thick and doesnt moisturize but a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Obviously NOT authentic product.  </li>
            <li> I tan usually between March-September every year</li>
            <li> not sure about this one (from amazon)</li>
            <li> I originally bought this to help keep my skin moisturized while I tried to build a base tan very slowly (yay for being a pale redhead).  </li>
            <li> All of that aside the lotion is very heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> It is thicker and lasts ALL DAY unlike the thin viscosity of other Tan Extenders.</li>
            <li> Selling a customer false advertisement is not only immoral, and a waste of my time but illegal.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it if yu have a fake tan it will leave your skin crackling and dry.</li>
            <li> then hard to tan areas</li>
            <li> I grudgingly gave 2 stars (simply for the moisturizing factor).    </li>
            <li> The least I can say is that this lotion smells like heaven in a bottle.</li>
            <li> Thick &amp; luxurious.  </li>
            <li> Too thick for me</li>
            <li> I was forced to go to work smelling like a stripper.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely hate the smell of it, so much</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s thick.</li>
            <li> Thick.  </li>
            <li> The lotion is extremely thick and it doesn&#x27;t even feel like it&#x27;s moisturizing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, but not so thick that it takes forever to rub in.</li>
            <li> Not happy :-/</li>
            <li> it will bring you out of that not tanning phase and really give your hard to tan areas a boost !!!!!</li>
            <li> It was so bad it actually gave me a HEADACHE.</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several times, but I can&#x27;t deal with the headache. :(</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed, because I use almost all of Australian Gold Products.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very thick lotion, is probably why it&#x27;s clogging my pores.</li>
            <li> When the lotion arrived it was very thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> it smells even worse.</li>
            <li> After you put it on it feels like you&#x27;re wearing a thin coat of cake frosting.</li>
            <li> I even have my husband addicted to it.</li>
            <li> THIN AND RUNNY.</li>
            <li> Not a great smell to it either.</li>
            <li> and I always thought after-tan lotion was unnecessary.</li>
            <li> Annoying but definitely not detrimental.</li>
            <li> &quot; before so this feels like  an unnecessary waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just a little disappointed it didn&#x27;t come sealed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming it was refilled with some fake lotion.</li>
            <li> Last, the smell is awful!!!</li>
            <li> FAKE bottle came with AG logo (not Koala logo in picture).  </li>
            <li> OBSESSED.</li>
            <li> I have been unable to use this product because the pump has never worked.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong...</li>
            <li> *BUYER WARNING: the product you receive is a FAKE.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy products at the salon they are so expensive.</li>
            <li> ill stick with body kisses instead.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion because I was bored with the lotion I had been using.</li>
            <li> My husband has terrible dry feet</li>
            <li> I took my chances hoping that the bad reviews were wrong.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Forever After!</li>
            <li> When you buy it in a Tanning Salon it is very expensive.</li>
            <li> Very frustrating!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s bad..</li>
            <li> If I knew it was that bad, I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so bad</li>
            <li> the smell will not come off which is making me so sick.</li>
            <li> smell hurts my eyes and made me sick to my stomach.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never get sick of it.</li>
            <li> Completely disappointed</li>
            <li> I hate that feeling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a crap shoot buying these online - wish</li>
            <li> but I hate the smell</li>
            <li> I base a lot of my Amazon.com purchases based on others&#x27; ratings</li>
            <li> Grr!</li>
            <li> My husband is probably sick of me saying &amp;#34;Hey!</li>
            <li> I AM SICK TO MY STOMACH!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m VERY disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very disappointed it doesn&#x27;t even work.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;m very disappointed in this AG because of the horrible scent/smell.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> It was a horrible smell.</li>
            <li> They sell them for $40.00 in the tanning salon which is awful.</li>
            <li> I found this product when I used to go to the tanning beds (worst decision for your health; please do not do it!!!!).</li>
            <li> Blech!</li>
            <li> but it smells awful</li>

            <li> The vanilla scent is heavy and overpowering, and doesn&#x27;t go away.  My clothes stink from this strong vanilla scent, and the odor irritates my sinuses.  The lotion is very heavy as well, and is harder to apply than other brands I have tried.  The lotion doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly.  The only positive note is that I feel the lotion prolongs your tan, but it&#x27;s not worth the strong odor.  I couldn&#x27;t believe all the positive reviews I&#x27;ve read for this product.  There&#x27;s other brands that work just as good with a lighter scent that doesn&#x27;t overpower the senses.</li>
            <li> Awesome after tanning lotion. Smells great. Goes on smooth leaving skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I was sent a knock off lotion from Green Web Inc. The logo on the top says AG Australian Gold, not the logo with a koala bear. It wasn&#x27;t packaged well either. The pump wasn&#x27;t screwed on all the way and the pump was already turned to open so lotion was leaking all over. Since the pump is messed up I&#x27;m assuming it was refilled with some fake lotion. I&#x27;m VERY disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Thick &amp; luxurious.  Love the way it smells too. A nice hint of vanilla.  I don&#x27;t need to wear perfume when I put this on after my showers!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I tan on a regular basis, and it is a good moisturizer with a light refreshing fragrance.</li>
            <li> Loved the scent, did not leave a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> The best after tanning lotion there is. My husband has very very dry and sensitive skin and this is the only lotion that works.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for years, and nothing else compares.  With any other lotion, I get rough itchy patches on my arms.  Forever After keeps my skin very smooth!</li>
            <li> it is exactly what you get at the salon. Can not bet the price. recommend doing! and will do it again</li>
            <li> Not great, not horrible. I really liked the smell, huge amount of lotion so the quality was good, but doesn&#x27;t feel super hydrating.</li>
            <li> package arrived with the pump broken off 😑😑😑 but the lotion is fabulous.</li>
            <li> I love the vanilla bean smell, and is not too strong. I love putting it on after my showers and at night, and the smell stays with you! The moisture from this lotion is amazing and my skin is very soft and supple!</li>
            <li> I give this product 5 starts because it really deserves it... i love this lotion...it leaves my body really soft... i will definitely buy this product again. i recommend it 100%</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I love the fell of it, the smell, the price,,everything about it is great!  If you are an occasional tanner or an avid tanner this is a must have! It keeps your skin moisturized to get a better tan and keep it longer, since moisturized skin is a must when tanning. It&#x27;s even wonderful after regular sun exposure or an all year long skin lotion! I would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> this is the most wonderful lotion  smells great and leaves your skin so most bot not sticky  it is truly one of the best lotion s on the market today.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the price, large bottle size, and the rave reviews. I can&#x27;t stand this stuff!!! The seller was great, the bottle size is wondeful, the lotion goes on smoothly....but it doesn&#x27;t moisturize any more than a standard generic lotion you could buy at a Walmart. GoldBond or Jergens is better. And I have very normal skin, not super dry, tan about 3 times a week, and I exfoliate. Last, the smell is awful!!! It was so bad it actually gave me a HEADACHE. I felt sick after I used it, way strong, kind of like a strong overpowering perfume, small notes of vanilla, but the best way I can describe the scent is a very STRONG mixture of CARMEX CHAPSTICK mixed with a cheap COCOA BUTTER lotion.......it&#x27;s bad.. Synergy&#x27;s moisturizer is amazing, thick and creamy and the scent is good. Will not continue to use this and will not buy again...if you are sucked in by the reviews and packaging as I was..I suggest you try to get a sample packet of this first!!</li>
            <li> one of the best creams around.  use it everywhere.</li>
            <li> This is a good lotion. Nongreasy, GREAT vanilla smell, very moisturizing, and I don&#x27;t lose any tan if I don&#x27;t go for several days as long as I&#x27;m using this. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is I seem to use more of this to get equal moisturization from sone other lotions I use. But it really does help you keep your tan!</li>
            <li> This lotion goes on smoothly &amp; really quenches the skin. For me, the smell has taken some getting use too and if I apply to liberally it&#x27;s sweet sent can make my stomach queasy. However, it rubs in so well &amp; moisturizes so well that I can live with it. May try a different sent next time, though. Was received as ordered &amp; on time!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite lotions! And it smells good!</li>
            <li> I first purchased this lotion at a tanning salon, it was a tiny bottle. Loved it so much I ordered it here. The lotion smells great, cools my skin after a tanning session, leaves my skin looking flawless! I mean I LOVE IT! The second time I ordered it, the top was broken, I complained and they sent me a new one right away. They were very helpful! This is my fourth time ordering the lotion from them. and you cant beat that price!!!</li>
            <li> love it this smells good you well like it</li>
            <li> Orderd from Solarium.  FAKE bottle came with AG logo (not Koala logo in picture).  AVOID!!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and makes my legs feel great!</li>
            <li> I used to be able to purchase this in my city but found that the supplier had stopped stocking their shelves with it.  I love it so much that I searched the internet and was thrilled to find it through Amazon.  It&#x27;s a great moisturizing lotion that I apply every day and absolutely love the fragrance!  Thank you Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> This has to be the best lotion I have ever used and it smells so good..it makes my skin so silky soft and the fragrance last all day and night.Not just for tanners.</li>
            <li> Smells so sweet.  I can&#x27;t really explain it.  It&#x27;s the strangest girliest scent I&#x27;ve ever experienced in a lotion, and I had gotten compliments in the past.  I don&#x27;t tan, so I can&#x27;t vouch to how it works on prolonging them.  As a super pale person, it keeps my skin moisturized and I can use it on my face as well.  It does contain caffeine, so be aware of that.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, ive been using hempz which smells great works great.. However I bought this to switch things up and OMG this smells AMAZING and to me this is WAYYY more hydrating!!! The hyrdation AND SCENT from this last from shower to shower them hempz scent I didnt notice after a few hours and u needed to apply it every 12 hours. This one lasts 24 hours I LOVE ITTTTTTTT</li>
            <li> As soon as I got this lotion in the mail, I opened it to smell it, and it smells amazing! It&#x27;s such a fresh, clean, airy, vanilla scent, and it is to die for! I haven&#x27;t used it after tanning yet, but I can say that it makes my skin feel so soft and smooth to the touch. I also noticed within 15 minutes of putting it on, I could literally feel the tightening agents tending to my skin. I did a lot of research on this lotion for weeks, and I finally bought it. IT&#x27;S WORTH EVERY PENNY! And it&#x27;s a huge bottle too! I know it says 22oz, but when I opened it up, it seems a lot bigger than 22oz. It will definitely last me a long time.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion for multiple reasons. It&#x27;s rich and moisturizing but easy to spread and the smell is wonderful. If used daily, there is a definite difference in the appearance of skin. When used with tanning the color lasts longer and glows. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> The Forever After moisturizer came two days before it was scheduled to, and it works wonders when prolonging my tan. It has a nice, powdery smell that is not overwhelming, and it absorbs rather quickly.</li>
            <li> great moisturizer!!! Great Smell not to much and feels good on skin! Not all do this does! Will get more!</li>
            <li> I am 63 years old and I have had dry skin all my life. I bought a bottle of the Austrilian Gold Forever After Moisturizer and after 2 weeks I could tell a big difference in not only my skin but also my neck area. My dry skin is now gone and I have smooth, non flaky skin. I also love the fragrance of this product. I believe that you will see quick results as I did after using this product. It is the only moisturizer I have used that has shown results this fast and resolved the dry skin problem.</li>
            <li> Great lotion to use after tanning. My family also just likes how it  helps with wrinkles. My son complemented me on the good smell&lt;br /&gt;of lotion</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tan extender lotion. It&#x27;s very creamy without the greasy feeling on your skin and keeps me hydrated all day. It also really does keep my tan longer. I love it and it helps that it smells amazing</li>
            <li> I like this lotion a lot.  It had a good scent and was pretty moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it isn&#x27;t oily like most other lotions! idk about the &amp;#34;All Day&amp;#34; part though...</li>
            <li> I love this lotion Used many times after Tanning. But now knowing how well it makes my skin velvety soft and not flaky I just can&#x27;t live with out it.  Nothing out there works for me since I went into menopause! Dry skin is a side effect.</li>
            <li> In love!! I don&#x27;t tan but omg this lotion leaves skin so smooth it&#x27;s unreal how amazing this stuff really is.. I highly recommend great for winter and improves trouble areas like knees and elbows.  It has a odorless smell is rich and creamy but like magic fast absorbent smith to touch leaving your body glowing and summer ready.</li>
            <li> Australian Gold Forever After leaves your skin feeling smooth and soft. I extremely enjoy how it extends your tan for a long time.</li>
            <li> the best thing about this lotion is the smell. kinda like vanilla. it is so soft and NOT GREASY! i use this as an every day lotion, makes my skin sooooooooo soft, i get compliments all the time. BUY THIS LOTION</li>
            <li> This lotion reeks especially after you just get done tanning it smells even worse. I will not continue to use this lotion. I bought the playboy daily mostiturizer instead, much better</li>
            <li> I usually purchase this from the salon, but thought I would try on amazon.com.  HUGE mistake; smells NOTHING like the product that I buy.  Smells cheap, tacky &amp; like it was something I concocted when I was 10 years old.  So greasy, I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash my hands, &amp; even that didn&#x27;t get rid of the smell.  Very disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> I take a couple swim classes, and so I use it after I finish swimming. I do not tan, but I love that it is not greasy at all! the sent is a little strong, but it fades really really quick.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t see anything special about this lotion, especially for the price.  it smells okay, kind of like the \\&quot;milk\\&quot; brand in they blue and white bottle the sell at regular stores.  however, other lotions at walmart or any convenient store work just as well and even better.  this stuff didn&#x27;t moisturize my skin for 24 hours and i wake up with dry skin every morning.</li>
            <li> Wonderful item, pleasant smell goes on nice and keeps your skin moisturized through the night and for hours during the day before any dryness starts to reoccur.</li>
            <li> This lotion rocks it really does i have all the tan extender lotions and this one is one of my top choices it is really thick and moisturizing and it sinks in and you think well its not working because i dont feel it, its not greasy but it is working it took my a day or two to figure that one out...its wonderful..another good one is hempnation pomaberry awesome scent and really good all day moisturizer these are my top 2 and then top 3rd is angel regular scent!!!!!  My top tanning lotions are Paridisio by designer skin (good best all around tanning lotion and i have all the desinger skins and more)and then hard to tan areas my swedish beauty Pink Diamond it will bring you out of that not tanning phase and really give your hard to tan areas a boost !!!!! (just thought i would throw those in maybe help someone i know its hard to pick out lotions and other peoples reviews help they do me)</li>
            <li> Love the smell and texture!</li>
            <li> Best lotion ever, tanning or no. There is no color to it - just a wonderfully light scent and all-day softness. It&#x27;s actually perfect for those long winter months when skin gets especially dry, cracked, and irritated.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and it is great for everyday use and does not overpower your perfume and will last all day.</li>
            <li> If you like lotions and use them many times during the day.... This is the lotion for you!  It keeps my tan moist and soft.  I can&#x27;t say enough how great this lotion is.  My husband has terrible dry feet and I attack him with this lotion and it soaks in quick.  Considering he don&#x27;t like his feet touched it helps that it soaks in fast.  Lol.  I use this lotion all year around!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product have ordered twice</li>
            <li> I highly recomend this lotion! Smells great &amp; works all day long! I&#x27;ll definitly be buying this product again. I&#x27;m new to the whole indoor tannning experience &amp; was searching for a aftercare ltion. Stumbled upon this &amp; decided to try it after reading all the positive reviews. Rest assured, look no further, just buy this one. It&#x27;s worth it! Promise  :)</li>
            <li> At first I loved this lotion but then I realized it was making the eczema on my hands flare up and it was also making my chest/shoulders/&amp; back break out in pimples/blackheads. It&#x27;s a very thick lotion, is probably why it&#x27;s clogging my pores. If you have very dry skin then it would probably work for you.</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive about buying this lotion, so I went to the tanning salon and bought one after I knew what it smelled like ($22). I LOVE the way it smells when it&#x27;s fresh out of the bottle, but I noticed that the scent changed a bit after I rubbed it into my skin. For the record, after I go tanning, I ALWAYS smell like \\&quot;cooked skin\\&quot; no matter WHAT tanning lotion I use! (Currently using Cypher 2011.) So when I applied this morning after tanning last night, this lotion&#x27;s scent changed from a sweet-but-not-too-sweet vanilla bean smell to a slightly burned smelling, bronzer-y, powdery vanilla. HOWEVER: I personally LIKE the way this lotion smells. Yes, it is slightly reminiscent of an \\&quot;older lady&#x27;s perfume\\&quot;, BUT I also think that it smells very classy, like a higher end perfume. I honestly don&#x27;t think that I would have thought this smelled anything like an old lady if I hadn&#x27;t read about the smell complaints on here before I bought it. I love this lotion! It smells classy and feels luxurious! My skin feels so hydrated now!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to make sure I wasn&#x27;t drying my skin out due to laying in the tanning bed. This stuff is amazing and made my skin feel smooth, hydrated, and healthy! I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer, very soothing after a tanning session, I would recommend to all!  I have bought this product quite a few times.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion! It smells wonderful and makes my skin feel soft and smooth all day. The smell lasts a really long time! I&#x27;m really impressed, and will definitely be ordering more when this (surprisingly large) bottle runs out!</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite moisturizing lotion !  I purchased it one time in the tanning salon, and they have never carried it after that.  It makes my skin smooth all day , and the smell is not too strong, to were it over comes perfume.  I use it every morning, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out.  I have a hard time finding good moisturizers for winter, and this one does the job !</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I have been using it for years.  I have sensitive skin and the barely there scent does not irritate at all.  It&#x27;s very moisturizing too and never greasy.</li>
            <li> Forever after is the best lotion ever. I love it.</li>
            <li> I have been in love with this lotion for many years! It has an amazing smell (slightly coconut but with an almost floral hint as well. Hard to describe but one of THE best smells ever! And not overpowering). Lotion absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy at all. I use this more in the winter and summer than the rest of the year&#x27; it&#x27;s great for moisturizing my skin in the dryer, winter months but is essential for use on skin if tanning. Excellent lotion! Will buy again and again!</li>
            <li> This cream is awesome! I started using it when I started tanning to help clear up my skin a few years ago but I loved the scent and how well it moisturized (without getting too greasy) so much that I started to use it every day after I showered. The smell is SO NICE and subtle. It&#x27;s like a tropical vanilla. I have eczema and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. (Actually, it soothes it.)</li>
            <li> Best stuff for the price.&lt;br /&gt; Smells good too</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! It sells for a lot more at the local tanning salon. They are always trying to get me to purchase items from them, but Amazon always has much better prices. This lotion smells fantastic and reminds me of summer fun and tans! My mother, who is close to retirement age, bought some for herself after she smelled mine. Anyone can use this lotion. It keeps my skin soft all day long, and I can&#x27;t stress enough how much I love the smell! Don&#x27;t be afraid to try this lotion if you haven&#x27;t&#x27; smelled it first. There is no way you couldn&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> I love Australian Gold products and was excited to buy Forever After All Day Moisturizer at a good price. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m very disappointed in this AG because of the horrible scent/smell. I thought I was buying the summer-like scent I&#x27;ve come to expect from Australian Gold, but this is ... phewwww!    To be fair, the silky moisturizing factor is great ~ my skin felt wonderful and soft for hours after I applied. However, the scent (difficult to described, but it reminds me of something my grandmother used in her 80&#x27;s) is much too overpowering and much too strong. I grudgingly gave 2 stars (simply for the moisturizing factor).    I purchased 2 bottles and might end up giving them to the nice little old lady that lives on my street. Hopefully, the smell won&#x27;t be too strong for her senses.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion before and fell in love with it. It&#x27;s not only a great aftersun lotion, it&#x27;s a great everyday lotion. It&#x27;s not greasy or oily. The best part is that I LOVE the smell. I recommend this lotion!</li>
            <li> Smell good.  A little sticky after I apply.  I have to wait a little bit to get dress but I still like the lotion.  Seems to help me keep my tan longer.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell or the way my skin feels after.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells AMAZING...the scent isn&#x27;t too strong or overbearing.  Smells a little weird after you first apply it, but that only lasts a few minutes. This really is an all day moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I love this body lotion.  Not only does it moisturize with out leaving me feeling greasy it really does help retain my Suntan and helps with the overall skin appearance even on the face with fine lines. I would recommend this to anyone.  When you buy it in a Tanning Salon it is very expensive.</li>
            <li> This is NOT the real lotion. I took my chances hoping that the bad reviews were wrong. But I have the real lotion which I get from the tanning store and compared them side-by-side. This lotion smells like chemicals and does not leave your skin moisturized at all. Do NOT waste your money. Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought 3 bottles now. Works like it says, helps you stay tan if you use it after right after you tan. Keeps me silky soft and smells like awesomeness. Can&#x27;t explain it. But I rebuy and use it when I don&#x27;t tan, also. My last bottle lasted me 2 months?maybe 1and 1/2.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer to apply at night before bed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super picky when it comes to how my lotions smell, but this product smells WONDERFUL. It applies easily and leaves my skin super smooth. I have yet to try it after tanning! It&#x27;s a bit costly, but worth it!</li>
            <li> I put this lotion on after tanning and after my morning shower.  I can still smell the scent of this lotion at the end of the day. I&#x27;ve only used it twice, but my skin feels SO moisturized, soft, and firm all day. My only problem with this lotion is that it takes awhile to rub in.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, I had received this as a gift a long time ago.  I found this on Amazon and it is perfect.</li>
            <li> the only lotion I use now!! it works so well!</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion in the whole world (or of the ~100 that I have tried). It smells absolutely amazing, without being overpowering. It soaks into your skin very nicely and quickly. It doesn&#x27;t make your skin oily, which is a big plus for everybody. AND, it makes your skin silky smooth. I highly reccomend this for everyday when you get out of the shower. All of my friends that have ever used it or borrowed some lotion have immediately gotten on Amazon and bought themselves a bottle because of how wonderful it is.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this lotion I was so impressed I threw out every other bottle of lotion I had. It makes my skin so soft instantly and smells so good. It helps keep my skin moisturized for days even after my showers. I have noticed an improvement in my tan too. It helps my skin tan better because it has more moisture and keeps the tan I have even if I don&#x27;t go to the tanning bed for a week. I would definitely recommend this to anyone whether they tan or not!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! Can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> It was delivered on time and it is a great product.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, there is no irritation at all .</li>
            <li> This lotion is absolutely fantastic!  It has such a light sweet fragrance and it keeps my skin smooth for hours if not days.  I definately recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was in search of a tan extender lotion and came across this one. I looked at some other reviews after I ordered it and some people really didn&#x27;t like the smell so I was a little skeptical, but I am SOOO in love with the smell!! I can&#x27;t get enough of it. It smells like warm vanilla bean. I really like the ingredients and the hemp seed. It leaves my skin feeling silky smooth and moisturized, not greasy.</li>
            <li> This lotion is very moisturizing but the smell of it is very strong and reminds me of an older woman&#x27;s perfume. The lotion works well but due to the scent I do not plan to purchase this lotion again.</li>
            <li> Great lotion. Arrived on time and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my wife to use after she tans. She loves the way it smells like vanilla beans and loves the silky texture. She puts it on and can still smell it hours later. She has tried other lotions and never found anything to please her until now.It is a must have.</li>
            <li> I bought this at my tanning salon last week and of course found it to be less expensive on Amazon.  It is a great deal for how big the bottle is!  The smell is okay, not my favorite but not as terrible as some say.  It is kind of thick to rub on but it leaves your skin smooth and soft!  It seems to keep your color longer but I did start to fade only after a few days of not tanning.</li>
            <li> i bought this based on others good reviews. It wasn&#x27;t bad, but it definitely wasn&#x27;t as good as i was expecting based on what people said. The smell was pretty bland not great but not horrible. I have extremely dry skin so just using this wasn&#x27;t enough to keep my skin healthy i also put coconut oil all over my body every time i got out of the shower. It was a little sticky and took a bit to sink into my skin. Also the pump on my bottle broke really fast. But over all it did the job but i don&#x27;t think i will be buying it again because of the smell.</li>
            <li> Bottle is a pretty biG size, love how it makes my skin baby soft and love the smell! Very happy to have purchased it..  Best lotion I&#x27;ve bought ever! :)</li>
            <li> Love how silky velvety smooth this lotion makes my skin feel. Only used it twice now but I can tell a difference already in my tan from both indoor and outdoor use. My skin doesn&#x27;t look dry and cracked. This has a great scent too, smells like vanilla! I definitely recommend for people with normal to dry skin (living in CO, my definition of normal to dry might differ).</li>
            <li> I used this lotion everyday when I was in the Caribbean for vacation and I am still using it.  I tanned beautifully and did not peal - my skin was not dry or flaky.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love it! I smell so good I could devour myself. My skin looks and feels healthy.  Do it!</li>
            <li> AMAZING!  Soft sweet scent, thick cream and leaves your skin super soft.  I like it so much I bought more and shipped it to friends and family!  Will buy again and again!</li>
            <li> I do not usually write any comments, bu this is fantastic stuff. It smells great, has a bit of a shimmer and is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Received this as a gift from daughter at Christmas and I loved it so much I wanted to purchase more.  So glad I was able to find it.</li>
            <li> Very creamy and soothing to the skin..Happy face:)))</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Smells clean and makes skin super soft. Ingredients are great for you. I love this product!</li>
            <li> I never write reviews for anything but this lotion is amazing! I tan everyday and use it immediately after and after showers. The scent is great not too strong! Was at a party when this guy hugged me and kept commenting on how good i smelt due to this lotion, definitely the best purchase Ive made!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer for all year round. It keeps my skin smooth and moisturized in the winter and smooth and shiny during the summer to keep my legs looking good! My 73 year old mother uses it every day to keep her skin moist and she loves it! She would use this over any &amp;#34;age preventing&amp;#34; moisturizer.</li>
            <li> A little thick - have to rub it in a lot. Other than that it is great.</li>
            <li> hands down favorite after tanning lotion. This goes for $45 at a tanning salong (Palm Beach tan) so I&#x27;m so glad to find it at a wonderful price.</li>
            <li> This smells great and is nice and thick. I have super dry skin but this keeps my skin from feeling tight, or looking too dry. If I mix it with grape seed oil, it is perfect!</li>
            <li> I question whether or not the lotion I received is genuine. It arrived unsealed with a loose cap (unscrewed a bit) and the pump wasn&#x27;t locked to prevent accidental depression during shipping. All of that aside the lotion is very heavy and greasy. It left a sticky residue that only came off in the shower.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It smells so good and it doesn&#x27;t break me out like most of the moisturizers I&#x27;ve bought lately and it&#x27;s so much cheaper then what I&#x27;ve been paying. I can&#x27;t wait to get  my Ed Hardy tanning lotion i also ordered I know I&#x27;m going to be very happy with it also. Thank you for your products.</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion because it was cheap and the woman at the tanning salon freaked out when I told her I use bath and body work products after I tan. So I used it for the first time today and Id have to say I can already notice a difference. You know how dark you look right after you step out of the tanning bed? Well that same darker glow had been able to stick thanks to this lotion.</li>
            <li> This lotion really keeps your tan longer and keeps the darkness of your tan as well. Smells great and lasts a long time. Price is awesome and the amount you get is even better. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about this product at first, since I can basically buy the same thing off the shelf at the grocery store for about half the price. However, this is the best moisturizing lotion that I have ever used. I put it on at night and the next day my skin (even my knees and elbows!) still feel smooth and soft. I definitely recommend this lotion, especially if you are going to be tanning but even if you aren&#x27;t. The smell seemed a little strong at first, but after getting a few compliments on it I decided I liked it :] My hesitation was likely because I&#x27;m not typically a fan of the fruity smell, but if that&#x27;s something you enjoy you will probably love it!</li>
            <li> I ordered the product on Monday and it arrived at my door today (Wednesday). Couldn&#x27;t have asked for more abrupt shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Product came unsealed, but overall the product is as described. Questionable \\&quot;knock-off\\&quot; as the label on the product isn&#x27;t the most professionally done, seems cheap and imitated. I however have not used a \\&quot;legit\\&quot; forever after lotion before, so I can not be certain that this isn&#x27;t the \\&quot;real thing\\&quot;. I have seen the bottles before and they seemed better made and the \\&quot;legit\\&quot; product seemed a little thicker than the shipment I received today.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product was worth the low amount that i paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;Unsure if I would reorder this product.</li>
            <li> Oh wow! I have never used a tanning lotion as an extender, but I sure am glad I decided to! And I made the perfect choice of products. This has a sweet soft vanilla kind of scent.  It&#x27;s not too strong which I love. It&#x27;s thick and creamy and applies so nicely. This is a staple for any sun tanner! A must have!</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and gets skin SUPER SUPER smooth! However, I have been using this for months (even before this purchase) and I don&#x27;t believe helps extend the tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for this price and great shipping, I&#x27;d still recommend it! :)</li>
            <li> This is as addicting as it can get. The smell is phenomenal and this literally keeps you moisturized throughout the day. I recommend this to anyone who loves lotion but doesn&#x27;t want the greasy texture. This is by far one of my FAVORITE lotions. I will definitely be a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> Even though I have only been using this lotion for alittle less then a month, I can see the difference in my skin. Its so much softer, and I can already see that my tan is lasting and looking much better then the results I was getting from another lotion I was using. And I LOVE, LOVE the smell, I am always getting compliaments and people asking me what I have on. I will defenitly be buying more of this</li>
            <li> I am 63 and this lotion is better at smoothing and tightening my skin than any lotion I have tried.  I use it all over and especially my face.  I have gotten many complements on how great my skin looks and I tell them all about this product.  It is so rich, creamy and smooth and never leaves a sticky or shiny residue.  Just wonderful.</li>
            <li> Our sister-in-law had a bottle of this at our last canoe/kayak outing, my wife loved it, I even use it occasionally on my dry, peeling face, it really is amazing!</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than expected.  Will purchase again</li>
            <li> This lotion is great except it is very very heavy. After you put it on it feels like you&#x27;re wearing a thin coat of cake frosting.</li>
            <li> Great After Tan or anytime MOISTURIZER. Really love this product. Extends the length of your tan without &amp;#34;wearing the color on your clothing&amp;#34; Just make sure you let the MOISTURIZER dry after application. Great for all over the body as well!!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and I use this as my everyday lotion I love it</li>
            <li> love this product  use it after indoor tanning smells nice and keeps your skin soft would definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> I do not recommend buying anything from Staytan! I placed an order on Jan 11 and as of Jan 26 Staytan still has not even shipped my product or responded to the delay. I sent an email to find out my staus on Jan 22 and still no reply so I put in to cancel my order on Jan 26. Will never do business with this person. Not reliable!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! Goes on smooth and smells wonderful! I&#x27;ve been a dedicated tanner for 11 years and one of my biggest concerns has always been the toll tanning will take on my skin but with this lotion my skin is so soft and firm and my tan lasts so much longer than with most lotions I&#x27;ve tried. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I swear by this after tan lotion. It is also much cheaper on Amazon than it in in the tanning salons! It makes your skin feel soft and healthy!</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion ever. Moisturizes very dry skin  all day. Absorbs quickly with a non greasy feel. Light vanilla scent leaves skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love Forever After Moisturizer especially after tanning. I also continue using it in the winter time  so my skin stays soft and smooth, not dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer. Use it every day and always get complimented on my smell. Packaging and delivery was excellent!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick lotion and will definitely only need to be applied once. The smell is fine even for guys. Not bad. The lotion should last you a long time.</li>
            <li> My wife loved the lotion and is very happy with it</li>
            <li> This lotion feels dry on the skin after multiple applications. It may be expired, but I can&#x27;t find  an expiration date on the bottle. I brought this  bottle of lotion to the local tanning salon and ask them why it feels so  dry on my skin. They suggested that it may be expired, because of its dry consistency. I  used it as a hand cream, but my hands are still dry after multiple applications. May be it will ok to use in summer time as a  extremely light moisturizer when it&#x27;s super hot outside.What a junk! I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> i love this product! the best u can get! I use for my face as a moisturizer before putting on makeup! its a wonderful lotion!</li>
            <li> This is the most fantastic lotion I have ever had. Every lotion I have ever bought had harsh alcohol in it that dried out my skin even more. I went on a quest for legit lotion and I wish I could buy a life time supply of this stuff. My skin has never been this soft in my life. My husband is probably sick of me saying &amp;#34;Hey! Feel my arm! Is it not crazy smooth?! I&#x27;m so soft!&amp;#34; Not thIck or oily and NO  tacky feeling. It feels like silk. OBSESSED.</li>
            <li> I must admit I was a bit skeptical about the benefits of this lotion, but as I am now on my second day of using it, I love it! I tan indoors about 3-4 days a week and am always looking for a better lotion. I love the warm, musk vanilla scent of this lotion and that it absorbs quickly. My skin is firm and very dewy looking even a couple hours after application. Out of every lotion I have ever tried, this is my favorite! I have spent alot of money on quality department store lotions to the basics from walgreens. It&#x27;s definitely worth every penny. I will be buying another bottle to get me through the hot Florida summers!</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing and much cheaper on amazon than it is at the tanning salon. It smells great and will keep your skin moisturizer for a long period of time. It&#x27;s great for if you tan and don&#x27;t want to peel :)</li>
            <li> Smells great, moisturizes great! A little goes a long way so you get more bang for your buck. Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I first was introduced to this lotion at a tanning salon when it came free with another purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I was so impressed with it but not with the $75 price tag. I found it on Amazon and purchase it regularly!&lt;br /&gt;It is not greasy but very long lasting with a pleasant scent that is not over empowering at all.&lt;br /&gt;I have SUPER sensitive skin and am prone to break outs. I sometimes use this product on my face and it has not caused any breakouts.</li>
            <li> Great  feels good on your skin, also smells good.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality lotion. It makes my skin feel great and my tan looks awesome. My only complaint is that it smells a bit masculine to me. It is supposed to be a vanilla scent but I can&#x27;t help but think I smell manly when I put it on.</li>
            <li> I have never wrote a review before but I had to for this. I am in love with this lotion. It smells so good and goes on good. With tanning my skin dries bad and I have used a lot of lotions and haven&#x27;t found a good one till now. I will forever buy this lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! Keeps my skin so soft and smells so good. Ever since I started moisturizing with this lotion, I&#x27;ve been getting way more color from tanning! Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> The product is okay from a moisturization standpoint. My gripe is that this isn&#x27;t Australian Gold with the koala, it&#x27;s a knock-off. The initial smell is like a vanilla-sugar scent, but then it changes slightly as it dries. It&#x27;s a huge bottle and it moisturizes okay, I just feel duped by not getting an actual Australian Gold product.</li>
            <li> i am pleased with my purchase.. it smells very good and it is thick and does the job for dry skin</li>
            <li> First off, can we just talk about how much product you get for your money? That right there makes this amazing! The smell is fantastic, my husband loves it, and it does a great job of moisturizing my skin. One of my biggest pet peeves about lotions is when they leave a greasy feeling on your skin afterwards. I don&#x27;t have to worry about that with Forever After. It absorbs quickly and leaves your skin feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li> This product is great and affordable!! I would recommend this product to any one. It smells great and adds that moister your body truly craves. I use it on my entire body. :)</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT FOR ME BC I TAN ALOT AND THE FOREVER AFTER GIVES A GREAT FEELING SKIN.. SUPER SMOOTH</li>
            <li> I absoolutely luv this moisturizer. Is is so rich and creamy and not greasy. I also like the fragrance, it is not heavy or perfumy.I got alot for the money, I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> When I read reviews on how amazing this lotion smelled, I gave it a try.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  It does have a nice smell but it really doesn&#x27;t moisturize that well.  I have better results with a generic cocoa butter lotion at Target.  Also, I noticed that my knees actually looked drier while using this product.  I actually had to use a second moisturizer to counter what this product did!</li>
            <li> Love this moisurizer!!  It lasts \\&quot;forever\\&quot; and smells so good!!!  I will re-order again and again.  I receive lots of compliments on the smell (vanilla).</li>
            <li> This lotion is by far my favorite. Great smell and does extend the life of your tan.  I typically order 2 or 3 bottles at a time because I use it so often. It is very hydrating and leaves your skin feeling silky and soft.</li>
            <li> It has a great smell and goes on very thick!!</li>
            <li> this is my 3rd bottle, and they each last like 4-6 months of daily use.&lt;br /&gt;great thick moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;for those who complain about the smell - give it half an hour, it evaporates really fast.&lt;br /&gt;great moisturizer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using other lotions after using this one, but always come back to this lotion.  It&#x27;s simply the best.</li>
            <li> Luv. 2nd one I have ordered. Smells so good like vanilla. Great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I got this lotion because I started tanning and I need to keep my skin moisturized. The least I can say is that this lotion smells like heaven in a bottle. I use this once after I shower and once after I finish tanning and it leaves my skin hydrated. Also, the bottle is HUGE and a little bit goes a long way. I&#x27;ll have this for a while, but I will definitely be repurchasing in the future. :)</li>
            <li> This is one of the best moisture I have ever used. Smells great Works great really has alot of ingredients that are good for your skin .makes your skin very moist and youthful lookings and helps you keep your tan longer</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer! Went on easy and smooth! It had a great smell to it and the price was a good buy.</li>
            <li> Absolutely perfect! My husband loves the smell of this stuff too 💗</li>
            <li> This lotion is wonderful! It&#x27;s very soft and silky and smells delicious.  I even have my husband addicted to it. Lol. Will definitely continue to use.</li>
            <li> It was diluted with something else not actual product</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer I have ever used. The bottle is huge so you&#x27;re definitely getting your money&#x27;s worth. The scent is very light. It only takes a little, maybe 3 pumps to moisturize my legs. GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! Smells good and keeps my skin soft and hydrated all day. I&#x27;ve never found another lotion that works this good. I love to use it in the summer time. I also noticed it helps heal mild sunburns quickly, I&#x27;d say as good as aloe!</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product to me and I&#x27;m very glad she did! It helps keep your tan but it&#x27;s also an excellent moisturizer. My skin has firmed up a little bit and my tan seems darker when I use this lotion. I didn&#x27;t give it five stars because I wasn&#x27;t too fond of the smell. However, I completely recommend this product. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I love it! I use it after tanning with Millenium Tanning Solid Black Bronzer 100X and Australian Gold Body Kisses Daily Moisturizer. The 3 work perfect together!</li>
            <li> It works great for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of a fan of the smell and it&#x27;s not as hydrating as some other after tan moisturizers I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;m also not a fan of the streaky thick white formulation. But it&#x27;s a good value for the money you pay and it has hemp in it which is very good for your skin.</li>
            <li> I have been unable to use this product because the pump has never worked. I thought I contacted the seller and never heard back. All I was looking for was a replacement pump.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion. I have used it for more than 10 years. Love the cover and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I put it on in the morning and at night.  I used to use a tanning bed twice a week and this helps keep your skin moisturized. I don&#x27;t do that anymore, but still use this lotion, twice a day.  At my age maybe it will help with the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Everytime I use this I am still amazed that after 15 yrs I haven&#x27;t found a better after tan lotion. When I am tanning a lot or on the beach a lot my skin gets so dry and itchy. I use this after I tan or after a shower or before bed and my skin stays soft smooth and my tan starts to glow again</li>
            <li> Hands down, this lotion is AMAZING. it feels like silk on my skin and smells delicious. I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! It smells so nice. Its not overpowering at all and reminds me of the beach. It&#x27;s easy to apply and absorbs quickly. I cant testify if it really makes my tan last longer but I can say my skin feels and smells wonderful so thats good enough for me!</li>
            <li> Not sure why, but it really dried out fast.  The pump got clogged and I had to dump it out of the bottle, but then it started getting dry so I tossed it.</li>
            <li> Best all day moisturizer I have yet!</li>
            <li> This product is great for a working man&#x27;s hands and arms.I love this product and have told all friends to use it.Also great for sunburns lady&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I bought this at a salon for only 17 bucks so really i got a better deal due to your shipping price but it really is a great moisturizer..they only thing i can do without is the vanilla smell..</li>
            <li> Love how this lotion feels and love the smell (reminds me of bath&amp; body works warm vanilla sugar.) My shoulders were burnt &amp; this lotion is very soothing they don&#x27;t hurt anymore. The only thing is the pump doesn&#x27;t work so that&#x27;s a real bummer</li>
            <li> this stuff smells so good and leaves my skin silky. huge bottle!! alot of bang for your buck here! Australian Gold rocks!!</li>
            <li> This feels great going on, and doesn&#x27;t have an obnoxious fruity/candy smell. It&#x27;s done a great job keeping my skin hydrated since I started tanning.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell of this lotion at all. Will not buy this ever again. It was a horrible smell.</li>
            <li> This was wonderful.  I would purchase this again in the future.</li>
            <li> This is the first lotion I have used I was impressed with.  It goes on smooth, absorbs quickly and leaves me feeling moisturized and my skin tightened.  Love the light vanilla scent and the price.  I will continue to use it daily and considering trying it on my face.  I am 50 years old and my skin feels like it did when I was 25!</li>
            <li> I like it.  It smells decent.  Moisturizes well.  And makes me feel fresh.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind smelling like baby powder, this is the lotion for you.  It&#x27;s a great moisturizer, but I am not fond of the smell, I prefer something more grown-up.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion from the seller &amp;#34;Green Web Inc&amp;#34; and they sent me a knock off of the original lotion. I noticed it right away when I saw that the Australian Gold label at the top of the bottle was replaced with just an &amp;#34;AG&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;From the other reviews maybe other sellers are actually giving you the real lotion but the one I got was not real so I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> But I think its a little watered down personally. I have definitely had better moisturizers for sure...its alright light vanilla scent that doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> When I use this after a shower I don&#x27;t need to wear perfume. I get so many complements about the smell of this lotion. Men and women both ask what do I have on that it smells really good.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer works great...but I am not crazy about the smell. The product goes on great and soaks into the skin and is not greasy or too thick. It is a great, great way to keep your skin hydrated all day. As for the fragrance it reminds me of a Vistoria Secret-esque vanilla lotion or french vanilla candle. The fragrance is not strong, but it is potent and lasts all day. I am a guy and I don&#x27;t want to smell like my Moms Amber Vanilla Lotion from Bath and Body. I found this brand by buying the other Australian Gold product that is fruity smelling. That also works great for skin moisture. I wanted to switch to something that has less smell and the reviews lead me to believe that. I do not agree. I wear cologne and this overpowers anything I would put on. I gave it four stars because the smell was too much for me. 5 Star moisturizer though. It may work for you if you are A.) A guy who wants to smell like a candle or B.) A woman who likes an amber french vanilla type smelling lotion that agrees with your perfume.</li>
            <li> I have used like 8 bottles of this great stuff. I like it so much I gave it out as Christmas gift last year. my husband and I use it after tanning. that tells you its not a girly smell. it also goes on creamy not like cheap stuff like water.</li>
            <li> Ok this stuff clearly isn&#x27;t actually forever after by Australian gold bc I&#x27;ve smelled the real on before and it smells wonderful and this stuff has an odd smell is don&#x27;t really care for the smell but it is a good lotion not greasy soaks in quick but if your looking for good smell to I wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> This item was out of date. It expired in 2014.</li>
            <li> I use this as regular lotion too.. love it,  totally not greasy and it smells great! and it&#x27;s a giant bottle!</li>
            <li> I just started using this since the last brand that I bought was discontinued.  I love it - it has a pleasant smell but not overbearing and my skin stays soft and moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> Lotion is ok... Smell is good, but the lotion, I feel, is quite thick. I personally would rather have a more spreadable lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It leaves your skin glowing, it smells good and it leaves your skin soft.  I will order it again.</li>
            <li> This product I was introduced to by a friend after leaving my lotion at home.  The product has an awesome clean and refreshing scent that is not overbearing.  The product feels smooth coming out of the bottle, upon applying to the skin, and after its applied you skin feels silky smooth. I love it, it&#x27;s extremely rare to find in retail stores are normally located in tanning salons however that&#x27;s becoming rare as a result of low quantity and high demand.</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for after tan exposure, for years. I love it</li>
            <li> This lotion is NOT FOR A BODY WITH SPRAY TAN ON&amp;#62; IT TAKES OFF YOUR SPRAY TAN. Don&#x27;t use it if yu have a fake tan it will leave your skin crackling and dry.</li>
            <li> When I was tanning my skin was getting dried out and it was burnt and it was very itchy. I seen this and had to try it. I was going to give up tanning until I started using this. The itching and burning were gone. It is very creamy and spreads well. It lasts all day and has a very pleasant scent. Not too strong of a scent but a subtle one to last all day. Use it right after you tan and it will also make your tan last longer and be more beautiful.</li>
            <li> I have been using this almost every day for two years now.  It&#x27;s non greasy, very moisturizing and leaves a slight sweet smell on your skin all day.  I get compliments all the time about how nice I smell and all I have on is this lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! It arrived days before it was suppose to, which is always a big plus. The only reasons that I didn&#x27;t give it five stars, is because the pump doesn&#x27;t work on it. The pump was one of the major selling points for me and I&#x27;m very disappointed it doesn&#x27;t even work. My husband also ordered some for himself, and surprise surprise, the pump doesn&#x27;t work on that one either! In the future i will be buying this lotion again, but from a different seller.</li>
            <li> Smells great as well as makes skin feel soft!</li>
            <li> My wife loves what it does for her skin, I love the sent</li>
            <li> This lotion is exquisite in many ways! The only reason for 4 star rating is that scent was a little heavy for my personal taste. Bottle is huge!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS LOTION. I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR OVER A YEAR. IT SMELLS GREAT AND ISN&#x27;T THIN AND RUNNY. MOISTURE LASTS ALL DAY!!</li>
            <li> I used to use this lotion years ago. My salon quit carrying it. I was so upset. i have been searching for it sense. It is the only lotion I can find to use on my sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t make me break out into a rash. I will be buying more as needed!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product. The price is reasonable for the size and actually amount of Lotion within the container. It leaves your skin feeling soft, smooth, and smelling sweet like vanilla but not over powering.</li>
            <li> When the lotion arrived it was very thick and creamy. Which was not what I was expecting. However it does smell good.</li>
            <li> SMELLS AMAZING! I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to notice a change in my skin (long term) however the smell is just so amazing I can smell it long after I apply it. Also, it keeps my skin feeling moisturized all day. I applied it to a sunburn the moment I received it in the mail and it made my pretty bad burn feel instantly better! Can&#x27;t wait to see the long term outcome!</li>
            <li> Love it creamy &amp; smells AWESOME</li>
            <li> love this stuff and the smell also</li>
            <li> I love this product. Can not do without it.</li>
            <li> Works great as a daily moisturizer for all over your body.  Found it to be better than a lot of over the counter products.</li>
            <li> I used to work at Planet Beach and I used to use this stuff after everytime I tanned or got out of a shower. Just got the lotion today and used a little of it and I do not remember it being so greasy! I had to wipe my hands on a towel to just get the slickness off. Also the smell is not the same as I remember, it smells good just very dull, almost like it&#x27;s unscented, when normally it has a good lingering vanilla smell... As I type this I can see the oil on my phone from my fingers, mixed feelings about this lotion. Don&#x27;t think I will repurchase unless from Australian Gold&lt;br /&gt;Itself or a local tanning salon. Not happy :-/</li>
            <li> Fast delivery! Very happy with product!!</li>
            <li> Excellent delivery service and products!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I do love the scent, but I if you are wanting/needing a good long lasting moisturizer, I am not sure this is the one for you, unless you want to reapply several times a day.  I personally don&#x27;t think it does anything to extend your existing tan any more than any other lotion would do, the key to extending a tan is to stay moisturized period &amp; tan regularly so it don&#x27;t fade.  But I like it for the scent mainly &amp; have ordered it 2 or 3 times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for 6 years now! I won&#x27;t ever stop buying it! Makes skin look soooooo gorgeous! Put it on morning and night, even at work, your legs and arms will look super sexy &amp; the skin firming action is awesome. I&#x27;m an indoor/outdoor tanner, which it&#x27;s ideal for. I PROMISE you can&#x27;t go wrong and will want to buy a whole case for yourself! I have people ask me what I use all of the time and the scent is wonderful too!</li>
            <li> Been using for 10+ yrs love it</li>
            <li> I love this lotion becasue the smell lasts longer than any other lotion that I have been used. It also gives me a thcker texture which I like the most. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Not good. Way to sticky, doesn&#x27;t absorb and like rubbing really cheap stuff on you with no staying power. It doesn&#x27;t moisturize. Sorry I usually love their product but simply put this suxs</li>
            <li> Smells great.. I can tell that my tan lasts longer when using this lotion. I would definitely recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> Loved how it extended my tan and the vanilla smell was nice. Great value for the price. I would use it again</li>
            <li> best moistureiser I ve ever used</li>
            <li> I love this product . I have bad skin and for some reason this is the only one that I am able to use !!</li>
            <li> Love this! Smells great, nice large bottle! Arrived quickly, and packaged great! Thank you.</li>
            <li> Used to Kisses body lotion by Australian gold.  It is so much better.  Thought I&#x27;d try this because for some reason KISSES is not available here only for $99 from another country???  Got me but I am not paying that much.  *I don&#x27;t care for this product.  Its greasy and does not help  your tan like Kisses.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money-really!!</li>
            <li> Lasts a really long time and moisturizes great!</li>
            <li> This lotion is so moisturizing for my extremely dry skin.  I either tan in the tanning beds or out by the pool and I cover myself in this lotion after I tan.  Love it!  And it smells so fresh and clean.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing scent!! Last a long time on your skin. It is a little thicker so you don&#x27;t have to use as much and this bottle is big! Great price for a great product!</li>
            <li> Great product indeed.  Keeps your skin moisturized indeed.  I would strongly urge eveyone to purchase it - for the cost - you get a ton of moisturizer!!!!</li>
            <li> I keep coming back and ordering this lotion, I love the way it feels on your skin and the smell is amazing!</li>
            <li> Smells great and keeps my skin hydrated for a little bit, but a few hours after application I have dry skin flakes again. It claims to be 24 hour protection and it&#x27;s not, maybe for someone who doesn&#x27;t have dryer skin.</li>
            <li> I gave this lotion to my daughter for Christmas! She had it in her&lt;br /&gt;Wish list and it was a nice size, great smelling, lasting and silky lotion!</li>
            <li> I like the product. Don&#x27;t know if it has the &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; effects that it claims, but I like the smell and seems to moisturize well. I just received this last week, and haven&#x27;t used it very much, but I am happy with it and it was packaged and delivered to my satisfaction</li>
            <li> I love this lotion would not use anything but this brand. I brought two of them. They sell them for $40.00 in the tanning salon which is awful. Arrived when expected.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even write reviews, but this product deserves one. It makes my skin feel SO smooth, and I usually have really dry, hard to retain moisture, skin. Would reccommed times a million. Will be buying this until I find a better one....which won&#x27;t be for some time. If you are on the fence about this lotion - DON&#x27;T BE. You will not be dissappointed.</li>
            <li> Love it  makes your skin feel so smooth and your tan will last longer using it ...... Last all day</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion for after I went tanning and I still use it. It lasts forever after! This lotion smells divine and works wonders for dry skin. I use it daily to help with the itchy dry skin of winter and get compliments on the smell often.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this moisturizer as I have used in the past couple of years.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion even better than Hemp - I use it everyday and also right after tanning. It keeps my skin moist without being greasy and it smells great.</li>
            <li> This is some of the best lotion out there. Especially after a shower.</li>
            <li> very good value, smells very nice, and an overall good tan extender and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good lotion.. Not packaged well. The top of the pump was shattered.</li>
            <li> This is not the same moisturizer as sold in salons. I have bought this several times in tanning salons. This one&#x27;s smell is different and the color is white not tan like salons. I will use it but it is definitely not what I have used and loved in the past.</li>
            <li> awesome stuff, use all year round</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all we use. Excellent lotion.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. Keeps skin smooth all day, great smell.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer ever. Fragrance is Awesome!!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this after reading the reviews and the price is great. I usually love AG products and this sounded just like what I was looking for. It arrived promptly and was a much bigger bottle than I thought which was great. I Used it after my shower the following day and it smells like mens classic Old Spice deoderant. Don&#x27;t get me wrong...I like classic Old Spice deoderant, in fact, my husband uses it. Also, it streaks white and doesn&#x27;t rub in real good. I got to work and still felt dry and smelled like a man. I tried it again this morning and as i type this review I&#x27;m sitting here smelling like a man and not fealing moisturized. I think I will just leave this out in my pool box as a community lotion for everyone to use but it will not be my everyday lotion. EWW</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, it smells amazing and makes your skin glow. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my legs after shaving either!</li>
            <li> This moisturizes great.  However it is not paraben free and for me that&#x27;s important.  I would give it 5 stars if it were paraben free, but if that&#x27;s not your thing, then 5 stars it is.</li>
            <li> The delivery was quick...but the lotion in it isnt the real lotion. Ive previously purchased this lotion from a tanning salon and smelled great this doesn&#x27;t even smell like vanilla. The lotion I received was really liquidy and smelled like something i could get from lupiderm or something. Also the lotion was already coming out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> It smells great and i like Australian gold products the shipment was on time and i recommend anyone to try it.</li>
            <li> I got introduced to this lotion working at my first job (a tanning salon) when I was 16. I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for 4 years and have never bought anything else! Whether I&#x27;m tanning or not, this is by far the most intense moisturizing lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. And the scent is my absolute favorite, nothing smells better. Will keep repurchasing! The price doesn&#x27;t get better than amazon&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great. My skin has never been as smooth as it is after using this lotion.  Even after one use you will see the difference on your skin.  I use it after indoor tanning and it really helps moisturize and maintain the tan.  I would also recommend it for daily use, even for those who do not tan.  Smells great too!</li>
            <li> I found this product when I used to go to the tanning beds (worst decision for your health; please do not do it!!!!). But I got this lotion for free with my tanning lotion and fell in love with the smell. I have sensitive skin and I do not break out from this lotion, and I am seriously in love with the smell. Reminds me of that &amp;#34;back from the beach, sunscreen smell.&amp;#34; My skin loves it too. Overall I would recommend it for an everyday lotion!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, I purchased this lotion for myself months ago at a flea market event and when I found it on Amazon, at a much better price, I wanted to share, with my daughter and daughter-in-law as part of thier Christmas.</li>
            <li> i have used this for years. i use it after i tan and its great i will never use anything else</li>
            <li> I was a little worried that I might not like the smell based off of some of the reviews, however I personally LOVE IT!  It is not an overpowering scent at all. It&#x27;s a nice vanilla scent but not too artificial. Definitely one a man can use as well, describe in another review below.  My skin feels amazing after using this and being in Colorado where it&#x27;s extremely dry, it does the job better then any lotion I&#x27;ve tried before.  I&#x27;m also what you would call a lotion junkie. I have a weakness with scented lotions. I use them in place of perfumes since I have to apply it everyday. I&#x27;m not a big tanner, but taking a vacation so wanted to get some nice color before hand. So although I won&#x27;t be baking on the tan beds long, this lotion will now ALWAYS be my go to one.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Just as promised</li>
            <li> Seems like a good product. Using once in the morning and evening helped my skin seem more moisterized. I&#x27;m just a little disappointed it didn&#x27;t come sealed.  Then I would know it is the genuine product. Just ordered another one from a different company that came sealed.  Now I can compare.</li>
            <li> Best lotion I have ever used.  I have been a cocoa butter queen since middle school, but this stuff is gold. There&#x27;s a lot too so even though it&#x27;s a little bit pricier than drug stores, you get more.  It smells AMAZING.  My grandma is CHEAP, but used this once when I was at her house, and loved the smell and moisture so much that she requested it for Christmas.  I told her it was kinda pricy (to her any beauty stuff more than $3 with rebates is expensive).  She did&#x27;t care.  Its the best-- definitely recommend it whether you tan or not!!</li>
            <li> love this product.  lotion goes right into skin.  not greasy!</li>
            <li> I cant wait to order more this is the best&lt;br /&gt;lotion ever read the reveiws im getting&lt;br /&gt;3 more for each room&lt;br /&gt;great lotion fast shipping</li>
            <li> Smells awesome. Dependable- been around awhile and works. Not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Smells nice. Moisturizes well. I&#x27;ve been using it for years now.</li>
            <li> Great price! Fast shipment! Awesome!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, it smells wonderful and make my skin super soft!!!</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Nice, moisturizing feel.&lt;br /&gt;Feels especially good after sun bathing, as it gently soothes your skin after taking on the heat.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because it wasn&#x27;t quite what I expected as far as its moisturizing qualities, but I would highly recommend it for those who don&#x27;t necessarily have dry and problematic skin.</li>
            <li> Just tried this for the first time and having used Australian Gold tanning lotion before I really had no doubt the all day lotion wouldn&#x27;t disappoint me I was right, I love it !</li>
            <li> was a gift and they like the smell and the moisturizer</li>
            <li> **BUYER WARNING: the product you receive is a FAKE. Label is different as the the one pictured. Instead of a koala bear it&#x27;s just the letters &amp;#34;AG&amp;#34;. If you are going to be selling fraudulent items it should clearly be stated in the description. Selling a customer false advertisement is not only immoral, and a waste of my time but illegal.</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a good deal. I got a bottle of mystery lotion! It hardly has a scent and is super oily. Sort of like an almond oil lotion. This company is a fraud. I know because this is my second purchase from them. My lotion isnt thick and doesnt moisturize but a few minutes. What if I was allergic to whatever freakin lotion they put in my bottle?! This company should be shut down and give refunds!</li>
            <li> Very hydrating with anti-aging benefits ------you do not have to keep  reapplying throughout the day----great moisturizer.  I would highly recommend this even for an all around year lotion.  As always Amazon prices are way better than the salons!  Thank You</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t firm/tone. Not a great smell to it either. Kinda pasty.</li>
            <li> Soo nice, works in extending the life of my tanning lotion and smells great. Pump is kind of a pain but worth it!</li>
            <li> My fiance absolutely loves this stuff. It smells good and goes on very nice and smooth. She uses it as a daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. It&#x27;s the best! Perfect. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion. Makes your skin feel like silk and smells good too!!</li>
            <li> I love the way this stuff smells. I think it may be discontinued or will be discontinued soon.</li>
            <li> Love it!! I will by more. Australian Gold is one of a few companies in the tanning world that always puts out good products!!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion  big bottle great price to thank you</li>
            <li> Too thick for me but it did keep me moist most of the way.</li>
            <li> I wanted to find a large bottle of lotion that would last me and wasn&#x27;t expensive. Lotion smells great and I still have quite a bit left. I use this after every shower I take. I haven&#x27;t been dry skinned at all. Since I&#x27;m a guy I wanted something that didn&#x27;t smell too girl-ish. Over all this is a 5 for me. Super soft skin!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I like this moisturizer. It goes on smooth and soaks in. I like the consistency of it. It is thick but not heavy like a cream. It is not greasy and soaks in. It smells like Bath and Body Works Warm Vanilla Sugar. Not my favorite smell but wearable, and the smell fades pretty fast. Don&#x27;t know how well it will prolong my tan yet. But for the $ you get a large bottle and if it works to keep the tan it&#x27;s worth it. Don&#x27;t buy products at the salon they are so expensive. Amazon is a much better deal.</li>
            <li> I just repurchased this product, and can&#x27;t wait for it to come! Not only was it great when I used to tan, but I used it on my new, flaky tattoos as a moisturizer. I swear, it made the tattoo heal faster, and it&#x27;s soothing to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly suggest this product!</li>
            <li> I get compliments on this whenever I apply it, so soft and the smell is amazing. One person said I &amp;#34;smelled like an orgasm&amp;#34; when I was wearing this. Smells like summer in a bottle. There are no bronzers in it so even if you don&#x27;t tan it is still a great moisturizer. Skin feels so much softer even after one application. The bottle is huge!</li>
            <li> NOT THE REAL FOREVER AFTER!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this item since I bought it at Palm Beach Tan for 25.00 back in 2003. It&#x27;s a great price on Amazon for 11.00. It makes my skin feel like silk. Men always comment about how great it smells. My boyfriend says it&#x27;s worth every penny and to never stop using it. The only draw back is the price of shipping.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! I use it all the time...keeps my skin Fantaxinice and smooth and healthy looking&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is huge and will last a very long time!&#x27;</li>
            <li> This is a very very good for hydration after sun...very very light and it last..the vanilla bean smell.LOVE IT!!!! Good winter lotion too!!!! \\&quot;Thanks Austalian Gold\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is thick and creamy and does a great job but,  the smell is unbearable  so I will not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly, packaged nicely. It seems to be a fine product and the smell lasts and is quite good.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for my winter-dry skin. I don&#x27;t like perfumy (sp!) scents, nor flowery stuff and I prefer unscented. This does have a scent but it is nice. A little like the Original Hemp lotion in scent and hydration.</li>
            <li> Okay product. I understand its no longer being distributed to tanning salons so grab some while its cheap. Could smell better btw.</li>
            <li> Unlike most moisturizers on the Market...this one DOES NOT have ANY Mineral Oil in it! It actually absorbs into your skin &amp; feels AWESOME!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEST MOISTURIZER THAT I HAVE FOUND!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this because i remember loving the smell from years and years ago....like clean laundry almost. It now smells like vanilla which still smells great, but it&#x27;s not the same. I absolutely do not think that this a counterfeit product, companies change formulations and fragrances all the time. the one I had so long ago didnt have hemp in it so maybe it was a different lotion completely. As far as moisture is concerned this lotion is excellent even during this awful winter weather😀</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft and hydrated!</li>
            <li> Perfect after tan lotion! HUGE bottle! Amazing price! Smells soooo good! Will buy again when I run out (which will be like next year!)</li>
            <li> awesome product definitely buying again should definitely try it if you have not yeah its pretty freaking awesome if I do say so myself</li>
            <li> Love how much you get for the price! Ultra moisturizing...and a little goes a long way. Nice smell. I love putting this on after I go tanning.</li>
            <li> Item moisturizes well, but I truley dislike the smell of the product.  If I knew it was that bad, I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it.  So since I don&#x27;t use it often, I can&#x27;t honestly state it helps my tan last longer.</li>
            <li> the best everyday lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.. great price... no scents...not greasy. smooth and soft lotion. try it and see!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I have been using this lotion for about 4 yrs. Every once in a while I will buy a lotion at the grocery store and always throw it away after one use and go back to Forever After.</li>
            <li> love this lotion.. after tanning my skin is soo dry.. thei lotion not only smells good but is very mosturizing,.</li>
            <li> I purchased this body moisturizer based on a ranking of moisturizers I found on one of the consumer product rating sites.  Listed this one as the best buy for the money and it got raves for its moisturizing features.  I&#x27;ve gone through the whole list of body moisturizers....and, none of them have ever lived up to their advertising claims.  This is the ONLY one to which my dry skin has really responded.  And, who&#x27;s ever heard of the brand?  Not me!  It&#x27;s rich and leaves my skin feeling soft and looking wonderful.  I love the scent, which doesn&#x27;t overpower.  I now make it a point to use it on my feet each morning.  My toes and happy and my heels are no longer like sandpaper.  I&#x27;m on my third bottle and will continue to purchase this little-known product. Kid you not -- I&#x27;ve gone from repitilian scales to smooth, healthy-looking skin. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this lotion!!! Vanilla bean yum. I put this lotion on after I shower on days I don&#x27;t tan. It&#x27;s leaves me soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> would buy from these people again. came in fast and was SUPER moisturizing. i have been tanning everyday and my skin started to get flakey.. i bought this and problem solved. so happy with it. it smells like vanilla..but if u put a lot on it starts to smell like icing- which i like. its not an overpowering smell. BIG bottle i think its worth the price. i was they sold this in big crates, i would buy one.</li>
            <li> Lotion feels nice, but has an overwhelming odor that doesn&#x27;t go away. Put some on before bed and regretted it, the smell would not come out of my hands even after washing them. The smell is good at first but after hours of smelling it you just want it to go away. I prefer Angel lotion over this for sure.</li>
            <li> This lotion is sooo smooth and smells great. Not too strong.</li>
            <li> I love this makes my skin so soft and smells wonderful</li>
            <li> i just did not like the smell and its really think so hard to rub in easy</li>
            <li> I have used Forever After for years. I will never be without it.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this lotion for over 10 yrs.&lt;br /&gt;It smells amazing and is an awesome after tan lotion.</li>
            <li> this lotion works very well, it leaves your skin soft and smooth.the smell is not the best for men but i was suprised at the size of the bottle for the price. works better then &amp;#34;store lotions&amp;#34;. skin must be dry to rub in easy.</li>
            <li> OMG !!  This product is so rich and creamy and I love it. It keeps your skin hydrated all day and it does last for 24 hours. I have not found anything that works this good. I would recommend it to anyone with dry skin. Once you try it you will not want to be with out it. And a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice daily lotion than can also be used after tanning. It does not have a strong smell at all which I was worried about based on other reviews since I have a sensitive nose. It does not leave a greasy layer like sond moisturizers and sinks right in. It also lasts a long time. It is a giant bottle too. For the price it is a wonderful buy.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth to skin, has a baby soft feel, love the smell and texture, leaves no grease very happy will buy more in the future :)</li>
            <li> I would say so far this one is the best feeling on my skin and the way it absorbs. None of the lotions I have been using leave an oily residue feeling on my skin or even the face.</li>
            <li> Got my product on time and love it!</li>
            <li> Moisturizer - it worked WELL</li>
            <li> Got this about 8 months ago and still have half a bottle! smells amazing, and is a great compliment to any perfume I&#x27;ve worn. Does leave skin smooth throughout the day.</li>
            <li> lotion goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. smells great and lasts most of the day! I have not found a better lotion to date.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this to help keep my skin moisturized while I tried to build a base tan very slowly (yay for being a pale redhead).  After my trip I continued using it because it was amazing on dry elbows, heels and my eczema.  It&#x27;s one of the only lotions I&#x27;ve used that continously out performs anything else I try at helping with my dry patchy eczema in the winter.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin in the winter and I originally bought this moisturizer because the reviews touted its effectiveness.  I cannot attest to this products effectiveness because I refuse to use it.  The only time I tried it, I applied a pea sized drop just to ensure there would be no negative reactions.  The vanilla fragrance was immediate, overbearing, and refused to wash off.  I was forced to go to work smelling like a stripper.  Not a male friendly product.</li>
            <li> I received the Forever After Moisturizer and  it is lovely. It  softens my skin instantly and leaves a light, very pleasant scent. I will be using this whenever my skin needs some love. I would definitely recommend this to all who want soft, smooth, skin, with a light fresh scent.</li>
            <li> This product vanishes into the skin very quickly.  Whether it is all day....not sure, but, for the price I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> The scent on this has changed since the first time I bought a bottle years ago.  It now has an almost musk scent that I can&#x27;t stand.  Not the fruity scent it used to have.  I purchased my bottle from a reputable tanning salon, not online, so I know it&#x27;s not a counterfeit or tampered with product.  Still very moisturizing, can&#x27;t fault it there, but this different and stronger scent is going to stop me from buying it ever again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this same moisturizer for over 5 years now and I never have break outs nor dry or oily skin. It&#x27;s fantastic and hope that they don&#x27;t ever discontinue making it!</li>
            <li> My husband is the user. He loves and I love the scent on him</li>
            <li> Im not usually picky about my lotions and not too sensitive to smells but this one i just dont like. It works well, moisturizing and doesnt leave you feeling greasy. But! I absolutely hate the smell of it, so much so i couldnt use it anymore after only a few times. I just cannot stand how it smells. I didnt think a smell would bother me so much but the scent from this lingers on ALL day. Blech!</li>
            <li> This lotion smells like vanilla beans, but not too strong. It moisturizers very well. It&#x27;s also not a thin lotion, it&#x27;s pretty thick which I love. They delivered fast too!</li>
            <li> This lotion works amazingly, but I can&#x27;t use it because the scent is SO overpowering. Gives me an instant headache. Throwing it out because I can&#x27;t use it. I&#x27;ve tried several times, but I can&#x27;t deal with the headache. :(</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this lotion. A lot cheaper than at the salon too. I love the smell and it isn&#x27;t a thin lotion which I love! I don&#x27;t want to feel like I am putting on water. I hate that feeling. This is wonderful!!</li>
            <li> AMAZING I LOVE THIS STUFF! I got soo many completes on how I smelled and how my skin was so soft, it&#x27;s great lotion.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the AG Hot for after tanning, it has a very interesting smell - it isn&#x27;t strong &amp; may not bother others but it was too  much of a musky-off scent for me, especially when I was hoping to use it on my whole body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if it was a combination of the AG Hot -or not (see my review for AG Hot), but I felt like it actually &#x27;encouraged&#x27; my skin to burn further rather than cooling my skin down or providing any moisturizing effect. Ultimately, I was very displeased &amp; after using the product only twice I will be tossing it out.</li>
            <li> Love this after tan lotion! One of my favorites! My skin feels amazing after. Will 100% buy again. Fast delivery too.</li>
            <li> Australian Gold has some of the very best products. This is the 2nd year I am using Forever After. Its thick and creamy and has a plain vanilla sent that leaves your skin silky soft and smelling lovely all day</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good lotion for the price. It&#x27;s not heavy, which is nice. I would recommend this as an after tanning or sun exposure</li>
            <li> Works good for after tanning.  Good amount for the money, and it feels good on the skin. I will order more.</li>
            <li> I thought it would smell like a beach-y kind of tanning lotion . . . . but I just put a tiny dot of it on my forearms and it smells like perfume . . . and yes, that&#x27;s a very personal thing . . . so you might like it. . .  but this does not smell like the beach to me . . . it smells like I&#x27;m standing at a perfume counter.  It&#x27;s pretty strong.</li>
            <li> Obviously NOT authentic product.  Purchased from Solarium - Had AG at the top instead of the Australian Gold logo shown on the product.  Doesn&#x27;t have the nice vanilla smell as stated in other reviews and isn&#x27;t very thick. Very frustrating!  It&#x27;s like a crap shoot buying these online - wish Amazon would block sellers who sell fake lotions that they claim to be authentic!</li>
            <li> This is really nice lotion, it makes your skin soft.. but it smells awful and it&#x27;s thick. I threw this bottle away..</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful.  Thick.  GREAT LOTION!</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer, but I wish it had a less synthetic smell and a lighter texture (on skin damaged skin, it&#x27;s always better not to rub the product too much into the skin!).</li>
            <li> This is a great product.It leaves my skin feeling very soft and lasts all day.Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> My mom really liked this stuff and I bought some more for her as a present when she ran out.  When I get really dry hands especially in winter, I go straight for this bottle over her other stuff.  After a few days the dryness improves.  Seems like a good every day moisturizer too.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing. I bought it for after tanning bed use but now I use it all of the time.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly..  smells and works great.  My daughter loves it (they sell it at her tanning salon but for a lot more money)</li>
            <li> Love the scent! It makes me think of summer sunshine and the beach. Also makes my skin feel soft and silky and think it makes my tan in the summer last longer. Goes on smooth and dries quick. Have used this for a year now and after price checking a few places, Amazon had the best price for the size.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion, it smells fantastic and I love the moisture it gives especially after a shower! Not too thick not too thin, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells spectacular!!!!  Totally moisturizes after tanning!</li>
            <li> Best lotion out there!!!</li>
            <li> great service. fast shipping. very gladful with my purchase!! keep up the good work!!</li>
            <li> keeps my skin very soft. I have oily skin and i don&#x27;t feel like it makes me break out. I wouldn&#x27;t recogmend in to use as a tan accelerator but afterwards. For some reason I thought I could use it in the tanning bed and it didn&#x27;t help my tan.&lt;br /&gt;It was also cheaper to buy on here than the $22 in salons.</li>
            <li> Before I got this lotion I didn&#x27;t use any after sun lotion and with this lotion I don&#x27;t personally see too much of a difference but it smells nice and makes my skin feel good but it hasn&#x27;t done much in the holding my tan department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have used this product for a year now and I can honestly say that it&#x27;s a simple lotion like any other lotion that smells nice. Nothing about this lotion helps prolong a tan anymore than any other lotion so don&#x27;t think this one is special and does more than other lotions might do, even a basic \\&quot;no scent\\&quot; lotion from CVS can do what this one does so I took away a star because I bought this thinking it was supposed to prolong my tan and it never did. It&#x27;s a nice smelling lotion that moisturizes like lotions do but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> The lotion is extremely thick and it doesn&#x27;t even feel like it&#x27;s moisturizing my skin it just smells like tanning lotion its nauseating</li>
            <li> This is the best tan extender I&#x27;ve ever used! A little bit goes a long way and it makes your skin feel like silk. It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin sticky or greasy feeling. I use it all over after I shower. The smell is not overpowering, just a light scent of vanilla.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  It smells great and goes on smoothly.  It really hydrates my skin.</li>
            <li> Best after sun lotion.</li>
            <li> There are no words. Just buy it, trust me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the smell but it gets the job done</li>
            <li> I love this product and thank you for the super quick shipping!!!</li>
            <li> You can not use this product.  I was so disappointed, because I use almost all of Australian Gold Products.  This smells so strong if you were to put it on your body they could smell you a mile away.  It is so strong it is offensive.  No one could stand to be around you.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, I put it on after I tan and shower, you can actually see me getting darker after I put it on and I love the firming affect. I recommend it to anyone!-)</li>
            <li> This product works great as far as moisturizing, but I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell. It&#x27;s not unbearable but I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I put this on a hr after I tan and it helps keep my tan and it really is an all day moisturizer. It smells really good too</li>
            <li> This is a great product and it was a great price! I&#x27;ll be buying more of this Australian Gold product.</li>
            <li> bought this as a gift for someone. They loved it and the price is a lot better than at the stores</li>
            <li> After 5 years of using this stuff everyday its still the BEST after tan lotion and incredibly soft. I only use Forever after.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. i have used this lotion for about 2 years and its cheap on here. i use this lotion during the time i go tanning in the booth. if you burn at all this really helps. I tan really easily, but i have burned before. and it smells really good!</li>
            <li> Works great has awesome smell perfect for after tanning the clean sent will leave you feeling fresh and moisturized big thumbs up</li>
            <li> Smell great! Has an awesome summertime smell. Nice thick non greasy texture. I don&#x27;t believe that is preserves my tan as much as I was expecting, still nice loiton though!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell good at all! It feels greasy! I would not recommend this Moisturizer!</li>
            <li> love this product, had a problem with very dry scaly skin with regular lotions after I began my tanning bed&lt;br /&gt;sessions.  I decided to order SOMETHIN that would be extra moisture and nourish the skin,  but im a bargain&lt;br /&gt;hunter ALWAYS!  so this caught my eye at just a little over $12 with free super saver shipping.  I was totally satisfied&lt;br /&gt;with the very pleasant fragrance and all day moisture without feeling like I have a film or heavy grease.&lt;br /&gt;I will be re-ordering</li>
            <li> It keeps ur skin moist and it soaks n as soon as u put it on ur skin and i love the smell of it....</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! its great if you have a tan it prolong it for awhile!</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best lotion that I have ever had :) i use it every day and it is just wonderful!</li>
            <li> Big bottle (I suggest get a travel bottle at the dollar store and fill it up). Nice flowery smell, great tan, good moisture</li>
            <li> The lotion is great for daily use &amp; has a light but pleasant fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t tan anymore but I still get the lotion bcuz it&#x27;s an awesome moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;The seller packaged everything very well &amp; it was shipped before the expected date, which was even better ( &#x3D;</li>
            <li> SMELLS TERRIBLE! CANT WASH SCENT AWAY!!! I have never smelt a lotion like this ever... I AM SICK TO MY STOMACH! The package came today and I was so excited to smell the lotion I put it on my hands and now no matter how many times I washed my hands the smell will not come off which is making me so sick. Its like someone had described a mix of CHEAP VANILLA and CARMAX. Completely disappointed</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer, leaves skin feeling soft all day long.  Smells wonderful, very rich moisturizer.  Australian Gold products are great, never disapointed.</li>
            <li> Smells good, moisturizes great!! Perfect for \\&quot;every day\\&quot; use to help preserve and extend your tan. :) Plus, you cant beat the price! They sell this lotion in a smaller bottle for twice the price at my local beauty supply store...</li>
            <li> Excellent thick moisturizing lotion. Soothing and refreshing especially after tanning. Softens skin and long lasting. Always excellent delivery. I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> I bought this bc i just started tanning again and was out of my regular stuff this stuff is AWESOME! my skin feels like silk its smells really good. i have sensitive skin and cant use anything smelly (BBW) this doesnt give my any rash/bumps nothing kist silky skin and since i am tanning daily my tan is holding on strong!!!!</li>
            <li> The Forever After All Day moisturizer is a great moisturizer. It is smooth, last all day and has a nice scent..</li>
            <li> The lotion is fine but the smell it odd i didn&#x27;t like it at all the smell is overwhelming</li>
            <li> This is a great product it smells wonderful and relieves the burn after tanning. I would buy this product again! Thank you</li>
            <li> This lotion is awesome. It smells great and lasts all day. I am a female in the automotive industry. i am always washing my hands/fore arms, and this lotion helps keep my skin supple and hydrated. I can&#x27;t tell you if it helps extend my tan&#x27;s \\&quot;life\\&quot; at all... but i do know my skin is never dry. if i have a day off and use this lotion, my skin is soft all day. it&#x27;s light yet effective. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I got this to use after tanning but I hate the smell and it doesn&#x27;t really feel like I&#x27;m moisturized. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend at all.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love this aftersun lotion it helps the bronze come out and keeps your skin from drying out.  It doesn&#x27;t have a pungent smell like some other lotions and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion although it does contain alcohol (I was hoping it didn&#x27;t) so it needs to be reapplied a few times a day. It still feels really nice though. My skin is much smoother.</li>
            <li> Hands down best lotion ever made best smell best feel just the best use it for years never stop making this!!!!!</li>
            <li> I first purchased this at a tanning salon after trying a sample; I just loved how it felt and the scent is tasteful and not overbearing.  It really does make my tan last longer vs. the other products I have tried.  I do not tan religiously so when I do get a tan, this is my go-to moisturizer to extend it!  It is a white creamy lotion, rubs in well without staying tacky and you feel moisturized all day. I have really sensitive skin and this has never caused irritation; no bronzers or tingling in this product either. The bottle for me lasts a long time too. Did I mention the amazing smell?  Love it!  I would definitely recommend this to anyone whether they tan or not.</li>
            <li> the best! buy it, you&#x27;ll love it too! I tan usually between March-September every year and I always thought after-tan lotion was unnecessary. I first tried Australian Gold&#x27;s body Kisses because it had such good reviews and I was looking for a new, every day moisturizing lotion and I loved it, then tried this and loved it even more. It makes your skin so soft and isn&#x27;t greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> not sure about this one (from amazon) and if it&#x27;s the real thing, but if it is, it smells heavenly. best smelling lotion ive ever had/used and lasts a lifetime</li>
            <li> I have been using this along with Solid Black bronzing lotion and my tan looks great and isn&#x27;t fading. The lotion keeps my skin soft all day long.</li>
            <li> This product suck it came expired!!! And didn&#x27;t smell to good</li>
            <li> Just ordered my 2nd bottle!  I am currently doing indoor tanning, and originally ordered it for after my tan session.  But I&#x27;m totally hooked, and will be using this as a daily moisturizer forever!  Such a great smell!!!  Man or woman!!!  Nothing fruity, just a clean smell!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m posting this hours after receiving my product. I absolutely love this lotion!! The way it feels on my skin I can&#x27;t stop touching it! It&#x27;s such a great every day moisturizer but I have a feeling it&#x27;s gonna do great things for my tan. Very satisfied. ALso...bottle is a very genorous size!</li>
            <li> This product has such a subtle but unique scent.  My niece is hooked on it now and my husband will grab me and smell me.  Loves it.  Leaves skin super soft!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! Like the warm vanilla sugar from bath and body works! Keeps my skin pretty soft, as well. Love it :)</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for years as I am an avid tanning bed user. I mix it with a drugstore brand and it lasts forever. Love that I am not paying what I was when I bought it in a tanning salon!!!  It is AWESOME!!!  Great lotion and GREAT PRICE!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion. I have only had it a couple weeks and I really like it. It deeply moisturizes and leaves my skin feeling great.</li>
            <li> We use this product after tanning, which helps keeping the skin soft.  The moisturizer lotion is very thick and when applying to the skin seems feels amazing</li>
            <li> Very pleased I love this loition I just couldn&#x27;t find it any where I am glad I found it here.. Thank u so much..</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion from Solarium for a great price! Smells great (vanilla), seems like the legit product, and moisturizes perfectly! Does not feel greasy like other lotions. I would highly recommend to all tanners!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s only one downside: I used this lotion once before the pump broke. Grr! Annoying but definitely not detrimental.</li>
            <li> MY LADY LOVES THIS LOTION...SHE SAID IT MAKES HER SKIN FEEL SO GOOD AND IT SMELL GOOD ALSO...WOULD RECOMMEND TO ALL</li>
            <li> Love this lotion it makes your skin look great and it smells great.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is lovely, and very effective.  It left my skin feeling soft without being greasy.  It is quite economical and you get a very generous amount.  Love the lotion, but the scent...not so much...lol.  I&#x27;ve noticed the fragrance lingers throughout day as well.  I&#x27;m hoping they come up with an unscented version.  I see most of the reviewers really do like the smell, so don&#x27;t let this discourage you.  This moisturizer is truly a bargain, and the quality is first-rate.  The only thing that would keep me from repurchasing is, as I said, the smell.  It is a just a bit too strong for me, but again, this is a matter of individual preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 3/26/2013:  I had given only three stars in my initial review because the scent was overpowering when applied for the first time.  I noticed after about two weeks the strength of the scent has diminished to a level where it is actually tolerable.  Since I absolutely love the quality of this moisturizing cream, I will now give it five stars.  The more I use this product, the more I like it, and I will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> This lotion is very moisturizing and smells amazing!!</li>
            <li> Works great as a daily moisturizer. My skin stays soft all day. It goes on a little thick, which I like. It smells amazing. And works great as a tan extender.</li>
            <li> smell hurts my eyes and made me sick to my stomach.  musk smell very strong. ill stick with body kisses instead.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin so soft and smells great.</li>
            <li> Great quality for the price--they have this lotion marked up to $26 at my tanning place--I paid less than half that!!!</li>
            <li> Love the scent and makes my skin feel soft all day</li>
            <li> One of the best lotions I&#x27;ve ever used, it goes on thick and creamy and dries fairly quickly leaving your skin feeling soft and moisturized.  The fragrance is a very light vanilla scent.  I really can&#x27;t say anything about the anti-aging properties but in my opinion you&#x27;re not going to rid of wrinkles in a lotion bottle anyway, but I do love the way it leaves my skin feeling.</li>
            <li> Good product. But still leaves skin dry.</li>
            <li> Works great! Great price!!</li>
            <li> Best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  Firms skin and smells lovely!!</li>
            <li> There is nothing I don&#x27;t love about this lotion.... :)  I have used it for years now, and my dry skin is a thing of the past! It&#x27;s not greasy or oily and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts on my sensitive skin. It smells lovely, too! One bottle just lasted me 2-3 years, so be aware that the bottle is very large! If you want to travel and take some, you would want to put it in a smaller container. :)</li>
            <li> Smells so good and does not leave an oily residue. My everyday lotion</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion.  It&#x27;s a great moisturizer and smells very nice, subtle vanilla scent.  Perfect for the summer or anytime!</li>
            <li> I like it a lot &amp; I love the way it smells!!!!  :-)</li>
            <li> Does not smell good. Bought this product particularly for how creamy and delicious it smelled when i tried it in the salon. Tried it upon arriveal and it smells terrible! Scent resembles chemicals/petroleum jelly</li>
            <li> the best lotion by far, very hydrating and smells amazing! I use this even when i dont have a tan.</li>
            <li> This is the best after tanning lotion I have used to date. It does not leave a greasy feeling after application and smells quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> I really love how this lotion smells. I purchased it to put on after going to the tanning both, and it works great! I put it on all the time because I love how it smells.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, absorbs quickly and leaves me feeling moisturized.  The scent is a light vanilla which is perfect for me as I hate lotions that are too strong.  Good value in this large bottle as well.  I use it every day and don&#x27;t have any peeling skin where I have been sunburned (although it was not that severe).  Will continue using this as an everyday moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The smell is kind of the a vanilla lotion, but I didn&#x27;t notice the smell after a few minutes of appling it.  I don&#x27;t tan enough to notice if it makes a difference in the color of my tanned skin, but overall it&#x27;s pleasant and would buy it again.  It&#x27;s a hugh bottle and will probably never need to buy another bottle as I tan once every other week.</li>
            <li> been using for years. love the smell ...I&#x27;ll never get sick of it. moisturizes like no other lotion I have used before lol</li>
            <li> It smells really good, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and works.</li>
            <li> Seems a nice rich thick product.  Size is generous.  Good to have around post tanning.  So far it has been great.</li>
            <li> If I had the option to rate no stars I would. I ordered the  product after reading the reviews I thought it was a good purchase. However there were a few comments talking about getting expired products...... I though I was a lucky person guess not the lotion smelled funny and was a year expired....... Shame on you!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and I was excited to find it at such a great price.  It shipped quickly and I am very satisfied with my purchase.  I highly recommend ordering this product.  Not only does the lotion help dry skin, it is also has the best fragrance and it&#x27;s not overpowering like some scents.</li>
            <li> my skin was left really silky smooth afterward. The smell is pleasant, not over-bearing. I personally enjoy strong perfumes. Worked great for a lotion after I went tanning. So far, it&#x27;s been 8 hours since I applied it, and I can still see the glowing affects of my skin. It&#x27;s pretty pricey though, next time I&#x27;ll probably just go with some cheap drug store lotion.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion after reading several great reviews about it.  I currently have been rotating through a few moisturizers...Jergen&#x27;s original, Body Drench original, and Hempz original....all great lotions.  I didn&#x27;t really NEED a new lotion but I like trying new products...you never know what might end up being great.  This, however, is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the positives.  Super fast shipping.  I ordered it Tuesday night, and recieved it Thursday morning.  The bottle is huge!!  There&#x27;s a lot of product for the amount paid so in case someone does enjoy this lotion, it&#x27;s a great value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now, the less desirable attributes.  The scent is just ok.  They describe it as vanilla bean I believe, but to me it smells like a mix of vanilla, musk, and powder.  It&#x27;s not really as sweet and warm smelling as I hoped for.  But the fragrance also fades pretty quickly. It&#x27;s not overly feminine so guys out there might enjoy it.  The lotion has a nice consistency...not too runny and not too thick.  I used it after bathing which is when I typically use any body lotion.  You do have to rub it in quite a bit for it to get absorbed, but for me, it still feels it&#x27;s sitting ON my skin and not absorbing INTO my skin.  It feels as though there&#x27;s a light waxy or chalky residue all over my skin, and it doesn&#x27;t feel very moisturized.  In fact, at night before bed I feel as though I need to put on a fresh layer of it.  Typically, with other lotions, I don&#x27;t feel like this is necessary so I haven&#x27;t done much \\&quot;re-applying\\&quot; before so this feels like  an unnecessary waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m not a big fan of this lotion.  It&#x27;s not so bad to.the point that I feel like I need to send it back, and for the price paid I also don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve been ripped off.  It&#x27;s just not what works for me despite all of the positive feedback from other customers.  I base a lot of my Amazon.com purchases based on others&#x27; ratings and I&#x27;m almost never disappointed.  And I like giving fair feedbackin return when I can.  This product just isn&#x27;t a good match for me and most likely will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> The scent is very mild and my skin stays hydrated all day even after tanning! Great Product! Definitely recommend this to anyone that tans!</li>
            <li> This is the lotion you have been looking for.&lt;br /&gt;It is the best lotion for dry skin, and lasts ALL DAY.&lt;br /&gt;I will not use any other lotion from now on.</li>
            <li> The best smell ever! Not greasy, but smooth and silky. Also, very affordable. You can&#x27;t go wrong with Forever After!</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer I have found!</li>
            <li> Love all the Australian Gold products and this is no exception!! The bottle is way bigger than I expected and it smells great!&lt;br /&gt;I mix this with my Australian Gold dark tanning accelerator lotion and it helps the lotion last so much longer while moisturizing my skin. Just save your used bottle and mix 50/50 Awesome product!!</li>
            <li> Best lotion ever!! Smells amazing,  and leaves my skin soft soft soft all day long!  I would recommend this to anyone not just tanners!  The bottle is huge and the soft vanilla scent is awesome!</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion! First thing that came to mind when I smelled it was buttercream frosting on a cupcake! Delicious! It keeps my skin moisturized for a long period of time and does not leave me feeling coated and gross. The bottle is huge, so I think its going to last me a while! A good buy for the money and it&#x27;s nice knowing my skin won&#x27;t be dry and prone to as many wrinkles from tanning!</li>
            <li> Lotion is thick and feels very moisurizing. Has a great smell to it - mild vanilla like smell! Not too overpowering or perfumey. Using it daily my skin felt great!</li>
            <li> Product is wonderful. I have been using it for several years. Delivery of order was great. Only one problem. Web page, when I started my search for this product, said anything over $25 was free shipping. I was charged almost $10 for my order. So if you are looking for free shipping, don&#x27;t count on it from this sight.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this lotion and it&#x27;s a wonderful moisturizer for after using a tanning bed. My tan seems to last longer too if I use it every day.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. It makes your skin feel like silk and it doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell (tanning bed smell). Another thing is it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy.  I finally have found the perfect lotion for me!</li>
            <li> This lotion is ok; it does help extend your tan and keep your skin feeling smooth.  However, the smell is iffy, and it doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly as other lotions.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion because I was bored with the lotion I had been using. I was surprised by how thick this lotion was. At the end of the day my Husband said it smelled like I had had been at the beach all day. (Major plus) It leaves my skin feeling soft and smells great! What more could you ask for?!</li>
            <li> I use this after the gym tanning booth. Although I have found better moisturizers for less money at the present time I am using this until its exhausted and will buy an over the counter moisturizer.Its just OK...............</li>
            <li> This is a good value I think. Not too greasy feeling. Slight coconut scent. Not too strong or overwhelming. Reminds me of the beach. Good everyday lotion.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion by chance....WOW!  What luck. It&#x27;s wonderful!  I feel the moisture all day long and it keeps my skin soft.  It has a nice smell too!  I was surprised at the price....great deal for a great product!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years.  I bought 4 bottles on my purchase for the price of 2 @ the salon</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly&lt;br /&gt;Not greasy&lt;br /&gt;Reasonably priced&lt;br /&gt;Smells great&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;LOVE LOVE LOVE this product&lt;br /&gt;Pumps could work a little better</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so good!!! It smells like coconuts and summertime. It is a thicker lotion but this allows it to really hydrate your skin! I put this on every day and you can tell a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion is what I expected &amp; more. It goes on smooth &amp; there is no greasy feeling. The scent is also nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion on my entire body for 5 years now! It&#x27;s a wonderful moisturizer, it soaks in and doesn&#x27;t make you feel greasy, and I love the way it smells. Plus it extends my tan and keeps my skin looking firm and smooth.</li>
            <li> Just got this lotion and a little goes along way, it smells really good not to strong but most lotions I have bought before smells good when u first put it on but after awhile you just can&#x27;t smell it anymore but this one it last all day. And it kept my skin very moisturized all night at work which made me happy ,so I would recommend this for sure plus it&#x27;s not a bad price!</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my daughter.  I want to order more for her birthday.  Will go there next.  I might need help to order it correctly.  My son does that for me.</li>
            <li> Oh Wow! This has to be one of the best scented after tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever known of! It really stays on and the vanilla bean ccscent lasts,usually a scented lotion won&#x27;t smell after a few hours,but this does. I&#x27;ll for sure get this again+the price is great for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> I have gone through at least ten bottles of this product.  It is by far the best moisturizing and best smelling lotion I have ever used.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time in the sun this summer. I wanted a great moisturizer that would help to save my tan. This stuff is the best! Also, it has a very pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Nice thick, long lasting lotion.</li>
            <li> Great lotion.  I called Australian Gold today to check on the AG logo.  This is a legitimate Australian Gold logo.  There certainly may be fakes out there but the AG logo is not an indicator.</li>
            <li> Even if your not a tanner this lotion is the sh(&amp;^%% I LOVE IT!! It smells great and keeps your skin looking fresh! This is my 4th bottle.</li>
            <li> I love how it smells but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that great as a tan extender to be honest. I tan four times a week and I am in need of something to hydrate my thirsty skin lol i heard live my couture is really awesome I smelled that and whoa yummy I&#x27;m getting that next time.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a moisturizer for after I tan,and I think I found the perfect one! This lotion has a nice,pleasant, and light scent that is not over powering at all. After only using this lotion for a few days, I can tell a difference in my skin and how much longer it holds my tan. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an after tan lotion!</li>
            <li> This purchase was my third time purchasing this lotion, and I love it! My skin is super soft! I get stopped all the time by people asking me what my scent is that I am wearing. This lotion has a great light scent, I rarely have to wear perfume anymore. Worth trying for sure!!</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for after tanning for years and I love it.  It does a great job of making your skin feel great and the smell is both fantastic and fits any gender.  Great stuff, great price, cant beat it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE the smell of this lotion. A few years ago I probably woulda argued it smelled like a gathering of old ladies. Old folk perfume, White musk or something funky? BUT, as far as keeping good color.... *Shakes head no* Not that great. No matter how many of these lotions I try I STILL have yet to be swayed from KISSES by Australian Gold. That stuffs awesometastic! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> This lotion feels like silk.  It goes on easily and smooth.  It lasts all day.  I tried it first on my hands; which were dry from the winter weather and I couldn&#x27;t believe the immediate results.  My hands felt wonderful.  I ordered this because of reading the reviews and I would order it again in a heartbeat.  Wonderful product.  The only thing that I will warn  you about; if you have sensitivity to perfumes/smells; then this product may not be for you.  I wish that they made one unscented.  The scent is wonderful; nice smelling but I  prefer unscented lotions.&lt;br /&gt;Try this lotion; you won&#x27;t want to use anything else.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great. It&#x27;s thick, but not so thick that it takes forever to rub in. It smells fantastic, fruity, and lasts a long time. It makes my legs feel really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It smells wonderful and it makes my skin feel great! I will be a repeat customer!</li>
            <li> Forever After is by far the best moisturizer I have ever used. I tried Kisses by Australian Gold and it was pretty good as well, but Designer Skin&#x27;s Guardian Angel is nothing compared to this. It is thicker and lasts ALL DAY unlike the thin viscosity of other Tan Extenders. I highly recommend this product, and I have tried it all.</li>
            <li> This is exactly the same product I buy in the salons, but for less than half the price.  Very pleased with the product.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have always loved the Australian Gold products, The only place I can find them now is online. I am thrilled with the product and have been using them for over 20 years.</li>
