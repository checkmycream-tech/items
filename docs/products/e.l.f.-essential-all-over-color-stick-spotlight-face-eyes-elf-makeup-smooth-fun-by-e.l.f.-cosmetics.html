            <li>This is an awesome product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s GREAT!</li>
            <li>This one is strictly for highlighting features, but it does a great job.</li>
            <li>Great value.</li>
            <li>Elf has great products for a good price.</li>
            <li>anything that gives a nice youthful glow is great.  </li>
            <li>This stick is good for under eye coverage.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to use it again, but eventually did and have been very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Great spotlight for areas on your face to want to &amp;#34;project&amp;#34; when light hits your face.</li>
            <li>It gives a nice spotlight where you need it and brightens up your face.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>It also smells really nice.</li>
            <li>Thought I&#x27;d give this a try since it was so cheap and had good reviews.  </li>
            <li>I love this highlighter.</li>
            <li>Why isn&#x27;t it rounded at the tip, like most things?</li>
            <li>You look brighter &amp; more awake w/o appearing to have anything on.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I thought this would be more like a highlighter stick</li>
            <li>May work better to sponge on than to use finger tips.</li>
            <li>I look more refreshed and awake.  </li>
            <li>I already ordered 5 more.</li>
            <li>, I find that it distributes better that way.</li>
            <li>Covers evenly  :)</li>
            <li>So glad I purchased this.  </li>
            <li>Okay that&#x27;s all I can say about this</li>
            <li>so be sure to pick the appropriate color for your skin tone.</li>
            <li>but I wish I had more information how to apply it</li>
            <li>Once I received the product I realized it wasn&#x27;t, but it worked like one but the results were even better.</li>
            <li>It does a great job enhancing natural highlights.</li>
            <li>I put a line above my blush and dab it in, gives me a great glow.</li>
            <li>I used the stick to glide it on my face and it didn&#x27;t go on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t have a gross make-up smell, it smells great.</li>
            <li>The fact that it is easy to apply and very reasonably priced is even better.  </li>
            <li>Smells funny and looks more like kid makeup.</li>
            <li>When I bought this product I originally thought it was a concealer.</li>
            <li>First time ever using a Elf product. :)</li>
            <li>I love this product, exactly as pictured well worth the money!!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s definitely good enough.</li>
            <li>But other than that it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>I find it more effective than regular concealer because it deflects light, disguising a pimple way better than obvious layers of makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So overall it&#x27;s a decent product and would recommend it to anyone looking for a cheap and good quality product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t add color or much sparkle, just a beam of light, as the name suggests.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than that, it looks very nice on my pale skin and works good as a highlight.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light almost white</li>
            <li>All e.l.f. products I&#x27;ve tried have delivered exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I only used it once maybe if I use it more I can see results.</li>
            <li>This is simple, easy, fast and works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that it covers very well.</li>
            <li>but it goes on very greasy and messes up any foundation you have on underneath.</li>
            <li>recommend warming this up a bit with your finger before applying it to your face - as opposed to applying it straight from the tube to your face</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t cost much</li>
            <li>I like it, more or less</li>
            <li>I have never found this particular item.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of hard to make an accurate highlight because of how wide the stick is.</li>
            <li>This product offers a brightening effect without looking like I swiped a too-light cover stick over my face.</li>
            <li>roller is small, so use it sparingly, but you will enjoy the effect.</li>
            <li>Bright white, the only down side is that it&#x27;s so small.</li>
            <li>The first time I used the elf Spotlight highlighter stick was over a primer, and right after it set in that area on my face dried out and got these little raised bumps.</li>
            <li>I usually use the most on my cheekbones, then do little dabs on my nose, chin, inner eyes, cupid&#x27;s bow, and bridge of the nose, and it all balances well.</li>
            <li>It also captures all the tiny hairs around the lip area that normally don&#x27;t show up, making the area above the upper lip look like a very aged area...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this highlighter. I&#x27;m a newb to the adult makeup scene (what, no more white eyeliner?!), and this is one of my go-to products. I put a line above my blush and dab it in, gives me a great glow.</li>
            <li> I like elf products, this one is alright, for me I don&#x27;t think that it covers very well.</li>
            <li> The picture is not what I received. I got liquid elf highlighter. It&#x27;s not a stick. Im disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love it, because I don&#x27;t have the money to go out and purchase all of those crazy NARS and MAC products. This is simple, easy, fast and works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beef with it? It&#x27;s so small, and it&#x27;s completely flat, like it wants us to break it. Why isn&#x27;t it rounded at the tip, like most things? Just makes sense to do that. Weird.</li>
            <li> This does just what it says. It gives a nice spotlight where you need it and brightens up your face.</li>
            <li> This stick would be the &amp;#34;catch-all&amp;#34; of face refreshers halfway through the day (due to stick delivery and compact container) if it didn&#x27;t go on stiff and cause pores to show up really boldly at the T-zone area of my cheeks.  I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m doing wrong.  I used the stick to glide it on my face and it didn&#x27;t go on smoothly.  So then I rubbed it in with my hands and still didn&#x27;t settle down.  It also captures all the tiny hairs around the lip area that normally don&#x27;t show up, making the area above the upper lip look like a very aged area...yuck.</li>
            <li> Great spotlight for areas on your face to want to &amp;#34;project&amp;#34; when light hits your face. It doesn&#x27;t add color or much sparkle, just a beam of light, as the name suggests.&lt;br /&gt;If you shop for ELF products elsewhere, you may occasionally find them @ dollar stores or Target, but I have never found this particular item.&lt;br /&gt;The roller is small, so use it sparingly, but you will enjoy the effect. You look brighter &amp; more awake w/o appearing to have anything on.&lt;br /&gt;I intend to try the other colors, too.</li>
            <li> I like the stick application of this product. i sometimes use it on my eyelids as a base for eyeshadow. It seems to make my eyeshadow last longer.  Even thought this stick is small, it doesn&#x27;t take a lot because it is so highly pigmented.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be more like a highlighter stick but it goes on very greasy and messes up any foundation you have on underneath. May work better to sponge on than to use finger tips.</li>
            <li> This product offers a brightening effect without looking like I swiped a too-light cover stick over my face. Will order again. All e.l.f. products I&#x27;ve tried have delivered exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and the all over stick in persimmon as well.  This is an awesome product.  I add it on my cheek bones in the morning and low and behold I look more refreshed and awake.  I am nearing 40, so anything that gives a nice youthful glow is great.  The fact that it is easy to apply and very reasonably priced is even better.  If you are purchasing this as a blush... go for a different color, there are several shades.  This one is strictly for highlighting features, but it does a great job.</li>
            <li> I purchased this looking to replace a previous contour stick. It&#x27;s GREAT! Bright white, the only down side is that it&#x27;s so small. I already ordered 5 more.</li>
            <li> I love this product, exactly as pictured well worth the money!!&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying again, only disappointment was the actual size, thought it would be a little bigger.</li>
            <li> I got this for just $1 on the ELF website. I think this is a decent highlighter, nothing really wrong with it, but also not quite stellar. (I do prefer ELF&#x27;s Shimmering Facial Whips over this formula).I&#x27;d recommend warming this up a bit with your finger before applying it to your face - as opposed to applying it straight from the tube to your face, I find that it distributes better that way. For the price, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> The stick is way too dry to get the color to appear.. I had to melt it alittle bit.. still not worth it.. it didn&#x27;t cost much so I guess I&#x27;m not to dissapointed just wish I could use it. In the trash it goes.</li>
            <li> Nice product. Covers evenly  :)</li>
            <li> Has acne causing ingredients...not shown online ( see &amp;#34;ZERO ZITS&amp;#34; ONLINE TO LEARN THE ACNE CAUSING INGREDIENTS.</li>
            <li> Ran out of my highlighter stick that I purchased at Sephora.  I can&#x27;t remember the brand, but it was over $20.  Thought I&#x27;d give this a try since it was so cheap and had good reviews.  So glad I purchased this.  Not as creamy as my old highlighter, but I like that because it it&#x27;s harder to overapply.</li>
            <li> Okay that&#x27;s all I can say about this I only used it once maybe if I use it more I can see results.</li>
            <li> Elf has great products for a good price. This stick is good for under eye coverage. It&#x27;s very light almost white so be sure to pick the appropriate color for your skin tone.</li>
            <li> This is the only primer I use. Recommend to all my friends and clients. Can&#x27;t beat the price. Great value.</li>
            <li> I like it, more or less but I wish I had more information how to apply it</li>
            <li> Smells funny and looks more like kid makeup.</li>
            <li> When I bought this product I originally thought it was a concealer. Once I received the product I realized it wasn&#x27;t, but it worked like one but the results were even better. It also doesn&#x27;t have a gross make-up smell, it smells great. First time ever using a Elf product. :)</li>
            <li> The first time I used the elf Spotlight highlighter stick was over a primer, and right after it set in that area on my face dried out and got these little raised bumps. I was hesitant to use it again, but eventually did and have been very pleased with the results. It hasn&#x27;t caused issue with my foundation, lotion, or bb cream - just that one primer. I&#x27;d advise experimenting with whatever you wear it over to monitor the results before leaving the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like some other reviewers, I prefer to rub it on my finger then dab it on my face. The stick packs some punch and can be hard to blend once on the face. It does a great job enhancing natural highlights. I usually use the most on my cheekbones, then do little dabs on my nose, chin, inner eyes, cupid&#x27;s bow, and bridge of the nose, and it all balances well. It also works as concealer! I find it more effective than regular concealer because it deflects light, disguising a pimple way better than obvious layers of makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have another, more expensive, liquid highlighter that this has all but replaced. It&#x27;s not perfect, but unless you&#x27;re a makeup junkie (which I&#x27;m not) it&#x27;s definitely good enough. Can&#x27;t beat this value.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of hard to make an accurate highlight because of how wide the stick is. Also was ALOT smaller than I had expected. Other than that, it looks very nice on my pale skin and works good as a highlight. It also smells really nice. So overall it&#x27;s a decent product and would recommend it to anyone looking for a cheap and good quality product.</li>
            <li> It was way smaller than I anticipated. A bit shiny too. Not for under eye. But other than that it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK...not quite what I expected</li>
    </ol>
