            <li>It works much better than lotions.</li>
            <li>I love this presentation of the sunblock stick.  </li>
            <li>Sweatproof or not, sunscreens end up in the eyes and mouth and it&#x27;s nice when it tastes sweet like this.</li>
            <li>so I wanted a quick way allow my kids to add their own protection to their faces if I forgot.</li>

            <li>even in 105 degree heat in the full sun.</li>
            <li>It also had no odor like other sticks have, and my daughters were able to apply it by themselves very easily.</li>
            <li>great for little faces.  </li>
            <li>Price was right too.</li>
            <li>Awesome - no more spray near the face and</li>
            <li>Great for a quick dab of sunscreen, on days when you won&#x27;t be out long and don&#x27;t want white &amp;#34;goop&amp;#34; on their faces.  </li>
            <li>The stick makes it so easy to reapply sunblock on my 3, 5 and 7 year old.</li>

            <li>The Banana Boat sticks make applying sunscreen to my 4-year and 15 month children&#x27;s faces so much easier!  </li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>very practice, and useful, really works</li>
            <li>I have been using this SPF50 sunscreen to protect my face and neck from wrinkles and fine lines when it is too sunny outside</li>
            <li>For kids much easier to apply and use over spray.  </li>
            <li>doing vigorous physical activities is important to me.</li>
            <li>50 spf is really good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very well packaged.</li>
            <li>Totally transparent, and although it has a bit of a &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34; texture at first, it blends in quickly and evens out.</li>
            <li>It makes it so much easier, and my older ones can put it on themselves without complaining about sunscreen in their eyes.</li>
            <li>The price was also better than what I saw for individual ones at local stores.</li>
            <li>Quick to apply and doesn&#x27;t melt to liquid when left in a tank bag...</li>
            <li>Amazon was able to credit me for the missing one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This stays put so you can get it right up next to her eyes without burning.</li>
            <li>First of all, I ordered a package of 5 of these but only 4 came with my shipment.  </li>
            <li>The stick works great but shipping was way too long for such a small pack.</li>
            <li>We live in Florida and have a pool - having the sunblock sticks has made my 7 year old \\&quot;queen\\&quot; of keeping every one sunblocked.</li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin, but I also use it on my face, and have had no trouble with irritation or breakouts.</li>
            <li>So far w haven&#x27;t had any sunburns or burning, watery eyes from exposure.</li>
            <li>My 2 year old doesn&#x27;t mind having this applied to her face.  </li>
            <li>Also, they&#x27;re small and would never spill or open, so they&#x27;re great to throw in your purse year round.</li>
            <li>Review is obviously of the seller, NOT the products--these were expired, one clearly dated as expiring in 2012, the rest were determined to be expired in 2012 or are expiring THIS month, after a call was placed to manufacturer for assistance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this for my ten year old grandaughter that has a surgical scar on her face.</li>
            <li>Was worried other reviews said they got product that was about to expire, but I checked mine and they were brand new and have a couple years until they expire.</li>

            <li> Review is obviously of the seller, NOT the products--these were expired, one clearly dated as expiring in 2012, the rest were determined to be expired in 2012 or are expiring THIS month, after a call was placed to manufacturer for assistance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this for my ten year old grandaughter that has a surgical scar on her face.</li>
            <li> Was worried other reviews said they got product that was about to expire, but I checked mine and they were brand new and have a couple years until they expire.</li>
            <li> She even threw one in her bag today before she left for a long day outside.</li>
            <li> Of course, it is difficult to get complete coverage as compared to lotion, but if you are careful it will work fine on your kids&#x27; face.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t take a notice of the expired product when i put on my 3 and 4 years-old kids until I see they developed little rash on their face.  </li>
            <li> We use these on kids faces all summer long.</li>
            <li> I used this while on a week long Motorcycle trip.  </li>
            <li> use this while surfing and while doing manual labor work outside -- it is the only stuff that will stay on after being in the water for a few hours.</li>
            <li> My lips were not at all burned or chapped at the end of our vacation though my back and shoulders, where I wore SPF 50 sunblock lotion, did get slightly burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They stay on for a very long time, and do NOT run down into eyes.</li>
            <li> The other stuff burns my daughter&#x27;s eyes.  </li>
            <li> So disappointed about the seller, they should be more diligent about selling kids products</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to remember to sunscreen multiple people every day</li>
            <li> It formed a slick greasy-feeling film on my face (imagine coating your face in chapstick).</li>
            <li> No more shots at a moving target with the cream.  </li>
            <li> Also, its so small you can take in your pocket while surfing (or wherever).</li>
            <li> My very pale son has not had a hint of a burn all summer.</li>
            <li> At least that shows it&#x27;s water resistant and won&#x27;t sweat off.</li>
            <li> These offer thick coverage with no &amp;#34;white sunblock face&amp;#34; that we&#x27;ve run into with the store brand sticks.</li>
            <li> tried Coppertone for Kids stick too and that stuff goes on thick and clogged my pores and made me feel funky and</li>
            <li> No more burnt faces!</li>
            <li> It worked very well protecting my lips, but has an artificial sweetener flavor, which I had no problem with but others may find unpleasant.</li>
            <li> The lotions aren&#x27;t bad, but the stick is definitely easier to use</li>
            <li> but she hated it and also said it burned her skin so we have been glopping on the white sunblock on her until now.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I am doing something wrong?</li>
            <li> It is difficult to rub in.  </li>
            <li> sometimes the taste seems unpleasant, but don&#x27;t know why....</li>
            <li> Also, the base is waxy, protecting skin from wind.</li>
            <li> Amazon rep was as disgusted as I was...</li>
            <li> As I ran, sweat beaded and dripped from my face because of the oily water-repellant coating, and after my run I felt (and looked) disgusting.</li>

            <li> This is perfect for beach or pool.  The other stuff burns my daughter&#x27;s eyes.  This stays put so you can get it right up next to her eyes without burning.</li>
            <li> Great for a quick dab of sunscreen, on days when you won&#x27;t be out long and don&#x27;t want white &amp;#34;goop&amp;#34; on their faces.  Totally transparent, and although it has a bit of a &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34; texture at first, it blends in quickly and evens out.</li>
            <li> My kids used it daily on their faces and it protected their skin well. It also had no odor like other sticks have, and my daughters were able to apply it by themselves very easily. They said it is not runny and doesn&#x27;t sting if it gets in their eyes.</li>
            <li> I bought these so that each of my kids could have one to put in their bookbags, etc and I could keep one in my purse. It&#x27;s hard to remember to sunscreen multiple people every day so I wanted a quick way allow my kids to add their own protection to their faces if I forgot. I am glad I bought this and would buy again!</li>
            <li> I use this as a easy way to sunscreen my tattoos so they don&#x27;t get faded. It&#x27;s easier to use a stick than the regular liquid sun screen. I love this!</li>
            <li> These work great. I bought 4 or 5 so both my kids have 1 to keep in their backpack to apply at camp and we have extras to put in the bathrooms. My kids can easily apply themselves and don&#x27;t have to worry about getting anything in their eyes. These offer thick coverage with no &amp;#34;white sunblock face&amp;#34; that we&#x27;ve run into with the store brand sticks. So far w haven&#x27;t had any sunburns or burning, watery eyes from exposure. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Works really well and best of all, my 4 year old puts it on her face herself.  We had been using a spray to put it on her face but she hated it and also said it burned her skin so we have been glopping on the white sunblock on her until now.  This stick is great, smells ok and best of all - she puts it on without issue.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy and works well.</li>
            <li> These sticks are the ONLY way to get sunscreen onto my kids faces while they&#x27;re jumping around trying to get into the water. It makes it so much easier, and my older ones can put it on themselves without complaining about sunscreen in their eyes. It&#x27;s also great to slip into my purse or diaper bag for those times when you need sunscreen but didn&#x27;t think about bringing the big bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin, but I also use it on my face, and have had no trouble with irritation or breakouts.</li>
            <li> They came expired 2012 and 2014 ....</li>
            <li> Review is obviously of the seller, NOT the products--these were expired, one clearly dated as expiring in 2012, the rest were determined to be expired in 2012 or are expiring THIS month, after a call was placed to manufacturer for assistance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a j*ck*ss move--selling expired KIDS facial sunscreen--shame on this seller!!!  Amazon rep was as disgusted as I was...</li>
            <li> First of all, I ordered a package of 5 of these but only 4 came with my shipment.  Amazon was able to credit me for the missing one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews and thought i would love this product, but I found it difficult to apply.  Maybe I am doing something wrong? It is difficult to rub in.  I&#x27;ll stick with the kids lotion.</li>
            <li> kids prefer this rather than lotion on their faces.  tried others but like this one the best.  they don&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> Drop the mic, this is it. Best kids face sun block I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> ** The &amp;#34;Kids&amp;#34; version of this sunblock stick is the same as the &amp;#34;Sport&amp;#34;, and works just as well (waterproof, won&#x27;t sweat off). It&#x27;s just packaged differently and for whatever reason, costs a bit less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this sunblock to use on my lips and face on a vacation to the Caribbean. It worked very well protecting my lips, but has an artificial sweetener flavor, which I had no problem with but others may find unpleasant. My lips were not at all burned or chapped at the end of our vacation though my back and shoulders, where I wore SPF 50 sunblock lotion, did get slightly burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before we went on vacation, I tried this product on my face while going out jogging in the morning. It formed a slick greasy-feeling film on my face (imagine coating your face in chapstick). As I ran, sweat beaded and dripped from my face because of the oily water-repellant coating, and after my run I felt (and looked) disgusting. At least that shows it&#x27;s water resistant and won&#x27;t sweat off. Luckily, it did not make me break out and washed off easily with soap.</li>
            <li> great product, has protected my sons nicely/they use it on their face and arms!...thanks!</li>
            <li> Great alternative for kids who hate sunscreen lotion on their face.  Of course, it is difficult to get complete coverage as compared to lotion, but if you are careful it will work fine on your kids&#x27; face.  I prefer the shape of some competing, more expensive brands, but not enough to pay the premium.</li>
            <li> You do not have to be a kid to use this product.  I have been using this SPF50 sunscreen to protect my face and neck from wrinkles and fine lines when it is too sunny outside and so far it has been doing a good job and this tube will last you for good while.</li>
            <li> For kids much easier to apply and use over spray.  The lotions aren&#x27;t bad, but the stick is definitely easier to use</li>
            <li> Great deal....love the face sticks.  Kids can apply independently.</li>
            <li> These work well, and kids can apply by themselves to their faces.  Also, they&#x27;re small and would never spill or open, so they&#x27;re great to throw in your purse year round. Makes life easier.</li>
            <li> I love buying this product because my kids loves it, they don&#x27;t ran away when it&#x27;s time to put sunblock. They even do it themselves. I always have one in my purse, so anytime we go to the park I won&#x27;t have a problem about sunburn.... Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Banana Boat is a great sunscreen product.  These sticks are perfect for kids to keep in their athletic bags.  Price was right too.</li>
            <li> My 6-year-old daughter can use this sunscreen herself, and likes it.</li>
            <li> Was worried other reviews said they got product that was about to expire, but I checked mine and they were brand new and have a couple years until they expire.</li>
            <li> Time and conditions are good like the picture.&lt;br /&gt;This is a good product for care our childrens and the price is very good.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, great protection, great price.</li>
            <li> I really want to like this product, it goes on clear, easy to apply, messy free, except the sunblock I received are expired 2 years already!!!  I didn&#x27;t take a notice of the expired product when i put on my 3 and 4 years-old kids until I see they developed little rash on their face.  So disappointed about the seller, they should be more diligent about selling kids products</li>
            <li> The Banana Boat sticks make applying sunscreen to my 4-year and 15 month children&#x27;s faces so much easier!  No more shots at a moving target with the cream.  They hold still and don&#x27;t mind the application process now.  The sun coverage is also great.  My very pale son has not had a hint of a burn all summer.</li>
            <li> These are excellent!  They stay on for a very long time, and do NOT run down into eyes.</li>
            <li> This product allows me to have a sun block on my face that does not adversely affect my eyes. It is the only one that does not affect my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have to watch my lips in the sun, and find this stick to be the easiest to use while on the go...sometimes the taste seems unpleasant, but don&#x27;t know why....works great...D. Murray</li>
            <li> Fantastic Product!  We&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  Best sunscreen for children!</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen. I use it primarily for cycling because it&#x27;s easy to apply each time I stop for a break. Tastes good and doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes (even though I don&#x27;t put it above my eyes. Sweatproof or not, sunscreens end up in the eyes and mouth and it&#x27;s nice when it tastes sweet like this. Also, the base is waxy, protecting skin from wind.</li>
            <li> Banana Boat works because kids can and will put it on - the lotion stuff is too goopy and kids won&#x27;t use it. Teens find it will pass the not embarrassing test. ;-)</li>
            <li> Does not melt into eyes!! Getting a 5 pack is awesome. We use these on kids faces all summer long.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen ever.  My kids will use it and it doesn&#x27;t make their eyes sting when they sweat.</li>
            <li> The price is right, and the size is perfect. I bought this for my ten year old grandaughter that has a surgical scar on her face. She has to have sun protection all of the time. She has her skin care regieme from the surgeon, but after applying her daily regieme, she applies this to her face for added protection. It&#x27;s a great size, and she keeps it in her school backpack, and I carry on in my purse, and in my car for acessanility. The quantity is great too.</li>
            <li> The stick makes it so easy to reapply sunblock on my 3, 5 and 7 year old. It is also the perfect way to get the kids involved in keeping sunblock on their faces. We live in Florida and have a pool - having the sunblock sticks has made my 7 year old \\&quot;queen\\&quot; of keeping every one sunblocked. She even threw one in her bag today before she left for a long day outside. The price was also better than what I saw for individual ones at local stores.</li>
            <li> Ignore the fact its for \\&quot;Kids\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adults, this stuff works great. I bought the kids version for myself since its cheaper and this is the best stuff to use when you will have prolonged exposure to the sun and doing anything active (e.g. sweaty or in the water).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this while surfing and while doing manual labor work outside -- it is the only stuff that will stay on after being in the water for a few hours. Also, its so small you can take in your pocket while surfing (or wherever). Best part: you can still re-apply it while you are soaking went.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people may not like the texture (its like chap stick) but being protected from the sun whilst doing vigorous physical activities is important to me. I use it on my back and chest as well...just mush some on and spread it around with your fingers. It works much better than lotions.</li>
            <li> I used this while on a week long Motorcycle trip.  It stays on and doesn&#x27;t sweat off.  Quick to apply and doesn&#x27;t melt to liquid when left in a tank bag...even in 105 degree heat in the full sun.</li>
            <li> man for 2 years i been using cream sunscreen on my face as i drive all day in the sun and my face gets tore up. always a pain then I seen these sticks and man are they great! So easy to put on my face and 50 spf is really good.&lt;br /&gt;I tried Coppertone for Kids stick too and that stuff goes on thick and clogged my pores and made me feel funky and as if I had to sweat, these go on great and non greasy!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use. Kids tove it.</li>
            <li> great for little faces.  My 2 year old doesn&#x27;t mind having this applied to her face.  Can actually use as lip balm as well to keep lips from burning</li>
            <li> The stick works great but shipping was way too long for such a small pack.</li>
            <li> Awesome - no more spray near the face and the kids were good at reapplying it on themselves while away at day camp.  No more burnt faces!</li>
            <li> I love this presentation of the sunblock stick.  Its perfect to take everywhere... fits in any purse and it is always handy.</li>
            <li> i love this sunscreen, its perfect for my 4yr old daughter to apply to her face. its easy to use, doesn&#x27;t sweat off and run in the eyes. its perfect for outdoor sports and swimming.</li>
            <li> very practice, and useful, really works</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s relatively cheap in the pack of 4. Very well packaged. The stick like sunblock is easy to carry around.</li>
