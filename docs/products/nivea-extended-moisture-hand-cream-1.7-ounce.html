            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Great smell, leaves hands feeling smooth without greasy feel.</li>
            <li>That stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>It has a light, pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best hand lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Nivea helped more than a lot of the lotions out there that I have tried but the build up on the hands is unacceptable when your paralyzed in a chair.</li>
            <li>Makes stopping interesting</li>
            <li>Lightweight and not overly perfumed like many lotions.</li>
            <li>Makes hands nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>but since I&#x27;ve been applying it 3-4 times a day I felt like I needed something more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It does a pretty good job of moisturizing</li>
            <li>Love Nivea products - goes on smooth, and lasts for quite awhile.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent, rich moisturizer for very dry hands or feet.&lt;br /&gt;Great for gardeners.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li>Good moisture and pleasant scent (not strong).</li>
            <li>Great cream for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It is not at all greasy and seems to be absorbed into skin easily.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect small hand moisturizer to keep in my car!  </li>
            <li>It does leave a mild smell</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>I use it daily and love it!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s hard to squeeze out of the tube, it&#x27;s incredibly greasy, and it sometimes aggravates my excema on my hands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just finishing my first tube of this and it is my new favorite hand cream.</li>
            <li>Absorbs right into the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is now the only hand cream I use, so have to make sure I&#x27;ve always got spares</li>
            <li>It does feel a bit greasy when first put on, but this feeling dissipates after about 60 seconds.</li>
            <li>so maybe I used too much?  </li>
            <li>After letting it soak in for ten minutes or so, my hands were grease free.</li>
            <li>really like the feel..</li>
            <li>but most are more expensive, smell funny, or both.  </li>
            <li>amazing long lasting!!</li>
            <li>i first discovered this cream during a harsh winter where I noticed that my hands were becoming chapped and sore.</li>
            <li>The protection seems to last, even if you use mild soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I got a good deal on 3 of these, but overall I thought it was a bit of a thick cream and tends to be greasy.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hands hydrated all day long and rubs right in without feeling oily.</li>
            <li>If you are gardening, working with clay, or hand-washing constantly because you have small kids -- in other words, you have \\&quot;parents of newborn\\&quot; hands -- then this is a great solution.  </li>
            <li>Nowhere near as greasy as Palmer&#x27;s coconut cream, for example.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>There was a very noticable and fast improvement in winter redness and roughness with this cream that I have not experienced with the many other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>my skin was real dry and this has really helped it..</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is honestly such a great product - heavy enough to help heal dried out hands, but doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy afterwards (just be careful not to apply too much).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other lotions also don&#x27;t moisturize nearly as much as this brand.</li>
            <li>This hand cream is thick and rich, but not overly greasy.  </li>
            <li>This is the first hand creme that keeps my hands soft but doesn&#x27;t feel like a greasy oil slick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unbelievably thick, but it absorbs extremely quickly without being greasy.</li>
            <li>The winters here in the middle of Iowa can be pretty harsh, to the point that the skin on my knuckles will crack open, but just a small dab of this lotion before bed really does keep your hands soft for two days.</li>
            <li>but I can verify that one application does have very long lasting effects even with frequent hand washing.</li>

            <li> This hand cream is thick and rich, but not overly greasy.  It has a light, pleasant scent.  You will never find a better deal than this for 3!</li>
            <li> Great smell, leaves hands feeling smooth without greasy feel.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin on my hands. In the winter, my knuckles crack and bleed. This is the first hand creme that keeps my hands soft but doesn&#x27;t feel like a greasy oil slick.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hand lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s unbelievably thick, but it absorbs extremely quickly without being greasy.

            <li> This hand cream is really good!</li>
            <li> This lotion leaves your hands with a waxy feeling and it is a tiny tube. Two days after ordering a friend recommended okeefs working hands. That stuff is amazing. It was to late to stop the order and not worth the return. Nivea helped more than a lot of the lotions out there that I have tried but the build up on the hands is unacceptable when your paralyzed in a chair. Makes stopping interesting</li>
            <li> This is a great hand lotion. Lightweight and not overly perfumed like many lotions. Perfect for the purse!</li>
            <li> Love Nivea products - goes on smooth, and lasts for quite awhile.  Has a greasy feel to it so maybe I used too much?  It does help with the dryness.</li>
            <li> Not greasy. Works great. Great price.</li>
            <li> i first discovered this cream during a harsh winter where I noticed that my hands were becoming chapped and sore. After just a couple of uses, this cream had healed and moisturised like no other!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work with children so am constantly washing my hands, meaning of course that they are often quite dried out. I have tried so many different hand creams over the years and found myself having to use it hundreds of times a day just to avoid the painful drying out that occurs.&lt;br /&gt;This is the only hand cream I&#x27;ve had that only needs a couple of applications throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is honestly such a great product - heavy enough to help heal dried out hands, but doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy afterwards (just be careful not to apply too much).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is now the only hand cream I use, so have to make sure I&#x27;ve always got spares</li>
            <li> Great cream for dry skin.  However, this tube is hard to squeeze the cream out.  The cream is so thick it hurts my hands to squeeze it.  It now comes in a pump bottle.  That one is for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bye for now</li>
            <li> Best hand cream ever. Not greasy at all. Absorbs right into the skin. Makes hands nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I keep this tube in my purse to provide some moisture when I need it immediately.  Good moisture and pleasant scent (not strong).</li>
            <li> Other lotions usually tend to be too greasy for me. I really hate having greasy hands, so I was very pleased even I tried this product out. After letting it soak in for ten minutes or so, my hands were grease free. Other lotions also don&#x27;t moisturize nearly as much as this brand. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is the best hand creme I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just finishing my first tube of this and it is my new favorite hand cream. There was a very noticable and fast improvement in winter redness and roughness with this cream that I have not experienced with the many other brands I have tried. I&#x27;m not sure if it has the advertised 48 hour effects but I can verify that one application does have very long lasting effects even with frequent hand washing. It is not at all greasy and seems to be absorbed into skin easily. It definitely helps to protect my hands from the weather and keeps the redness and roughness from returning. I only wish it came in a larger size or maybe a pump bottle. It may be a little hard to get the last few drops out of the tube, but no different in this regard from others I have used. I&#x27;m sticking with this one. It&#x27;s nice to find something that works!</li>
            <li> very nice feel and not a greasey feeling..my skin was real dry and this has really helped it..I will use again..really like the feel..</li>
            <li> a great price on this hand cream - I love this hand cream by Nivea!</li>
            <li> It does a pretty good job of moisturizing but it&#x27;s hard to squeeze out of the tube, it&#x27;s incredibly greasy, and it sometimes aggravates my excema on my hands.</li>
            <li> I love the product, but it is difficult to get the lotion out of the container as alot of pressure is required.</li>
            <li> My hands always end up really dry while at work. I&#x27;ve been using the Body Shop&#x27;s Satsuma Puree but since I&#x27;ve been applying it 3-4 times a day I felt like I needed something more moisturizing. I decided to try Nivea&#x27;s Extended Moisture. It is so greasy I might as well have rubbed butter all over my hands.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect small hand moisturizer to keep in my car!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars, did not expect  48 hrs of moisture for that i give it 4 stars.  Its will be misleading for some people</li>
            <li> amazing long lasting!!</li>
            <li> Almost dropped my phone after applying this stuff. Seems to do what it advertises, but using a touchpad/touchscreen or holding anything slippery can be a challenge afterwards.</li>
            <li> I like the small size because I keep it either in my car or at my office desk. Leaves my hands hydrated all day long and rubs right in without feeling oily.</li>
            <li> I got a good deal on 3 of these, but overall I thought it was a bit of a thick cream and tends to be greasy. I definitely have to wait 5 mins for my hands to dry before I use my computer</li>
            <li> Hands stay soft and moisturized all through the brutal New England Winter.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific product, the only flaw of which is that it doesn&#x27;t (at least, not often) come in a larger container.  If you are gardening, working with clay, or hand-washing constantly because you have small kids -- in other words, you have \\&quot;parents of newborn\\&quot; hands -- then this is a great solution.  There are a few other products that work as well but most are more expensive, smell funny, or both.  This product:&lt;br /&gt;* Doesn&#x27;t smell bad or strongly. It&#x27;s almost neutral in odor.&lt;br /&gt;* Isn&#x27;t excessively greasy. It does feel a bit greasy when first put on, but this feeling dissipates after about 60 seconds. Nowhere near as greasy as Palmer&#x27;s coconut cream, for example.&lt;br /&gt;* Isn&#x27;t excessively hard to get out of the tube. Getting out the last little bit is a challenge (I have resorted to cutting the tube when it&#x27;s almost out) but for most of the tube, it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;* Lasts through several hand washings. The protection seems to last, even if you use mild soap.&lt;br /&gt;* Lasts for hours if you haven&#x27;t washed your hands.&lt;br /&gt;* Truly improves the condition of your hands, even sandpaper palms.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent, rich moisturizer for very dry hands or feet.&lt;br /&gt;Great for gardeners.&lt;br /&gt;Wish the tubes were larger.</li>
            <li> I use it daily and love it!</li>
