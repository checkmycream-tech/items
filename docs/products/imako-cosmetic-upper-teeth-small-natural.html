            <li>Great going to order another set I had to refit them a couple of times but very pleased.</li>
            <li>They are the best quick fix out there!</li>
            <li>My smile is awesome, and I am extremely happy with them.</li>
            <li>My remaining teeth are in good shape which made the imako teeth overkill.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li>If this product were fairly reviewed it would have 5 stars.</li>
            <li>We are in mail order catalogs, and the competition is not, for good reason.</li>
            <li>but it was for good reasons.</li>
            <li>Good temporary fix....</li>
            <li>Defiantly a good buy.</li>
            <li>but once they are fit they stay in perfectly!</li>
            <li>It seemed like a good idea but don&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li>I consider that a good sign as there have been no stares.  </li>
            <li>good product, buy the sealer.</li>
            <li>they do look good tho</li>
            <li>/&gt;You know how you&#x27;ll have the best smile?</li>
            <li>/&gt;You know how you&#x27;ll have the best smile?</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with them.  </li>
            <li>IMO great temporary solution until a more permanent fix can be had.</li>
            <li>Went right out into the world and had the best day ever.  </li>
            <li>I love it and am extremely satisfied!!</li>
            <li>The imako cosmetic teeth have been a great joy I like to smile now</li>
            <li>They look a bit phony, but way better than my teeth!</li>
            <li>If you purchase this product not having the expectation of veneers, you will be extremely pleased!</li>
            <li>Its more embarrasing to wear this!</li>
            <li>So glad I did!  </li>
            <li>Great looking easy to apply and wear.  </li>
            <li>They required some manipulation to get them to fit but were great for her considering her condition.</li>
            <li>It took me nine attempts to fit the teeth till I was happy.</li>
            <li>is amazing.</li>
            <li>I thought I would have to pay thousands of dollars but for a temporary fix amazing.</li>
            <li>these are really nice and they look rea.</li>
            <li>and so I can still use my own teeth to chew.  </li>
            <li>I liked</li>
            <li>, they just are to nice</li>
            <li>but I honestly can say that they did the job.  </li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t let that stop you from having a beautiful smile.</li>
            <li>I have always been told I have a &#x27;beautiful smile&#x27;</li>
            <li>it was very easy to make the tooth and for around $25.00 you can make yourself about 10 teeth</li>
            <li>very easy to put on and are a lot thinner</li>
            <li>without it they stain very easily.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the results!</li>
            <li>She said they were very comfortable and stayed in place nicely.</li>
            <li>it was nothing like they said and could not get it to fit right,do not buy this product not any good</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get a perfect fit the first time but</li>
            <li>Although I think this is a great product for people who need it, it wasn&#x27;t the right choice for me.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try these out because the reviews were good..</li>
            <li>Everyone else was just happy to see me smile. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So they do look nice, and they fit nice</li>
            <li>It just took a while to get them fitted and when he did they look perfect, I would recommend this if you do not have the money for major dental work A+++</li>
            <li>the good thing is you can get another chance until it&#x27;s right!</li>
            <li>These are too good to be true.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable</li>
            <li>because I knew compared to fixing at a dentist would cost way more...</li>
            <li>It sure beats.</li>
            <li>You will get used to them and be able to make a more informed judgment of the product.      </li>
            <li>Okay so here&#x27;s the scoop.</li>
            <li>will say that it took me about 11 to 12 times to get them fitting</li>
            <li>- I made 4 more teeth for back-ups ...</li>
            <li>I so wanted to love the Imako shell</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to find.  </li>
            <li>Have everything you need close at hand and fitting should go without a hitch.  </li>
            <li>I had some problems fitting it</li>
            <li>A great fast fix for an embarassing problem.</li>
            <li>I could not be any more pleased with purchasing the Imako teeth.</li>
            <li>My kids had a good laugh.  </li>
            <li>Okay in a pinch</li>
            <li>What better place?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It takes a bit of time and patience to do-it-yourself. :)&lt;</li>
            <li>I said BE PATIENT, I made sure to follow both the written and video instructions</li>
            <li>I dipped either one side or the top part in simmering water to re-loosen it and re-mold it.</li>
            <li>They do give you more than needed as it says, so I trimmed a bit off.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t believe I did it myself. :)</li>
            <li>Its just a strip that sits on top of teeth.</li>
            <li>Ok, I will do a top to bottom review.</li>
            <li>But it works for me; I feel more confidant in them and wish they made bottoms.</li>
            <li>Fitting is</li>
            <li>and I swear it looks better than these did.</li>
            <li>This should be more like $2.99 for Halloween.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>We are selling maybe 25 times as many units.</li>
            <li>Look at their YouTube fitting instructions where 13,000 people have watched, as opposed to over 312,000 have watched ours.</li>
            <li>They look okay, but closeup</li>
            <li>These are OK, if you are taking a picture ( alone)</li>
            <li>Just take your time and refit as many times as it takes.</li>
            <li>I love these teeth.</li>
            <li>and yet it&#x27;s not even able to be said to be the quality of costume teeth.</li>
            <li>They are ok just not something I would wear 24/7</li>
            <li>better off getting the cheaper one.</li>
            <li>I want to note I have all my top teeth removed</li>
            <li>and I love them</li>
            <li>I love my teeth</li>
            <li>It might be because I have been a customer of invisalign - which were considerably more bulky.  </li>
            <li>They are comfy and I feel a lot more happier about my teeth and appearance.</li>
            <li>and it is getting more and more challenging to find ways to talk to people while hiding my dilapidated grin,  </li>
            <li>They still turned out ok.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am pleased.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m in love with these.</li>
            <li>If you have any questions about them or want to see more photos text me @</li>
            <li>keeping that in mind and ignoring Imako&#x27;s claims you can remold them as many times as needed,  </li>
            <li>SO GLAD</li>
            <li>I will admit fitting</li>
            <li>have had many compliments from people asking when I had my teeth</li>
            <li>you will be able to adjust the Imakos</li>
            <li>Buying more.</li>
            <li>you can do it as many times as you need to</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; themselves looked comical, like something you&#x27;d wear on</li>
            <li>but once you get it youll love it plus you can refit it if needed</li>
            <li>From what she tells me it was very easy to fit to her mouth.</li>
            <li>That said, the teeth are really nice looking and easy to fit.</li>
            <li>They are easy to shape and form and very light to hold in your hand.</li>
            <li>Up close these will not fool anyone, but are great for normal conversation distances and pictures.</li>
            <li>This product has pretty good reviews, so I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend these but also advise that if you willing to do some tweaking then you will be very happy.</li>
            <li>I can smile again!!</li>
            <li>I can smile now!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d say these are worth the 40 bucks I paid for them for a great wedding pictures that I&#x27;m not afraid to share with my friends and</li>
            <li>they were ok, but stained very very quickly...</li>
            <li>Well after about 2 tries I got a perfect fit!</li>
            <li>I do not usually review items, but I had to let people know just how great these are.      </li>
            <li>they  hurt your mouth after awhile but makes my smile look better !</li>
            <li>I should be able to talk just fine.</li>
            <li>As for the fit, I&#x27;m going to try remolding them to my teeth again and see if I can get a better one as</li>
            <li>My bottom teeth are just now becoming brittle.</li>
            <li>My smile really does look beautiful now.  </li>
            <li>After receiving and fitting the Secure Smile I promptly threw them in the trash got online and wrote my honest opinion of them on their Amazon review page.</li>
            <li>They are good but discoloration is fast</li>
            <li>Got these for my daughter, she needed more teeth to really make a good fit.</li>
            <li>They look great and are far more comfortable then Dentures.</li>
            <li>I guess it is good, i really dont know</li>
            <li>The ladies all said I had a nice smile.</li>
            <li>I can say this would be good for Halloween, but to wear this like they are are real dentures....</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if these were going to work for me but was pleasantly surprised at how easy they were to fit and look great.</li>
            <li>I love my smile!</li>
            <li>The instructional video made it easy for me.</li>
            <li>There easy to form but fall apart and look dingy even after cleaning...</li>
            <li>I have been able to smile and love it .I</li>
            <li>Did you take the time out to really try and get a good fit in your mouth?</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say that now, at last, I can walk around in confidence and smile happily ...</li>
            <li>The confidence I got when first I smiled at someone</li>
            <li>They are very easy to fit and much more comfortable than the first set I purchased of another brand.</li>
            <li>a couple of times i started to eat with them in because i forgot i was wearing them , they are comfortable , easy in , easy out .</li>
            <li>They were easy to mold and fit</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m fine with it for now</li>
            <li>Once you get a fit they easily pop in and out.  </li>
            <li>They shipped quickly and I was pleased and knew what I was getting.</li>
            <li>It was not hard to do at all and the fit was good...</li>
            <li>Just a suggestion use the small size and get a couple of bags of the fitting beads for a perfect fit..</li>
            <li>Then  one day while shopping here on Amazon I realized you can buy practically anything on this site and usually really cheap............</li>
            <li>I remembered seeing something called a \\&quot;flip\\&quot; on one of the kid beauty pageant shows and decided to look and see if there was something available for adults.  </li>
            <li>Just fit them, wear them around for the day.  </li>
            <li>These are the best cosmetic substitute for missing teeth</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit well either.  </li>
            <li>They are also comfortable to wear.         </li>
            <li>Secure</li>
            <li>Gotta tweak &#x27;em a bit to fit your mouth</li>
            <li>They fit..</li>
            <li>to fit if you follow directions.</li>
            <li>They do look fabulous in pictures</li>
            <li>If you want to look like a cheap horse, it&#x27;s for you.</li>
            <li>You may get a lisp, and notice more saliva producing, but it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>and i got the smallest size available it stick out like horse teeth</li>
            <li>/&gt;You need to have simmering water in a pot, a snipping tool and it will probably take you a couple hours of work to make it fit</li>
            <li>I fit them with the melted beads,then I use Denture Adhesive to keep them in a bit tighter.</li>
            <li>Now I can smile without covering my mouth:-)</li>
            <li>You can see from the photo, they look great, especially for photos.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The gums are light but my lips covered them.</li>
            <li>but they fit comfterably</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t look like it was going to fit to my teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my smile, which has never happened before in my life.</li>
            <li>It will work if you need something fast so that you can attend a function and want nice looking teeth.</li>
            <li>Took me about 6 times to get fit</li>
            <li>This works, received them yesterday and it took about an hour to fit.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit and never stays in your mouth.</li>
            <li>are they comfortable?  </li>
            <li>I was so amazed at the fit and results.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fit and they make your lip stick out.</li>
            <li>But no where as many as secure smile.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s very important is to measure your teeth exactly as instructed on their site.</li>
            <li>They fit right and great for quick easy touch up for social events.</li>
            <li>Its just nice to be able  to have confidence in social situations again.</li>
            <li>Friendly customer service as well</li>
            <li>How fun!</li>
            <li>I was excited to get these before the weekend.</li>
            <li>The directions that are included for the product are not user friendly.</li>
            <li>At first my top lipped poked out and I felt</li>
            <li>But after several attempts I was successful.</li>
            <li>and I can laugh without covering my mouth!</li>
            <li>I can actually smile again and I can&#x27;t stop looking in the mirror at them!</li>
            <li>When you talk at first your speech is a litle lispy but it does get better.</li>
            <li>I should have paid more attention to the word &#x27;novelty&#x27; in the title because that is exactly what they ended up looking like.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was hoping for but it is okay.</li>
            <li>Looked clean, though.</li>
            <li>Neither the imakos or the secure smile look completely fabulous.</li>
            <li>I will be using this product until I can actually get my teeth fixed and perfect.</li>
            <li>This is my first using my Imako Teeth and pretty much loving them.</li>
            <li>When I first put them in, I smiled and started crying from joy.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to receive this product in the mail since I lost 2 teeth right in the front of my mouth with one tooth sticking out in the middle -</li>
            <li>not being able to pay the $$$ for dentures at this time , these are the best things i have found to substitute ,   highly recommend this product to anyone that can realize that they are not real teeth or real dentures , they are a decent , nicely done 40.00 cover up of bad/crooked teeth , thats all</li>
            <li>the first few times now it is just perfect.</li>
            <li>They came in the mail sooner then expected, so I was happy about that.</li>
            <li>So when I got it I wasn&#x27;t sure if they&#x27;d look real......</li>
            <li>Now I feel so much happier and confident.</li>
            <li>I purchased the cheaper Secure Smile before I purchased this product.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; color is best unless you have &amp;#34;Hollywood teeth,&amp;#34; and they are the thinnest, and therefore least noticeable on the market.  </li>
            <li>These cosmetic teeth look real and make me look 100% better as opposed to looking like a Jack-o-Lantern.</li>
            <li>Its a cool product.</li>
            <li>BETTER THAN MY NEIGHBORS REAL TEETH.</li>
            <li>Ok, I purchased both the Imako and the Secure Smile cosmetic teeth at the same time, because I was curious about which ones were best.</li>
            <li>Not a bad buy for the price.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.  </li>
            <li>It does take a time or two to get the fit just right, but as others have said, take your time and be patient.  </li>
            <li>The teeth wont be longer they&#x27;ll be wider so that when you smile they wont stop while your smile is still going!       </li>
            <li>I am happy with all my other purchases with Amazon and will continue to shop, but this company never again.</li>
            <li>They fit great and they look alot more natural than the other ones I ordered.</li>
            <li>After trying this for a quick fix I end up at the dentist anyway.</li>
            <li>my speech sounded funny at first but that goes away the more you wear them.</li>
            <li>It starts to stiffen just that quickly.</li>
            <li>The best thing about them is finally having photos were I am actually smiling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly and as described.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Imako smile for my daughter&#x27;s friend because she was embarrassed and asked for my help to get it to fit right.</li>
            <li>Please be more clear regarding sizing!!</li>
            <li>They were pretty easy to customize to my smile.</li>
            <li>I have next to no pallett and the teeth were cutable and fitablr to a point of great ease and resulted in a comfortable and natural look of confidence.</li>
            <li>so it would fit higher on my teeth.</li>
            <li>Once I got them to fit higher</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are many more things said by people that give me the idea that they have used the Instant smile teeth and are trying to adapt the instructions to</li>
            <li>Things that are worth it are not always quick and easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Things that are worth it are not always quick and easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The item was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Ive been told that you can&#x27;t really tell soooo if you are looking for a quick temp fix so for it!</li>
            <li>They come straight, they are not shaped or anything, that is fine, but I don&#x27;t think the instructions came in the description.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think sudden bright white teeth would have been believable even to myself.  </li>
            <li>Have molded fit several times and can&#x27;t get a comfortable and/or stable fit.</li>
            <li>I wanted to hide my imperfection not change my smile.  </li>
            <li>I know that several reviews are worded this way, but it&#x27;s an honest statement.</li>
            <li>and I tried the Imako smile on myself</li>
            <li>I really hope they can send me a good set of teeth as replacement for the ones I received that are obviously a Manafacture defect</li>
            <li>do you know I get compliments on my smile.</li>
            <li>but it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>Smile-</li>
            <li>she is embarrassed of your smile because after not taking care of them as a child/teenager and after 2 kids she has lots of cosmetic issues with her teeth which are getting pulled</li>
            <li>and she is getting them fixed but was hoping to give her confidence and feel better about herself,</li>
            <li>These  are perfect for anyone who has broken and rotten teeth.</li>
            <li>But it was well worth it.</li>
            <li>Working in customer service, as the district manager for a National restaurant chain, My smile is worth Millions...</li>
            <li>Totally worth it though...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to be as honest as I possibly can be here.</li>
            <li>I have read many reviews and am working on solutions to keep them a natural color.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised at how securely they did fit.  </li>
            <li>and I can smile and laugh now with out having to worry about my teeth.</li>
            <li>now that is worth the money</li>
            <li>I can finally smile again.</li>
            <li>I wish I knew how to put pictures on this review, so you can see the difference in my smile.  </li>
            <li>within the time it said and it was well worth the wait.  </li>
            <li>and if you watch the fitting video and then read/watch other youtube fitting videos</li>
            <li>These look like an avid smokers teeth very stained will try bleached next and see if that is more satisfying.</li>
            <li>These are great, but the first time I molded a set they came out a little wierd.  </li>
            <li>but you can keep melting the beads until you get it right ...</li>
            <li>right now they make me feel like I&#x27;m wearing a mouth guard.</li>
            <li>Mine arrived right on time.</li>
            <li>I have a cavity right between my two front teeth</li>
            <li>well they are right.</li>
            <li>will be just right</li>
            <li>I can even eat with these teeth when fitted right.</li>
            <li>but I got right to it and began to mold and shape my teeth.</li>
            <li>&quot; picture on the right of the page?</li>
            <li>&quot; picture on the right of the page?</li>
            <li>These were the right ones for me.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t look right at all.</li>
            <li>I will say, i DO buy a new set every 4-5 months, because after wearing them 7 days a week, 12 hours a day, they start to get stained very quickly.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t look real.. followed directions exactly and still didn&#x27;t fit correctly</li>
            <li>Good luck to you if you waste money on them and are looking for a quick fix</li>
            <li>The Secure Smile may fit people with a bigger mouth, but they were not the choice for</li>
            <li>I have 4 full teeth left on top and getting top dentures when I can pay for them but with these my smile is back.</li>
            <li>and they get back to you very quickly if you have a question!</li>
            <li>Just remember when you first get thy look like &amp;#34;that&#x27;s it&amp;#34; but once you play with and get right you won&#x27;t be feeling that way.</li>
            <li>i love the new product  the older version melted and smeared when you touched it.</li>
            <li>Definitely more for pics than for real life, every day wear if you want a natural appearance.</li>
            <li>I am going outside to the store and try on my smile :)</li>
            <li>Not a great fit but great in a pinch</li>
            <li>The gum area looks very natural and they are comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>Once they were fitted they did look very large in my mouth almost horsey like, so I took to them with my nail filer and shaved off a good few mm.</li>
            <li>Obviously, I want my wedding pictures to look as good as possible, so I was looking for a quick fix to wear just for my wedding</li>
            <li>beads aren&#x27;t meant to be sticky or hold in the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;The impressions you make of your own teeth while the shell is soft and hot, when hard again is what holds the shell in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;There is no need to use any kind of cream/paste or strip.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everyone tells me I am a pretty girl</li>
            <li>First of all, I could tell just by first glance that they weren&#x27;t going to be bulky.</li>
            <li>I would suggest reading the instructions thoroughly several times and going onto the Imako site and watching the fitting tutorial video.</li>
            <li>I needed a replacement because I lost mine, and they shipped them out fast!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, it&#x27;s pretty flimsy.</li>
            <li>First let me say  DO NOT LOOK FOR PERFECTION, YOU AREN&#x27;T GOING TO GET IT.</li>
            <li>and I really didn&#x27;t think they were going to work!</li>
            <li>Drinking sips of hot water will help loosen it if need be.</li>
            <li>First, they come in a package, with a before and after picture of what these teeth are supposed to do.</li>
            <li>(you have more than necessary).</li>
            <li>/&gt;4.Refresh hot water in bowl.</li>
            <li>well, I guess you really do get what you pay for!</li>
            <li>The adhesive did not roll out the way it was illustrated when placed in hot water.</li>
            <li>It is not as pliable in the mouth as when it comes out of the hot water.</li>
            <li>product is very well worth the price</li>
            <li>Love this product, it was a total lifesaver (and JOB saver) for me!</li>
            <li>they say hot water...</li>
            <li>I bought my first pair 2 months ago...</li>
            <li>Can only wear for about 1/2 an hour at the most.</li>
            <li>It has boosted my confidence level so much!</li>
            <li>Warped in the hot water, I&#x27;ll just go to my dentist and pay $1500.00 for a flipper.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no longer self-conscious and am looking forward to going out in public more.</li>
            <li>Will be funny to bring a woman home with her push up bra and spanks to hold it all in.</li>
            <li>it &#x27;a not even funny.</li>
            <li>but then they are ok for occasional use  </li>
            <li>Those teeth made by BillyBob or whatever were horribly big and kinda goofy looking...</li>
            <li>I have been smiling sooo much in my pics now!</li>
            <li>At first i was unsure about this product but after buying it and fiting it</li>
            <li>It took me two tries to fit them comfortably and correctly, but when I saw myself in the mirror, I was ecstatic.  </li>
            <li>After this they looked a lot better and actually looked like real teeth</li>
            <li>Temptooth on the other hand was a life (and smile) saver !!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to who ever feels ashamed of their smile.</li>
            <li>They were easy to work with however you may have to heat them up a few additional times and squish them to your teeth to get your desired fit just right.</li>
            <li>If you need more than a little bleaching and a tooth get these and smile all the time!</li>
            <li>When you have the cost of this garbage in your pocket and not wasted on finding out I was right after you read this review and thought; ah, she must be kidding!</li>
            <li>When you have the cost of this garbage in your pocket and not wasted on finding out I was right after you read this review and thought; ah, she must be kidding!</li>
            <li>When I purchased this I had been optimistic because of all of the positive reviews this product received.</li>
            <li>&quot; mouth above may be real but the one under it is not because this appliance isn&#x27;t capable of fitting that way.</li>
            <li>&quot; mouth above may be real but the one under it is not because this appliance isn&#x27;t capable of fitting that way.</li>
            <li>I am very self conscious (my wife says vain) and found I was becoming more of a recluse due to the condition of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>For right now, I will be wearing the Imakos, only because secure smile sticks out too far.</li>
            <li>but i should have gotten the large.  </li>
            <li>The stock picture they show here is for the size large.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have a lisp with these and even though I have a large overbite these don&#x27;t make</li>
            <li>so I couldn&#x27;t get a good fit, and even the small size was too big and my gums still hurt from being scraped.</li>
            <li>I bet you&#x27;re not smiling as much as you&#x27;d like to or should be.  </li>
            <li>If you are buying these expecting them to replace your real teeth</li>
            <li>anyway I think you would be so much happier to get the Temptooth ...</li>
            <li>Thanks and</li>
            <li>You could not tell it was not there real teeth.  </li>
            <li>Customer service was very understanding and refunded my money.  </li>
            <li>Very workable..  </li>
            <li>These things don&#x27;t work or look real at all, and what a rip off on the cost.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t look like your real teeth</li>
            <li>aparantley thinking that they would be a replacement for dentures and that some thought that they would not protrude farther than their real teeth</li>
            <li>not buck toothed , and do not protrude much farther at all than my real teeth .</li>
            <li>I tried getting them ready 2 days after receiving them,that didn&#x27;t work out to well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not wax, it&#x27;s a much sturdier</li>
            <li>I wanted to get an idea of what the real  &amp;#34;snap on smile&amp;#34; will be like before ordering it from the dentist..</li>
            <li>Gently support the position for TWO MINUTES and</li>
            <li>They look real and people I have asked if they look all say YES.</li>
            <li>but in PERSON, the fakeness is VERY noticeable.</li>
            <li>It took me several weeks reviewing and watching videos of the Imako teeth and the secure teeth before I settled on one.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m starting to get comfortable.</li>
            <li>My teeth are very brittle I inherited a gum disease.</li>
            <li>no adhesive can be applied that is going to hold it fast, nor prevent that adhesive from falling on your tongue after a bit.</li>
            <li>Not enough of the beads used to secure them.</li>
            <li>Too much work involved.  </li>
            <li>People tell me they look fairly real</li>
            <li>That caused a suction and it really holds.</li>
            <li>But, once that was actually accomplished.</li>
            <li>I dont know much about this.  </li>
            <li>up on the top where the pink is.  </li>
            <li>But does give he appearance of real teeth.</li>
            <li>The pink piece is for the top of the shell for comfort of your gums.</li>
            <li>so thus they look not as real.  </li>
            <li>ordered these straight from the Imako website</li>
            <li>could not get to work correctly and look real</li>
            <li>The imakos look just a tiny bit better than the secure smile only because I have a smaller mouth and imakos are a little  thinner than the secure smile.</li>
            <li>you just have to be really diligent about the fitting process and be careful to follow directions closely and not rush, so you get it right the first or second time.  </li>
            <li>A flat rubbery device formed into teeth and gums needs to worked on quite a bit before you can fit them on your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I REALLY wish secure smile would not put that shelf on the back of theirs and make them just a little thinner, because their color looks more natural and realistic than the imakos.</li>
            <li>The only thing is I have to put pretty hot water in my mouth and swish then suck hard to get a good suction that keeps them in place every time I wear them.</li>
            <li>Because there isn&#x27;t enough room for this tiny ridge to overlap your good available teeth as they are to anchor this appliance that is meant to fill that gap of missing one&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a YouTube video about this appliance that does not allow you to post comments without moderator approval.</li>
            <li>(I have redone mine 4 different times now and each time they fit a little better).  </li>
            <li>had a mouth full of white plastic ...</li>
            <li>Keep soft by dipping in hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the back of them with tooth paste and rinse each time to keep the mouthpiece sweet.</li>
            <li>Yes they are almost flat, and they don&#x27;t look as realistic as the Secure Smile teeth, but they do look real enough for pictures IMO, esp.</li>
            <li>I was lucky that I had the one tooth in the middle</li>
            <li>The natural color and the shape of the teeth matched well with my own and and didn&#x27;t have too stark of a contrast.</li>
            <li>They will yellow quite quickly if you smoke or chew tobacco.</li>
            <li>Okay, so when I open it, there is a white container that has a REDICULOUS sticker on it saying, &amp;#34;If found, please return to:&amp;#34; Why would I want someone to return these to me?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how it would fit with someone who has a full set of teeth</li>
            <li>an investment.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise this product, worthy of no star rating if the Amazon server system would allow it, is only going to make the manufacturer richer.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s be realistic..</li>
            <li>I have 5 kiddos and after my 2nd, my teeth started to deteriorate quickly.  </li>
            <li>It took me a couple tries to fit them in because I used wayyy too much plastic</li>
            <li>I think they def look realistic and so does my family.</li>
            <li>I have tried instant smile and Imako is much nicer.&lt;br /&gt;Extremely</li>
            <li>Despite following the instructions, reading many reviews, and watching the instructional video man times, these simply would not stay put.  </li>
            <li>I am missing, so I am very happy to have this to cover up the missing teeth!!</li>
            <li>My smile was totally different.. not bad, just different.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have high hopes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>They are easy to use compared to Secure Smile, but look patently fake.  </li>
            <li>If you want a little more confidence when speaking try this product.</li>
            <li>they looked a little better.</li>
            <li>Secure smile sticks out a little too far.</li>
            <li>(totally lowers your &amp;#34;eewww&amp;#34; factor), and as a temporary substitute, they sure beat the #@*&amp;!% out of a black hole in your face.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t keep reheating the plastic as it eventually just spreads out too much and ruins the fit.  </li>
            <li>Took me about 4 tries to get them to fit.</li>
            <li>teeth are natural in color and look very nice.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I actually did it wrong the first time, but I was able to refit them because the fitting material will remelt in \\&quot;simmering water\\&quot; as the instructions say.</li>
            <li>Even though it looks ok (size-wise) when you put it up against the teeth, it does not fit well at all.</li>
            <li>I love these as long as they are properly molded.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t state that if you had more than one or two missing teeth, it wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>My &#x27;temporary smile replacement&#x27; is now grinning somewhere in the bottom of the local landfill.</li>
            <li>My &#x27;temporary smile replacement&#x27; is now grinning somewhere in the bottom of the local landfill.</li>
            <li>do they know, my smile was actually purchased on Amazon.com!</li>
            <li>Looks hella better than a gaping hole from a missing tooth.</li>
            <li>to use the Instant Smile</li>
            <li>Instant smile tells you to do this.</li>
            <li>Until then, I&#x27;ll order a few more sets of Imako Cosmetics.</li>
            <li>Only complaint is they stin and discolor very easily and quickly</li>
            <li>It takes several tries to get the fit right.</li>
            <li>Well, it took about two hours of fiddling around with them to get it right, but my persistence paid off big time.</li>
            <li>Tried it several times, followed instructions and still couldn&#x27;t get it right.</li>
            <li>so if you have a wide smile you may want to get the large.  </li>
            <li>otherwise you cannot anchor your new tooth ...</li>
            <li>so im waiting to find a new dentist.</li>
            <li>We are going to a new duty station and these teeth will give me the confidence I need to meet people.</li>
            <li>so I purchased the imako natural colored teeth and they were easy to shape over my other teeth .Everyone</li>
            <li>There is no way to make these look real, PLEASE PLEASE save your money, I looked and followed the youtube video that was made by the maker and it looked possible to make it look real.</li>
            <li>Attach the pink spaghetti piece to the top edge of the back</li>
            <li>Maybe once a month we have an unhappy caller, but we can walk most of them through the fitting process.</li>
            <li>, so they do not stick out very far.</li>
            <li>very natural looking.</li>
            <li>It took a few tries to get the perfect mold and shape to my mouth and even now I keep going back looking in the mirror and finding minor things to adjust.</li>
            <li>To secure a little better I sometimes use a small amount of denture cream - gives me a little more confidence.  </li>
            <li>Get to a dentist and spend the money that will give you a proper corrected smile that will last and make your cost an investment.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise this product, worthy of no star rating if the Amazon server system would allow it, is only going to make the manufacturer richer.</li>
            <li>I know they say the small size fits most people</li>
            <li>so practice on the first one and the 2nd</li>
            <li>During my pregnancy, i developed a condition that started to tear thru my mouth and soften/broke almost all of my teeth!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s embarrassing and depressing to not be able to smile without wondering what people think of your teeth, but with my &amp;#34;new teeth&amp;#34; people always compliment my smile</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li>I will eventually go to &amp;#34;Snap-on Smile&amp;#34;, but I live on a fixed income and that may take awhile.</li>
            <li>Imakos are already thin, but are not as realistic looking as secure smile.    </li>
            <li>Let cool until back layer turns white.</li>
            <li>Public speaking, family functions, everything will be much improved for this small investement. :)</li>
            <li>Soften the chunk of pink plastic in a bowl of very hot water.</li>
            <li>Additionally, because the plastic spreads, you always have to remove excess plastic from the teeth portion (as it drips below the teeth or under them) and you inevitably lose more plastic which leaves less  plastic for molding capability.</li>
            <li>they look realistic and more natural and have natural color (not outragously white and the gums are not too pale.)                  </li>
            <li>If you have a regular or large size jaw it would work well for you.</li>
            <li>The teeth do not have a lot of shading in between, so they look like one large piece of white plastic covering my teeth from far away.    </li>
            <li>ok I did get some dental wax cause my gums weren&#x27;t used to something hard rubbing them.</li>
            <li>And if feels weird so that you won&#x27;t be comfortable wearing it if you do try to percevier and fit it in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It took me four tries to mold them for the proper fit in my mouth.</li>
            <li>My bite is clear from any of the product</li>
            <li>but I had such a harder time getting them to fit for some reason.  </li>
            <li>in case you lose, damage, or  stain it (clear nailpolish prevents this somewhat) and 2.</li>
            <li>but I feel any pros outweigh the cons by far..</li>
            <li>They look so natural.  </li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>this looks nothing like my old smile!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I was REALLY unsure as to what I was going to get after the laughable teeth that I received from Secure Smile.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the package with the Imako teeth today.</li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>I am a professional and NEED to look like it.</li>
            <li>they look natural.</li>
            <li>they do not look natural.</li>
            <li>I was surprised when this arrived.  </li>
            <li>I am 40 now and facing the facts that dentures are in my near</li>
            <li>When you begin the &#x27;molding&#x27; process it adamantly states do NOT leave them in your mouth for longer than 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s just because they are so usedto seeing me natural, that it gave them pause.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s face it, they are not a permanent solution and really should only be worn until something permanent is done.</li>
            <li>It looks so natural u can not tell they are cosmetic.</li>
            <li>The natural colored smalls are what I ordered.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>will be future ordering thanks</li>
            <li>direct go to press  on veeners</li>
            <li>It was more difficult to fit properly than the video shows, but the upside is...</li>
            <li>I thought of sending them back but just to much hassle.</li>
            <li>These are nice and thin, i have low lip when i smile so you cant see the gum part, they are different</li>
            <li>never had any intention of wearing these in public but definitely thought they would give me an idea of how snap on smile would look.</li>
            <li>ridge that&#x27;s on the back part of the top gum part that you see in the picture here is so narrow</li>
            <li>but it will surely work in the mean time.</li>
            <li>It stinks because so many drinks and foods cause staining and these things are very porous, so no way they are going to stay pristine white, no matter what you use to clean and protect.  </li>
            <li>they are very easy to prepare and fit , the look is natural enough that no one can tell that they are what they are , it sure looks better than a big gap in the teeth , being a smoker they do stain bad and fast , BUT , i did not do as instructions say and apply a clearcoat to stop this from happening as bad .</li>
            <li>The only other thing I can advise is to make sure the water is boiling hot and on hand for a few tries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This makes it virtually impossible to get them to fit whatsoever and mold properly to your own teeth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to look natural, but nowadays everyone bleaches their teeth, so the normal or acceptable appearance should be white.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s because, unlike here, all those dissatisfied customers will be able to forewarn potential buyers not to waste their money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously!</li>
            <li>Second pair the same exact thing happened</li>
            <li>I filed them down so much they disintegrated, just trying to make them not stick out so much.  </li>
            <li>If the condition of your teeth are a major concern and you can&#x27;t afford to have them fixed...</li>
            <li>I saw this product and decided even if it didn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;ve spent more and received less.  </li>
            <li>was not able to fit for use.</li>
            <li>ok for about 1 week then they are no good..</li>
            <li>it did take me about 4 tries at first</li>
            <li>have just added my actual before &amp; after picture above the reviews, using the large size</li>
            <li>For Imako the white beads are&lt;br /&gt;used to fill in the gaps for missing teeth to keep the shell from being weaker where a person has no teeth, and for no other purpose.&lt;br /&gt;Another person said that she placed the pink material on the back of her own teeth, which is where Instant smile says to put the white beads (actually they say to tuck</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a very small ridge behind the front gum of this product meant to overlap those remaining teeth that you have so as to secure this item, with bonding agent, so as to afford a full tooth smile.</li>
            <li>The teeth are so small they would only fit the mouth of a young child.  </li>
            <li>I have degenerative bone disease and a moderate calcium deficiency and because of these two issues, my teeth are pretty much shot and in a few months I&#x27;ll be getting dentures.  </li>
            <li>Due to a motorcycle accident I have 3 1/2 missing front teeth and anything would look better then gaps.</li>
            <li>I made mistakes of smooshing the mold compound too high on my front gum, and too low on my back two sides.</li>
            <li>When the back layer turns completely clear, pour off the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They do come out further than your natural teeth, but unless you have a problem closing your mouth over the teeth you have</li>
            <li>I wanted them, but once fitted they look natural enough for pictures.</li>
            <li>Gently rub through your lip to get the pink to lay against your gums.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve promised myself that this time next year I will have my teeth fixed bc as we know</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have insurance to get them fixed and have had really low self esteem ever since.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After I had fitted the Imakos and had them in my mouth, my upper lip stuck out noticeably far.  </li>
            <li>but anything is better tn than smili g with a broken front tooth</li>
            <li>cause they are white and my teeth are stained but for the price they are worth it and will get me by until i can afford to have a real partial made.</li>
            <li>I am missing the two teeth on either side of my front teeth and have always been embarrased to smile.</li>
            <li>I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical of these, but I ended up loving them.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;them up behind all of the top</li>
            <li>The cost was almost prohibitive (about $500 per tooth in front (X3) and still my smile would show missing teeth.  </li>
            <li>They do not look real in any way, shape or form (contrary to other reviews).  </li>
            <li>If you are willing to grind the shelf down and think you could thin them out a little bit, go for the secure smile.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping the fit would feel comfy, unfortunately, it did not.</li>
            <li>I had dismissed the negative reviews thinking that perhaps others didn&#x27;t spend the time to fit them properly.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a GREAT alternative to having a HORRIBLE smile.</li>
            <li>This product is far more expensive than costume teeth</li>
            <li>you had better not be planning to go anywhere where you&#x27;ll have to actually speak if you do try to keep this false teeth appliance in.</li>
            <li>Turn the Imako teeth upside down and briefly dip halfway into the hot water to make it receptive to bonding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This process is what took the longest and it wasn&#x27;t a easy process,the plastic is very hard to cut into.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Remarkably, I found that the people who are saying negative things about the Imako teeth are trying to fit them by following instructions given by the \\&quot;instant Smile\\&quot; company.&lt;br /&gt;Although they are saying that they followed the instructions Imako gave them to the letter \\&quot;T\\</li>
            <li>I did have to re-submerge in hot water a few times to adjust and re-adjust</li>
            <li>Like someone else said, if you&#x27;re missing more than a few teeth, ESPECIALLY front teeth, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li>I spent hours trying to get the right fit and failed.</li>
            <li>They stuck out too far, weren&#x27;t wide enough to cover the teeth near the back and were rather rigid.  </li>
            <li>Remember, this is NOT a therapeutic device--that&#x27;s why they have to call it &amp;#34;novelty.&amp;#34;  They may not rival good dentures in appearance, but they cost a LOT less, you won&#x27;t scare off the faint of heart</li>
            <li>30 dollars, it&#x27;s too much work for little gain.  </li>
            <li>Please, listen to the bad reviews here and not the good ones...</li>

            <li> My smile is awesome, and I am extremely happy with them.</li>
            <li> My remaining teeth are in good shape which made the imako teeth overkill.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> If this product were fairly reviewed it would have 5 stars.</li>
            <li> We are in mail order catalogs, and the competition is not, for good reason.</li>
            <li> but it was for good reasons.</li>
            <li> Good temporary fix....</li>
            <li> Defiantly a good buy.</li>
            <li> but once they are fit they stay in perfectly!</li>
            <li> It seemed like a good idea but don&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> I consider that a good sign as there have been no stares.  </li>
            <li> good product, buy the sealer.</li>
            <li> they do look good tho</li>
            <li> /&gt;You know how you&#x27;ll have the best smile?</li>
            <li> /&gt;You know how you&#x27;ll have the best smile?</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with them.  </li>
            <li> IMO great temporary solution until a more permanent fix can be had.</li>
            <li> Went right out into the world and had the best day ever.  </li>
            <li> I love it and am extremely satisfied!!</li>
            <li> The imako cosmetic teeth have been a great joy I like to smile now</li>
            <li> They look a bit phony, but way better than my teeth!</li>
            <li> If you purchase this product not having the expectation of veneers, you will be extremely pleased!</li>
            <li> Its more embarrasing to wear this!</li>
            <li> So glad I did!  </li>
            <li> Great looking easy to apply and wear.  </li>
            <li> They required some manipulation to get them to fit but were great for her considering her condition.</li>
            <li> It took me nine attempts to fit the teeth till I was happy.</li>
            <li> is amazing.</li>
            <li> I thought I would have to pay thousands of dollars but for a temporary fix amazing.</li>
            <li> these are really nice and they look rea.</li>
            <li> and so I can still use my own teeth to chew.  </li>
            <li> I liked</li>
            <li> , they just are to nice</li>
            <li> but I honestly can say that they did the job.  </li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t let that stop you from having a beautiful smile.</li>
            <li> I have always been told I have a &#x27;beautiful smile&#x27;</li>
            <li> it was very easy to make the tooth and for around $25.00 you can make yourself about 10 teeth</li>
            <li> very easy to put on and are a lot thinner</li>
            <li> without it they stain very easily.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the results!</li>
            <li> She said they were very comfortable and stayed in place nicely.</li>
            <li> it was nothing like they said and could not get it to fit right,do not buy this product not any good</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get a perfect fit the first time but</li>
            <li> Although I think this is a great product for people who need it, it wasn&#x27;t the right choice for me.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to try these out because the reviews were good..</li>
            <li> Everyone else was just happy to see me smile. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So they do look nice, and they fit nice</li>
            <li> It just took a while to get them fitted and when he did they look perfect, I would recommend this if you do not have the money for major dental work A+++</li>
            <li> the good thing is you can get another chance until it&#x27;s right!</li>
            <li> These are too good to be true.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable</li>
            <li> because I knew compared to fixing at a dentist would cost way more...</li>
            <li> It sure beats.</li>
            <li> You will get used to them and be able to make a more informed judgment of the product.      </li>
            <li> Okay so here&#x27;s the scoop.</li>
            <li> will say that it took me about 11 to 12 times to get them fitting</li>
            <li> - I made 4 more teeth for back-ups ...</li>
            <li> I so wanted to love the Imako shell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to find.  </li>
            <li> Have everything you need close at hand and fitting should go without a hitch.  </li>
            <li> I had some problems fitting it</li>
            <li> A great fast fix for an embarassing problem.</li>
            <li> I could not be any more pleased with purchasing the Imako teeth.</li>
            <li> My kids had a good laugh.  </li>
            <li> Okay in a pinch</li>
            <li> What better place?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes a bit of time and patience to do-it-yourself. :)&lt;</li>
            <li> I said BE PATIENT, I made sure to follow both the written and video instructions</li>
            <li> I dipped either one side or the top part in simmering water to re-loosen it and re-mold it.</li>
            <li> They do give you more than needed as it says, so I trimmed a bit off.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe I did it myself. :)</li>
            <li> Its just a strip that sits on top of teeth.</li>
            <li> Ok, I will do a top to bottom review.</li>
            <li> But it works for me; I feel more confidant in them and wish they made bottoms.</li>
            <li> Fitting is</li>
            <li> and I swear it looks better than these did.</li>
            <li> This should be more like $2.99 for Halloween.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> We are selling maybe 25 times as many units.</li>
            <li> Look at their YouTube fitting instructions where 13,000 people have watched, as opposed to over 312,000 have watched ours.</li>
            <li> They look okay, but closeup</li>
            <li> These are OK, if you are taking a picture ( alone)</li>
            <li> Just take your time and refit as many times as it takes.</li>
            <li> I love these teeth.</li>
            <li> and yet it&#x27;s not even able to be said to be the quality of costume teeth.</li>
            <li> They are ok just not something I would wear 24/7</li>
            <li> better off getting the cheaper one.</li>
            <li> I want to note I have all my top teeth removed</li>
            <li> and I love them</li>
            <li> I love my teeth</li>
            <li> It might be because I have been a customer of invisalign - which were considerably more bulky.  </li>
            <li> They are comfy and I feel a lot more happier about my teeth and appearance.</li>
            <li> and it is getting more and more challenging to find ways to talk to people while hiding my dilapidated grin,  </li>
            <li> They still turned out ok.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am pleased.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m in love with these.</li>
            <li> If you have any questions about them or want to see more photos text me @</li>
            <li> keeping that in mind and ignoring Imako&#x27;s claims you can remold them as many times as needed,  </li>
            <li> SO GLAD</li>
            <li> I will admit fitting</li>
            <li> have had many compliments from people asking when I had my teeth</li>
            <li> you will be able to adjust the Imakos</li>
            <li> Buying more.</li>
            <li> you can do it as many times as you need to</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; themselves looked comical, like something you&#x27;d wear on</li>
            <li> but once you get it youll love it plus you can refit it if needed</li>
            <li> From what she tells me it was very easy to fit to her mouth.</li>
            <li> That said, the teeth are really nice looking and easy to fit.</li>
            <li> They are easy to shape and form and very light to hold in your hand.</li>
            <li> Up close these will not fool anyone, but are great for normal conversation distances and pictures.</li>
            <li> This product has pretty good reviews, so I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend these but also advise that if you willing to do some tweaking then you will be very happy.</li>
            <li> I can smile again!!</li>
            <li> I can smile now!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d say these are worth the 40 bucks I paid for them for a great wedding pictures that I&#x27;m not afraid to share with my friends and</li>
            <li> they were ok, but stained very very quickly...</li>
            <li> Well after about 2 tries I got a perfect fit!</li>
            <li> I do not usually review items, but I had to let people know just how great these are.      </li>
            <li> they  hurt your mouth after awhile but makes my smile look better !</li>
            <li> I should be able to talk just fine.</li>
            <li> As for the fit, I&#x27;m going to try remolding them to my teeth again and see if I can get a better one as</li>
            <li> My bottom teeth are just now becoming brittle.</li>
            <li> My smile really does look beautiful now.  </li>
            <li> After receiving and fitting the Secure Smile I promptly threw them in the trash got online and wrote my honest opinion of them on their Amazon review page.</li>
            <li> They are good but discoloration is fast</li>
            <li> Got these for my daughter, she needed more teeth to really make a good fit.</li>
            <li> They look great and are far more comfortable then Dentures.</li>
            <li> I guess it is good, i really dont know</li>
            <li> The ladies all said I had a nice smile.</li>
            <li> I can say this would be good for Halloween, but to wear this like they are are real dentures....</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if these were going to work for me but was pleasantly surprised at how easy they were to fit and look great.</li>
            <li> I love my smile!</li>
            <li> The instructional video made it easy for me.</li>
            <li> There easy to form but fall apart and look dingy even after cleaning...</li>
            <li> I have been able to smile and love it .I</li>
            <li> Did you take the time out to really try and get a good fit in your mouth?</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say that now, at last, I can walk around in confidence and smile happily ...</li>
            <li> The confidence I got when first I smiled at someone</li>
            <li> They are very easy to fit and much more comfortable than the first set I purchased of another brand.</li>
            <li> a couple of times i started to eat with them in because i forgot i was wearing them , they are comfortable , easy in , easy out .</li>
            <li> They were easy to mold and fit</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m fine with it for now</li>
            <li> Once you get a fit they easily pop in and out.  </li>
            <li> They shipped quickly and I was pleased and knew what I was getting.</li>
            <li> It was not hard to do at all and the fit was good...</li>
            <li> Just a suggestion use the small size and get a couple of bags of the fitting beads for a perfect fit..</li>
            <li> Then  one day while shopping here on Amazon I realized you can buy practically anything on this site and usually really cheap............</li>
            <li> I remembered seeing something called a \\&quot;flip\\&quot; on one of the kid beauty pageant shows and decided to look and see if there was something available for adults.  </li>
            <li> Just fit them, wear them around for the day.  </li>
            <li> These are the best cosmetic substitute for missing teeth</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit well either.  </li>
            <li> They are also comfortable to wear.         </li>
            <li> Secure</li>
            <li> Gotta tweak &#x27;em a bit to fit your mouth</li>
            <li> They fit..</li>
            <li> to fit if you follow directions.</li>
            <li> They do look fabulous in pictures</li>
            <li> If you want to look like a cheap horse, it&#x27;s for you.</li>
            <li> You may get a lisp, and notice more saliva producing, but it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> and i got the smallest size available it stick out like horse teeth</li>
            <li> /&gt;You need to have simmering water in a pot, a snipping tool and it will probably take you a couple hours of work to make it fit</li>
            <li> I fit them with the melted beads,then I use Denture Adhesive to keep them in a bit tighter.</li>
            <li> Now I can smile without covering my mouth:-)</li>
            <li> You can see from the photo, they look great, especially for photos.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The gums are light but my lips covered them.</li>
            <li> but they fit comfterably</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t look like it was going to fit to my teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my smile, which has never happened before in my life.</li>
            <li> It will work if you need something fast so that you can attend a function and want nice looking teeth.</li>
            <li> Took me about 6 times to get fit</li>
            <li> This works, received them yesterday and it took about an hour to fit.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit and never stays in your mouth.</li>
            <li> are they comfortable?  </li>
            <li> I was so amazed at the fit and results.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fit and they make your lip stick out.</li>
            <li> But no where as many as secure smile.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s very important is to measure your teeth exactly as instructed on their site.</li>
            <li> They fit right and great for quick easy touch up for social events.</li>
            <li> Its just nice to be able  to have confidence in social situations again.</li>
            <li> Friendly customer service as well</li>
            <li> How fun!</li>
            <li> I was excited to get these before the weekend.</li>
            <li> The directions that are included for the product are not user friendly.</li>
            <li> At first my top lipped poked out and I felt</li>
            <li> But after several attempts I was successful.</li>
            <li> and I can laugh without covering my mouth!</li>
            <li> I can actually smile again and I can&#x27;t stop looking in the mirror at them!</li>
            <li> When you talk at first your speech is a litle lispy but it does get better.</li>
            <li> I should have paid more attention to the word &#x27;novelty&#x27; in the title because that is exactly what they ended up looking like.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was hoping for but it is okay.</li>
            <li> Looked clean, though.</li>
            <li> Neither the imakos or the secure smile look completely fabulous.</li>
            <li> I will be using this product until I can actually get my teeth fixed and perfect.</li>
            <li> This is my first using my Imako Teeth and pretty much loving them.</li>
            <li> When I first put them in, I smiled and started crying from joy.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to receive this product in the mail since I lost 2 teeth right in the front of my mouth with one tooth sticking out in the middle -</li>
            <li> not being able to pay the $$$ for dentures at this time , these are the best things i have found to substitute ,   highly recommend this product to anyone that can realize that they are not real teeth or real dentures , they are a decent , nicely done 40.00 cover up of bad/crooked teeth , thats all</li>
            <li> the first few times now it is just perfect.</li>
            <li> They came in the mail sooner then expected, so I was happy about that.</li>
            <li> So when I got it I wasn&#x27;t sure if they&#x27;d look real......</li>
            <li> Now I feel so much happier and confident.</li>
            <li> I purchased the cheaper Secure Smile before I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; color is best unless you have &amp;#34;Hollywood teeth,&amp;#34; and they are the thinnest, and therefore least noticeable on the market.  </li>
            <li> These cosmetic teeth look real and make me look 100% better as opposed to looking like a Jack-o-Lantern.</li>
            <li> Its a cool product.</li>
            <li> BETTER THAN MY NEIGHBORS REAL TEETH.</li>
            <li> Ok, I purchased both the Imako and the Secure Smile cosmetic teeth at the same time, because I was curious about which ones were best.</li>
            <li> Not a bad buy for the price.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price.  </li>
            <li> It does take a time or two to get the fit just right, but as others have said, take your time and be patient.  </li>
            <li> The teeth wont be longer they&#x27;ll be wider so that when you smile they wont stop while your smile is still going!       </li>
            <li> I am happy with all my other purchases with Amazon and will continue to shop, but this company never again.</li>
            <li> They fit great and they look alot more natural than the other ones I ordered.</li>
            <li> After trying this for a quick fix I end up at the dentist anyway.</li>
            <li> my speech sounded funny at first but that goes away the more you wear them.</li>
            <li> It starts to stiffen just that quickly.</li>
            <li> The best thing about them is finally having photos were I am actually smiling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They arrived quickly and as described.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Imako smile for my daughter&#x27;s friend because she was embarrassed and asked for my help to get it to fit right.</li>
            <li> Please be more clear regarding sizing!!</li>
            <li> They were pretty easy to customize to my smile.</li>
            <li> I have next to no pallett and the teeth were cutable and fitablr to a point of great ease and resulted in a comfortable and natural look of confidence.</li>
            <li> so it would fit higher on my teeth.</li>
            <li> Once I got them to fit higher</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are many more things said by people that give me the idea that they have used the Instant smile teeth and are trying to adapt the instructions to</li>
            <li> Things that are worth it are not always quick and easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Things that are worth it are not always quick and easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The item was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Ive been told that you can&#x27;t really tell soooo if you are looking for a quick temp fix so for it!</li>
            <li> They come straight, they are not shaped or anything, that is fine, but I don&#x27;t think the instructions came in the description.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think sudden bright white teeth would have been believable even to myself.  </li>
            <li> Have molded fit several times and can&#x27;t get a comfortable and/or stable fit.</li>
            <li> I wanted to hide my imperfection not change my smile.  </li>
            <li> I know that several reviews are worded this way, but it&#x27;s an honest statement.</li>
            <li> and I tried the Imako smile on myself</li>
            <li> I really hope they can send me a good set of teeth as replacement for the ones I received that are obviously a Manafacture defect</li>
            <li> do you know I get compliments on my smile.</li>
            <li> but it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Smile-</li>
            <li> she is embarrassed of your smile because after not taking care of them as a child/teenager and after 2 kids she has lots of cosmetic issues with her teeth which are getting pulled</li>
            <li> and she is getting them fixed but was hoping to give her confidence and feel better about herself,</li>
            <li> These  are perfect for anyone who has broken and rotten teeth.</li>
            <li> But it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> Working in customer service, as the district manager for a National restaurant chain, My smile is worth Millions...</li>
            <li> Totally worth it though...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be as honest as I possibly can be here.</li>
            <li> I have read many reviews and am working on solutions to keep them a natural color.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised at how securely they did fit.  </li>
            <li> and I can smile and laugh now with out having to worry about my teeth.</li>
            <li> now that is worth the money</li>
            <li> I can finally smile again.</li>
            <li> I wish I knew how to put pictures on this review, so you can see the difference in my smile.  </li>
            <li> within the time it said and it was well worth the wait.  </li>
            <li> and if you watch the fitting video and then read/watch other youtube fitting videos</li>
            <li> These look like an avid smokers teeth very stained will try bleached next and see if that is more satisfying.</li>
            <li> These are great, but the first time I molded a set they came out a little wierd.  </li>
            <li> but you can keep melting the beads until you get it right ...</li>
            <li> right now they make me feel like I&#x27;m wearing a mouth guard.</li>
            <li> Mine arrived right on time.</li>
            <li> I have a cavity right between my two front teeth</li>
            <li> well they are right.</li>
            <li> will be just right</li>
            <li> I can even eat with these teeth when fitted right.</li>
            <li> but I got right to it and began to mold and shape my teeth.</li>
            <li> &quot; picture on the right of the page?</li>
            <li> &quot; picture on the right of the page?</li>
            <li> These were the right ones for me.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t look right at all.</li>
            <li> I will say, i DO buy a new set every 4-5 months, because after wearing them 7 days a week, 12 hours a day, they start to get stained very quickly.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t look real.. followed directions exactly and still didn&#x27;t fit correctly</li>
            <li> Good luck to you if you waste money on them and are looking for a quick fix</li>
            <li> The Secure Smile may fit people with a bigger mouth, but they were not the choice for</li>
            <li> I have 4 full teeth left on top and getting top dentures when I can pay for them but with these my smile is back.</li>
            <li> and they get back to you very quickly if you have a question!</li>
            <li> Just remember when you first get thy look like &amp;#34;that&#x27;s it&amp;#34; but once you play with and get right you won&#x27;t be feeling that way.</li>
            <li> i love the new product  the older version melted and smeared when you touched it.</li>
            <li> Definitely more for pics than for real life, every day wear if you want a natural appearance.</li>
            <li> I am going outside to the store and try on my smile :)</li>
            <li> Not a great fit but great in a pinch</li>
            <li> The gum area looks very natural and they are comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> Once they were fitted they did look very large in my mouth almost horsey like, so I took to them with my nail filer and shaved off a good few mm.</li>
            <li> Obviously, I want my wedding pictures to look as good as possible, so I was looking for a quick fix to wear just for my wedding</li>
            <li> beads aren&#x27;t meant to be sticky or hold in the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;The impressions you make of your own teeth while the shell is soft and hot, when hard again is what holds the shell in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;There is no need to use any kind of cream/paste or strip.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everyone tells me I am a pretty girl</li>
            <li> First of all, I could tell just by first glance that they weren&#x27;t going to be bulky.</li>
            <li> I would suggest reading the instructions thoroughly several times and going onto the Imako site and watching the fitting tutorial video.</li>
            <li> I needed a replacement because I lost mine, and they shipped them out fast!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, it&#x27;s pretty flimsy.</li>
            <li> First let me say  DO NOT LOOK FOR PERFECTION, YOU AREN&#x27;T GOING TO GET IT.</li>
            <li> and I really didn&#x27;t think they were going to work!</li>
            <li> Drinking sips of hot water will help loosen it if need be.</li>
            <li> First, they come in a package, with a before and after picture of what these teeth are supposed to do.</li>
            <li> (you have more than necessary).</li>
            <li> /&gt;4.Refresh hot water in bowl.</li>
            <li> well, I guess you really do get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> The adhesive did not roll out the way it was illustrated when placed in hot water.</li>
            <li> It is not as pliable in the mouth as when it comes out of the hot water.</li>
            <li> product is very well worth the price</li>
            <li> Love this product, it was a total lifesaver (and JOB saver) for me!</li>
            <li> they say hot water...</li>
            <li> I bought my first pair 2 months ago...</li>
            <li> Can only wear for about 1/2 an hour at the most.</li>
            <li> It has boosted my confidence level so much!</li>
            <li> Warped in the hot water, I&#x27;ll just go to my dentist and pay $1500.00 for a flipper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no longer self-conscious and am looking forward to going out in public more.</li>
            <li> Will be funny to bring a woman home with her push up bra and spanks to hold it all in.</li>
            <li> it &#x27;a not even funny.</li>
            <li> but then they are ok for occasional use  </li>
            <li> Those teeth made by BillyBob or whatever were horribly big and kinda goofy looking...</li>
            <li> I have been smiling sooo much in my pics now!</li>
            <li> At first i was unsure about this product but after buying it and fiting it</li>
            <li> It took me two tries to fit them comfortably and correctly, but when I saw myself in the mirror, I was ecstatic.  </li>
            <li> After this they looked a lot better and actually looked like real teeth</li>
            <li> Temptooth on the other hand was a life (and smile) saver !!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to who ever feels ashamed of their smile.</li>
            <li> They were easy to work with however you may have to heat them up a few additional times and squish them to your teeth to get your desired fit just right.</li>
            <li> If you need more than a little bleaching and a tooth get these and smile all the time!</li>
            <li> When you have the cost of this garbage in your pocket and not wasted on finding out I was right after you read this review and thought; ah, she must be kidding!</li>
            <li> When you have the cost of this garbage in your pocket and not wasted on finding out I was right after you read this review and thought; ah, she must be kidding!</li>
            <li> When I purchased this I had been optimistic because of all of the positive reviews this product received.</li>
            <li> &quot; mouth above may be real but the one under it is not because this appliance isn&#x27;t capable of fitting that way.</li>
            <li> &quot; mouth above may be real but the one under it is not because this appliance isn&#x27;t capable of fitting that way.</li>
            <li> I am very self conscious (my wife says vain) and found I was becoming more of a recluse due to the condition of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> For right now, I will be wearing the Imakos, only because secure smile sticks out too far.</li>
            <li> but i should have gotten the large.  </li>
            <li> The stock picture they show here is for the size large.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have a lisp with these and even though I have a large overbite these don&#x27;t make</li>
            <li> so I couldn&#x27;t get a good fit, and even the small size was too big and my gums still hurt from being scraped.</li>
            <li> I bet you&#x27;re not smiling as much as you&#x27;d like to or should be.  </li>
            <li> If you are buying these expecting them to replace your real teeth</li>
            <li> anyway I think you would be so much happier to get the Temptooth ...</li>
            <li> Thanks and</li>
            <li> You could not tell it was not there real teeth.  </li>
            <li> Customer service was very understanding and refunded my money.  </li>
            <li> Very workable..  </li>
            <li> These things don&#x27;t work or look real at all, and what a rip off on the cost.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t look like your real teeth</li>
            <li> aparantley thinking that they would be a replacement for dentures and that some thought that they would not protrude farther than their real teeth</li>
            <li> not buck toothed , and do not protrude much farther at all than my real teeth .</li>
            <li> I tried getting them ready 2 days after receiving them,that didn&#x27;t work out to well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not wax, it&#x27;s a much sturdier</li>
            <li> I wanted to get an idea of what the real  &amp;#34;snap on smile&amp;#34; will be like before ordering it from the dentist..</li>
            <li> Gently support the position for TWO MINUTES and</li>
            <li> They look real and people I have asked if they look all say YES.</li>
            <li> but in PERSON, the fakeness is VERY noticeable.</li>
            <li> It took me several weeks reviewing and watching videos of the Imako teeth and the secure teeth before I settled on one.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m starting to get comfortable.</li>
            <li> My teeth are very brittle I inherited a gum disease.</li>
            <li> no adhesive can be applied that is going to hold it fast, nor prevent that adhesive from falling on your tongue after a bit.</li>
            <li> Not enough of the beads used to secure them.</li>
            <li> Too much work involved.  </li>
            <li> People tell me they look fairly real</li>
            <li> That caused a suction and it really holds.</li>
            <li> But, once that was actually accomplished.</li>
            <li> I dont know much about this.  </li>
            <li> up on the top where the pink is.  </li>
            <li> But does give he appearance of real teeth.</li>
            <li> The pink piece is for the top of the shell for comfort of your gums.</li>
            <li> so thus they look not as real.  </li>
            <li> ordered these straight from the Imako website</li>
            <li> could not get to work correctly and look real</li>
            <li> The imakos look just a tiny bit better than the secure smile only because I have a smaller mouth and imakos are a little  thinner than the secure smile.</li>
            <li> you just have to be really diligent about the fitting process and be careful to follow directions closely and not rush, so you get it right the first or second time.  </li>
            <li> A flat rubbery device formed into teeth and gums needs to worked on quite a bit before you can fit them on your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I REALLY wish secure smile would not put that shelf on the back of theirs and make them just a little thinner, because their color looks more natural and realistic than the imakos.</li>
            <li> The only thing is I have to put pretty hot water in my mouth and swish then suck hard to get a good suction that keeps them in place every time I wear them.</li>
            <li> Because there isn&#x27;t enough room for this tiny ridge to overlap your good available teeth as they are to anchor this appliance that is meant to fill that gap of missing one&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a YouTube video about this appliance that does not allow you to post comments without moderator approval.</li>
            <li> (I have redone mine 4 different times now and each time they fit a little better).  </li>
            <li> had a mouth full of white plastic ...</li>
            <li> Keep soft by dipping in hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the back of them with tooth paste and rinse each time to keep the mouthpiece sweet.</li>
            <li> Yes they are almost flat, and they don&#x27;t look as realistic as the Secure Smile teeth, but they do look real enough for pictures IMO, esp.</li>
            <li> I was lucky that I had the one tooth in the middle</li>
            <li> The natural color and the shape of the teeth matched well with my own and and didn&#x27;t have too stark of a contrast.</li>
            <li> They will yellow quite quickly if you smoke or chew tobacco.</li>
            <li> Okay, so when I open it, there is a white container that has a REDICULOUS sticker on it saying, &amp;#34;If found, please return to:&amp;#34; Why would I want someone to return these to me?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it would fit with someone who has a full set of teeth</li>
            <li> an investment.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise this product, worthy of no star rating if the Amazon server system would allow it, is only going to make the manufacturer richer.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be realistic..</li>
            <li> I have 5 kiddos and after my 2nd, my teeth started to deteriorate quickly.  </li>
            <li> It took me a couple tries to fit them in because I used wayyy too much plastic</li>
            <li> I think they def look realistic and so does my family.</li>
            <li> I have tried instant smile and Imako is much nicer.&lt;br /&gt;Extremely</li>
            <li> Despite following the instructions, reading many reviews, and watching the instructional video man times, these simply would not stay put.  </li>
            <li> I am missing, so I am very happy to have this to cover up the missing teeth!!</li>
            <li> My smile was totally different.. not bad, just different.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high hopes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> They are easy to use compared to Secure Smile, but look patently fake.  </li>
            <li> If you want a little more confidence when speaking try this product.</li>
            <li> they looked a little better.</li>
            <li> Secure smile sticks out a little too far.</li>
            <li> (totally lowers your &amp;#34;eewww&amp;#34; factor), and as a temporary substitute, they sure beat the #@*&amp;!% out of a black hole in your face.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t keep reheating the plastic as it eventually just spreads out too much and ruins the fit.  </li>
            <li> Took me about 4 tries to get them to fit.</li>
            <li> teeth are natural in color and look very nice.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I actually did it wrong the first time, but I was able to refit them because the fitting material will remelt in \\&quot;simmering water\\&quot; as the instructions say.</li>
            <li> Even though it looks ok (size-wise) when you put it up against the teeth, it does not fit well at all.</li>
            <li> I love these as long as they are properly molded.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t state that if you had more than one or two missing teeth, it wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> My &#x27;temporary smile replacement&#x27; is now grinning somewhere in the bottom of the local landfill.</li>
            <li> My &#x27;temporary smile replacement&#x27; is now grinning somewhere in the bottom of the local landfill.</li>
            <li> do they know, my smile was actually purchased on Amazon.com!</li>
            <li> Looks hella better than a gaping hole from a missing tooth.</li>
            <li> to use the Instant Smile</li>
            <li> Instant smile tells you to do this.</li>
            <li> Until then, I&#x27;ll order a few more sets of Imako Cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is they stin and discolor very easily and quickly</li>
            <li> It takes several tries to get the fit right.</li>
            <li> Well, it took about two hours of fiddling around with them to get it right, but my persistence paid off big time.</li>
            <li> Tried it several times, followed instructions and still couldn&#x27;t get it right.</li>
            <li> so if you have a wide smile you may want to get the large.  </li>
            <li> otherwise you cannot anchor your new tooth ...</li>
            <li> so im waiting to find a new dentist.</li>
            <li> We are going to a new duty station and these teeth will give me the confidence I need to meet people.</li>
            <li> so I purchased the imako natural colored teeth and they were easy to shape over my other teeth .Everyone</li>
            <li> There is no way to make these look real, PLEASE PLEASE save your money, I looked and followed the youtube video that was made by the maker and it looked possible to make it look real.</li>
            <li> Attach the pink spaghetti piece to the top edge of the back</li>
            <li> Maybe once a month we have an unhappy caller, but we can walk most of them through the fitting process.</li>
            <li> , so they do not stick out very far.</li>
            <li> very natural looking.</li>
            <li> It took a few tries to get the perfect mold and shape to my mouth and even now I keep going back looking in the mirror and finding minor things to adjust.</li>
            <li> To secure a little better I sometimes use a small amount of denture cream - gives me a little more confidence.  </li>
            <li> Get to a dentist and spend the money that will give you a proper corrected smile that will last and make your cost an investment.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise this product, worthy of no star rating if the Amazon server system would allow it, is only going to make the manufacturer richer.</li>
            <li> I know they say the small size fits most people</li>
            <li> so practice on the first one and the 2nd</li>
            <li> During my pregnancy, i developed a condition that started to tear thru my mouth and soften/broke almost all of my teeth!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s embarrassing and depressing to not be able to smile without wondering what people think of your teeth, but with my &amp;#34;new teeth&amp;#34; people always compliment my smile</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> I will eventually go to &amp;#34;Snap-on Smile&amp;#34;, but I live on a fixed income and that may take awhile.</li>
            <li> Imakos are already thin, but are not as realistic looking as secure smile.    </li>
            <li> Let cool until back layer turns white.</li>
            <li> Public speaking, family functions, everything will be much improved for this small investement. :)</li>
            <li> Soften the chunk of pink plastic in a bowl of very hot water.</li>
            <li> Additionally, because the plastic spreads, you always have to remove excess plastic from the teeth portion (as it drips below the teeth or under them) and you inevitably lose more plastic which leaves less  plastic for molding capability.</li>
            <li> they look realistic and more natural and have natural color (not outragously white and the gums are not too pale.)                  </li>
            <li> If you have a regular or large size jaw it would work well for you.</li>
            <li> The teeth do not have a lot of shading in between, so they look like one large piece of white plastic covering my teeth from far away.    </li>
            <li> ok I did get some dental wax cause my gums weren&#x27;t used to something hard rubbing them.</li>
            <li> And if feels weird so that you won&#x27;t be comfortable wearing it if you do try to percevier and fit it in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took me four tries to mold them for the proper fit in my mouth.</li>
            <li> My bite is clear from any of the product</li>
            <li> but I had such a harder time getting them to fit for some reason.  </li>
            <li> in case you lose, damage, or  stain it (clear nailpolish prevents this somewhat) and 2.</li>
            <li> but I feel any pros outweigh the cons by far..</li>
            <li> They look so natural.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li> this looks nothing like my old smile!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I was REALLY unsure as to what I was going to get after the laughable teeth that I received from Secure Smile.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the package with the Imako teeth today.</li>
            <li> wow</li>
            <li> I am a professional and NEED to look like it.</li>
            <li> they look natural.</li>
            <li> they do not look natural.</li>
            <li> I was surprised when this arrived.  </li>
            <li> I am 40 now and facing the facts that dentures are in my near</li>
            <li> When you begin the &#x27;molding&#x27; process it adamantly states do NOT leave them in your mouth for longer than 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s just because they are so usedto seeing me natural, that it gave them pause.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, they are not a permanent solution and really should only be worn until something permanent is done.</li>
            <li> It looks so natural u can not tell they are cosmetic.</li>
            <li> The natural colored smalls are what I ordered.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> will be future ordering thanks</li>
            <li> direct go to press  on veeners</li>
            <li> It was more difficult to fit properly than the video shows, but the upside is...</li>
            <li> I thought of sending them back but just to much hassle.</li>
            <li> These are nice and thin, i have low lip when i smile so you cant see the gum part, they are different</li>
            <li> never had any intention of wearing these in public but definitely thought they would give me an idea of how snap on smile would look.</li>
            <li> ridge that&#x27;s on the back part of the top gum part that you see in the picture here is so narrow</li>
            <li> but it will surely work in the mean time.</li>
            <li> It stinks because so many drinks and foods cause staining and these things are very porous, so no way they are going to stay pristine white, no matter what you use to clean and protect.  </li>
            <li> they are very easy to prepare and fit , the look is natural enough that no one can tell that they are what they are , it sure looks better than a big gap in the teeth , being a smoker they do stain bad and fast , BUT , i did not do as instructions say and apply a clearcoat to stop this from happening as bad .</li>
            <li> The only other thing I can advise is to make sure the water is boiling hot and on hand for a few tries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This makes it virtually impossible to get them to fit whatsoever and mold properly to your own teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to look natural, but nowadays everyone bleaches their teeth, so the normal or acceptable appearance should be white.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s because, unlike here, all those dissatisfied customers will be able to forewarn potential buyers not to waste their money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously!</li>
            <li> Second pair the same exact thing happened</li>
            <li> I filed them down so much they disintegrated, just trying to make them not stick out so much.  </li>
            <li> If the condition of your teeth are a major concern and you can&#x27;t afford to have them fixed...</li>
            <li> I saw this product and decided even if it didn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;ve spent more and received less.  </li>
            <li> was not able to fit for use.</li>
            <li> ok for about 1 week then they are no good..</li>
            <li> it did take me about 4 tries at first</li>
            <li> have just added my actual before &amp; after picture above the reviews, using the large size</li>
            <li> For Imako the white beads are&lt;br /&gt;used to fill in the gaps for missing teeth to keep the shell from being weaker where a person has no teeth, and for no other purpose.&lt;br /&gt;Another person said that she placed the pink material on the back of her own teeth, which is where Instant smile says to put the white beads (actually they say to tuck</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a very small ridge behind the front gum of this product meant to overlap those remaining teeth that you have so as to secure this item, with bonding agent, so as to afford a full tooth smile.</li>
            <li> The teeth are so small they would only fit the mouth of a young child.  </li>
            <li> I have degenerative bone disease and a moderate calcium deficiency and because of these two issues, my teeth are pretty much shot and in a few months I&#x27;ll be getting dentures.  </li>
            <li> Due to a motorcycle accident I have 3 1/2 missing front teeth and anything would look better then gaps.</li>
            <li> I made mistakes of smooshing the mold compound too high on my front gum, and too low on my back two sides.</li>
            <li> When the back layer turns completely clear, pour off the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They do come out further than your natural teeth, but unless you have a problem closing your mouth over the teeth you have</li>
            <li> I wanted them, but once fitted they look natural enough for pictures.</li>
            <li> Gently rub through your lip to get the pink to lay against your gums.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve promised myself that this time next year I will have my teeth fixed bc as we know</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have insurance to get them fixed and have had really low self esteem ever since.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I had fitted the Imakos and had them in my mouth, my upper lip stuck out noticeably far.  </li>
            <li> but anything is better tn than smili g with a broken front tooth</li>
            <li> cause they are white and my teeth are stained but for the price they are worth it and will get me by until i can afford to have a real partial made.</li>
            <li> I am missing the two teeth on either side of my front teeth and have always been embarrased to smile.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical of these, but I ended up loving them.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;them up behind all of the top</li>
            <li> The cost was almost prohibitive (about $500 per tooth in front (X3) and still my smile would show missing teeth.  </li>
            <li> They do not look real in any way, shape or form (contrary to other reviews).  </li>
            <li> If you are willing to grind the shelf down and think you could thin them out a little bit, go for the secure smile.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping the fit would feel comfy, unfortunately, it did not.</li>
            <li> I had dismissed the negative reviews thinking that perhaps others didn&#x27;t spend the time to fit them properly.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a GREAT alternative to having a HORRIBLE smile.</li>
            <li> This product is far more expensive than costume teeth</li>
            <li> you had better not be planning to go anywhere where you&#x27;ll have to actually speak if you do try to keep this false teeth appliance in.</li>
            <li> Turn the Imako teeth upside down and briefly dip halfway into the hot water to make it receptive to bonding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This process is what took the longest and it wasn&#x27;t a easy process,the plastic is very hard to cut into.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Remarkably, I found that the people who are saying negative things about the Imako teeth are trying to fit them by following instructions given by the \\&quot;instant Smile\\&quot; company.&lt;br /&gt;Although they are saying that they followed the instructions Imako gave them to the letter \\&quot;T\\</li>
            <li> I did have to re-submerge in hot water a few times to adjust and re-adjust</li>
            <li> Like someone else said, if you&#x27;re missing more than a few teeth, ESPECIALLY front teeth, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> I spent hours trying to get the right fit and failed.</li>
            <li> They stuck out too far, weren&#x27;t wide enough to cover the teeth near the back and were rather rigid.  </li>
            <li> Remember, this is NOT a therapeutic device--that&#x27;s why they have to call it &amp;#34;novelty.&amp;#34;  They may not rival good dentures in appearance, but they cost a LOT less, you won&#x27;t scare off the faint of heart</li>
            <li> 30 dollars, it&#x27;s too much work for little gain.  </li>
            <li> Please, listen to the bad reviews here and not the good ones...</li>
            <li> But not what I expected.. I have molded them over and over and they still do not fit right...</li>
            <li> I had to determine over a period where the compound was too thick, or where it didn&#x27;t sit right.</li>
            <li> and it makes for a very poor fitting process.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be frustrated if they don&#x27;t look write after the first fit, just simply refit them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (which is why I bought them) and so far other than my brother, no one has noticed them.  </li>
            <li> The photos made it look totally different from the flat product that arrived.</li>
            <li> I bought the IMAKO Small size and it looks a bit unnatural as my real teeth are a bit crooked, but</li>
            <li> I ordered small but received a large.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had them for a few hours and they still are new to me.</li>
            <li> I really looked bad before I got dentures and these teeth look real and gave me so much confidence.</li>
            <li> the teeth is a flat piece of plastic that overlay over your teeth and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like having a tongue ring in your mouth, anytime you put something new in your mouth like that it takes a little getting used to before you can speak</li>
            <li> I have one large tooth missing which results in me never smiling and trying to talk through a closed mouth.</li>
            <li> Teeth are  rounded not flat and gums are generally slanted down toward the teeth.</li>
            <li> Due to medical problems, I&#x27;ve had my teeth fracture and break off causing numerous extractions in the last 2 years.  </li>
            <li> the fitting got worse because as you heat up the plastic it spreads so unevenly each additional time</li>
            <li> There is a \\&quot;shelf\\&quot; right behind the teeth, which makes them VERY low.</li>
            <li> They still stuck out a little too far, because they are thicker than the imakos.     </li>
            <li> Bad teeth are embarassing and I just wanted to look nice.  </li>
            <li> light.i have some uneven teeth and did not smile much.</li>
            <li> firm n&#x27; they look natural.</li>
            <li> teeth arrived as described and I ordered some extra beads and pink plastic</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Buying these was a complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> matter how long you soak this appliance in the hot water, as directed with the little page of directions that come with, it still feels like a stiff bit of plastic in your mouth.</li>
            <li> , how could they not be a little further out when it is just a cap like appliance that lays over the outside of your teeth ?</li>
            <li> I have a low gum line and from other reviews it seem to be easier by doing it this way.</li>
            <li> If I had only read the other reviews, I would not have bought them.</li>
            <li> I actually ordered the other cheaper teeth before I ordered these.  </li>
            <li> Like i said, if you have a need for them (several missing teeth, crooked teeth, discolored, metal showing from dental work</li>
            <li> and I was left with  two front teeth missing and none on the left side.  </li>
            <li> To thick and big to look natural</li>
            <li> Th gums are a bit too pale pink to be natural looking unless you care to darken with food coloring as suggested.</li>
            <li> I found another product that replaces a single tooth</li>
            <li> the small teeth were longer than my natural teeth</li>
            <li> I ordered the &#x27;Natural&#x27; and size &#x27;Small&#x27;.</li>
            <li> And a little hard to do by yourself the first time.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend them to others who are unable to smile due to dental problem.</li>
            <li> And I ordered mine from the actual  company not sure if it makes a difference  and paid 46.00 with shipping and extra beads.</li>
            <li> Images trying to lay a flat piece of plastic from the top/middle of your gum line down to the bottom of your teeth.</li>
            <li> After reading the mixed reviews I was a little unsure about wether or not to purchase the imakos...</li>
            <li> purchased these in small but exchanged them for a large, I could see through the package without even opening it they were too small for me.</li>
            <li> So I would recommend reading the little booklet carefully and repeatedly prior to jumping in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My enamel on a front tooth has been slightly eroded (due to tons of lemonade) and wearing these make such a difference</li>
            <li> I expected to pay upwards of $200 for something, but I was prepared to do so.    </li>
            <li> I will not wear them everyday, but I will wear them for my wedding pictures and possibly my wedding</li>
            <li> the only thing is that you must have a tooth on either side of the one that is missing -</li>
            <li> It was a waste of $35 and several days of trying for hours.</li>
            <li> I got what I expected I should have ordered bleach</li>
            <li> Read the directions carefully; then read them again.  </li>
            <li> I spent over $ 1,300 three years ago on caps,root canals and fillings for all of them to crack.</li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m missing my one front tooth and the one next to it.</li>
            <li> I just ordered my 2nd pair hospital misplaced my 1st pair.</li>
            <li> About what I expected.</li>
            <li> They were a lot harder to put on.</li>
            <li> there is no real line definition between them and the gums are sickly/unhealthy looking.</li>
            <li> I decided on not using the pink plastic bc</li>
            <li> This product is not what was expected.  </li>
            <li> Ordered this product and it was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> them took me 3 tries</li>
            <li> It was the worse I thought they would look real an stay in place.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money...</li>
            <li> I feel like these were a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I had to send my partial out for repair</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m starting college in a few days</li>
            <li> The teeth don&#x27;t look natural at all and the gums are really thick.</li>
            <li> The false teeth of it conflict with what you have of real teeth</li>
            <li> The false teeth of it conflict with what you have of real teeth</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was afraid it would be loose and fall out, but once I perfected the fit, just the opposite, it took a little trying to come out!</li>
            <li> When I got it in the mail I was a little worried because it was flat...</li>
            <li> Perhaps for photos or maybe from a distance they may pass, but certainly not up close.  </li>
            <li> They will INSTANTLY turn yellow/brown and your smile will be worse than before!!</li>
            <li> Didnt fit and it looked SO fake!</li>
            <li> The teeth are a little big and too white and the gums are a little pale.</li>
            <li> and I cut off some of the plastic on the back and even trimmed down the gums and shaped a few teeth to my liking.</li>
            <li> even the small was to big for my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Bought these for my mom that couldn&#x27;t get dentures due to a groth in the roof of her mouth which required surgery.</li>
            <li> Even at size small, teeth are too big.</li>
            <li> If not satisfied melt back</li>
            <li> and my fang teeth both have small but noticeable hole and my last 2 dentist visits</li>
            <li> The teeth didn&#x27;t stay curved or stay on, the edges are sharp, and when I talked, the teeth &#x27;whistled&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Follow the instructions CAREFULLY!</li>
            <li> Teeth were tiny not just small.</li>
            <li> They are small and spaced out and one is crooked.  </li>
            <li> I am a army wife Ive let my teeth stop me from getting to know people and that causes a very lonely me during deployment.</li>
            <li> I think you should be very careful in the measuring of your teeth with this product.</li>
            <li> The Imako Cosmetic teeth I purchased arrived on time but were completely fake looking and hard to fit.</li>
            <li> The only thing I did wrong was to not put the clear coat over them before wearing.</li>
            <li> I am unfortunately missing a few upper teeth waiting for dental work.</li>
            <li> but I sounded like I was talking around, well, fake teeth, and there was too much of the pink stuff up under my gums</li>
            <li> the directions were a little difficult to get right..</li>
            <li> I wish they were a little longer as my mouth is wide.</li>
            <li> It is a little weird the first time trying them on when you&#x27;re all done.  </li>
            <li> Not realistic looking at all and gums were so pale looking.  </li>
            <li> Very fake looking, Hard to get molded, and if you have a broke tooth it will break it even more when you try to remove the product ( even with warm/hot water)</li>
            <li> These are big bulky ugly and not to mention they are hard to fit</li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t really tell they are fake.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After reading very mixed reviews I was anxious to get them and see if I wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> I never smiled with my mouth open before I got these.</li>
            <li> The savage criticism is fueled by bitter losers.</li>
            <li> i have a missing tooth and my teeth are not straight and my teeth are stained with this product you cant even tell this</li>
            <li> + dollars down the drain.</li>
            <li> Place teeth face down in the bowl.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend and like the previous person said if you follow the directions this will work..</li>
            <li> The frauds will crack in half if you drop them.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even try them since they were less than the size of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Did not look as realistic as we hoped and were difficult to form.  </li>
            <li> It has a little pink gum part that you roll as thin as a spaghetti noodle, and 9 little white balls that you shape into teeth</li>
            <li> The unhappy customers must of given up on the first try.</li>
            <li> It may take a little getting used to..</li>
            <li> They sat in my bathroom for awhile because to be honest I was afraid that when I finally fitted them to my mouth, I would be disappointed.    </li>
            <li> speech is a little bit affected by them at this point, but my fianc&amp;eacute;e</li>
            <li> I gave it four stars because the gum color is a little too</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having work done on the teeth a little at a time</li>
            <li> You have to use a little denture cream to make it stay in place or it slips a little.</li>
            <li> The teeth arrived as described and I was a little nervous</li>
            <li> so I decided to tweak them a little</li>
            <li> These cosmetic teeth are a little weird...and their version of \\&quot;small\\&quot; still look like horse teeth.  </li>
            <li> Little</li>
            <li> , it protrudes a little, not a lot.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The directions could have been written a little easier, i.e. Step 1, Step 2, etc.</li>
            <li> Before I re-adjusted, my hubby agreed with me that I looked a little Denzel Washington-y.  </li>
            <li> The little beads they send you did not do what they were suppose to ,nothing worked like they said it would,please don&#x27;t waste your money,it is not worth it!</li>
            <li> I was so desperate for a temporary solution until my surgery that I fell for, what I see as, as the modern day equivelant of a snake oil salesman, or those conscienceless homeopaths who say they can cure cancer with herbs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My one missing tooth is wreaking havoc on my self esteem...</li>
            <li> have one tooth to the left of my front two teeth that chipped about a year and has progressively gotten worse.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It is a WASTE of money.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste ur $$$.</li>
            <li> and I will not have the insurance to cover it for a few months.</li>
            <li> I REFUSE to walk around with my tooth missing.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> after a few times trying to get it adjusted..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, go to a dental school &amp; get reduced cost work.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> you have missing teeth.</li>
            <li> I had hope to get a few pics of my smiling with my kids</li>
            <li> Did not fit.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> does not fit well...</li>
            <li> After that, the teeth will not fit properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> does not look anything like the pic, don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I wasted $40.</li>
            <li> You can see from far away it is fake.</li>
            <li> I have a few teeth missing</li>
            <li> Wasted money...</li>
            <li> This product was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I have several missing teeth and broken teeth.</li>
            <li> I had a few teeth that looked pretty bad in front</li>
            <li> I used all the gum material to get the gums to go over the ridge of bone above where my teeth used to be then sucked real hard for a minute.</li>
            <li> It does look a little juvenile..</li>
            <li> the people who gave bad reviews, I don&#x27;t know your exact dental situation of course, but I would urge some of you to give it another try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok to occasional use, if you have bad front  teeth, or to hide the bad front teeth, until you can get to a dentist.</li>
            <li> and they were flimsy, it was missing the extra material for missing teeth and looked fake.</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to and they are obvious when you are up close and smiling a lot but for casual encounters, shooting video etc...</li>
            <li> /&gt;The people who wrote bad reviews either ordered the wrong size, got frustrated after the first fitting or were expecting perfection.</li>
            <li> I have small teeth (none missing, all there), so I ordered the small one.</li>
            <li> People just do not take me seriously as a non-crack-headed human with missing, broken and cavity ridden teeth,  </li>
            <li> Also, in the imako teeth holder container, they have a little bag inside, just for you!</li>
            <li> a little hard to get set up</li>
            <li> I know they are there, but they don&#x27;t hurt my mouth and affect my speech very little.  </li>
            <li> I followed directions and still didn&#x27;t work and a waste of hard earned money.</li>
            <li> It &#x27;a a waste of my hard earned money.</li>
            <li> I leave the house regularly now, and even my son has not noticed that I have fake teeth.  </li>
            <li> Since my jaw is small.  </li>
            <li> if u have to ...cut every thing small is all..</li>
            <li> /&gt;First note: If you are an impatient person, do not get these!</li>
            <li> If it is closer to 1-1/8th inches (28 mm.), then order small, If closer to 1-1/4th inches (32 mm.)</li>
            <li> Not satisfied at all.</li>
            <li> That ridge is so small there is no bonding agent that will work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I was not able to use this item at all.  </li>
            <li> I have no top teeth</li>
            <li> I like the small case to put them in, too.</li>
            <li> I was not sure if these teeth could help me</li>
            <li> I ordered the Imako teeth in a small, watched the video</li>
            <li> Press once very firmly against each of your teeth.</li>
            <li> Well I am not rich and don&#x27;t have dental insurance...and trying to get an appointment at the low income clinic dentist was impossible.</li>
            <li> could just be hard to get use to for me</li>
            <li> These are hard to mold to teeth and if you drink coffee don&#x27;t even bother.</li>
            <li> hard to to talk with it on...</li>
            <li> Hard to talk.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard dating when your teeth look like s</li>
            <li> but when I looked in the mirror is wasn&#x27;t near as bad as I thought it would.  </li>
            <li> It is clumsy, not attractive, messy, does not stay in place at all.</li>
            <li> Sucks that I can&#x27;t return this.</li>
            <li> My complaint is they made me look like a horse....</li>
            <li> I have purchased at least a dozen of these.</li>
            <li> Is recommend this to anyone lookin for a cheap fix to ugly teeth!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just frustrating and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;teeth covers&#x27; are flat and artificial looking.</li>
            <li> they mean it.  </li>
            <li> in a few days!!</li>
            <li> In case you screw the first one up badly and it&#x27;s too difficult to remold.  </li>
            <li> The problem with them is that they can&#x27;t work unless your gum line is just at flat as the teeth which is silly!</li>
            <li> these suck could not get them to stay on, they do stick out but iv seen worse I ordered small</li>
            <li> They wont stay in my mouth and even if they would, they look ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Since my teeth are serious need of repair I have been using these.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to wear these in public.</li>
            <li> The instructions it comes with are a little difficult to understand and follow, so I suggest watching the video.</li>
            <li> They look a LITTLE fake but not that noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I may just use them in some creepy craft project after a few alterations.</li>
            <li> This product did not fit well and looked extremely fake.</li>
            <li> I am missing all four of my front teeth and my self esteem has suffered horribly because of it (I&#x27;m a 24 year old woman), so I figured I&#x27;d give these a shot.</li>
            <li> Once finally fitted, you will be disappointed in their \\&quot;toy-like\\&quot; appearance.  </li>
            <li> But it looked fake in my mouth, even ordering the small size.  </li>
            <li> I chose it because there was no lower one!It was cheaply made impossible to use and ugly!</li>
            <li> It was not shipped as promised and was too small!!</li>
            <li> They have peeled and a couple of chunks have broken off.  </li>
            <li> Not happy with this product</li>
            <li> Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> Roll it out on your palm until you have a thin tube the size of a spaghetti noodle</li>
            <li> I broke a front tooth and was a three week wait for an appt with my dentist, so I bought this to hide the broken tooth.</li>
            <li> At worse, they will get a close up and think they are false ...</li>
            <li> thin</li>
            <li> It is worse that Halloween teeth.</li>
            <li> but you don&#x27;t put any of Imako&#x27;s material behind any of your teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are too thin and flimsy to stay in place or hold their shape.</li>
            <li> I know my friends would not judge me, but I felt a little out of place with bad teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reading some of these bad reviews, and I&#x27;m wondering a few things.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my grandmother and they did not fit, we couldn&#x27;t get them to sick on.</li>
            <li> but it was still expensive for someone like me.</li>
            <li> the teeth must have run through the machine that makes them wrong</li>
            <li> It does not look too fake and you can&#x27;t tell they are plastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect..</li>
            <li> Root canal failed about 8 years ago and ever since then, wore a flipper.</li>
            <li> but they still look fake, which of course they are.</li>
            <li> You can still tell they are fake.   </li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> these are a fail.</li>
            <li> Terrible want my money back</li>
            <li> So think twice before buying  this sad product.</li>
            <li> and he says you can&#x27;t tell they are fake and trust me he would tell me if he thought I looked like bugs bunny.</li>
            <li> But I could be wrong</li>
            <li> I did not even use the product but was unable to return it.</li>
            <li> They look like the fake teeth you can buy at a toy store.</li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical to buy these, but I did think hey</li>
            <li> I am sorry I purchase this product.</li>
            <li> The teeth look so fake</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> but once in are difficult to tell they are.  </li>
            <li> but I felt so ugly because of my broken tooth.</li>
            <li> It will be weird  not being afraid to talk to the cashier at the grocery store for fear</li>
            <li> They gave me a worse speech impediment then the Dr. Bailey&#x27;s Horse teeth. :(  </li>
            <li> they are so desperate they are packaging and selling  fraudulent versions of Imako on Amazon, so let me know if this happens to you, and we will get these sellers banned from Amazon and prosecute them.</li>
            <li> Worst purchase every made don&#x27;t waste your money or time</li>
            <li> Awkward to work with, shipping was prompt</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s fake too!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s fake too!</li>
            <li> It still sits in a drawer, collecting dust because I am unable to use it!</li>
            <li> Felt and looked SO fake!</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with the way these worked its like putting a ring of silly putty in your mouth  </li>
            <li> it was horrible to say the least ...</li>
            <li> it was very uncomfortable and unatural in my mouth</li>
            <li> and I found speaking very difficult ...</li>
            <li> No, they were very difficult to size .</li>
            <li> THEY ARE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE</li>
            <li> If they were thinner it wouldn&#x27;t be so bad.</li>
            <li> i would recommend the cosmetic teeth to any one with bad teeth</li>
            <li> However I was still concerned because of the bad reviews I had come across.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m posting my review here because I doubt they&#x27;d let me post a bad review on their site.  </li>
            <li> knew if I rushed it I would get frustrated.</li>
            <li> I was going to return these, but got them to not be so painful.  </li>
            <li> you may be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was sadly disappointed with the looks of this product.  </li>
            <li> Look terrible fake.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy, anytime I tried to get information about returning</li>
            <li> It worked but leaving trails of tissue in my car and my pocket was a bit annoying.</li>
            <li> To a dentist and do not make this manufacturer any richer.&lt;br /&gt;The 5 star ratings on this crap you can bet are by people who have never tried it, or they&#x27;re sock accounts for the manufacturer/</li>

            <li> I sounded horrible, too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s positively awful.  </li>

            <li> Well, maybe the very worst.</li>
            <li> Terrible, would not buy, should be taken off the market!</li>
            <li> Well I was in an accident and 2 of my front teeth chipped and looked horrible.</li>
            <li> These are horrible.  </li>
            <li> Everything was in the package that was supposed to be, and I had no problems using/molding the wax, but the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; themselves are just terrible in my opinion.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The Imako Cosmetic teeth I purchased arrived on time but were completely fake looking and hard to fit. They look and feel like the &amp;#34;Bubba Gump&amp;#34; teeth you buy for Halloween. I</li>
            <li> A while ago I broke my front tooth. Well I am not rich and don&#x27;t have dental insurance...and trying to get an appointment at the low income clinic dentist was impossible. Everytime I call for an appointment they always say they are booked up and call back in three months. Only to be told then to call back in another three months.So what do I do? I felt so embarrased and self consciencious.....So I srarted looking on line for some type of solution.  I found a place who will make you a product similar to the one here but for six hundred dollars.Iwas actualy happy about that because I knew compared to fixing at a dentist would cost way more...but it was still expensive for someone like me.Then  one day while shopping here on Amazon I realized you can buy practically anything on this site and usually really cheap............so I typed in dental flippers and this product popped up.Well,first of all the price is awesome..It sure beats. Six hundred dollars........So when I got it I wasn&#x27;t sure if they&#x27;d look real......but anything is better tn than smili g with a broken front tooth......so they take some getting used to.....and its not the same as if a dentist did something. But they are toleratable  and you can&#x27;t really tell they are fake. Its just nice to be able  to have confidence in social situations again.Everyone tells me I am a pretty girl but I felt so ugly because of my broken tooth. Now I feel so much happier and confident. It may take a little getting used to..but I feel any pros outweigh the cons by far.. I am so thankful for this product. It is a lifesaver.</li>
            <li> I do not usually review items, but I had to let people know just how great these are.      I&#x27;m having problems with my front teeth.  They have peeled and a couple of chunks have broken off.  I would not leave the house except to go to the doctor.  I just did not want anyone to see me like this.    I remembered seeing something called a \\&quot;flip\\&quot; on one of the kid beauty pageant shows and decided to look and see if there was something available for adults.  I expected to pay upwards of $200 for something, but I was prepared to do so.    Imagine my surprise when I found this product at under $40.  I immediately ordered a set.  They sat in my bathroom for awhile because to be honest I was afraid that when I finally fitted them to my mouth, I would be disappointed.    I was not!  It took me two tries to fit them comfortably and correctly, but when I saw myself in the mirror, I was ecstatic.  I leave the house regularly now, and even my son has not noticed that I have fake teeth.  They look so natural.  My smile is awesome, and I am extremely happy with them.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT.  They do not look real in any way, shape or form (contrary to other reviews).  If you are looking for a cosmetic fix... look elsewhere because this is not it.  Even after you spend several hours fitting them and watching video online, you look like you&#x27;re wearing fake toy/Halloween teeth.    Oh yeah, the fitting is difficult.  Once finally fitted, you will be disappointed in their \\&quot;toy-like\\&quot; appearance.  Perhaps for photos or maybe from a distance they may pass, but certainly not up close.  They are bulky in your mouth and make your lip stick out. They fit/feel similar to those plastic toy vampire teeth that everyone wore as a kid.   When I purchased this I had been optimistic because of all of the positive reviews this product received. I was hoping for the best.  Before purchasing I had combed through numerous reviews, websites, etc... I had dismissed the negative reviews thinking that perhaps others didn&#x27;t spend the time to fit them properly.  Please don&#x27;t make the same mistake i did.  In the end, these are toy teeth.</li>
            <li> Looks like a horse&#x27;s mouth when u put it on</li>
            <li> Only complaint is they stin and discolor very easily and quickly</li>
            <li> My one missing tooth is wreaking havoc on my self esteem... blah blah.. found imako!  Although I think this is a great product for people who need it, it wasn&#x27;t the right choice for me.  My remaining teeth are in good shape which made the imako teeth overkill.  My smile was totally different.. not bad, just different.  I wanted to hide my imperfection not change my smile.  I found another product that replaces a single tooth and i think that my be my solution.      That said, the teeth are really nice looking and easy to fit. They do come out further than your natural teeth, but unless you have a problem closing your mouth over the teeth you have now I wouldn&#x27;t worry about it.  Also, don&#x27;t put them in and look in the mirror and think \\&quot;omg! this looks nothing like my old smile!\\&quot;  Like i said, if you have a need for them (several missing teeth, crooked teeth, discolored, metal showing from dental work etc.)they are great.  Just fit them, wear them around for the day.  You will get used to them and be able to make a more informed judgment of the product.      The size!  I know they say the small size fits most people but i should have gotten the large.  Here&#x27;s the thing... the small teeth were longer than my natural teeth but the width was smaller.  so if you have a wide smile you may want to get the large.  The teeth wont be longer they&#x27;ll be wider so that when you smile they wont stop while your smile is still going!       It&#x27;s a perfect set of teeth.  People will think that you had dental work or dentures or something, but guess what?!  They&#x27;re going to think that if you have dental work or get dentures too!    I think this is a great buy.. even if you can&#x27;t smoke and drink coffee.  I bet you&#x27;re not smiling as much as you&#x27;d like to or should be.  If you need more than a little bleaching and a tooth get these and smile all the time!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as described. Very unhappy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Okay so here&#x27;s the scoop. I purchased the cheaper Secure Smile before I purchased this product. After receiving and fitting the Secure Smile I promptly threw them in the trash got online and wrote my honest opinion of them on their Amazon review page. Then, I ordered the Imako teeth. I was REALLY unsure as to what I was going to get after the laughable teeth that I received from Secure Smile. The Secure Smile may fit people with a bigger mouth, but they were not the choice for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have one tooth to the left of my front two teeth that chipped about a year and has progressively gotten worse. I have no dental insurance and I am planning a wedding that I am paying for myself, so I don&#x27;t have the money budgeted to go to the dentist. Obviously, I want my wedding pictures to look as good as possible, so I was looking for a quick fix to wear just for my wedding pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the package with the Imako teeth today. First of all, I could tell just by first glance that they weren&#x27;t going to be bulky. Yes they are almost flat, and they don&#x27;t look as realistic as the Secure Smile teeth, but they do look real enough for pictures IMO, esp. pictures from a distance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that it took me about 11 to 12 times to get them fitting as well I wanted them, but once fitted they look natural enough for pictures. I would suggest reading the instructions thoroughly several times and going onto the Imako site and watching the fitting tutorial video. I actually did it wrong the first time, but I was able to refit them because the fitting material will remelt in \\&quot;simmering water\\&quot; as the instructions say. Don&#x27;t be frustrated if they don&#x27;t look write after the first fit, just simply refit them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The people who wrote bad reviews either ordered the wrong size, got frustrated after the first fitting or were expecting perfection. If you are just looking for something to wear for a couple of hours here and there, these will work. Especially for photographs. If you are buying these expecting them to replace your real teeth you may be disappointed. I know that several reviews are worded this way, but it&#x27;s an honest statement. I will not wear them everyday, but I will wear them for my wedding pictures and possibly my wedding ceremony.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My speech is a little bit affected by them at this point, but my fianc&amp;eacute;e and I both believe that after I get used to them I should be able to talk just fine. It&#x27;s just like having a tongue ring in your mouth, anytime you put something new in your mouth like that it takes a little getting used to before you can speak properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say these are worth the 40 bucks I paid for them for a great wedding pictures that I&#x27;m not afraid to share with my friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I uploaded a before and after on photo bucket. Here&#x27;s the link to that:&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> This is a fraud and I would never recommend this product to anyone. This product should be listed as a novelty item, it is total BS and you will never get your money back. Amazon should take this product off their web-site because it is a shammmm. Not happy with this product the teeth is a flat piece of plastic that overlay over your teeth and they are yellow not white, total BS.  I am happy with all my other purchases with Amazon and will continue to shop, but this company never again. $40 + dollars down the drain.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to receive this product in the mail since I lost 2 teeth right in the front of my mouth with one tooth sticking out in the middle - it was horrible to say the least ... well when I got it I followed the directions to a T and no matter what I did I still ended up looking like a had a mouth full of white plastic ... it was very uncomfortable and unatural in my mouth and I found speaking very difficult ... I read another review where someone said they found a website called Temptooth - I figured at this point I had nothing to lose - I ordered the Temptooth and I can honestly say that now, at last, I can walk around in confidence and smile happily ... it was very easy to make the tooth and for around $25.00 you can make yourself about 10 teeth - I made 4 more teeth for back-ups ... it did take me about 4 tries at first but you can keep melting the beads until you get it right ... wow what a difference ... if you are going to spend the $25.00 or so dollars anyway I think you would be so much happier to get the Temptooth ... the only thing is that you must have a tooth on either side of the one that is missing - I was lucky that I had the one tooth in the middle otherwise you cannot anchor your new tooth ... all in all I so wanted to love the Imako shell but for me it definitely did not work ... Temptooth on the other hand was a life (and smile) saver !!!</li>
            <li> I looked like I had buck teeth. It looked like halloween teeth. Don&#x27;t waste your money. They looked horrible. I hope this helps someone else not to make the same mistake as I did. It is a WASTE of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t look real.. followed directions exactly and still didn&#x27;t fit correctly</li>
            <li> These are big bulky ugly and not to mention they are hard to fit your teeth.they don&#x27;t stay like it says..but what do u expect for fame teeth.I asked for a refund ..don&#x27;t waste ur $$$.</li>
            <li> I bought the Imako smile for my daughter&#x27;s friend because she was embarrassed and asked for my help to get it to fit right. We tried EVEYTHING to make it work and it was not working. So I went searching for the \\&quot;beads\\&quot; like the ones they give you (they do not give you nearly enough for the money and thats when I saw Instamorph and a pic of a girl that had made 1 tooth out of it in the images on Amazon. Intrigued I ordered it. I figured if we still couldn&#x27;t get the Imako to work with the beads maybe we could make the 2 teeth she needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure enough there was not enough prayer in the world to make the Imakos work. I  have perfect teeth and I tried the Imako smile on myself and then I figured it out! The problem with them is that they can&#x27;t work unless your gum line is just at flat as the teeth which is silly! Teeth are  rounded not flat and gums are generally slanted down toward the teeth. Images trying to lay a flat piece of plastic from the top/middle of your gum line down to the bottom of your teeth. It actually makes no sense at all. It was a waste of $35 and several days of trying for hours. Urg!</li>
            <li> I got what I expected I should have ordered bleach however my teeth are too white in comparison. These look like an avid smokers teeth very stained will try bleached next and see if that is more satisfying.</li>
            <li> Great seller! I needed a replacement because I lost mine, and they shipped them out fast! Friendly customer service as well and they get back to you very quickly if you have a question! As to the product, ive used this product for over a year now, this is my 2nd pair as I lost my 1st. I use them on a daily basis in my life. They are the best quick fix out there!</li>
            <li> My product came to me completly deformed the teeth must have run through the machine that makes them wrong the teeth are smashed and mishaped I really hope they can send me a good set of teeth as replacement for the ones I received that are obviously a Manafacture defect</li>
            <li> Obviously there not meant to replace getting dentures or something repaired correctly. But they work well enough to wear in public until you get to the dentist.</li>
            <li> No, they were very difficult to size . Bought 3 pairs none worked in my favor .I will say the gentleman at Imako did his best to help me .</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with the way these worked its like putting a ring of silly putty in your mouth  could just be hard to get use to for me</li>
            <li> This product has pretty good reviews, so I decided to give it a try. I have small teeth (none missing, all there), so I ordered the small one. Even though it looks ok (size-wise) when you put it up against the teeth, it does not fit well at all. I&#x27;ve been refitting it continuously, and even though the indentations line up, it does not stay on by itself. I will try to use denture bond to keep it on. Maybe that will help.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it&#x27;s pretty flimsy. And yellow. It&#x27;s supposed to look natural, but nowadays everyone bleaches their teeth, so the normal or acceptable appearance should be white. I would recommend getting the white set instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, an additionally, the tooth strip came in a plastic baggy that was already opened. Looked clean, though.</li>
            <li> Th gums are a bit too pale pink to be natural looking unless you care to darken with food coloring as suggested. The natural color and the shape of the teeth matched well with my own and and didn&#x27;t have too stark of a contrast. As for the fit, I&#x27;m going to try remolding them to my teeth again and see if I can get a better one as right now they make me feel like I&#x27;m wearing a mouth guard. Definitely more for pics than for real life, every day wear if you want a natural appearance. They were easy to work with however you may have to heat them up a few additional times and squish them to your teeth to get your desired fit just right.</li>
            <li> These are the best cosmetic substitute for missing teeth I&#x27;ve been able to find.  The &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; color is best unless you have &amp;#34;Hollywood teeth,&amp;#34; and they are the thinnest, and therefore least noticeable on the market.  Read the directions carefully; then read them again.  Have everything you need close at hand and fitting should go without a hitch.  Remember, this is NOT a therapeutic device--that&#x27;s why they have to call it &amp;#34;novelty.&amp;#34;  They may not rival good dentures in appearance, but they cost a LOT less, you won&#x27;t scare off the faint of heart (totally lowers your &amp;#34;eewww&amp;#34; factor), and as a temporary substitute, they sure beat the #@*&amp;!% out of a black hole in your face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do reviews but I have to say that this worked for me. First let me say  DO NOT LOOK FOR PERFECTION, YOU AREN&#x27;T GOING TO GET IT. I can&#x27;t afford the $4,000 to fix my teeth. I spent over $ 1,300 three years ago on caps,root canals and fillings for all of them to crack. I took a gamble with this product and I must say I am smiling. I do public speaking and I was using tissue to cover the holes in my teeth. It worked but leaving trails of tissue in my car and my pocket was a bit annoying. I know my friends would not judge me, but I felt a little out of place with bad teeth. If you want a little more confidence when speaking try this product. It is not the savoir for a dentist visit but it will surely work in the mean time. The instructional video made it easy for me. I had to try about 5 times but I made it work.  Thanks and I am going outside to the store and try on my smile :)</li>
            <li> This product is not for everybody. even the small was to big for my mouth.  But I do know of people it worked well for. You could not tell it was not there real teeth.  But it looked fake in my mouth, even ordering the small size.  Since my jaw is small.  Customer service was very understanding and refunded my money.  If you have a regular or large size jaw it would work well for you.</li>
            <li> OK..I broke out my front tooth and I will not have the insurance to cover it for a few months. I am a professional and NEED to look like it. I REFUSE to walk around with my tooth missing. I bought the IMAKO Small size and it looks a bit unnatural as my real teeth are a bit crooked, but do you know I get compliments on my smile. It does not look too fake and you can&#x27;t tell they are plastic. I have a before and after I can email anyone.. sassyserpent@gmail.com - It&#x27;s not perfect.. but it&#x27;s a GREAT alternative to having a HORRIBLE smile.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my mom that couldn&#x27;t get dentures due to a groth in the roof of her mouth which required surgery. They required some manipulation to get them to fit but were great for her considering her condition. She said they were very comfortable and stayed in place nicely. I just wish she could eat with them!  We are purchasing another set because the dog ate them!</li>
            <li> If you want to look like Captain Teeth MAAAAANNNNNN for Halloween, um they are awesome....notttt.  What a joke!  I got ripped on this one</li>
            <li> Do not like this product. It is clumsy, not attractive, messy, does not stay in place at all. No thanks.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend and like the previous person said if you follow the directions this will work.. You just have to take them out when you eat and sleep but for the price it is a day and night difference it made on his teeth!! It just took a while to get them fitted and when he did they look perfect, I would recommend this if you do not have the money for major dental work A+++</li>
            <li> I bought 4 sets already... Very workable..  Can eat with them...if u have to ...cut every thing small is all..</li>
            <li> I was sadly disappointed with the looks of this product.  Not realistic looking at all and gums were so pale looking.  Didn&#x27;t fit well either.  Product overpriced.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product and it is great.I had some problems fitting it the first few times now it is just perfect.I gave it four stars because the gum color is a little too light.i have some uneven teeth and did not smile much.Now I can&#x27;t stop smiling.It is not mother nature but it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> great product for the price. Cheaper than the dentist. Works great for temporary coverage. Looks real enough to fool your friends</li>
            <li> These things don&#x27;t work or look real at all, and what a rip off on the cost. A waste of money.</li>
            <li> These worked great for me. A great fast fix for an embarassing problem. I&#x27;m having work done on the teeth a little at a time and i&#x27;m missing my one front tooth and the one next to it. I found these and read all the reviews and I really didn&#x27;t think they were going to work! The day I got them in the mail was the best day ever! Having missing teeth is very embarassing to me but these worked great! They were easy to mold and fit ok I did get some dental wax cause my gums weren&#x27;t used to something hard rubbing them. They don&#x27;t look like your real teeth so dont put them on and think that your going to look the same. Ive been told that you can&#x27;t really tell soooo if you are looking for a quick temp fix so for it! I just ordered my 2nd pair hospital misplaced my 1st pair.</li>
            <li> These are nice and thin, i have low lip when i smile so you cant see the gum part, they are different then im used to looking at cause they are white and my teeth are stained but for the price they are worth it and will get me by until i can afford to have a real partial made.</li>
            <li> THERE MAY BE SOME OVER-THE -COUNTER COSMETIC DENTAL COVERS&lt;br /&gt;THAT WORK---IMAKO IS NOT IT!!! THEY DON&#x27;T INSTALL PROPERLY THEY ARE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE&lt;br /&gt;&amp; THEY LOOK REDICULOUS.</li>
            <li> after reading the reviews on these i saw that some people were aparantley thinking that they would be a replacement for dentures and that some thought that they would not protrude farther than their real teeth , how could they not be a little further out when it is just a cap like appliance that lays over the outside of your teeth ? some people should not be allowed to write reviews or rate anything if they dont have the mentality to do so . they are very easy to prepare and fit , the look is natural enough that no one can tell that they are what they are , it sure looks better than a big gap in the teeth , being a smoker they do stain bad and fast , BUT , i did not do as instructions say and apply a clearcoat to stop this from happening as bad . a couple of times i started to eat with them in because i forgot i was wearing them , they are comfortable , easy in , easy out . not buck toothed , and do not protrude much farther at all than my real teeth . not being able to pay the $$$ for dentures at this time , these are the best things i have found to substitute ,   highly recommend this product to anyone that can realize that they are not real teeth or real dentures , they are a decent , nicely done 40.00 cover up of bad/crooked teeth , thats all , it is not a miracle fix like some think , it works , and works well</li>
            <li> I could not be any more pleased with purchasing the Imako teeth. I am missing the two teeth on either side of my front teeth and have always been embarrased to smile. Now you can not catch me not smiling!! They are very easy to fit and much more comfortable than the first set I purchased of another brand. They do not give the appearance of buck teeth either. The only thing I did wrong was to not put the clear coat over them before wearing. They will yellow quite quickly if you smoke or chew tobacco. But once again, that is my fault not the products fault. This is truely an amazing product!!!!</li>
            <li> I wear a flipper, had knocked a tooth out at age 12, had a root canal back then to resecure it. Root canal failed about 8 years ago and ever since then, wore a flipper. Bought these so I might not need to always wear the flipper. Even at size small, teeth are too big. Sucks that I can&#x27;t return this.</li>
            <li> It was not hard to do at all and the fit was good...you know you aren&#x27;t going to lose them.  My complaint is they made me look like a horse....terrible overbite and my lips wouldn&#x27;t close over them.  My kids had a good laugh.  I will not be wearing this anywhere anytime soon.</li>
            <li> I am on my third set. I love these as long as they are properly molded.</li>
            <li> Mine arrived right on time. I tried getting them ready 2 days after receiving them,that didn&#x27;t work out to well. The I-Teeth were to bulky in the front and I looked like I had Buck teeth. I&#x27;m going to start all over again, hopefully this time it works and I&#x27;ll write another review and maybe post before and after pictures.  My fianc&amp;eacute;e bought his,and they look great!</li>
            <li> Okay in a pinch but they still look fake, which of course they are. About what I expected.</li>
            <li> after a few times trying to get it adjusted..it beautiful..i love the new product  the older version melted and smeared when you touched it.The newer one is great.i wish they made bottom shell. Just a suggestion use the small size and get a couple of bags of the fitting beads for a perfect fit..This is a great alternative to the surgery i need to get to fix my teeth.</li>
            <li> Ok, I purchased both the Imako and the Secure Smile cosmetic teeth at the same time, because I was curious about which ones were best. I have gaps between my teeth and cant afford dental work at the time.     Imako- pros- very easy to put on and are a lot thinner, so they do not stick out very far. They are also comfortable to wear.         cons- The teeth are a little big and too white and the gums are a little pale. The teeth do not have a lot of shading in between, so they look like one large piece of white plastic covering my teeth from far away.    Secure Smile- pros- they look realistic and more natural and have natural color (not outragously white and the gums are not too pale.)                  cons- They were a lot harder to put on. There is a \\&quot;shelf\\&quot; right behind the teeth, which makes them VERY low. I actually had to grind the shelf off with my husbands grinder in the garage so it would fit higher on my teeth. Once I got them to fit higher they looked a little better. They still stuck out a little too far, because they are thicker than the imakos.     My choice-- Neither the imakos or the secure smile look completely fabulous. You can still tell they are fake.   The imakos look just a tiny bit better than the secure smile only because I have a smaller mouth and imakos are a little  thinner than the secure smile. Secure smile sticks out a little too far. I REALLY wish secure smile would not put that shelf on the back of theirs and make them just a little thinner, because their color looks more natural and realistic than the imakos. If you are willing to grind the shelf down and think you could thin them out a little bit, go for the secure smile. Imakos are already thin, but are not as realistic looking as secure smile.    For right now, I will be wearing the Imakos, only because secure smile sticks out too far.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all. They gave me a worse speech impediment then the Dr. Bailey&#x27;s Horse teeth. :(  Good luck to you if you waste money on them and are looking for a quick fix JUST so you can leave your home again</li>
            <li> After having them for a week, I finally put them to the test today. In an hour-long session with my therapist! What better place?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First note: If you are an impatient person, do not get these! It takes a bit of time and patience to do-it-yourself. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased these in small but exchanged them for a large, I could see through the package without even opening it they were too small for me. The stock picture they show here is for the size large. The smalls are noticably smaller. What&#x27;s very important is to measure your teeth exactly as instructed on their site. Like this - \\&quot;Measure across the width of the four front teeth. If it is closer to 1-1/8th inches (28 mm.), then order small, If closer to 1-1/4th inches (32 mm.) order large.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said BE PATIENT, I made sure to follow both the written and video instructions, that&#x27;s a MUST. I didn&#x27;t get a perfect fit the first time but the good thing is you can get another chance until it&#x27;s right! I made mistakes of smooshing the mold compound too high on my front gum, and too low on my back two sides. I dipped either one side or the top part in simmering water to re-loosen it and re-mold it. I gradually tried it on each day and talked in a mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew if I rushed it I would get frustrated. I had to determine over a period where the compound was too thick, or where it didn&#x27;t sit right. They do give you more than needed as it says, so I trimmed a bit off. It&#x27;s not wax, it&#x27;s a much sturdier compound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was afraid it would be loose and fall out, but once I perfected the fit, just the opposite, it took a little trying to come out! Drinking sips of hot water will help loosen it if need be. Public speaking, family functions, everything will be much improved for this small investement. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have just added my actual before &amp; after picture above the reviews, using the large size I purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the people who gave bad reviews, I don&#x27;t know your exact dental situation of course, but I would urge some of you to give it another try. I&#x27;m a theatrical make-up artist and even I had to use patience and keep perfecting it. Things that are worth it are not always quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, my doctor, my mom and my nephew ALL thought that I had gone to a dentist to have it fitted! Couldn&#x27;t believe I did it myself. :)al situation of course, but I would urge some of you to give it another try.

            <li> The teeth don&#x27;t look natural at all and the gums are really thick. If they were thinner it wouldn&#x27;t be so bad.</li>
            <li> There is no way to make these look real, PLEASE PLEASE save your money, I looked and followed the youtube video that was made by the maker and it looked possible to make it look real. I bought these for my sister she is embarrassed of your smile because after not taking care of them as a child/teenager and after 2 kids she has lots of cosmetic issues with her teeth which are getting pulled and she is getting them fixed but was hoping to give her confidence and feel better about herself, its a shame these people get away with selling these all the 5 point stars HAVE to be paid to leave reviews.</li>
            <li> This product was terrible. After trying this for a quick fix I end up at the dentist anyway. You get what you pay for. It makes your mouth look like a horse.</li>
            <li> I am unfortunately missing a few upper teeth waiting for dental work. I figured maybe these would work. Wrong. I followed the instructions to a tee (I used to be a dental assistant) and they were flimsy, it was missing the extra material for missing teeth and looked fake. It didn&#x27;t state that if you had more than one or two missing teeth, it wouldn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t waste your money, go to a dental school &amp; get reduced cost work. The teeth are rubber!</li>
            <li> Horrible. Waste of money. Dont buy. They constantly fall off. Its just a strip that sits on top of teeth.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get an idea of what the real  &amp;#34;snap on smile&amp;#34; will be like before ordering it from the dentist.. never had any intention of wearing these in public but definitely thought they would give me an idea of how snap on smile would look. But these are horrible. My brother told me I looked like I was &amp;#34;slow&amp;#34;.. my mom n hubby were cracking up laughing at me.</li>
            <li> Ok, I will do a top to bottom review. First, they come in a package, with a before and after picture of what these teeth are supposed to do. Okay, so when I open it, there is a white container that has a REDICULOUS sticker on it saying, &amp;#34;If found, please return to:&amp;#34; Why would I want someone to return these to me? They are $35 dollars, not $3500! Also, in the imako teeth holder container, they have a little bag inside, just for you! It has a little pink gum part that you roll as thin as a spaghetti noodle, and 9 little white balls that you shape into teeth incase you have missing teeth. How fun! Alrighty, let&#x27;s move on to the TEETH! They come straight, they are not shaped or anything, that is fine, but I don&#x27;t think the instructions came in the description. Here is the instructions that came with the teeth:&lt;br /&gt;BEFORE YOU BEGIN- Wash hand, floss &amp; brush teeth. Review this instruction booklet.&lt;br /&gt;ITEMS NEEDED: A mirror, a timer with seconds displayed, a pot of simmering water, a ceramic bowl and scissors/nail clippers.&lt;br /&gt;It says Imako teeth arrive flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Soften the chunk of pink plastic in a bowl of very hot water. Remove with a spoon. Roll it out on your palm until you have a thin tube the size of a spaghetti noodle the width of your palm (you have more than necessary). Keep soft by dipping in hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Turn the Imako teeth upside down and briefly dip halfway into the hot water to make it receptive to bonding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Attach the pink spaghetti piece to the top edge of the back layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.Refresh hot water in bowl. Place teeth face down in the bowl. When the back layer turns completely clear, pour off the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. The teeth will be floppy. Use mirror. Pull lip forward, insert and position teeth. Press once very firmly against each of your teeth. Gently rub through your lip to get the pink to lay against your gums. Keep it still. Use one hand to keep sides in place and one hand to keep front in place.Gently support the position for TWO MINUTES and no longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Remove teeth by spreading from below. Let cool until back layer turns white. Try on! If not satisfied melt back again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Snip off the tips of any points which are formed where two teeth meet the gum, or it will cause discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alrighty, that is all the instructions. They have a bunch of warnings too, like, if they get stuck in your mouth, do not use force, swish the hottest water you can withstand and scrape it all off. YUCK!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, I guess you really do get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> Great looking easy to apply and wear.  They look real and people I have asked if they look all say YES.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get these before the weekend. I have a cavity right between my two front teeth and I am to be a bridesmaid in a wedding. These are too good to be true. They wont stay in my mouth and even if they would, they look ridiculous. My lip bulges out when they on.</li>
            <li> they look natural. my speech sounded funny at first but that goes away the more you wear them. I wish they were a little longer as my mouth is wide. But it works for me; I feel more confidant in them and wish they made bottoms.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten these a number of times. You get what they say you get. Gotta tweak &#x27;em a bit to fit your mouth but it&#x27;s all good. Fitting is firm n&#x27; they look natural.</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst things that is on the market. The directions that are included for the product are not user friendly.</li>
            <li> There easy to form but fall apart and look dingy even after cleaning...this isnt a solution to teeth problems its kinda embarrassing cuz u cnt eat while there in place.</li>
            <li> i was hoping the low reviews were form picky aholes or trolls who complain about everything well they are right. these suck could not get them to stay on, they do stick out but iv seen worse I ordered small and they look like horse teeth there is no real line definition between them and the gums are sickly/unhealthy looking. look like something out of a 25cent machine. I may just use them in some creepy craft project after a few alterations. I order because my teeth were over drilled 5 yrs ago and my fang teeth both have small but noticeable hole and my last 2 dentist visits have been horrible with them pulling and impacting my teeth so im waiting to find a new dentist. I had hope to get a few pics of my smiling with my kids these are a fail. Iv been using unscented candle wax on each hole and I swear it looks better than these did. I will post pic of these teeth once I get batteries in my camera.</li>
            <li> Look terrible fake. To thick and big to look natural</li>
            <li> Terrible want my money back</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy-Poor Quality-it looks awful.This should be more like $2.99 for Halloween. So think twice before buying  this sad product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok to occasional use, if you have bad front  teeth, or to hide the bad front teeth, until you can get to a dentist. You can&#x27;t eat with it in, you can however, drink with it in and it&#x27;s ok. You have to use a little denture cream to make it stay in place or it slips a little. I broke a front tooth and was a three week wait for an appt with my dentist, so I bought this to hide the broken tooth. It did it&#x27;s job, until the dentist did his.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the inventor and manufacturer of the Imako Cosmetic Teeth, and very proud of it. I put one star so people looking at the worst criticism would learn the truth. Each day I get tearful testimonials and blessings from customers . We have a 2% return rate, and often this is because they order two to decide which one to keep. We guarantee our product. We have NEVER harmed anyone&#x27;s teeth, never had to pay for anyone&#x27;s dental treatment, never been sued, never had to use our liability insurance and we have an A+ BBB rating. Maybe once a month we have an unhappy caller, but we can walk most of them through the fitting process. If this product were fairly reviewed it would have 5 stars. We are in mail order catalogs, and the competition is not, for good reason. We are selling maybe 25 times as many units. Look at their YouTube fitting instructions where 13,000 people have watched, as opposed to over 312,000 have watched ours. So take these reviews trashing Imako with a grain of salt. The savage criticism is fueled by bitter losers. There&#x27;s evidence mounting they are so desperate they are packaging and selling  fraudulent versions of Imako on Amazon, so let me know if this happens to you, and we will get these sellers banned from Amazon and prosecute them. The frauds will crack in half if you drop them.</li>
            <li> was not able to fit for use. The adhesive did not roll out the way it was illustrated when placed in hot water. Not satisfied at all. would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my mom as a temporary solution until she can get to the dentist. From what she tells me it was very easy to fit to her mouth. The color is still way to white. They look okay, but closeup they do not look natural. Not a bad buy for the price.</li>
            <li> I have purchased at least a dozen of these. I really looked bad before I got dentures and these teeth look real and gave me so much confidence. They are the best thing that ever happened to my mouth. Very comfortable</li>
            <li> These are OK, if you are taking a picture ( alone) Selfy picture that is..BUT you would not want to wear these out in public, unless maybe its Halloween. In a picture you cant tell..but in PERSON, the fakeness is VERY noticeable.</li>
            <li> You guys do not even deserve one star. Horrible horrible horrible. Did not fit. I followed directions and still didn&#x27;t work and a waste of hard earned money.</li>
            <li> i choose a four star because i am happy with my teeth. i would recommend the cosmetic teeth to any one with bad teeth that they wont to cover up.</li>
            <li> They fit..look wonderful..the directions were a little difficult to get right..so practice on the first one and the 2nd will be just right</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 4 sets of these just because I like backups .Easy to fit if you follow directions. very natural looking. I can even eat with these teeth when fitted right.Just take your time and refit as many times as it takes. I love these teeth.</li>
            <li> I chose it because there was no lower one!It was cheaply made impossible to use and ugly! I want my money back!</li>
            <li> I received my cosmetic teeth today. They arrived in two days. So I&#x27;m very happy about the shipment process.&lt;br /&gt;The teeth arrived as described and I ordered some extra beads and pink plastic just incase needed. It took me several weeks reviewing and watching videos of the Imako teeth and the secure teeth before I settled on one. And from all that I could gather imako was the best choice for me. However I was still concerned because of the bad reviews I had come across. But no where as many as secure smile. The teeth arrived as described and I was a little nervous but I got right to it and began to mold and shape my teeth. I decided on not using the pink plastic bc I have a low gum line and from other reviews it seem to be easier by doing it this way. Although I will say I had already decided before hand I would use some denture glue to hold my teeth in place. It took a few tries to get the perfect mold and shape to my mouth and even now I keep going back looking in the mirror and finding minor things to adjust. At first my top lipped poked out and I felt like bugs bunny so I decided to tweak them a little and I cut off some of the plastic on the back and even trimmed down the gums and shaped a few teeth to my liking. This process is what took the longest and it wasn&#x27;t a easy process,the plastic is very hard to cut into. But after several attempts I was successful. I&#x27;ve only had them for a few hours and they still are new to me. But my husband thinks they are great and he says you can&#x27;t tell they are fake and trust me he would tell me if he thought I looked like bugs bunny. Lol...I took several pictures of me smiling and I&#x27;m starting to get comfortable. They do look fabulous in pictures but I&#x27;m still a bit worried that people will be able to detect they are fake. Lord I hope not bc I&#x27;m already embarrassed enough that I had to purchase such a thing but it was for good reasons. My teeth are very brittle I inherited a gum disease. I have several missing teeth and broken teeth. My bottom teeth are just now becoming brittle. But I still have some time to possibly save those. I am terrified of the dentist. I have dental insurance but my fear stops me form getting the work done that needs to be done but I&#x27;ve promised myself that this time next year I will have my teeth fixed bc as we know cosmetic teeth are only  temp. but I&#x27;m fine with it for now and I plan to order another pair soon for a back up. I am a army wife Ive let my teeth stop me from getting to know people and that causes a very lonely me during deployment. We are going to a new duty station and these teeth will give me the confidence I need to meet people. These  are perfect for anyone who has broken and rotten teeth. I&#x27;m not sure how it would fit with someone who has a full set of teeth but I imagine you would look like bugs bunny. But I could be wrong so don&#x27;t let that stop you from having a beautiful smile. And I ordered mine from the actual  company not sure if it makes a difference  and paid 46.00 with shipping and extra beads. But it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> This product did not fit well and looked extremely fake. It made my mouth protrude. I sounded horrible, too. It might work for some, but, it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price.  They look a bit phony, but way better than my teeth!</li>
            <li> You know how at Halloween there are novelty teeth sold for costuming? This product is not even qualified to be of that quality.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s garbage! And it will not work.&lt;br /&gt;There is a very small ridge behind the front gum of this product meant to overlap those remaining teeth that you have so as to secure this item, with bonding agent, so as to afford a full tooth smile. That ridge is so small there is no bonding agent that will work.&lt;br /&gt;No matter how long you soak this appliance in the hot water, as directed with the little page of directions that come with, it still feels like a stiff bit of plastic in your mouth. It is not as pliable in the mouth as when it comes out of the hot water. It starts to stiffen just that quickly. And if feels weird so that you won&#x27;t be comfortable wearing it if you do try to percevier and fit it in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And you had better not be planning to go anywhere where you&#x27;ll have to actually speak if you do try to keep this false teeth appliance in. Because it will slip and fall out almost as soon as you open your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ridge that&#x27;s on the back part of the top gum part that you see in the picture here is so narrow no adhesive can be applied that is going to hold it fast, nor prevent that adhesive from falling on your tongue after a bit. Because there isn&#x27;t enough room for this tiny ridge to overlap your good available teeth as they are to anchor this appliance that is meant to fill that gap of missing one&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a YouTube video about this appliance that does not allow you to post comments without moderator approval. That&#x27;s because, unlike here, all those dissatisfied customers will be able to forewarn potential buyers not to waste their money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously! This product is far more expensive than costume teeth and yet it&#x27;s not even able to be said to be the quality of costume teeth. Get to a dentist and spend the money that will give you a proper corrected smile that will last and make your cost an investment.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise this product, worthy of no star rating if the Amazon server system would allow it, is only going to make the manufacturer richer.

            <li> This product is not what was expected.  It&#x27;s positively awful.  I sent it back and would advise others not to purchase.</li>
            <li> They are ok just not something I would wear 24/7 they  hurt your mouth after awhile but makes my smile look better !</li>
            <li> these are really nice and they look rea. makes a big difference in your appearance. product is very well worth the price</li>
            <li> If you want to look like a cheap horse, it&#x27;s for you. I would not recommend it to my worst enemy.  Well, maybe the very worst.</li>
            <li> ok for about 1 week then they are no good..better off getting the cheaper one. These are hard to mold to teeth and if you drink coffee don&#x27;t even bother.</li>
            <li> Look ridiculous,seriously would like to see a picture of an actual customer with them on.</li>
            <li> Ordered this product and it was not what I expected. I did not even use the product but was unable to return it. Very unhappy, anytime I tried to get information about returning I was either blown off or was told I can not have a refund. It still sits in a drawer, collecting dust because I am unable to use it!</li>
            <li> They are good but discoloration is fast</li>
            <li> These cosmetic teeth are a little weird...and their version of \\&quot;small\\&quot; still look like horse teeth.  They are easy to use compared to Secure Smile, but look patently fake.  Not enough of the beads used to secure them.</li>
            <li> Excellent product ..,</li>
            <li> Working in customer service, as the district manager for a National restaurant chain, My smile is worth Millions... Little do they know, my smile was actually purchased on Amazon.com! During my pregnancy, i developed a condition that started to tear thru my mouth and soften/broke almost all of my teeth! It&#x27;s embarrassing and depressing to not be able to smile without wondering what people think of your teeth, but with my &amp;#34;new teeth&amp;#34; people always compliment my smile and I can laugh without covering my mouth! Love this product, it was a total lifesaver (and JOB saver) for me! I will say, i DO buy a new set every 4-5 months, because after wearing them 7 days a week, 12 hours a day, they start to get stained very quickly. DO NOT SMOKE with them in! They will INSTANTLY turn yellow/brown and your smile will be worse than before!!</li>
            <li> Good temporary fix....</li>
            <li> I was really hoping the fit would feel comfy, unfortunately, it did not. Felt and looked SO fake! Almost as if I were wearing Halloween kids play vampire teeth :/ I personally did not like. But that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical of these, but I ended up loving them. I love my smile! You may get a lisp, and notice more saliva producing, but it&#x27;s well worth it. I will be using this product until I can actually get my teeth fixed and perfect. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the teeth it was too big for my mouth and i got the smallest size available it stick out like horse teeth I&#x27;ve never worn them outside of my room i wish i could get a refund...</li>
            <li> The teeth are so small they would only fit the mouth of a young child.  I was not able to use this item at all.  It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I received the advertised product. Very disappointed, but &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ll wear them for Halloween, they&#x27;re a costume, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for asking, please stop emailing me now.</li>
            <li> I was surprised when this arrived.  I had the impression that these were a snap on device.  They are not.  A flat rubbery device formed into teeth and gums needs to worked on quite a bit before you can fit them on your teeth.  THEY DO NOT COME ALREADY PREPARED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to have simmering water in a pot, a snipping tool and it will probably take you a couple hours of work to make it fit properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For 30 dollars, it&#x27;s too much work for little gain.  Pass on this item...it&#x27;s just frustrating and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> They do the job.  Got these for my daughter, she needed more teeth to really make a good fit.</li>
            <li> no negatives.  this is a &amp;#34;glad to have it&amp;#34; item</li>
            <li> So far, so good. This is my first using my Imako Teeth and pretty much loving them. I would definitely recommend them to others who are unable to smile due to dental problem.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product. Too much work involved.  I would rather have had something to paste over my teeth.</li>
            <li> Great for their purpose</li>
            <li> Since my teeth are serious need of repair I have been using these. People tell me they look fairly real</li>
            <li> Terrible, would not buy, should be taken off the market!</li>
            <li> I have been using them as a replacement for dentures for over a year, I have only has to replace them one time because I overheated them.  They look great and are far more comfortable then Dentures. You can not eat with them, and I would not wear them to sleep but if you are looking for something to hold you over until you get your dentures, or if you are like me and just can not stand wearing them this are perfect. I fit them with the melted beads,then I use Denture Adhesive to keep them in a bit tighter. I want to note I have all my top teeth removed so I have idea how they would work with someone who has teeth lol.</li>
            <li> They look like the fake teeth you can buy at a toy store.</li>
            <li> These are awesome! I have no top teeth and so was taking a big chance that these would even work. Well, it took about two hours of fiddling around with them to get it right, but my persistence paid off big time. I used all the gum material to get the gums to go over the ridge of bone above where my teeth used to be then sucked real hard for a minute. That caused a suction and it really holds. The only thing is I have to put pretty hot water in my mouth and swish then suck hard to get a good suction that keeps them in place every time I wear them. Totally worth it though...I can smile again!!</li>
            <li> does not fit well...hard to to talk with it on...\&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DONT BUY</li>
            <li> still have them and I love them</li>
            <li> I am very happy with them!  I can smile now!! Thank u! I have always had teeth problems and can afford to fix them now. Now I can smile without covering my mouth:-)</li>
            <li> I had a few teeth that looked pretty bad in front so I purchased the imako natural colored teeth and they were easy to shape over my other teeth .Everyone thought I had costmetic set work..I love my teeth I have been able to smile and love it .I feel like a movie star .</li>
            <li> It was not shipped as promised and was too small!! Please be more clear regarding sizing!!</li>
            <li> On time shipment. Product worked as described.</li>
            <li> Ok. I&#x27;m going to be as honest as I possibly can be here. You can see from the photo, they look great, especially for photos. I just received them today. It took me four tries to mold them for the proper fit in my mouth. But, once that was actually accomplished. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the results! I am awaiting some implants for two teeth I am missing, so I am very happy to have this to cover up the missing teeth!! For the price, and ease of use, I can not complain. I was extremely skeptical to buy these, but I did think hey its only 30$. Why not try it? And I&#x27;m sooo glad that I did!! I&#x27;m reading some of these bad reviews, and I&#x27;m wondering a few things. Did you mold it properly? Did you take the time out to really try and get a good fit in your mouth? What did you expect? An at home miracle that would look like porcelain veneers from a dentists office? Let&#x27;s be realistic.. If you purchase this product not having the expectation of veneers, you will be extremely pleased! Yes, it does cover your teeth, it protrudes a little, not a lot. I do not look like Mr.Ed, I do not have buckteeth either. I think you should be very careful in the measuring of your teeth with this product. I love it and am extremely satisfied!!</li>
            <li> I have purchased a second one to have as back up.  What a difference they make.  The gum area looks very natural and they are comfortable to wear. It might be because I have been a customer of invisalign - which were considerably more bulky.  It does take a time or two to get the fit just right, but as others have said, take your time and be patient.  This is not what you want to do if rushed for time.  Once you get a fit they easily pop in and out.  I have read many reviews and am working on solutions to keep them a natural color.  To secure a little better I sometimes use a small amount of denture cream - gives me a little more confidence.  I have also, although not recommended, left them in while eating.  My bite is clear from any of the product and so I can still use my own teeth to chew.  My enamel on a front tooth has been slightly eroded (due to tons of lemonade) and wearing these make such a difference - I&#x27;m smiling again.</li>
            <li> I dont know much about this.  My daughter bought this and uses it.  I guess it is good, i really dont know</li>
            <li> After reading lots of reviews and never smiling I decided to purchase the Imako teeth. My teeth to me are an embarrassment. I have one large tooth missing which results in me never smiling and trying to talk through a closed mouth. I decided on Imako as I currently don&#x27;t have the funds to get my teeth sorted and this was an affordable option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the teeth on a Wednesday and had them by Saturday which was brilliant. On opening the teeth and trying them I would advise that you read the instructions several times and you may need to refit them several times also. It took me nine attempts to fit the teeth till I was happy. Once they were fitted they did look very large in my mouth almost horsey like, so I took to them with my nail filer and shaved off a good few mm. After this they looked a lot better and actually looked like real teeth it wasn&#x27;t obvious that they were fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am please that I purchased these and I do wear them all the time. They are comfy and I feel a lot more happier about my teeth and appearance. The best thing about them is finally having photos were I am actually smiling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a lisp with these and even though I have a large overbite these don&#x27;t make it any worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend these but also advise that if you willing to do some tweaking then you will be very happy. The unhappy customers must of given up on the first try. The only other thing I can advise is to make sure the water is boiling hot and on hand for a few tries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck and happy smiling</li>
            <li> It does look a little juvenile..up on the top where the pink is.  extremely white..After a couple days of wearing them and reshaping they did the job..They shipped quickly and I was pleased and knew what I was getting.</li>
            <li> I took quite a while before deciding to spend the cash - $40 may not be a lot to some...but is to me!  I have 5 kiddos and after my 2nd, my teeth started to deteriorate quickly.  I am 40 now and facing the facts that dentures are in my near future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am starting a business and it is getting more and more challenging to find ways to talk to people while hiding my dilapidated grin,  People just do not take me seriously as a non-crack-headed human with missing, broken and cavity ridden teeth,  I cannot afford just yet to get a massive dental overhaul so started looking around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading very mixed reviews I was anxious to get them and see if I wasted my money.  They arrived quickly and as described.  I ordered the &#x27;Natural&#x27; and size &#x27;Small&#x27;. I don&#x27;t think sudden bright white teeth would have been believable even to myself.  The &#x27;teeth covers&#x27; are flat and artificial looking. I didn&#x27;t have high hopes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions could have been written a little easier, i.e. Step 1, Step 2, etc. So I would recommend reading the little booklet carefully and repeatedly prior to jumping in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they say hot water...they mean it.  Tap water didn&#x27;t cut it so had to microwave it.  When you begin the &#x27;molding&#x27; process it adamantly states do NOT leave them in your mouth for longer than 2 minutes.  This made me nervous, so I think I barely left mine in a minute. They still turned out ok.  I did have to re-submerge in hot water a few times to adjust and re-adjust but if you practice patience, it will pay off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised at how securely they did fit.  It is a little weird the first time trying them on when you&#x27;re all done.  I FELT horse-ish but when I looked in the mirror is wasn&#x27;t near as bad as I thought it would.  My family gave me mixed reviews.  Before I re-adjusted, my hubby agreed with me that I looked a little Denzel Washington-y.  My youngest just gave me a disapproving look but I think it&#x27;s just because they are so usedto seeing me natural, that it gave them pause. Everyone else was just happy to see me smile. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gums are light but my lips covered them. I didn&#x27;t have any problems speaking although when I LOL they do slip a bit so I will just have to be mindful of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am pleased.  I took a selfie on my phone...SMILING! Never did that before! Next stop will be going out in public. It will be weird  not being afraid to talk to the cashier at the grocery store for fear he/she will see my shame.  At worse, they will get a close up and think they are false ...beats the alternative so I&#x27;m a happy camper!</li>
            <li> These were the right ones for me. They fit right and great for quick easy touch up for social events.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if these were going to work for me but was pleasantly surprised at how easy they were to fit and look great.</li>
            <li> they do not work like they say they would, I would not recommend any one to buy them never ever</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review before even though I constantly buy stuf off of Amazon but I&#x27;m in love with these. I never smiled with my mouth open before I got these. Defiantly a good buy. I recommend 100%. It took me a couple tries to fit them in because I used wayyy too much plastic but they fit comfterably and they don&#x27;t get in the way of any of my piercings witch is amazing. If you have any questions about them or want to see more photos text me @ (513) 967- 5061 💜</li>
            <li> I bought my first pair 2 months ago...they were ok, but stained very very quickly...Second pair the same exact thing happened but I had such a harder time getting them to fit for some reason.  Each time I tried to refit them and reheat the plastic the fitting got worse because as you heat up the plastic it spreads so unevenly each additional time and it makes for a very poor fitting process.  Additionally, because the plastic spreads, you always have to remove excess plastic from the teeth portion (as it drips below the teeth or under them) and you inevitably lose more plastic which leaves less  plastic for molding capability. This makes it virtually impossible to get them to fit whatsoever and mold properly to your own teeth. I would say 2 times is the charm.  After that, the teeth will not fit properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So keeping that in mind and ignoring Imako&#x27;s claims you can remold them as many times as needed,  you just have to be really diligent about the fitting process and be careful to follow directions closely and not rush, so you get it right the first or second time.  You can&#x27;t keep reheating the plastic as it eventually just spreads out too much and ruins the fit.  As so far as staining goes, you need to be really careful and diligent about cleaning and preventing stains. It stinks because so many drinks and foods cause staining and these things are very porous, so no way they are going to stay pristine white, no matter what you use to clean and protect.  I contacted the person who handles complaints and she made some recommendations with regard to preventing staining.  So I am going to give it another try and see what happens.  I will post updates after I see how the produuct works out with her rcommendations.  Let&#x27;s face it, they are not a permanent solution and really should only be worn until something permanent is done.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my grandmother and they did not fit, we couldn&#x27;t get them to sick on. It was a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Hurts the gum line really bad! Can only wear for about 1/2 an hour at the most. But does give he appearance of real teeth. Hard to talk. Can&#x27;t eat or drink because they will not stay seated on gum line. Have molded fit several times and can&#x27;t get a comfortable and/or stable fit.</li>
            <li> Not a great fit but great in a pinch</li>
            <li> Didnt fit and it looked SO fake! Its more embarrasing to wear this!</li>
            <li> After reading the mixed reviews I was a little unsure about wether or not to purchase the imakos... I AM SO GLAD I DID! I will admit fitting them took me 3 tries but once they are fit they stay in perfectly! I can actually smile again and I can&#x27;t stop looking in the mirror at them! When you talk at first your speech is a litle lispy but it does get better. Deffinetly try this product you will not regret it!!</li>
            <li> This product looks like &amp;#34;horse teeth&amp;#34;.  I would not recommend any one to buy this product.  The pictures are deceiving.</li>
            <li> The product was not what it was suppose to be, it didn&#x27;t work like it was suppose to! The little beads they send you did not do what they were suppose to ,nothing worked like they said it would,please don&#x27;t waste your money,it is not worth it!</li>
            <li> does not look anything like the pic, don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> They are great!!!&#x27;And very easy</li>
            <li> Well I was in an accident and 2 of my front teeth chipped and looked horrible. I don&#x27;t have insurance to get them fixed and have had really low self esteem ever since. It&#x27;s hard dating when your teeth look like s***! So I was looking online and found the Imako. When I got it in the mail I was a little worried because it was flat...it didn&#x27;t look like it was going to fit to my teeth. Well after about 2 tries I got a perfect fit! I am so happy with this purchase, i love it!! It does the job I want it to do and I can smile and laugh now with out having to worry about my teeth. I think they def look realistic and so does my family. It looks like you have veneers! Is recommend this to anyone lookin for a cheap fix to ugly teeth!!</li>
            <li> They came in the mail sooner then expected, so I was happy about that. They were pretty easy to customize to my smile. The instructions it comes with are a little difficult to understand and follow, so I suggest watching the video. For $40, these work out great! I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my smile, which has never happened before in my life. When I first put them in, I smiled and started crying from joy. I highly recommend this product to who ever feels ashamed of their smile. It has boosted my confidence level so much! I hope this helps you decide to use it or not.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> These cosmetic teeth look real and make me look 100% better as opposed to looking like a Jack-o-Lantern. They are easy to shape and form and very light to hold in your hand. I like the small case to put them in, too.</li>
            <li> I should of known by the cost..... It&#x27;s impossible to wear these in public. If I had only read the other reviews, I would not have bought them. Very disappointed....</li>
            <li> It looks so natural u can not tell they are cosmetic. I highly recommend it I would only like for them to be stronger so I can eat with them.</li>
            <li> I wasted $40. It seemed like a good idea but don&#x27;t do it. I spent hours trying to get the right fit and failed.</li>
            <li> It will work if you need something fast so that you can attend a function and want nice looking teeth. I wasn&#x27;t that impressed with it at all.</li>
            <li> The natural colored smalls are what I ordered.&lt;br /&gt; They look a LITTLE fake but not that noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I have had many compliments from people asking when I had my teeth fixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally suggest you try this brand before ANY of the others.  I have tried instant smile and Imako is much nicer.&lt;br /&gt;Extremely thin and if you watch the fitting video and then read/watch other youtube fitting videos you will be able to adjust the Imakos&lt;br /&gt;perfectly in a few days!!</li>
            <li> The confidence I got when first I smiled at someone (that had never met me before) swelled within me.  That same confidence diminished somewhat when I forgot I had them in and tried to bit into a slice of pizza, however - I learned how to roll with them and slip them off when I eat.&lt;br /&gt;Brush the back of them with tooth paste and rinse each time to keep the mouthpiece sweet.</li>
            <li> will be future ordering thanks</li>
            <li> It is worse that Halloween teeth. You can see from far away it is fake. I lost my money and time.</li>
            <li> Would not adapt to my teeth. Warped in the hot water, I&#x27;ll just go to my dentist and pay $1500.00 for a flipper.</li>
            <li> Great going to order another set I had to refit them a couple of times but very pleased. I thought I would have to pay thousands of dollars but for a temporary fix amazing. Thank You</li>
            <li> The item was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> I tried the SecSmile. Wasn&#x27;t happy. They stuck out too far, weren&#x27;t wide enough to cover the teeth near the back and were rather rigid.  Thought I&#x27;d give these a try. I am very pleased with them.  They&#x27;re softer, flatter, wider. Took me about 4 tries to get them to fit. No problems talking. Looks hella better than a gaping hole from a missing tooth. I&#x27;m no longer self-conscious and am looking forward to going out in public more. IMO great temporary solution until a more permanent fix can be had.</li>
            <li> Worst purchase every made don&#x27;t waste your money or time I ended up going with lab direct go to press  on veeners now that is worth the money</li>
            <li> What was I thinking? Dreaming, I suppose. Maybe these work for someone, but not me. I should have paid more attention to the word &#x27;novelty&#x27; in the title because that is exactly what they ended up looking like.</li>
            <li> Incredible.  Went out last night with these and no could tell. The ladies all said I had a nice smile. My confidence is raisin by the minute.  Will be funny to bring a woman home with her push up bra and spanks to hold it all in. She removes and suddenly it&#x27;s a different person. Now I can have a suprise for her. I have 4 full teeth left on top and getting top dentures when I can pay for them but with these my smile is back. Took me about 6 times to get fit I liked but now they snap in. I use poligrip for extra hold. Just remember when you first get thy look like &amp;#34;that&#x27;s it&amp;#34; but once you play with and get right you won&#x27;t be feeling that way.</li>
            <li> Despite following the instructions, reading many reviews, and watching the instructional video man times, these simply would not stay put.  Complete waste of money.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this produc to anyone.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was hoping for but it is okay.And a little hard to do by yourself the first time.</li>
            <li> I am sorry I purchase this product. It &#x27;a a waste of my hard earned money. The teeth look so fake it &#x27;a not even funny.</li>
            <li> The teeth didn&#x27;t stay curved or stay on, the edges are sharp, and when I talked, the teeth &#x27;whistled&#x27;. Not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> These work great.&lt;br /&gt;When fitted correctly you don&#x27;t notice them in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;The teeth are natural in color and look very nice.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the reviews under the Imako teeth sold here and by others on Amazon. I went to the \\&quot;Products For Fun\\&quot; website and read the instructions on&lt;br /&gt;how to use the Instant Smile teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remarkably, I found that the people who are saying negative things about the Imako teeth are trying to fit them by following instructions given by the \\&quot;instant Smile\\&quot; company.&lt;br /&gt;Although they are saying that they followed the instructions Imako gave them to the letter \\&quot;T\\&quot;, this simply is not true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One person said something about the white beads not being sticky enough to hold the teeth in her mouth..Instant smile tells you to do this. For Imako the white beads are&lt;br /&gt;used to fill in the gaps for missing teeth to keep the shell from being weaker where a person has no teeth, and for no other purpose.&lt;br /&gt;Another person said that she placed the pink material on the back of her own teeth, which is where Instant smile says to put the white beads (actually they say to tuck&lt;br /&gt;them up behind all of the top teeth)....but you don&#x27;t put any of Imako&#x27;s material behind any of your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;There are many more things said by people that give me the idea that they have used the Instant smile teeth and are trying to adapt the instructions to Imako.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beads aren&#x27;t meant to be sticky or hold in the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;The impressions you make of your own teeth while the shell is soft and hot, when hard again is what holds the shell in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;There is no need to use any kind of cream/paste or strip.&lt;br /&gt;The beads are used to fill in gaps. The pink piece is for the top of the shell for comfort of your gums.</li>
            <li> it was nothing like they said and could not get it to fit right,do not buy this product not any good</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work for us like we assumed by reading about it, would not recommend or purchase again</li>
            <li> I was excited to try these out because the reviews were good.. But not what I expected.. I have molded them over and over and they still do not fit right... Maybe its just me! But wish I didn&#x27;t buy these.</li>
            <li> It was the worse I thought they would look real an stay in place. NOT</li>
            <li> This works, received them yesterday and it took about an hour to fit. Went right out into the world and had the best day ever.  Buying more.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money! This does not work. Doesn&#x27;t fit and never stays in your mouth. Tried it several times, followed instructions and still couldn&#x27;t get it right.</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t adhere to my teeth. I tried it over and over. I threw it away.it was not what I had hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> These are horrible.  They make you look like a horse.  I filed them down so much they disintegrated, just trying to make them not stick out so much.  Total waste of money...</li>
            <li> I feel like these were a total waste of money. They are too thin and flimsy to stay in place or hold their shape. Everything was in the package that was supposed to be, and I had no problems using/molding the wax, but the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; themselves are just terrible in my opinion. Would not recommend. Save your money.</li>
            <li> I can say this would be good for Halloween, but to wear this like they are are real dentures.... don&#x27;t do it to yourself. Halloween or child pagents.... that is it.</li>
            <li> did not work an broke</li>
            <li> Did not look as realistic as we hoped and were difficult to form.  Awkward to work with, shipping was prompt</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t perfect but it does work. It takes several tries to get the fit right. Do not try to eat with it, it will not work. I have a few teeth missing and it covers it great I can finally smile again. So for me this is the perfect product to cover my teeth while I&#x27;m working to get the money for a permeant fix at the dentist.</li>
            <li> Due to medical problems, I&#x27;ve had my teeth fracture and break off causing numerous extractions in the last 2 years.  I am very self conscious (my wife says vain) and found I was becoming more of a recluse due to the condition of my teeth.  The cost was almost prohibitive (about $500 per tooth in front (X3) and still my smile would show missing teeth.  I saw this product and decided even if it didn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;ve spent more and received less.  Well, I&#x27;ve had them for 7 days now and thought I would write a review.  They are plastic (what I would expect for the price) but once in are difficult to tell they are.  It was more difficult to fit properly than the video shows, but the upside is...you can do it as many times as you need to (I have redone mine 4 different times now and each time they fit a little better).  Guess practice makes perfect.  I wish I knew how to put pictures on this review, so you can see the difference in my smile.  I realize this is a temporary fix to my dental problem, but I am very impressed with this Imako product.  No, I can&#x27;t eat with them...they are after all plastic.  I wear them when I am out among people (which is why I bought them) and so far other than my brother, no one has noticed them.  I consider that a good sign as there have been no stares.  I have worn them 4-8 hours per day since receiving them...are they comfortable?  I know they are there, but they don&#x27;t hurt my mouth and affect my speech very little.  If the condition of your teeth are a major concern and you can&#x27;t afford to have them fixed...this is a great alternative.  Just don&#x27;t expect them to look like $4000 veneers.</li>
            <li> I was going to return these, but got them to not be so painful.  I have a flipper that was lost and I just got it replaced.  I had hoped that this product would be something I could use all the time, but they are \\&quot;cosmetic\\&quot;.  I will keep them with me in my purse, in case I leave home without the flipper.  So they do look nice, and they fit nice, they just are to nice so thus they look not as real.  My dentist was quite impressed with them.</li>
            <li> These are great, but the first time I molded a set they came out a little wierd.  It&#x27;s tricky.  I would suggest getting a second one 1. in case you lose, damage, or  stain it (clear nailpolish prevents this somewhat) and 2. In case you screw the first one up badly and it&#x27;s too difficult to remold.  Follow the instructions CAREFULLY!</li>
            <li> They protrude so it looks like I have buck teeth</li>
            <li> Teeth were tiny not just small. The photos made it look totally different from the flat product that arrived. I didn&#x27;t even try them since they were less than the size of my teeth. I forgot to send them back. Recycle!</li>
            <li> I never did use these. I ordered small but received a large. I thought maybe my husband would try them but he didn&#x27;t want to. Still in the package maybe one day will find something to do with them. I thought of sending them back but just to much hassle.</li>
            <li> The imako cosmetic teeth have been a great joy I like to smile now and my hand isnt in front of my face anymore. I have next to no pallett and the teeth were cutable and fitablr to a point of great ease and resulted in a comfortable and natural look of confidence. Thank you for youre genius</li>
            <li> good product, buy the sealer. without it they stain very easily.</li>
            <li> I was not sure if these teeth could help me but I honestly can say that they did the job.  I had to send my partial out for repair and I was left with  two front teeth missing and none on the left side.  I ordered the Imako teeth in a small, watched the video and I tell you I was so amazed at the fit and results.  No one knew I was wearing them.  I am keeping these in the case and will order a pair just to keep on hand.  Thank You Imako</li>
            <li> a little hard to get set up but then they are ok for occasional use  they do look good tho</li>
            <li> I have degenerative bone disease and a moderate calcium deficiency and because of these two issues, my teeth are pretty much shot and in a few months I&#x27;ll be getting dentures.  However, I&#x27;m starting college in a few days and I wanted something to make my teeth not look like crap until my dental surgery.  Bad teeth are embarassing and I just wanted to look nice.  After reading reviews and watching comparison videos, I decided on the Imako.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying these was a complete waste of money.  I was so desperate for a temporary solution until my surgery that I fell for, what I see as, as the modern day equivelant of a snake oil salesman, or those conscienceless homeopaths who say they can cure cancer with herbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I had fitted the Imakos and had them in my mouth, my upper lip stuck out noticeably far.  The &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; themselves looked comical, like something you&#x27;d wear on Halloween.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered these straight from the Imako website but I&#x27;m posting my review here because I doubt they&#x27;d let me post a bad review on their site.  I definitely do NOT recommend these.  Please, listen to the bad reviews here and not the good ones...I wish I had.</li>
            <li> Very fake looking, Hard to get molded, and if you have a broke tooth it will break it even more when you try to remove the product ( even with warm/hot water)</li>
            <li> So like I ordered this I think around the 15th of May.  It did take quite some time to get to me but within the time it said and it was well worth the wait.  I am 30 and I have always hated my teeth.  They are small and spaced out and one is crooked.  I have always been told I have a &#x27;beautiful smile&#x27; but I never knew why people would say that.  I actually ordered the other cheaper teeth before I ordered these.  Those teeth made by BillyBob or whatever were horribly big and kinda goofy looking... I couldnt even keep them in my mouth.  Wasted money... shrugs but anyway I came back to these Imako teeth and decided to go on and pay the extra money for them.  So glad I did!  I can talk in them I have sipped a slushee drink from the corner store with them in.  They fit great and they look alot more natural than the other ones I ordered. I have been smiling sooo much in my pics now! My smile really does look beautiful now.  Thank You.</li>
            <li> could not get to work correctly and look real</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fit and they make your lip stick out. This product was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Followed the instruction to a tee. Bought them for my mom. Didn&#x27;t look right at all.</li>
            <li> I am missing all four of my front teeth and my self esteem has suffered horribly because of it (I&#x27;m a 24 year old woman), so I figured I&#x27;d give these a shot. Like someone else said, if you&#x27;re missing more than a few teeth, ESPECIALLY front teeth, don&#x27;t bother. The product didn&#x27;t have enough to grip without front teeth so I couldn&#x27;t get a good fit, and even the small size was too big and my gums still hurt from being scraped. It kinda stayed in my mouth but I sounded like I was talking around, well, fake teeth, and there was too much of the pink stuff up under my gums so I looked like a horse. All in all I was probably better off buying a $2 pair of fake teeth from a halloween store because that&#x27;s what this amounted to.</li>
            <li> At first i was unsure about this product but after buying it and fiting it i now cant stop smiling i have a missing tooth and my teeth are not straight and my teeth are stained with this product you cant even tell this is my blessing warning you have to have plenty of patience when fiting it cause it is nerve wrecking but once you get it youll love it plus you can refit it if needed</li>
            <li> Due to a motorcycle accident I have 3 1/2 missing front teeth and anything would look better then gaps. Up close these will not fool anyone, but are great for normal conversation distances and pictures. I will eventually go to &amp;#34;Snap-on Smile&amp;#34;, but I live on a fixed income and that may take awhile. Until then, I&#x27;ll order a few more sets of Imako Cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Its a cool product. It takes a little getting used to and they are obvious when you are up close and smiling a lot but for casual encounters, shooting video etc... they work.</li>
            <li> BETTER THAN MY NEIGHBORS REAL TEETH.</li>
