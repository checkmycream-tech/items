            <li>I am using at night before I go to bed and it absorbs nicely but still enough moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The deep forehead lines softened after a few weeks but the best part was the pores tightened up</li>
            <li>One of my best friend&#x27;s ordered it before I did and can&#x27;t say enough about the difference it&#x27;s making for her in less than one week&#x27;s time!</li>
            <li>buy loads of everything on Amazon and this is the first time alarm bells are ringing.&lt;br /&gt;Probably being paranoid but will not purchase</li>
            <li>:) I&#x27;ve only been using this for 2 mos or so</li>
            <li>and I may go over the top a little on the drops, otherwise I&#x27;m pretty sure it could last about 4 mos.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a topical vitamin C and E to help with fine lines and large pores.  </li>
            <li>I was going to purchase this item and also the clay but noticed that all the rave reviews are from the people who have given the whole line of products from this seller rave reviews and haven&#x27;t really reviewed much else on Amazon&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> I am not sure about this product. It feels like water, and I am not sure that it is working. I used it only a couple of times, and it did not blow me away. I have not seen any results yet.</li>
            <li> I love this product. This absorbs in my skin quickly. My skin feels great and I am noticing fading of an age spot and reduction in wrinkles</li>
            <li> I love this serum! I was looking for a topical vitamin C and E to help with fine lines and large pores.  I tried a vitamin C serum many years ago but disliked the tingly burn it gave me. This one did not burn at all and dried very quick. The deep forehead lines softened after a few weeks but the best part was the pores tightened up and the skin took on a velvety look within days, like I had applied a light powder. It was only this awesome serum used daily. And it doesn&#x27;t take much at all to cover the entire face and neck. I am very happy I found it and will keep using it.</li>
            <li> I am editing my initial 5 star review of this product and lowering it to 2 stars.  After using this product twice a day for almost 3 weeks now I have failed to see the same results I have gotten in the past from using other CE Feurlic acid serums.  I&#x27;m not sure why this serum has not worked like the more costly  Paula&#x27;s Choice C serum I have used with great results since the alive ingredients are almost the same, but it hasn&#x27;t and I am quite disappointed.  I have now ordered products from OZ and hope to see better results</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!  I can see my brown spots getting lighter and lighter!!  I like the way it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all either!!</li>
            <li> Stubborn dark spots have markedly diminished in a month.</li>
            <li> I was going to purchase this item and also the clay but noticed that all the rave reviews are from the people who have given the whole line of products from this seller rave reviews and haven&#x27;t really reviewed much else on Amazon&lt;br /&gt;I buy loads of everything on Amazon and this is the first time alarm bells are ringing.&lt;br /&gt;Probably being paranoid but will not purchase</li>
            <li> I really like this - I have been using it on my face and now started to make my husband use it too for his brown spots.  I had a question on this product about the scent and they explained they made this perfectly neutral which is nice so that men and women alike will enjoy it. I&#x27;m glad they did so my husband doesn&#x27;t think he&#x27;s putting on some girly vitamin c serum. Very excited to see the results! I&#x27;ve read so much about how good vitamin c is for your face and am happy I have found a brand and seller that is very open about the products and only uses the best ingredients!</li>
            <li> My skin seems to thirst for this product.  It soaks it up and I am noticing a considerable difference after 7 days of using the product.  I use it under my regular moisturizer and my makeup goes on just fine following it in the mornings.  It says use once a day, but I sometimes cheat and use it in the evenings as well.</li>
            <li> I use the whole Perfect Body Harmony line and really like the results so far.  I use this serum at night and focus on my eyes, mouth, and forehead.  After three weeks, I see a softening of the wrinkles, especially around the eyes - woo hoo!</li>
            <li> What a great value! I&#x27;ve tried Skinceuticals products with Vitamin C and salicylic acid that were twice the price, and gave no better results. My skin tends to get fine bumps and look dull. This serum cleared up the bumps and brightened my skin beautifully.  This gem of a product is now in my permanent skin care regimen!</li>
            <li> I love this but it&#x27;s a little expensive so i can&#x27;t buy as often as I feel I need to use it....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I look any younger, but at least I don&#x27;t look any older! It applies watery, dries and my face feels good. After a bit I apply a moisturizer. I apply night and morning. I bought more so I guess I think it must be doing something :) I&#x27;ve only been using this for 2 mos or so and I may go over the top a little on the drops, otherwise I&#x27;m pretty sure it could last about 4 mos.</li>
            <li> I have been using this  product twice a day for about a month, and it is amazing. I added it to my&lt;br /&gt;daily cleansing regiment and have been more than pleased at the overall softness and smoothness of&lt;br /&gt;my skin.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product from a friend and a relative.  After complimenting them on how great their skin looks, both raved about it being the freshest and best smelling Vitamin C serum they have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can hardly wait for my order to be delivered next week!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the Perfect Body Harmony products. The BEST Vitamin CE Serum used before the Vitamin C Moisture Cream is amazing. In just two weeks my skin looks brighter and feels smoother. I am using at night before I go to bed and it absorbs nicely but still enough moisturizer. I am extremely happy with these products.</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about this.  I think if my skin weren&#x27;t so sensitive it would be a good product, but I find the acidity of the vitamin C very drying.  (I have acne/rosacea/sensitive/combination skin).</li>
            <li> This product cannot be beat for price and performance.  My skin is glowing!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product in addition to the other amazing products in this line. Simple, natural, organic ingredients which is perfect for my sensitive skin. This serum definitely makes me feel brighter and took away the dull feeling I was having. I got some melasma (dark spots) after pregnancy and this helped get rid of that. This is great for in the morning before you apply moisturizer as it helps to plump the skin and retain moisture. So happy I found it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an off-the charts Vit C Serum and believe I&#x27;ve found it! The ingredients are amazing!  I&#x27;ve heard that people are RAVING about Perfect Body Harmony&#x27;s Serum.  One of my best friend&#x27;s ordered it before I did and can&#x27;t say enough about the difference it&#x27;s making for her in less than one week&#x27;s time! Perfect Body Harmony, you seem to have started a \\&quot;buzz\\&quot; around here...the word is spreading and I can hardly wait to join the \\&quot;Kudos to You\\&quot; crowd!</li>
            <li> this was great stuff. felt smooth on my skin and i could see an improved difference! i highly&lt;br /&gt;recommend this serum!</li>
            <li> I see a lot of reviews for this product, so I have to jump in.  I&#x27;ve been a &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; user for many years, so I know the great benefits of the vitamin in general.  C provides results, so that can always get great reviews.  I&#x27;ve tried a number of C products and they can often dry your skin or leave a stripped feeling.  I use this C with Harmony night cream and nothing else.  I see maximum benefits from the C, but at the same time my skin is hydrated and dewey.  I&#x27;ve found this combo hard to find in &amp;#34;working serums&amp;#34; etc.  I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month now~ I can already tell a difference in my skin. I feel like my darker spots have started to disappear.  Love this line of face products~</li>
