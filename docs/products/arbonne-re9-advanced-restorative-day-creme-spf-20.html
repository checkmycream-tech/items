            <li>I absolutely love Arbonne products.  </li>
            <li>but like this line better.</li>
            <li>Glad I can still get it on line.</li>
            <li>I still like it, but preferred the more substantial type.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Love this product line.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love Arbornne.</li>
            <li>Wish you got more Creme for the price.  </li>
            <li>I love the product</li>
            <li>I love this product...</li>
            <li>I have used it before and love the smell of oranges.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite products for my aging skin.</li>
            <li>I absolutley love this day cream.  </li>
            <li>My skin does not do well with most products.  </li>
            <li>and I love that sun protection is built in</li>
            <li>Wish I could compare it to something to give you a better idea of the texture.  </li>
            <li>Im glad I ordereded it anyway because it was a lot creamier, which I like in a face cream.</li>
            <li>Light and mild, feels good on.</li>
            <li>I was happy to try new skincare products but did not expect the line to do anything.</li>
            <li>I use all of RE9 Advanced Restorative cleansing and moisturing products (except for the neck cream) and love them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost 39 with fine lines on my forehead and under my eyes, and I have very fair skin that tends to get blotchy from time to time, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li>Having your own personal consultant can make the process smoother and more enjoyable as this is what we are here for, to assist clients in making their arbonne experience as amazing as their products.</li>
            <li>It used to be more of a rich cream.</li>
            <li>I had read reviews that said this cream was watery, more so than the original cream.</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly, great packaging, and big $$ savings.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Light non-greasy but does wonders for my face.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the number of products I was using, because I often don&#x27;t have much time for my skin care routine.</li>
            <li>Light on my face, which I prefer.  </li>
            <li>Please feel free to contact me for any ordering assistance, price specials and questions.</li>
            <li>I love the product, it works very well</li>
            <li>I have used Arbonne RE 9 for several years and have always loved the day cream until now.  </li>
            <li>Sure it&#x27;s a little bit cheaper but the quality is not as good.</li>
            <li>Arbonne products are fabulous and worth the investment, If you believe your product is less than satisfactory, then please contact me and I would be happy to assist you in returning the product and choosing something else or exchanging the one you have to see if it was just a flaw.</li>
            <li>Over time I have stoppped using other products in this line mostly out of convenience but have continued to use the day cremes because I have really liked them.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for approximetaly a year and think it is worth</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product directly from Arbonne for many years.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey but has been well worth it.</li>
            <li>i dont think i recieved a fresh bottle...will buy from arbonne from now on</li>
            <li>When applying to the skin it feels like it goes right in and leaves no residue or oiliness.  </li>
            <li>Item was shipped out right away.</li>
            <li>Though not a strong SPF, it did work out great when I was out mowing my lawn in the hot sun.  </li>
            <li>but she had been paying much more from a personal sales person.</li>
            <li>The first RE9 Day Creme I received off of Amazon made my face break out in a rash.  </li>
            <li>I use it sparingly because it is expensive, but it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li>I just signed up and all the products I got straight from Arbonne are fresh.</li>
            <li>If interested I&#x27;m on Facebook Phyllis Bonnett and message me inbox.</li>
            <li>My skin is smoother, and more even toned since I have started using this product, and it only took about a week to start seeing results.  </li>
            <li>Delivery is always fast on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>I love the Arbonne &#x27;RE9&#x27; Advanced corrective eye cream &amp; thought I would give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;I will go back to Mark Lee&#x27;s Hydrofluide (non oily hydrating fluid) with Jan Marini SPF 33 as an overlay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have bought this cream in the past and loved it.</li>
            <li>Not only has the RE9 system eliminated my acne, it has made my skin supple, smooth, protected from the sun and never greasy.  </li>
            <li>it my skin feels much smoother and softer.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I really like it.</li>
            <li>i could&#x27;ve gone to the drug store and spent $5 and gotten a better product.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face really shiny</li>
            <li>I believe the Day Creme is very oily and clogged my pores.  </li>
            <li>It is very drying.</li>
            <li>MY SKIN IS SO MUCH SMOOTHER NOW.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE</li>
            <li>Really like this.</li>
            <li>After only a few days my skin started to look clearer, healthier, more moisturized and more even toned.</li>
            <li>This product is very moisturizing without being greasy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I really like Arbonne and this crème</li>
            <li>Arbonne has definately changed this product and I really don&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li>I love all the other Arbonne products.</li>
            <li>I love Amazon to buy other things</li>
            <li>For some reason, this creme is thinner and more liquid than previous versions.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I love Arbonne, but the Day Creme bottle I received was dried up.</li>
            <li>I love Arbonne products and have been using them for a few years.  </li>
            <li>Normally I would wear stronger.  </li>
            <li>I have normal skin.  </li>
            <li>One review said new formula too watery.</li>
            <li>Product was as described but did take approx 10 days longer to get here (Canada) than expected which was most likely a customs thing.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer, combined with the cleanser has minimized them completely!</li>
            <li>I am an arbonne consultant and would be happy to help anyone who is unhappy with their products.</li>
            <li>I also believe it contributed my adult acne breakouts.  </li>
            <li>it is old.  </li>
            <li>This bottle is literally over three years old.  </li>
            <li>I am 47 years old and people can&#x27;t believe it because my skin looks so young.  </li>
            <li>I like this creme because it&#x27;s not too light or too heavy, and has the SPF.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t buy this again unless it is from a direct representative.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft and not greasy</li>
            <li>Not sure this is worth the trouble and expense any more</li>
            <li>When I first opened the product it was thick and clumpy, but after about 5 pumps it thinned and has the right consistency.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terrible, just not particularly pleasant to me.</li>
            <li>My skin looks fresh and the wrinkles are less pronounced and the results are excellent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When you buy from someone other than through a consultant straight from Arbonne company you stand the chance of getting old products.</li>
            <li>The lotion would barely come out.</li>
            <li>As far as any of it&#x27;s anti aging properties, only time will tell.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to those with sensitive skin also.</li>
            <li>Everything seemed fine until she used it and informed me someone else had already used the product and it was about half empty.</li>
            <li>The first mistake was changing the formulation from spf 8 to spf 20, when that change happened the quality of the product did go down - fragrance, consistency of lotion etc.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy this one more time and much to my dismay, the product in this bottle is again really thick and different than previous purchases.</li>
            <li>The new product did not give me a rash, so I am not sure what the first seller sent to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have no idea how this product would work on its own since I used the whole line together, but I am will continue to buy this product, along with a few of the others in the line, since I&#x27;ve noticed my skin revert back to looking tired and blotchy since I&#x27;ve finished using up the samples.</li>
            <li>It was always thick, creamy and rich feeling on my skin.</li>
            <li>I finally decided after several years to look for a new facial products.  </li>
            <li>You only need a small amount of product, so you kinda offset the higher price by not having to purchase as frequently.</li>
            <li>A little short on patience, I looked to Amazon to get the product fast.  </li>

            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I love Arbonne, but the Day Creme bottle I received was dried up.</li>
            <li> I love Arbonne products and have been using them for a few years.  </li>
            <li> Normally I would wear stronger.  </li>
            <li> I have normal skin.  </li>
            <li> One review said new formula too watery.</li>
            <li> Product was as described but did take approx 10 days longer to get here (Canada) than expected which was most likely a customs thing.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer, combined with the cleanser has minimized them completely!</li>
            <li> I am an arbonne consultant and would be happy to help anyone who is unhappy with their products.</li>
            <li> I also believe it contributed my adult acne breakouts.  </li>
            <li> it is old.  </li>
            <li> This bottle is literally over three years old.  </li>
            <li> I am 47 years old and people can&#x27;t believe it because my skin looks so young.  </li>
            <li> I like this creme because it&#x27;s not too light or too heavy, and has the SPF.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t buy this again unless it is from a direct representative.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft and not greasy</li>
            <li> Not sure this is worth the trouble and expense any more</li>
            <li> When I first opened the product it was thick and clumpy, but after about 5 pumps it thinned and has the right consistency.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terrible, just not particularly pleasant to me.</li>
            <li> My skin looks fresh and the wrinkles are less pronounced and the results are excellent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When you buy from someone other than through a consultant straight from Arbonne company you stand the chance of getting old products.</li>
            <li> The lotion would barely come out.</li>
            <li> As far as any of it&#x27;s anti aging properties, only time will tell.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to those with sensitive skin also.</li>
            <li> Everything seemed fine until she used it and informed me someone else had already used the product and it was about half empty.</li>
            <li> The first mistake was changing the formulation from spf 8 to spf 20, when that change happened the quality of the product did go down - fragrance, consistency of lotion etc.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this one more time and much to my dismay, the product in this bottle is again really thick and different than previous purchases.</li>
            <li> The new product did not give me a rash, so I am not sure what the first seller sent to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have no idea how this product would work on its own since I used the whole line together, but I am will continue to buy this product, along with a few of the others in the line, since I&#x27;ve noticed my skin revert back to looking tired and blotchy since I&#x27;ve finished using up the samples.</li>
            <li> It was always thick, creamy and rich feeling on my skin.</li>
            <li> I finally decided after several years to look for a new facial products.  </li>
            <li> You only need a small amount of product, so you kinda offset the higher price by not having to purchase as frequently.</li>
            <li> A little short on patience, I looked to Amazon to get the product fast.  </li>
            <li> The product I received from this distributor was clearly not the actual cream.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t take the time and expense to mail it back to the original vendor, but it&#x27;s bothersome since it&#x27;s already an expensive product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The same results apply for the other products that I use from Arborne</li>
            <li> -I thought I was a victim of a product \\&quot;switch\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I will be buying more, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> but the product is very dry and does not moisturize at all.</li>
            <li> It is very dry and takes quite a lot just for minimal coverage.</li>
            <li> I use the entire line and even using it every day, this product will last at least 6 months.  </li>
            <li> and I have seen a difference in the texture of my skin in only a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to question whether this was really an Arbonne product or if it was just seriously outdated.</li>
            <li> Slightly oily in the t zone and dry on the cheeks.  </li>
            <li> You have to make a little bit go a long way.  </li>
            <li> Just a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use any other moisturizer or toner...</li>
            <li> The other issue I keep having with all of the RE products is that the pump inside the bottle breaks off</li>
            <li> i thought it might have been the first few pumps, but i was wrong.</li>
            <li> I never suspected that a product could possibly be tampered with - a bit naive on my part</li>
            <li> I started to use this 5 years ago and it made a difference in less then 1 week.</li>
            <li> When I apply it to my face it creates little \\&quot;rolls/</li>
            <li> With that said, I have tried the spf 20 a few times.</li>
            <li> do not love the viscosity of this product (too thick/lacks absorbency), or the chemical odor (not pleasant).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, it is a small amount for the price.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve purchased this in the past and that is why i decided to order it again</li>
            <li> it was too late.  </li>
            <li> Not watery, at least not this batch, like some people have said.  </li>
            <li> The contents of this bottle are too thick to spread.</li>
            <li> Not positive, but my cream seems like a fake.</li>
            <li> I know that when I am  using it I do not have to worry about all the dangerous contaminants/chemicals that exist in other products.</li>
            <li> It was very thick, wouldn&#x27;t even come out of the dispenser.  </li>
            <li> This batch is quite &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34;..like a thin lotion from the drug store.</li>
            <li> Literally as thin as water.</li>
            <li> They smell horrible and I&#x27;m completely irritated that I purchased this.  </li>
            <li> The negative side to Arbonne is that it is too expensive!</li>
            <li> The last bottle I bought, was thrown in the garbage because the pump did not work and the consistency of the product was terrible</li>
            <li> The product I received had a weird consistency.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch, a refilled container, or if they simply changed the consistency, but it was awful.</li>
            <li> you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Horrible experience.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am a big Arbonne fan.  Not only has the RE9 system eliminated my acne, it has made my skin supple, smooth, protected from the sun and never greasy.  I will definitely be buying this product again!</li>
            <li> I just ordered and received one on 4/26.  The expiration date is 6/2015.  The owner puposely covered the expiration date on the box with a white paper.</li>
            <li> I love the Arbonne &#x27;RE9&#x27; Advanced corrective eye cream &amp; thought I would give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;I will go back to Mark Lee&#x27;s Hydrofluide (non oily hydrating fluid) with Jan Marini SPF 33 as an overlay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not love the viscosity of this product (too thick/lacks absorbency), or the chemical odor (not pleasant).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use Arbonne eye cream, that I rate 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product over the last four years and I am very pleased with the results. I know that when I am  using it I do not have to worry about all the dangerous contaminants/chemicals that exist in other products. My skin looks fresh and the wrinkles are less pronounced and the results are excellent.&lt;br /&gt;The same results apply for the other products that I use from Arborne</li>
            <li> I have used this product for approximetaly a year and think it is worth it my skin feels much smoother and softer. I use this alone and under makeup.</li>
            <li> Love the way It makes my skin look</li>
            <li> This is my favorite day creme. Not at all greasy, very smooth. However, it is a small amount for the price. Otherwise I really like it.</li>
            <li> I found this for my wife who had been using the product already but she had been paying much more from a personal sales person. Delivered quickly, great packaging, and big $$ savings.</li>
            <li> I use this product day and night sometime.  It is very light on your face.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Arbonne products.  It has changed my face by closing pores and making my face feel smooth and look great.</li>
            <li> I use all of RE9 Advanced Restorative cleansing and moisturing products (except for the neck cream) and love them. I used to use the RE9 NutriMin C but like this line better.</li>
            <li> I love Arbonne, but the Day Creme bottle I received was dried up. The lotion would barely come out. I was very disappointed. I will wait on my Arbonne representative rather than buy online.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! you will be disappointed. product is nothing like it&#x27;s described. i&#x27;ve purchased this in the past and that is why i decided to order it again but the product is very dry and does not moisturize at all. i thought it might have been the first few pumps, but i was wrong. i could&#x27;ve gone to the drug store and spent $5 and gotten a better product. i got scammed.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way to read the ingredients and I had no idea the sunscreen agents in this are chemical. They smell horrible and I&#x27;m completely irritated that I purchased this.  I love all the other Arbonne products.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years but no longer have an Arbonne consultant. Glad I can still get it on line.</li>
            <li> For some reason, this creme is thinner and more liquid than previous versions.  I still like it, but preferred the more substantial type.</li>
            <li> This product does not moisturize at all! In fact, it dries the skin out. I don&#x27;t see&lt;br /&gt;any benefit in using it, except for the SPF; which I can buy cheaper at a local drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;Would NOT recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. It&#x27;s mixed with sun block as bell. Goes on smoothly. Doesn&#x27;t stick or glom up on the skin. Nice product</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. It is great to have a product that you don&#x27;t have. To wonder about the ingredients and your skin feels great all day with an SPF 30</li>
            <li> Love this product line. I started to use this 5 years ago and it made a difference in less then 1 week. My teen daughter also uses this product without any issues for her skin type.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face really shiny and I break out whenever I wear it.</li>
            <li> Wish it was a big bottle</li>
            <li> The first RE9 Day Creme I received off of Amazon made my face break out in a rash.  I returned it and purchased for a different seller.  The new product did not give me a rash, so I am not sure what the first seller sent to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used RE9 for several years.  While using RE9 products (all of them), I noticed my face breaking out with acne.  I believe the Day Creme is very oily and clogged my pores.  I also believe it contributed my adult acne breakouts.  I finally decided after several years to look for a new facial products.  I have switched and my face has cleared up and looks healthier.  I do not recommend this product if you have moderate to oily face type.</li>
            <li> I was turned on to Arbonne products a number of years ago when my sister was a sales rep for the company. Over time I have stoppped using other products in this line mostly out of convenience but have continued to use the day cremes because I have really liked them. The first mistake was changing the formulation from spf 8 to spf 20, when that change happened the quality of the product did go down - fragrance, consistency of lotion etc. With that said, I have tried the spf 20 a few times. The last bottle I bought, was thrown in the garbage because the pump did not work and the consistency of the product was terrible-I thought I was a victim of a product \\&quot;switch\\&quot;. I decided to buy this one more time and much to my dismay, the product in this bottle is again really thick and different than previous purchases. The contents of this bottle are too thick to spread. It is very drying. I think it&#x27;s time to find a department store moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product directly from Arbonne for many years.  The product I received from this distributor was clearly not the actual cream.  It was very thick, wouldn&#x27;t even come out of the dispenser.  If I had opened it earlier I would have returned it but I buy my products in advance so by the time I opened it it was too late.  I never suspected that a product could possibly be tampered with - a bit naive on my part I guess.</li>
            <li> Wonderful. Here in record time. I did not pay my membership this year this was so inexpensive! I love it!</li>
            <li> Non- greasy but hydrating. Actually improves the look of my skin. You only need a small amount of product, so you kinda offset the higher price by not having to purchase as frequently. Goes well under make-up and has a pleasant but not perfume-y smell.</li>
            <li> JUST AS THE NIGHT CREAM THIS IS A WONDERFUL CREAM. MY SKIN IS SO MUCH SMOOTHER NOW.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE BOTH PRODUCTS&lt;br /&gt;J TOMLINSON</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my mother who adores this product line. Everything seemed fine until she used it and informed me someone else had already used the product and it was about half empty. Horrible experience. Won&#x27;t be purchasing anything of this nature off of Amazon again.</li>
            <li> When I first opened the product it was thick and clumpy, but after about 5 pumps it thinned and has the right consistency. I&#x27;m not sure if having it shipped during the hot summer days maybe contributed?</li>
            <li> Good day creme - I used to sell it.</li>
            <li> Hello, I&#x27;ve used Arbonne RE9 Restorative day Creme since 2008.  The product I received had a weird consistency.  When I apply it to my face it creates little \\&quot;rolls/pills\\&quot; of product.  I think it was not stored properly and/or it is old.  Because of this, I am concerned that the SPF 20 has been compromised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Arboone  now for over 10 years and I absolutely love it.I wouldn&#x27;t use any other moisturizer or toner...</li>
            <li> I love Arbornne. And through amazon I paid a lower price. Yeah!!</li>
            <li> When you buy these products on line - you never know what you are getting.  This bottle is literally over three years old.  FyI</li>
            <li> Yes, just as advertised</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using RE daycreme from Arbonne for years and have always loved it. It&#x27;s pricey but has been well worth it. The last few I have purchased have been really watery though, same as another reviewer below mentioned. It seems that when they bumped up the SPF to 20 this happened. It used to be more of a rich cream. The other issue I keep having with all of the RE products is that the pump inside the bottle breaks off and I can&#x27;t get anymore out of the bottle. I have had this happen several times. It&#x27;s often when there isn&#x27;t that much left so I don&#x27;t take the time and expense to mail it back to the original vendor, but it&#x27;s bothersome since it&#x27;s already an expensive product. I&#x27;m not sure I will be buying more, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I love Arbonne products and have been using them for a few years.  I am 47 years old and people can&#x27;t believe it because my skin looks so young.  I use the entire line and even using it every day, this product will last at least 6 months.  I like this creme because it&#x27;s not too light or too heavy, and has the SPF.</li>
            <li> Looooove this cream! I use it sparingly because it is expensive, but it&#x27;s wonderful! Breakouts are gone! I used to get pimples all the time, especially around that time of the month, and I&#x27;m 41. This moisturizer, combined with the cleanser has minimized them completely! Sold! Smells nice too, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Formula definitely changed. I only use in the winter and had not ordered for a year. It was always thick, creamy and rich feeling on my skin. This batch is quite &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34;..like a thin lotion from the drug store. Not sure this is worth the trouble and expense any more</li>
            <li> One review said new formula too watery. When you buy from someone other than through a consultant straight from Arbonne company you stand the chance of getting old products. That&#x27;s why it was watery. I just signed up and all the products I got straight from Arbonne are fresh. I love Amazon to buy other things but I will stick to being a consultant getting the products myself rather than taking a chance with a consultant off Amazon which that person is not suppose to be doing anyway. I read the company policy and they should be turned into Arbonne for doing this. Sure it&#x27;s a little bit cheaper but the quality is not as good. Find a consultant in your area to buy from. Believe me there are ways to get a lot of products for a really great discount. If interested I&#x27;m on Facebook Phyllis Bonnett and message me inbox.</li>
            <li> Really like this. Light non-greasy but does wonders for my face. Like the fact it has SPF.&lt;br /&gt;Decided to be a consultant based on trying this product. Re9 eye cream, and mascara,</li>
            <li> Light and mild, feels good on.</li>
            <li> I received some samples of this line to test for a friend who sells Arbonne. I was happy to try new skincare products but did not expect the line to do anything. I used the cleanser, toner, day cream, serum, and under eye cream for about 2 weeks and was amazed at how good my skin looked. I&#x27;m almost 39 with fine lines on my forehead and under my eyes, and I have very fair skin that tends to get blotchy from time to time, especially in the winter. After only a few days my skin started to look clearer, healthier, more moisturized and more even toned. I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the number of products I was using, because I often don&#x27;t have much time for my skin care routine. I took one star off because I didn&#x27;t like the smell of this product. It&#x27;s not terrible, just not particularly pleasant to me. I have no idea how this product would work on its own since I used the whole line together, but I am will continue to buy this product, along with a few of the others in the line, since I&#x27;ve noticed my skin revert back to looking tired and blotchy since I&#x27;ve finished using up the samples.</li>
            <li> Wish you got more Creme for the price.  You have to make a little bit go a long way.  I love the product&lt;br /&gt;though.</li>
            <li> great service. great product</li>
            <li> These provide great skin care that takes years off of the face.  I have used these products for years and took a break and have found there are not others as good.  Janelle</li>
            <li> Though not a strong SPF, it did work out great when I was out mowing my lawn in the hot sun.  Normally I would wear stronger.  Nice creamy feel.  Not watery, at least not this batch, like some people have said.  Light on my face, which I prefer.  I have normal skin.  Slightly oily in the t zone and dry on the cheeks.  As far as any of it&#x27;s anti aging properties, only time will tell.</li>
            <li> I love this product...I have used it before and love the smell of oranges.  I recommend this to every age.</li>
            <li> This product is very moisturizing without being greasy. I also like the amount of sunscreen that it has in it. One of my favorite products for my aging skin.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. It is a very effective sunscreen and moisturizer without being oily. You only need to use a tiny amount so the bottle lasts for months. I would definitely recommend this product to those with sensitive skin also.</li>
            <li> I have bought this cream in the past and loved it. However, this bottle was like water. I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch, a refilled container, or if they simply changed the consistency, but it was awful. Literally as thin as water. Won&#x27;t buy this again unless it is from a direct representative.</li>
            <li> I am an arbonne consultant and would be happy to help anyone who is unhappy with their products. Arbonne products are fabulous and worth the investment, If you believe your product is less than satisfactory, then please contact me and I would be happy to assist you in returning the product and choosing something else or exchanging the one you have to see if it was just a flaw. Having your own personal consultant can make the process smoother and more enjoyable as this is what we are here for, to assist clients in making their arbonne experience as amazing as their products. Please feel free to contact me for any ordering assistance, price specials and questions.</li>
            <li> I absolutley love this day cream.  Just a little bit goes a long way. My skin is smoother, and more even toned since I have started using this product, and it only took about a week to start seeing results.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Throughout the years, of all the creams I have used, Arbonne is the best.  I highly recommend it.  The negative side to Arbonne is that it is too expensive!</li>
            <li> I really like Arbonne and this crème is light and has a wonderful, fresh, citrusy scent that is not overpowering or perfume like.  It makes my skin feel soft and not greasy</li>
            <li> i dont think i recieved a fresh bottle...will buy from arbonne from now on</li>
            <li> I was really impressed with this product. When applying to the skin it feels like it goes right in and leaves no residue or oiliness.  I think my skin has improved using it daily.</li>
            <li> Not positive, but my cream seems like a fake. I&#x27;ve used Arbonne for years. The product I received had a different consistency and smelled different. I&#x27;ve had to question whether this was really an Arbonne product or if it was just seriously outdated.</li>
            <li> My skin does not do well with most products.  This one seems to work and I love that sun protection is built in so I don&#x27;t have to think about it.</li>
            <li> Arbonne products are the best and not exorbitantly priced. Hae used it for years and always been happy with the product</li>
            <li> I have had a problem with finding a moisturizer that does not just sit on my skin, but actually penetrates the skin.  I have a friend that is an Arbonne rep and she suggested for me to try some of their products.  A little short on patience, I looked to Amazon to get the product fast.  Delivery is always fast on Amazon!  I love the product, it works very well and I have seen a difference in the texture of my skin in only a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have used Arbonne RE 9 for several years and have always loved the day cream until now.  Arbonne has definately changed this product and I really don&#x27;t like it.  It is very dry and takes quite a lot just for minimal coverage. Wish I could compare it to something to give you a better idea of the texture.  It is not creamy at all.&lt;br /&gt;Has anyone experienced this problem?</li>
            <li> I had read reviews that said this cream was watery, more so than the original cream. Im glad I ordereded it anyway because it was a lot creamier, which I like in a face cream. Product was as described but did take approx 10 days longer to get here (Canada) than expected which was most likely a customs thing. Item was shipped out right away.</li>
