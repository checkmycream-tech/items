            <li>so that is good.</li>
            <li>Great for making lipstick stay on...love the brush applicator, much better than roll on ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>This product is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>I have stocked up on this, it really is an amazing tool.</li>
            <li>Pretty good!</li>
            <li>so you better buy more than just one! :)</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>not just the top layer thats over the product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>It seals my lipstick perfectly and lasts the entire day.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, I use it as eyebrow sealer.  </li>
            <li>Last the best out of three products I have tried.  </li>
            <li>My problem is that most of them come off with water</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many years.&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li>One application over my lipstick (although it burned when I put it on because of the alcohol content) lasted me a full day and night of partying!</li>
            <li>The lipstick came off just as easily as before.</li>
            <li>The reviews made this sound legit.</li>
            <li>works just fine yet not for a full day out</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this several times since then and it has done its job spectacularly!</li>
            <li>Was a huge bummer, but the seller quickly issued me a refund so props to them for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so they dont smuge off, I work out on a daily bases and this stuff is sweat proof and works great in the summer when the weather is really hot and make-up Intends to come off.</li>
            <li>Does stop bleeding but seems to lighten the true color of lipstick.</li>
            <li>It does tingle when applying but that dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>its ok and it keeps my lipstick sealed longer than the normal application.</li>
            <li>Just as good as or better than other high end products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it does indeed seal your lipstick on and has been fantastic for keeping several colors adhered to my lips, It works better with some brands than others</li>
            <li>but I think the product was definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>If I put a layer of lipstick or clear gloss over the top of the sealer, it no longer seals and ALL of it WILL come off..</li>
            <li>If you put gloss or anything over it your lipstick and seal and gloss will wipe right</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>Made my lips flaky and it burned at first.  </li>
            <li>I frollowed instructions and first of all it burns my lips.</li>
            <li>and I am a water, tea both hot and iced</li>
            <li>In the future my wife will search for a better lipstick sealer.</li>
            <li>I first found it at bed bath &amp; beyond.  </li>
            <li>This product really works, it protects your lipstick for hours</li>
            <li>My lipstick stays on much longer than if wearing alone.  </li>
            <li>really needed for the lines around the mouth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as convenient as a tube to apply because you need two hands to do it but works really well once applied.</li>
            <li>as directed,it really works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It does get dry, but if you put Vaseline on your lips and then apply your lipstick followed by the sealer you&#x27;ll be fine.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>recommend it highly</li>
            <li>I have used this per the directions and as many other ways as possible and it flakes off and peels after about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>It smells a lot like straight gin for a minute but that goes away quickly, it burns slightly</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>This product absolutely keeps your lipstick on for several hours.</li>
            <li>I have not tried any other sealer since this one does exactly what I want.</li>
            <li>Theres no way I can put this on and not put some kind of gloss or something over it, which makes it useless.</li>
            <li>This product takes a long time to dry and is very sticky until then.</li>

            <li> This product takes a long time to dry and is very sticky until then.</li>
            <li> Totally chapped my lips and made them uncomfortably dry.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, so save your money and go with a more expensive lip sealer, or just buy the over the counter lipstick that&#x27;s all day wear with the lipgloss on the other end.</li>
            <li> so it foesn&#x27;t stay on my lips that long.</li>
            <li> sting a bit on application and causes dry lips - must moisturize lips at night.</li>
            <li> However, it makes your lips ridiculously dry.</li>
            <li> It also causes some serious flaking of your lipstick because of how much it dries out your lips.</li>
            <li> tends to dry and then crack, though it does keep lipstick in place</li>
            <li> Kind of disappointed with this.</li>
            <li> I was told for my faun makeup, that this would not keep my nude lower lip and black upper lip from rubbing off on one another.</li>
            <li> So although the product itself was terrible, I&#x27;m gonna give this 3 stars because the sellers were so great.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s only .17 oz</li>
            <li> Took longer than expected to arrive.</li>
            <li> Is eat proof but once lips get wet or gloss is applied over it</li>
            <li> A little sharp on the lips but helps.</li>
            <li> Anyone who says this is  normal is wrong.</li>
            <li> It also gave my lips this hard, plasticky, inflexible top coat, it was like applying superglue over my lipstick, looked stupid and was completely ineffective.</li>
            <li> Two thumbs down!</li>
            <li> When dried it is kiss proof</li>
            <li> Dries out lips and leaves a slight stain does no work as published!</li>
            <li> The people with negative reviews didn&#x27;t read the instructions.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money will not buy again!!!</li>
            <li> So painful.</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>
            <li> and I stopped using it because it had a nasty smell and burned when I put it on.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> its ok and it keeps my lipstick sealed longer than the normal application. works just fine yet not for a full day out</li>
            <li> Seals the lipstick as says and doesn&#x27;t peel.</li>
            <li> I have used this per the directions and as many other ways as possible and it flakes off and peels after about 20 minutes. You get what you pay for, so save your money and go with a more expensive lip sealer, or just buy the over the counter lipstick that&#x27;s all day wear with the lipgloss on the other end.</li>
            <li> I was told for my faun makeup, that this would not keep my nude lower lip and black upper lip from rubbing off on one another. This was wonderfully incorrect! One application over my lipstick (although it burned when I put it on because of the alcohol content) lasted me a full day and night of partying! I&#x27;ve used this several times since then and it has done its job spectacularly!</li>
            <li> Pretty good! I like it!</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and it refused to keep my lipstick in place. The reviews made this sound legit. Ugh my lipstick still ended up on my boyfriends face!</li>
            <li> Color Save Lipstick Sealer is great.  It is not sticky and does not peel.  My lipstick stays put for hours, even when eating and drinking.  No bleeding.  It does have a tiny sting for a moment.  Very reasonably priced.  I have not tried any other sealer since this one does exactly what I want.</li>
            <li> Horrible! Does not work at all. Dries out lips and leaves a slight stain does no work as published!</li>
            <li> I love this product. My lipstick stays on after I eat.</li>
            <li> Great for making lipstick stay on...love the brush applicator, much better than roll on ones I&#x27;ve tried. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I like the staying power but it is a bit sticky....and drying.</li>
            <li> Didnt work. Made my lips flaky and it burned at first.  The lipstick came off just as easily as before. Two thumbs down!</li>
            <li> Keeps lipstick on for hours when used as directed.&lt;br /&gt;Does sting a bit on application and causes dry lips - must moisturize lips at night.</li>
            <li> It does not work at all comes off on glasses; cups.  Does not retain color on lips. Waste of money will not buy again!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this and the bottle has leaked everywhere so there was about 5% left in the bottle when I received it. Was a huge bummer, but the seller quickly issued me a refund so props to them for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product itself, the bottle was already open and I only had enough left in it for 2x applications, so take this with a grain of salt. I applied this stuff over OCC liptars, and it burnt like hellfire. WOW. So painful. It also gave my lips this hard, plasticky, inflexible top coat, it was like applying superglue over my lipstick, looked stupid and was completely ineffective. So although the product itself was terrible, I&#x27;m gonna give this 3 stars because the sellers were so great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to start off by saying that I dont use this as a lip stick sealer but i infact use it on my eye brows so they dont smuge off, I work out on a daily bases and this stuff is sweat proof and works great in the summer when the weather is really hot and make-up Intends to come off.</li>
            <li> This product really works, it protects your lipstick for hours I&#x27;m very happy that products like these exist, I&#x27;ll be buying more of these</li>
            <li> It smells a lot like straight gin for a minute but that goes away quickly, it burns slightly but this isn&#x27;t bothersome to me as I&#x27;m used to plumping glosses etc burning a bit too. If you put gloss or anything over it your lipstick and seal and gloss will wipe right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it does indeed seal your lipstick on and has been fantastic for keeping several colors adhered to my lips, It works better with some brands than others but I think the product was definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Holds lipstick for hours</li>
            <li> So, if you use this product, it WILL seal on your lipstick to where it will not come off. However, it makes your lips ridiculously dry. Theres no way I can put this on and not put some kind of gloss or something over it, which makes it useless. If I put a layer of lipstick or clear gloss over the top of the sealer, it no longer seals and ALL of it WILL come off.. not just the top layer thats over the product. It also causes some serious flaking of your lipstick because of how much it dries out your lips. I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> This works great It keeps the lipstick on for alot longer then without it.</li>
            <li> Totally chapped my lips and made them uncomfortably dry.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I tried a different product before this one called Lipcot and I stopped using it because it had a nasty smell and burned when I put it on.  This stuff has a tiny bit of a smell but not enough to be grossed out by and does not burn when I apply.  It seals my lipstick perfectly and lasts the entire day.  My only complaint is that it&#x27;s only .17 oz so you better buy more than just one! :)</li>
            <li> I got this because of the good reviews. I frollowed instructions and first of all it burns my lips. Anyone who says this is  normal is wrong. Anytime a product  burns you it is harming body tissue. Secondly it doesnt work. My li[stick wore off even faster than with just gloss over it.</li>
            <li> tends to dry and then crack, though it does keep lipstick in place</li>
            <li> I love this product, I use it as eyebrow sealer.  Eyebrows stay on all day.  Just as good as or better than other high end products.</li>
            <li> Last the best out of three products I have tried.  My problem is that most of them come off with water and I am a water, tea both hot and iced so it foesn&#x27;t stay on my lips that long.</li>
            <li> Idk what&#x27;s in this stuff it smells like alcohol. When u put it on your lips it burns and it also makes your lips sticky</li>
            <li> I love it.  My lipstick stays on much longer than if wearing alone.  Only problem is that the container that it comes in should be of a larger quantity.</li>
            <li> I am liking this one as well....really needed for the lines around the mouth. I would say they are all about the same in the dryness it does create.</li>
            <li> This product absolutely keeps your lipstick on for several hours. It does tingle when applying but that dissipates quickly. It&#x27;s not as convenient as a tube to apply because you need two hands to do it but works really well once applied.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years.&lt;br /&gt;Used as directed,it really works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it highly</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product like this for a while and am delighted to have found it. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Took longer than expected to arrive. Kind of disappointed with this. My wife asked me for because im always kissing her with lipstick on. This product takes a long time to dry and is very sticky until then. Does stop bleeding but seems to lighten the true color of lipstick. Is eat proof but once lips get wet or gloss is applied over it then the lipstick sealer no longer seals. When dried it is kiss proof so that is good. In the future my wife will search for a better lipstick sealer.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING.  I first found it at bed bath &amp; beyond.  The people with negative reviews didn&#x27;t read the instructions.  This stuff keeps my lipstick on even after a drunken night.  It does get dry, but if you put Vaseline on your lips and then apply your lipstick followed by the sealer you&#x27;ll be fine.  I have stocked up on this, it really is an amazing tool. I don&#x27;t tell any of my friends because I want to keep it to myself lol</li>
            <li> A little sharp on the lips but helps.</li>
