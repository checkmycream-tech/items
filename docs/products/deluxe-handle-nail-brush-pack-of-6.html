            <li>The frogs love it!</li>
            <li>I love these brushes!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re exactly what I wanted, the perfect size to hang from my shower caddy.</li>
            <li>Order two packs, they come in handy for more things than you can dream of!</li>
            <li>It would be nice if the handles were</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>Still - cleans under the nails - good price - and nice to have so many around.</li>
            <li>This one is good for fitting into a purse.</li>
            <li>The bristles are strong and the construction is good.  </li>
            <li>I wanted more compact brushes but that may have been my own fault as I cant remember if the dimensions were given and</li>
            <li>Awesomely priced, and super useful.</li>
            <li>great for getting your hands super clean</li>
            <li>LOOKS MORE LIKE DENTURE BRUSHES THAN NAIL.</li>
            <li>ok.  </li>
            <li>but they suffice ok for nail brush.  </li>
            <li>but they work ok.</li>
            <li>Who needs so many of these?</li>
            <li>Nice to do light</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fingernail brushes, but better suited for children.</li>
            <li>This is a versatile product that has many applications for home and garage.</li>
            <li>it fell apart into so many pieces in my hand that it was like it disintegrated.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;bullhorn&#x27; style handle make them easy to hang on to, and they dig out the grime from cracked skin and under the nails with ease.</li>
            <li>OK, while still convenient, I was expecting full size brushes.</li>
            <li>Too dainty and not enough brawn to clean...</li>
            <li>WORKS FINE OTHERWISE.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, the are good sized brushes and I&#x27;ve found many good uses for the like scrubbing in stain remover in my laundry and for scrubbing fine cookware or other easy to scratch items that occasionally need a good scrubbing.</li>
            <li>Though they were smaller than I anticipated these are great brushes.</li>
            <li>too lightly made.</li>
            <li>Remember when brushes like these used to be readily available at any drug store?</li>
            <li>At last I found a source for these handy nail brushes!  </li>
            <li>I love my brushes and they work exactly the way they should.</li>
            <li>I use to clean veggies.</li>
            <li>clean around nails.</li>
            <li>I put one in each bathroom, plus two in the kitchen - one for hands, one to clean apples, potatoes, nectarines, pears, peaches, etc.  </li>
            <li>so there&#x27;s really no room for complaining (LOL).</li>
            <li>Shipping was ok, packed well and arrived in a reasonable time frame.</li>
            <li>Good enough.</li>
            <li>price was good, they could be a tad larger.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are cheap and they fit in my hand very well.</li>
            <li>These are great for someone who wants larger ones.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and was as described in profile.</li>
            <li>quick delivery useful tool</li>
            <li>Inexpensive and a great little packet of nail brushes.  </li>
            <li>Good brushes, sturdy, bristles are actually hard (which is needed and many nailbrushes don&#x27;t have).</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t really look at the dimension that closely  - I love that they fit on old school shower door handles</li>
            <li>I felt misled by the word deluxe in the item, these brushes are tiny.</li>
            <li>I wanted different colors so each person could have their own.</li>
            <li>Nice brushed that do the job.</li>
            <li>They came in different beautiful colors, though alittle thin, they are of good quality.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are just right, and I like the grip.</li>
            <li>The price is right.</li>
            <li>Good, stiff bristles to clean hands and nails thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>We seem always to be losing nail brushes so having a whole pack will help keep the grandchildren&#x27;s nails clean.</li>
            <li>Great little brushes!</li>
            <li>great product--works as expected, glad its a six pack for all sinks in house</li>
            <li>They enjoy being able to clean their nails after a busy day outdoors, and I appreciate getting to keep my personal brush for myself.</li>
            <li>Break easily, bristles are a bit too soft</li>
            <li>Since they were so cheap, I will use them till I find the adult size of nail brushes.</li>
            <li>It would be better if the handles had a space in the middle to allow for hanging it over the side of a dish or soap holder.  </li>
            <li>As everyone else has stated, we used to be able to find these types of brushes everywhere and now you simply cannot.  </li>
            <li>All in all - they work for the price, but I would look for a better quality brush next time around.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really just too small and don&#x27;t seem to do that great a job on my fingernails.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had them for about 3 months or so now and the brushes are still really crisp.</li>
            <li>I had hoped to be able to tell my personal nail brush apart from the one my husband will use to scrub the shaving residue from the sink.</li>
            <li>Super cheap tiny pieces of junk.</li>
            <li>The bristles are the right firmness, but really could use another row added to the brush.</li>
            <li>They are pretty colors and hold up very well.</li>
            <li>and I can barely get my fingers comfortably around the handles.</li>
            <li>When I received this my first thoughts were I paid to much.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft but clean under the nails very well.</li>
            <li>These little guys are pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>These are great for getting those hard crusty, yucky spots scrubbed off your skin while still leaving you some!  </li>
            <li>You would think a nail brush could be easily found locally.  </li>
            <li>This brush isn&#x27;t as large as I would like.</li>
            <li>It seemed like a great bargain at first, but after a few months even ones that I hadn&#x27;t used mysteriously deteriorated and disintegrated.</li>
            <li>Mine are all blue, but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>These are handy little nail brushes.</li>
            <li>Bristles are too soft for my taste- might be good for little kids.</li>
            <li>A good deal for the package, but the bristles are a little soft for my taste.  </li>
            <li>These are a great deal for multi-pack of nailbrushes, a must-have in the food indsutry - a few dollars for 6 of these keeps us stocked for months, and nail brushes are critical in a chocolate shop.  </li>
            <li>different colors - ours were all blue (thus the subtraction of one star) - but overall, great product.</li>
            <li>Did not like very well.</li>
            <li>My thumbs and cuticles get really cracked and sore in the winter months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve added brushing and exfoliating to my morning routine with these puppies and they&#x27;re really improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was able to place them at sinks, the showers, tub and in the garden shed.</li>
            <li>Considering I use a scrub brush often after gardening and couldn&#x27;t find any in any town near me, I&#x27;m glad I at least have these until I can locate a better brush.</li>
            <li>They are so tiny no one could fit their fingers in them.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for prompt and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>brushes are smaller than expected but still good</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed to help my young son thoroughly clean his hands, especially under the nails.</li>
            <li>, they come in a package and look new!).  </li>
            <li>I work with my hands so i was looking for a decent scrubber to get out greases and dirt.</li>
            <li>SUPER TINY.</li>
            <li>my cats toe nails have never been cleaner, i highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I have smaller hands, so, not a major issue, but, bigger would be more useful.</li>
            <li>but right where I need them after getting messy in the yard and taking a shower to clean up</li>
            <li>Not even worth mailing back.  </li>
            <li>Many thanks for offering at such a low price, as some others listed even just a single brush for 3 and 4 times as much as this seller is offering a pack of 6.</li>
            <li>but they seem to be lasting and very convenient and reasonable.</li>
            <li>A little smaller than expected and feel a bit cheaply made,  but they were cheap,</li>
            <li>Got this because my kids play and get toes and nails dirty so this work great</li>
            <li>The brush is made for a preschoolers hand.. not for adults hand .brissles are too too soft.</li>
            <li>The bristle are pliable and soft-</li>
            <li>They actually work really well.</li>
            <li>Also the seller sent me one color on all brushes (and as it happens my least favorite color) instead of the multi colored package of six as depicted in the description.  </li>
            <li>Not happy with brushes a lot rougher than I would have liked</li>
            <li>brushes were not tough enough for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that the really stiff, short bristles are better for getting under the fingernails and these are a bit soft for that.  </li>
            <li>They are a little small, but I have huge hands and can use them just fine.  </li>
            <li>Good for little kids way too small for adult use.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a little beat up and looked used but clean.  </li>
            <li>when my fingernails get dirty at work, I&#x27;m able to scrub my hands and clean under my nails.</li>
            <li>I will still use these but with the arthritis in my hands and their small size I find them more difficult than I would have liked.</li>
            <li>The quality is fine, but just too small.</li>
            <li>I just had this exact same thing happen with the third brush.</li>
            <li>These work well enough to polish off the fine hairs on a frog&#x27;s underbelly...stiff, but not too stiff, soft, but not too soft.</li>
            <li>As much as I hate WalMart, I have to be honest and proclaim that you can buy nail brushes  individually at WalMart for just over $1 each, and those are much better quality (not to mention</li>
            <li>In the picture the brush handles are all different colors, when I received the item all the brushes are simply clear.</li>
            <li>Very very tiny and too soft</li>
            <li>I ordered these for my 10 year old culinary students to scrubs under their nails when washing their hands.</li>
            <li>I purchased these brushes believing these brushes were of normal size, similar to the brushes they were replacing since in the picture they were of the same design.</li>
            <li>The bristles on these are a little too long and a little too soft to really get the fingernails clean after gardening or potting plants.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re hard enough to get under my nails and clean them but soft enough to use on my sore cuticles.</li>
            <li>Only received pink and purple colors  - the guys in our household don&#x27;t appreciate that too much.</li>
            <li>Lots of other styles on many other sites, but these are the handiest compact brushes around - and can be used for other purposes than cleaning your nails.  </li>
            <li>Each one is about 1.5 inches long with soft bristles that will never get dirt out from underneath fingers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve barely used the brush twice and on the third</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it to make a trip to WalMart and spend the few extra cents for a basic nail brush.</li>

            <li> As everyone else has stated, we used to be able to find these types of brushes everywhere and now you simply cannot.  </li>
            <li> All in all - they work for the price, but I would look for a better quality brush next time around.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really just too small and don&#x27;t seem to do that great a job on my fingernails.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had them for about 3 months or so now and the brushes are still really crisp.</li>
            <li> I had hoped to be able to tell my personal nail brush apart from the one my husband will use to scrub the shaving residue from the sink.</li>
            <li> Super cheap tiny pieces of junk.</li>
            <li> The bristles are the right firmness, but really could use another row added to the brush.</li>
            <li> They are pretty colors and hold up very well.</li>
            <li> and I can barely get my fingers comfortably around the handles.</li>
            <li> When I received this my first thoughts were I paid to much.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft but clean under the nails very well.</li>
            <li> These little guys are pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> These are great for getting those hard crusty, yucky spots scrubbed off your skin while still leaving you some!  </li>
            <li> You would think a nail brush could be easily found locally.  </li>
            <li> This brush isn&#x27;t as large as I would like.</li>
            <li> It seemed like a great bargain at first, but after a few months even ones that I hadn&#x27;t used mysteriously deteriorated and disintegrated.</li>
            <li> Mine are all blue, but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> These are handy little nail brushes.</li>
            <li> Bristles are too soft for my taste- might be good for little kids.</li>
            <li> A good deal for the package, but the bristles are a little soft for my taste.  </li>
            <li> These are a great deal for multi-pack of nailbrushes, a must-have in the food indsutry - a few dollars for 6 of these keeps us stocked for months, and nail brushes are critical in a chocolate shop.  </li>
            <li> different colors - ours were all blue (thus the subtraction of one star) - but overall, great product.</li>
            <li> Did not like very well.</li>
            <li> My thumbs and cuticles get really cracked and sore in the winter months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve added brushing and exfoliating to my morning routine with these puppies and they&#x27;re really improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was able to place them at sinks, the showers, tub and in the garden shed.</li>
            <li> Considering I use a scrub brush often after gardening and couldn&#x27;t find any in any town near me, I&#x27;m glad I at least have these until I can locate a better brush.</li>
            <li> They are so tiny no one could fit their fingers in them.  </li>
            <li> Thank you for prompt and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> brushes are smaller than expected but still good</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed to help my young son thoroughly clean his hands, especially under the nails.</li>
            <li> , they come in a package and look new!).  </li>
            <li> I work with my hands so i was looking for a decent scrubber to get out greases and dirt.</li>
            <li> SUPER TINY.</li>
            <li> my cats toe nails have never been cleaner, i highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I have smaller hands, so, not a major issue, but, bigger would be more useful.</li>
            <li> but right where I need them after getting messy in the yard and taking a shower to clean up</li>
            <li> Not even worth mailing back.  </li>
            <li> Many thanks for offering at such a low price, as some others listed even just a single brush for 3 and 4 times as much as this seller is offering a pack of 6.</li>
            <li> but they seem to be lasting and very convenient and reasonable.</li>
            <li> A little smaller than expected and feel a bit cheaply made,  but they were cheap,</li>
            <li> Got this because my kids play and get toes and nails dirty so this work great</li>
            <li> The brush is made for a preschoolers hand.. not for adults hand .brissles are too too soft.</li>
            <li> The bristle are pliable and soft-</li>
            <li> They actually work really well.</li>
            <li> Also the seller sent me one color on all brushes (and as it happens my least favorite color) instead of the multi colored package of six as depicted in the description.  </li>
            <li> Not happy with brushes a lot rougher than I would have liked</li>
            <li> brushes were not tough enough for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that the really stiff, short bristles are better for getting under the fingernails and these are a bit soft for that.  </li>
            <li> They are a little small, but I have huge hands and can use them just fine.  </li>
            <li> Good for little kids way too small for adult use.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little beat up and looked used but clean.  </li>
            <li> when my fingernails get dirty at work, I&#x27;m able to scrub my hands and clean under my nails.</li>
            <li> I will still use these but with the arthritis in my hands and their small size I find them more difficult than I would have liked.</li>
            <li> The quality is fine, but just too small.</li>
            <li> I just had this exact same thing happen with the third brush.</li>
            <li> These work well enough to polish off the fine hairs on a frog&#x27;s underbelly...stiff, but not too stiff, soft, but not too soft.</li>
            <li> As much as I hate WalMart, I have to be honest and proclaim that you can buy nail brushes  individually at WalMart for just over $1 each, and those are much better quality (not to mention</li>
            <li> In the picture the brush handles are all different colors, when I received the item all the brushes are simply clear.</li>
            <li> Very very tiny and too soft</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my 10 year old culinary students to scrubs under their nails when washing their hands.</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes believing these brushes were of normal size, similar to the brushes they were replacing since in the picture they were of the same design.</li>
            <li> The bristles on these are a little too long and a little too soft to really get the fingernails clean after gardening or potting plants.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re hard enough to get under my nails and clean them but soft enough to use on my sore cuticles.</li>
            <li> Only received pink and purple colors  - the guys in our household don&#x27;t appreciate that too much.</li>
            <li> Lots of other styles on many other sites, but these are the handiest compact brushes around - and can be used for other purposes than cleaning your nails.  </li>
            <li> Each one is about 1.5 inches long with soft bristles that will never get dirt out from underneath fingers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve barely used the brush twice and on the third</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it to make a trip to WalMart and spend the few extra cents for a basic nail brush.</li>
            <li> They say large brushes in their description but then on answering a question they say they are small only 2 inches.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re the right size for little kids but too small for an adult.</li>
            <li> /&gt; too small and narrow for comfortable use.  </li>
            <li> after I loose the last one, I will order these again.</li>
            <li> I am still on a quest for that particular size as the ones I ordered are way too small.  </li>
            <li> Well the brushes I got are for tiny tiny little people with even tiny hands.  </li>
            <li> Not made for guys who get dirty more for kids.</li>
            <li> They were kinda smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> These are only about 2 1/5&amp;#34; in length and 1/2&amp;#34; wide.  </li>
            <li> Suggest you change the picture, as only black and white brushes were sent (not that I care, but some might).</li>
            <li> br /&gt;we use them for other projects and basic cleaning&lt;br /&gt;looking</li>
            <li> They sit out on my counter to dry when I&#x27;m not using them and then by the thrid hand washing, disintegration.</li>
            <li> They are inexpensive yes, but way to small for an adult.</li>
            <li> Not worth it to send them back</li>
            <li> Other than that the brushes appear sturdy and are actually larger than expected - something some may want</li>
            <li> Very tiny... 2 broke already, not very strong.</li>
            <li> a little smaller than I thought they would be</li>
            <li> We use them at the bathrm &amp; kitchen sinks to wash up our hand with... can&#x27;t imagine washing without a brush!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> in length and 1&amp;#34; wide.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s now one at each of our sinks.</li>
            <li> We keep them in the bath tubs, bath sinks and kitchen.  </li>
            <li> They work but not really suited for adults.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I prefer the bristles to be an inch wide.</li>
            <li> They do their job, the bristles are harder than I prefer.</li>
            <li> The brush is stiff enough for car grease.</li>
            <li> Disappointed to have received six of the SAME COLOR when there were 4 colors available.</li>
            <li> other than that it does the job as advertised.</li>
            <li> As several others have said, I don&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s so hard to find these nailbrushes in stores these days.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know these would be so hard to come by when Wal-Mart quiet carrying them.</li>
            <li> am in grease and oil a lot and the bristles just don&#x27;t have the oomph to get down under the nail like I would like.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately these nail brushes can&#x27;t be conveniently hooked on the side of a basket or wire soap/sponge container as my old brush could due to an almost closed handle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never without a half dozen of these type knuckle brushes.  </li>
            <li> These things probably cost them 2 cents each or less to make in China.  </li>
            <li> About two and one half inches by almost a quarter.</li>
            <li> I needed a black one</li>
            <li> They were less $5 for 6</li>
            <li> Not good enough for me.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a small fingernail brush, about 1/4-1/2 inch wide, then this is it.</li>
            <li> one fits perfectly in my little wallet.</li>
            <li> In fact, they are thin and tiny (the size of a pinky finger).</li>
            <li> I used to get these at the dollar store every few years... now can&#x27;t find them any where.  </li>
            <li> After just a few uses, the brushes start bending.</li>
            <li> these are to harsh for kids nails&lt;</li>
            <li> Was hoping for a stiff brush.  </li>
            <li> We used to use these nail brushes years ago but they were a little hard to find now.</li>
            <li> When they arrived a couldn&#x27;t believe how small they where.  </li>
            <li> These are small mini nail brushes.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a bit on the small side....</li>
            <li> I read all kinds of reviews and chose this product, to find out they are way too small.  </li>
            <li> I am pettie woman with small hands.</li>
            <li> I travel for a living, and these are small....</li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed about this.</li>
            <li> I have small hands</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for nail, but didn&#x27;t expect the brush to be that small, the handle part is hard to grip or put fingers through even for me.</li>
            <li> Since I can hardly ever them anymore, I took a chance and ordered online.</li>
            <li> I should have read the negative reviews before ordering, but I didn&#x27;t think there could be any surprises with nail brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These are very small.</li>
            <li> Very small.</li>
            <li> they are very small.  </li>
            <li> They are very small and don&#x27;t work well at all.  </li>
            <li> Very small, almost unusable.  </li>
            <li> NOT HAPPY</li>
            <li> Poor quality on the plastic.</li>
            <li> Difficult to hold unless you have very small hands.  </li>
            <li> Difficult to explain.</li>
            <li> was wrong.</li>
            <li> These brushes are useless for adults, would not have bought them if I had seen the size</li>
            <li> item was TOO SMALL and really worthless</li>
            <li> Since I work in a shop, my nails and fingers get extremely dirty.  </li>
            <li> Also, there are impossible-to-completely-remove UPC codes on EACH nailbrush which is annoying (and unnecessary).</li>
            <li> For the price, not too bad.  </li>
            <li> All broke immediately with 2x uses :-(</li>
            <li> first!&lt;br /&gt;I should have believed the reviews! :-(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> They say large brushes in their description but then on answering a question they say they are small only 2 inches.  What the sam hell are you saying?  These are not nail brushes for anyone but a flipping barbi doll.  Not even worth mailing back.  NOT HAPPY</li>
            <li> item was TOO SMALL and really worthless</li>
            <li> These are very small. I have smaller hands, so, not a major issue, but, bigger would be more useful.</li>
            <li> These are a great deal for multi-pack of nailbrushes, a must-have in the food indsutry - a few dollars for 6 of these keeps us stocked for months, and nail brushes are critical in a chocolate shop.  They are a little small, but I have huge hands and can use them just fine.  The bristles are strong and the construction is good.  It would be nice if the handles were different colors - ours were all blue (thus the subtraction of one star) - but overall, great product.</li>
            <li> Thes brushes are made for children, or elves, or elf children.  They are inexpensive yes, but way to small for an adult.</li>
            <li> great for getting your hands super clean</li>
            <li> I work with my hands so i was looking for a decent scrubber to get out greases and dirt. this looked like a good deal, 6 for a good price. When they arrived a couldn&#x27;t believe how small they where.  Not made for guys who get dirty more for kids. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Although this is what I ordered the picture is not the item I was sent.  Colors are the same but the handle is different and the ones I received are bigger than this.</li>
            <li> did what they were bought for.</li>
            <li> You would think a nail brush could be easily found locally.  Well I looked and looked.  Amazon has it all   found just what I needed.</li>
            <li> I felt misled by the word deluxe in the item, these brushes are tiny. I purchased these brushes believing these brushes were of normal size, similar to the brushes they were replacing since in the picture they were of the same design. I  felt cheated.</li>
            <li> I have been using nail brushes for years. Since I work in a shop, my nails and fingers get extremely dirty.  Well the brushes I got are for tiny tiny little people with even tiny hands.  Since they were so cheap, I will use them till I find the adult size of nail brushes.</li>
            <li> They were kinda smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> Not good enough for me. The brush is made for a preschoolers hand.. not for adults hand .brissles are too too soft.</li>
            <li> SUPER TINY. LOOKS MORE LIKE DENTURE BRUSHES THAN NAIL. WORKS FINE OTHERWISE.</li>
            <li> As several others have said, I don&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s so hard to find these nailbrushes in stores these days.  Everything out there is bigger than necessary and more expensive.  These are perfect.  The bristles are just right, and I like the grip.</li>
            <li> Good brushes in garish neon  colors, if you like that.</li>
            <li> Great little brushes!</li>
            <li> Very small. Did not like very well.</li>
            <li> For some reason I thought they would be wider and bigger. These are small mini nail brushes. They still do the job intended.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a bit on the small side....for our use. We use them for veggie brushes, not for nails. The price is right.</li>
            <li> These are handy little nail brushes. I keep one any where there is a sink. They are pretty colors and hold up very well.</li>
            <li> My thumbs and cuticles get really cracked and sore in the winter months. I&#x27;ve added brushing and exfoliating to my morning routine with these puppies and they&#x27;re really improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are cheap and they fit in my hand very well. The bristle are pliable and soft- probably like a medium toothbrush. They&#x27;re hard enough to get under my nails and clean them but soft enough to use on my sore cuticles.</li>
            <li> Does the job ; saved me trip to Target</li>
            <li> I bought them thinking they&#x27;d be bigger. In fact, they are thin and tiny (the size of a pinky finger). I recommend editing the product description.</li>
            <li> my cats toe nails have never been cleaner, i highly recommend it</li>
            <li> It seemed like a great bargain at first, but after a few months even ones that I hadn&#x27;t used mysteriously deteriorated and disintegrated.</li>
            <li> Very very tiny and too soft</li>
            <li> These brushes are 1/4 the size of the brush I wanted to replace.  Difficult to hold unless you have very small hands.  Not recommended.</li>
            <li> I used to get these at the dollar store every few years... now can&#x27;t find them any where.  We use them at the bathrm &amp; kitchen sinks to wash up our hand with... can&#x27;t imagine washing without a brush!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like this smaller, pointy brush for things like scrubbing a metal mesh strainer, or getting into the tiny grooves up a travel mug lid...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Superior-Nail-Brush-Pack-162/dp/B002PD8F1G/ref&#x3D;pd_sbs_indust_30</li>
            <li> These brushes are as pictured.  The bristles are great and the handle fits my hand ok.  It would be better if the handles had a space in the middle to allow for hanging it over the side of a dish or soap holder.  Difficult to explain.</li>
            <li> As everyone else has stated, we used to be able to find these types of brushes everywhere and now you simply cannot.  I read all kinds of reviews and chose this product, to find out they are way too small.  These are only about 2 1/5&amp;#34; in length and 1/2&amp;#34; wide.  The ones I had stocked up on in the stores years ago are 3 1/2&amp;#34; in length and 1&amp;#34; wide.  I am still on a quest for that particular size as the ones I ordered are way too small.  A kids brush.  Good bristles though and will work, but not what I was expecting.  Wish they would post dimensions when they advertise.</li>
            <li> Bristles are too soft for my taste- might be good for little kids.</li>
            <li> Though they were smaller than I anticipated these are great brushes. The bristles are soft but clean under the nails very well. I was able to place them at sinks, the showers, tub and in the garden shed. Great price.</li>
            <li> These brushes came just tossed into the mailing envelope, not even in a package.  They&#x27;re a little beat up and looked used but clean.  Not the best quality but they suffice ok for nail brush.  I would not recommend these ever.  As much as I hate WalMart, I have to be honest and proclaim that you can buy nail brushes  individually at WalMart for just over $1 each, and those are much better quality (not to mention, they come in a package and look new!).  It&#x27;s worth it to make a trip to WalMart and spend the few extra cents for a basic nail brush.</li>

            <li> At last I found a source for these handy nail brushes!  Lots of other styles on many other sites, but these are the handiest compact brushes around - and can be used for other purposes than cleaning your nails.  There&#x27;s now one at each of our sinks.</li>
            <li> I ordered these.... I travel for a living, and these are small.... yet perfect....... one fits perfectly in my little wallet. when my fingernails get dirty at work, I&#x27;m able to scrub my hands and clean under my nails. so that&#x27;s nice. after I loose the last one, I will order these again.</li>
            <li> These were perfect for the mason jar pedicure favors I hade made up for my bridal shower.  All the girls loved them!</li>
            <li> Seem good.  These were gifts for a local mission.  Our church was putting together toiletry kits with all the essentials.</li>
            <li> These came all the same color.  I wanted different colors so each person could have their own.</li>
            <li> These are a cheaper quality than the ones I used to buy locally - and can&#x27;t find anywhere anymore! After just a few uses, the brushes start bending. Still - cleans under the nails - good price - and nice to have so many around. Poor quality on the plastic. Only received pink and purple colors  - the guys in our household don&#x27;t appreciate that too much. All in all - they work for the price, but I would look for a better quality brush next time around.</li>
            <li> quick delivery useful tool</li>
            <li> We used to use these nail brushes years ago but they were a little hard to find now. They&#x27;re great! Thank you JD Beauty.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking I would never again have to run from drugstore to drugstore looking for a nail brush, how convenient that I could buy a 6 pack!  OK, while still convenient, I was expecting full size brushes. Have they gone by the wayside? Shipping was ok, packed well and arrived in a reasonable time frame. I will still use these but with the arthritis in my hands and their small size I find them more difficult than I would have liked.</li>
            <li> These work well enough to polish off the fine hairs on a frog&#x27;s underbelly...stiff, but not too stiff, soft, but not too soft. The frogs love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never without a half dozen of these type knuckle brushes.  The &#x27;bullhorn&#x27; style handle make them easy to hang on to, and they dig out the grime from cracked skin and under the nails with ease.</li>
            <li> This brush isn&#x27;t as large as I would like. The bristles are the right firmness, but really could use another row added to the brush. Considering I use a scrub brush often after gardening and couldn&#x27;t find any in any town near me, I&#x27;m glad I at least have these until I can locate a better brush. When I do, I&#x27;ll get several. I didn&#x27;t know these would be so hard to come by when Wal-Mart quiet carrying them.</li>
            <li> a little smaller than I thought they would be - but I didn&#x27;t really look at the dimension that closely  - I love that they fit on old school shower door handles so I can store them there and they are not in the way - but right where I need them after getting messy in the yard and taking a shower to clean up</li>
            <li> mini brushes, great for travel, work, car etc...</li>
            <li> They came in different beautiful colors, though alittle thin, they are of good quality.  I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> When I got the brushes not like picture shown. Not happy with brushes a lot rougher than I would have liked and we&#x27;ll not what I ordered wanted what the picture showed.</li>
            <li> They are smaller than I thought they would be, but they do the job. The brush is stiff enough for car grease.</li>
            <li> All broke immediately with 2x uses :-(</li>
            <li> brushes are smaller than expected but still good</li>
            <li> The bristles on these are a little too long and a little too soft to really get the fingernails clean after gardening or potting plants.  I&#x27;ve found that the really stiff, short bristles are better for getting under the fingernails and these are a bit soft for that.  Nevertheless, the are good sized brushes and I&#x27;ve found many good uses for the like scrubbing in stain remover in my laundry and for scrubbing fine cookware or other easy to scratch items that occasionally need a good scrubbing.</li>
            <li> Very cute and fits well in hand.  I use to clean veggies. If you buy bulk just pass along as a mini gift.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed to help my young son thoroughly clean his hands, especially under the nails.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought they would be but they work ok.</li>
            <li> i must not have read the size....they are very small.  great for grandkids - not adults which is what i was looking for.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and a great little packet of nail brushes.  We seem always to be losing nail brushes so having a whole pack will help keep the grandchildren&#x27;s nails clean.</li>
            <li> These are miniscule.  Good for little kids way too small for adult use.</li>
            <li> Who needs so many of these? - well, I&#x27;ve got one by each sink (3), bathroom (2) and one in the garage.  Nice brushed that do the job.</li>
            <li> Super cheap tiny pieces of junk. These things probably cost them 2 cents each or less to make in China.  They are so tiny no one could fit their fingers in them.  Each one is about 1.5 inches long with soft bristles that will never get dirt out from underneath fingers.</li>
            <li> I never seem to have enough of these around the house when I need them.  Now I do!  They are not the best quality but they seem to be lasting and very convenient and reasonable.</li>
            <li> This brush although a good value is&lt;br /&gt; too small and narrow for comfortable use.  Its not a&lt;br /&gt;good choice for us.</li>
            <li> We keep them in the bath tubs, bath sinks and kitchen.  Durable.  Get the job done!</li>
            <li> A good deal for the package, but the bristles are a little soft for my taste.  I farm, garden, and am in grease and oil a lot and the bristles just don&#x27;t have the oomph to get down under the nail like I would like.  Perhaps I need to use a steel welding brush....</li>
            <li> In the picture the brush handles are all different colors, when I received the item all the brushes are simply clear. I was pretty disappointed about this.</li>
            <li> Too dainty and not enough brawn to clean...&lt;br /&gt;Just whisks over the dirt under the nails or knuckles, might as well have used a Kleenex,&lt;br /&gt;Just too lightly made.</li>
            <li> Got this because my kids play and get toes and nails dirty so this work great</li>
            <li> For the price, not too bad.  A little smaller than expected and feel a bit cheaply made,  but they were cheap, so....  Good enough.</li>
            <li> Was hoping for a stiff brush.  Nice to do light clean around nails.</li>
            <li> I was looking for the smaller version.  These are great for someone who wants larger ones.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fingernail brushes, but better suited for children. VERY tiny. About two and one half inches by almost a quarter. TINY! They work but not really suited for adults.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just being honest!</li>
            <li> great product--works as expected, glad its a six pack for all sinks in house</li>
            <li> these are to harsh for kids nails&lt;br /&gt;we use them for other projects and basic cleaning&lt;br /&gt;looking for an alternate</li>
            <li> Needs to be larger for my man-hands.  Can&#x27;t grip the handles and the brush needs to be a lot stiffer.</li>
            <li> price was good, they could be a tad larger.</li>
            <li> Nie indeed! Order two packs, they come in handy for more things than you can dream of!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and was as described in profile. A bit smaller than what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really just too small and don&#x27;t seem to do that great a job on my fingernails.  I don&#x27;t know why I can&#x27;t find the ones I used to get when I was younger.</li>
            <li> These are great for getting those hard crusty, yucky spots scrubbed off your skin while still leaving you some!  Great for athlete&#x27;s foot, psoriasis, fungus, etc.  I love these brushes!</li>
            <li> Got what I paid for.  J Pohl</li>
            <li> Remember when brushes like these used to be readily available at any drug store? So do I. Since I can hardly ever them anymore, I took a chance and ordered online. They&#x27;re exactly what I wanted, the perfect size to hang from my shower caddy. If you&#x27;re picky about color, you might want to drop the seller a line. Mine are all blue, but that&#x27;s fine. Since they&#x27;re for my shower, I didn&#x27;t care about color at all.</li>
            <li> These little guys are pretty amazing. I bought them so that my kids can wash under their fingernails. They actually work really well. I&#x27;ve had them for about 3 months or so now and the brushes are still really crisp.</li>
            <li> Good, stiff bristles to clean hands and nails thoroughly.  Sturdy plastic, conveniently shaped handle.  I put one in each bathroom, plus two in the kitchen - one for hands, one to clean apples, potatoes, nectarines, pears, peaches, etc.  This is a versatile product that has many applications for home and garage.</li>
            <li> I should have read the negative reviews before ordering, but I didn&#x27;t think there could be any surprises with nail brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong. These brushes are TINY. I have small hands and I can barely get my fingers comfortably around the handles. Not worth it to send them back, so I&#x27;ll try to use them, but I&#x27;ll definitely have to find something else for my husband&#x27;s big hands.</li>
            <li> Good brushes, sturdy, bristles are actually hard (which is needed and many nailbrushes don&#x27;t have). Suggest you change the picture, as only black and white brushes were sent (not that I care, but some might). Also, there are impossible-to-completely-remove UPC codes on EACH nailbrush which is annoying (and unnecessary).</li>
            <li> Thank you for prompt and fast delivery. I love my brushes and they work exactly the way they should. For the price I consider that I got an excellent deal for the money. Keep those deals coming!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good nail brush.  These are definately not what I was looking for.  They are very small and don&#x27;t work well at all.  Pass on this!</li>
            <li> Awesomely priced, and super useful. Many thanks for offering at such a low price, as some others listed even just a single brush for 3 and 4 times as much as this seller is offering a pack of 6.</li>
            <li> these are for children , not adults.</li>
            <li> Very tiny... 2 broke already, not very strong.</li>
            <li> Break easily, bristles are a bit too soft</li>
            <li> Very small, almost unusable.  Good for cleaning cracks and detailing though.</li>
            <li> The quality is fine, but just too small. If you are looking for a small fingernail brush, about 1/4-1/2 inch wide, then this is it. I prefer the bristles to be an inch wide.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve barely used the brush twice and on the third try it fell apart into so many pieces in my hand that it was like it disintegrated. After only using it TWO times. Ok. That could have been a fluke. Tried a second brush, and the same thing happened. I have dropped them. They sit out on my counter to dry when I&#x27;m not using them and then by the thrid hand washing, disintegration. I just had this exact same thing happen with the third brush. I should have taken a picture. I will the next time the fourth one falls apart without a doubt the third time I go I use it. Utter rubbish. If I could have given it 1/4th of a star I would have.</li>
            <li> When I received this my first thoughts were I paid to much. other than that it does the job as advertised.</li>
            <li> Very tiny but functional.  I needed a black one -- that is the only reason I ordered them.</li>
            <li> These are much smaller than what I&#x27;m used to purchasing in the store, but they&#x27;ll do the trick. I ordered these for my 10 year old culinary students to scrubs under their nails when washing their hands. They&#x27;re the right size for little kids but too small for an adult. They were less $5 for 6 so there&#x27;s really no room for complaining (LOL).</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes. Great deal.</li>
            <li> I have a &amp;#34;full size&amp;#34; one of these.  This one is good for fitting into a purse.</li>
            <li> These brushes are useless for adults, would not have bought them if I had seen the size first!&lt;br /&gt;I should have believed the reviews! :-(</li>
            <li> Smaller than you think.</li>
            <li> i bought these for my toddler grandchildren. They are a good size for them and work nicely. They enjoy being able to clean their nails after a busy day outdoors, and I appreciate getting to keep my personal brush for myself.</li>
            <li> brushes were not tough enough for me.  good price though</li>
            <li> good product good service</li>
            <li> Unfortunately these nail brushes can&#x27;t be conveniently hooked on the side of a basket or wire soap/sponge container as my old brush could due to an almost closed handle.  Also the seller sent me one color on all brushes (and as it happens my least favorite color) instead of the multi colored package of six as depicted in the description.  They need to change that description.  I received six blue brushes.  Other than that the brushes appear sturdy and are actually larger than expected - something some may want but I didn&#x27;t.  I wanted more compact brushes but that may have been my own fault as I cant remember if the dimensions were given and if so then it would have been up to me to note that. If none of these features is an issue for you I say go for it but if they are - look elsewhere. The shipping speed was quite good.</li>
            <li> They do their job, the bristles are harder than I prefer.</li>
            <li> Received my order today, item appears just like pictured. Disappointed to have received six of the SAME COLOR when there were 4 colors available. I had hoped to be able to tell my personal nail brush apart from the one my husband will use to scrub the shaving residue from the sink. No comment on quality; have not used yet. Wish there had been variety in colors.</li>
