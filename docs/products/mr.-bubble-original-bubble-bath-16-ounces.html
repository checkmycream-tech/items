            <li>Has there ever been a better bath product than Mr. Bubble?  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t looked elsewhere, but would guess Wal Mart is an even better deal if they carry it.</li>

            <li>I love the smell of Mr. Bubble.</li>
            <li>I love Mr. Bubble.</li>
            <li>You will have to put more so it will make more bubbles.</li>
            <li>I have to pour a ton into the water to get a nice full bubble bath.</li>
            <li>The scent is ok, very mild.</li>
            <li>I love this product, but would buy it more often if it reminded me of my original Mr. Bubble.  </li>
            <li>(If this happens to you, a dustpan is good for cleaning up the mess, then throw the dustpan into the dishwasher, lol)</li>
            <li>and it is a mild soap - you dont have to worry about anything!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try Johnson and Johnson&#x27;s tear free bubble bath</li>
            <li>Not quite the same, but a good product anyway.</li>
            <li>now really what is not to love with Mr. Bubble -plus</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m allowed to have a full house Water softener.</li>
            <li>I have to use more than 2 ounces of this to make a decent amount of bubbles in my tub.</li>
            <li>it is mild -</li>
            <li>This is a nice big bottle of bubbles!</li>
            <li>Mr. Bubbles creates so many more bubbles in a thick blanket compared to my many Amazon orders.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter how old you are, if you want a bubble bath Mr. Bubble is the right place to be!!</li>
            <li>, we tried the sensitive skin kind first, and when that proved nearly unusable we got a bottle of the regular to see if it&#x27;d be any better -</li>
            <li>You are much better off buying this locally.  </li>
            <li>The best, but only arrived open because the bottle cap doesn&#x27;t have internal protection.</li>
            <li>I have a large plastic egg beater that is made for non-stick pan use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a small, goofy indulgence that cheers me up, and, I should mention, helps get me clean.</li>
            <li>The bubbles didn&#x27;t make as much bubbles as the ones I found at a dollar store.</li>
            <li>It would have lasted much longer if my daughter hadn&#x27;t spilled the whole thing on the bathroom floor.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really recommend it, even if it doesn&#x27;t happen to every child.</li>
            <li>bottle was not packed very well from Amazon and the weight of it cracked a CD case that was also being shipped.</li>
            <li>Cost to much to send it back.&lt;br /&gt;need</li>
            <li>My son loves it although it doesnt produce that much bubbles.</li>
            <li>Also the tub we used it in was quite large, so felt like we had to use like 1/2 the bottle to get a decent amount of bubbles.</li>
            <li>It still has the same familiar smell.</li>
            <li>then the tub simply rinses clean</li>
            <li>Why not bring back the old box of Mr. Bubble with the original image?</li>
            <li>Now he&#x27;s a solid darker pink and looks more like a frog.  </li>
            <li>The tub actually froths up high with large bubbles.</li>
            <li>: I live near the ocean</li>
            <li>One small cap of this stuff is more than enough to generate enough suds to completely conceal Wynonna Judd, if you could find a crane strong enough to drop her fat carcass into a tub that is.  </li>
            <li>Purchased Mr. Bubble for old times sake.</li>
            <li>My 3 year old broke out in a rash after using this product.</li>
            <li>The version they&#x27;re hawking currently is a ringer, but if it&#x27;s anything like mine, it will hold together until well after your Social Security checks start rolling in.  </li>
            <li>Seemed very watered down vs buying locally.</li>

            <li> I remember Mr Bubble filling up the entire bathtub with bubbles before a few ounces of water actually accumulated at the bottom of the tub.  </li>
            <li> remember bubble bath in the 80s that gave me mounds of fluffy bubbles at least a couple inches high, especially around the spout.</li>
            <li> I ran out and got in big trouble with my kids</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sad to say my daughter got one after the first use of Mr. Bubble, so</li>
            <li> Mr. Bubble used to be PALE pink, and round, and actually looked like a bubble.  </li>
            <li> only complaint would be</li>
            <li> Seems Mr. Bubble&#x27;s been around for as long as, oh, the Rolling Stones, but it continues to deliver the goods (unlike Keith, Mick, Charlie, and Ronnie - in the studio at least).  </li>
            <li> Well my husband rinsed her hair and she started crying.</li>
            <li> Luckily I&#x27;m not rating this product based on the shipping!</li>
            <li> Sometimes just the promise of Mr. Bubble is enough to send them on a mad dash for the bathroom, leaving footprints on each other&#x27;s backs.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what is happening.</li>
            <li> The crap I get right after pouring this into the tub looks like the sad remains of those bubbles after I&#x27;d been playing in the tub for 15-20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if all modern bubble baths are this weak, or if Mr Bubbles can still trade so heavily on its brand name that it doesn&#x27;t need to produce a quality product, but I will definitely be trying all other brands after this miserable</li>
            <li> Duh...</li>
            <li> But worse than that, it burns my boys&#x27; eyes.</li>
            <li> The lid was broken and the bottle leaked.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as bubbly-producing as I imagined.. perhaps my expectations were unrealistic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really sad.  </li>
            <li> Her eyes were so red it was insane.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I will NEVER buy this!</li>
            <li> So it wasn&#x27;t just one bad bottle, either.)</li>
            <li> :(  </li>
            <li> But its too watery for my taste and thought it would have a thicker base.  </li>

            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as bubbly-producing as I imagined.. perhaps my expectations were unrealistic. Also the tub we used it in was quite large, so felt like we had to use like 1/2 the bottle to get a decent amount of bubbles. Might just be an issue of the tub size, but the one bottle didn&#x27;t go a long ways.</li>
            <li> Purchased Mr. Bubble for old times sake. Not quite the same, but a good product anyway.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter how old you are, if you want a bubble bath Mr. Bubble is the right place to be!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 5 stars based on the Mr. Bubble that was out when I was a kid... in a box... in powder form!  Anyone else remember that?  It smelled so good and some would always go up my nose LOL couldn&#x27;t wait until bath time.  Ahhh the glorious 70&#x27;s  :-)</li>
            <li> My 3 year old broke out in a rash after using this product.</li>
            <li> My kids love taking bubble baths, I use it every day. Great value for the price!</li>
            <li> I have to pour a ton into the water to get a nice full bubble bath. But worse than that, it burns my boys&#x27; eyes. They have bloodshot eyes and red eyelids by the end of the bath. My little one (14 months) cries if he rubs his eyes and my older boy (2 3/4 years) yells for me to dry his eyes if he touches them. It&#x27;s really sad.  :(  I see so many great reviews, but I just don&#x27;t get why. Seems like most people like for the nostalgia. I&#x27;ll try Johnson and Johnson&#x27;s tear free bubble bath and I hope it&#x27;s better!</li>
            <li> The bubbles didn&#x27;t make as much bubbles as the ones I found at a dollar store. I have to use more than 2 ounces of this to make a decent amount of bubbles in my tub.</li>
            <li> My kids love this bubble bath!</li>
            <li> This is GREAT! My daughter loves the bubbles! and it is a mild soap - you dont have to worry about anything!  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Mr Bubble is the only bubbles I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t clog hot-tub filters or appaently affect water chemistry. Eventually, after about a week the bubbles just go away.</li>
            <li> I got this as a sample through a website thinking &amp;#34;maybe this is something else I can try for my daughter. Well my husband rinsed her hair and she started crying. Her eyes were so red it was insane. She was rubbing her eyes and telling me her eyes hurt. Needless to say I will NEVER buy this!</li>
            <li> I love this product, but would buy it more often if it reminded me of my original Mr. Bubble.  Mr. Bubble used to be PALE pink, and round, and actually looked like a bubble.  Now he&#x27;s a solid darker pink and looks more like a frog.  Why not bring back the old box of Mr. Bubble with the original image?</li>
            <li> Seemed very watered down vs buying locally. when it arrived, all bottles were leaking and had leaked almost 1/4 of each bottle. loved mr bubbles before this purchase. won&#x27;t buy online again.</li>
            <li> It would have lasted much longer if my daughter hadn&#x27;t spilled the whole thing on the bathroom floor.  (If this happens to you, a dustpan is good for cleaning up the mess, then throw the dustpan into the dishwasher, lol)</li>
            <li> With a brand name like &amp;#34;Mr Bubble&amp;#34; and a history spanning decades, you&#x27;d think that this would be a brand you could trust to... y&#x27;know... make bubbles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is about 90% water. Pouring 1/4 (or more) into an average bathtub results in a sparse smattering of thin bubbles, that will be gone within three or four minutes of the average toddler&#x27;s splashing around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember bubble bath in the 80s that gave me mounds of fluffy bubbles at least a couple inches high, especially around the spout. The crap I get right after pouring this into the tub looks like the sad remains of those bubbles after I&#x27;d been playing in the tub for 15-20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if all modern bubble baths are this weak, or if Mr Bubbles can still trade so heavily on its brand name that it doesn&#x27;t need to produce a quality product, but I will definitely be trying all other brands after this miserable showing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(For the record, we tried the sensitive skin kind first, and when that proved nearly unusable we got a bottle of the regular to see if it&#x27;d be any better - it&#x27;s not. So it wasn&#x27;t just one bad bottle, either.)</li>
            <li> The person I bought it for loved it</li>
            <li> Well, I know there is a risk in children who take bubble baths to get a UTI and I&#x27;m sad to say my daughter got one after the first use of Mr. Bubble, so I can&#x27;t really recommend it, even if it doesn&#x27;t happen to every child.</li>
            <li> This is a nice big bottle of bubbles! It provides lots and lots of dense bubbles in your bath :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle was not packed very well from Amazon and the weight of it cracked a CD case that was also being shipped. Luckily I&#x27;m not rating this product based on the shipping!</li>
            <li> OMG childhood memories ! Love it !</li>
            <li> For some reason, this formulation wasn&#x27;t as bubbly as the ones I&#x27;ve purchased from the store. Still serves the purpose though!</li>
            <li> Seems Mr. Bubble&#x27;s been around for as long as, oh, the Rolling Stones, but it continues to deliver the goods (unlike Keith, Mick, Charlie, and Ronnie - in the studio at least).  One small cap of this stuff is more than enough to generate enough suds to completely conceal Wynonna Judd, if you could find a crane strong enough to drop her fat carcass into a tub that is.  I was brought up on Mr. Bubble and I use it when I give my three kids baths, whether they like it or not.  Sometimes just the promise of Mr. Bubble is enough to send them on a mad dash for the bathroom, leaving footprints on each other&#x27;s backs.  Plus, in a stroke of marketing genius, there&#x27;s an offer on the back label for a Mr. Bubble T-shirt, which your trusty scribe used to sport when he haunted Detroit&#x27;s punk clubs back in the late 70&#x27;s and early 80&#x27;s.  It was the source of countless compliments and I still have it and wear it to this day (at the tender age of 46!).  The version they&#x27;re hawking currently is a ringer, but if it&#x27;s anything like mine, it will hold together until well after your Social Security checks start rolling in.  Has there ever been a better bath product than Mr. Bubble?  Duh...</li>
            <li> You are much better off buying this locally.  Walgreens is substantially cheaper.  I haven&#x27;t looked elsewhere, but would guess Wal Mart is an even better deal if they carry it.</li>
            <li> now really what is not to love with Mr. Bubble -plus it is mild - I  I add a cup of Epsom Salts to the bath which acts as a softener and makes lots of bubbles  then the tub simply rinses clean</li>
            <li> What can I say?  It makes bubbles and the kids love it.  I ran out and got in big trouble with my kids so I need to keep some backup bottles.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Mr. Bubble. It&#x27;s second to none. It&#x27;s a small, goofy indulgence that cheers me up, and, I should mention, helps get me clean. 100% recommended. I love Mr. Bubble.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter as a stocking stuffer.  It smells just as good as it did when she was a baby 19 years ago.  Just love it!</li>
            <li> The lid was broken and the bottle leaked.  Cost to much to send it back.&lt;br /&gt;need to find it in a store and purchase outright</li>
            <li> The best, but only arrived open because the bottle cap doesn&#x27;t have internal protection. One off the last one I ordered arrived empty.</li>
            <li> This is the 5th bottle for me. I also like Johnson &amp; Johnson. I&#x27;m biased because this is what I remember as a child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might have a different experience with this product compared to others do to the following reason: I live near the ocean and I&#x27;m allowed to have a full house Water softener. This makes a big difference with bubble creation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second thing I&#x27;ve done is not to rely on the water faucet to create all the bubbles. I have a large plastic egg beater that is made for non-stick pan use ([[ASIN:B00004OCNU OXO Good Grips Nylon Balloon Whisk]]).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I add the Mr. Bubbles &amp; let the bath tub fill up about 1 inch. I then beat the heck out of the water. The tub actually froths up high with large bubbles. Then finish filling up tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint would be I thought the bubbles would be multicolored like quality outdoor bubbles are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2/21/13 :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Not sure what is happening. I ran out of my Amazon order of Mr.Bubbles. I went to my local Walmart &amp; found it there. The Walmart Mr. Bubbles creates so many more bubbles in a thick blanket compared to my many Amazon orders. I&#x27;m at a loss of words on why. I no longer have to go through the eggbeater procedure either. Just turn on the faucet.</li>
            <li> I remember Mr Bubble filling up the entire bathtub with bubbles before a few ounces of water actually accumulated at the bottom of the tub.  More like Mr. Soap Suds!</li>
            <li> My son loves it although it doesnt produce that much bubbles. You will have to put more so it will make more bubbles. The scent is ok, very mild. Good for kids though.</li>
            <li> I bought it for the nostalgia.  But its too watery for my taste and thought it would have a thicker base.  It still has the same familiar smell.</li>
