    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>SNAPS PERFECTLY ON ANDIS PRODUCTS I OWN.</li>
            <li>I had some clips like this before that were great.</li>
            <li>Great Service and item</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have a perfect fit</li>
            <li>If they were smooth would give 5 stars because the length is great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This should be noted more prominently.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t fit my trimmer but seemed legit</li>
            <li>so I had to use pliers to make  them fit snugly to the  clipper</li>
            <li>My original guard had a #5</li>
            <li>I was excited to find replacements.</li>
            <li>Even after the adjustment, it did not snap on crisply like the original!</li>
            <li>It took good 15 minutes to get it fitted just right...even after that the guide did not sit flatly on.  </li>
            <li>I need it right now.  </li>
            <li>My second one is holding up fine after 2 months.</li>
            <li>The difference will be felt when trying to snap the guard on any of my prior tools I use to enjoy.</li>
            <li>instead of buying the whole set you can just get the one you need.</li>
            <li>The fit was as bit loose</li>
            <li>The first time I ordered this product, one of the teeth had a crack in it and ended up breaking on the 2nd use.  </li>
            <li>GAME CHANGER and much better haircuts of course!</li>
            <li>I usually skip the small list of &amp;#34;features&amp;#34; at the top of the page and go straight to the description.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However these are so sharp on the ends they really scratch up the customers scalp.</li>
            <li>Too much hassle and too little money invested to bother shipping it back for a refund.</li>

            <li> This attachment is just as likely to pull your hair out by the root as it is to guide the cutting blade to a smooth cut.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint is what feels like a micro-level of flash across the scalp as I cut my hair low.  </li>
            <li> Lifelong Andis user, though...I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> so be careful as they may scratch a tender scalp</li>
            <li> SHARP POINTS</li>
            <li> but my other guard broke and</li>
            <li> I am going to try to return the incorrect item, but it&#x27;s almost not worth doing.  </li>
            <li> for the price , it is not worth the hassle to return them..</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed that a supposedly universal attachment intended to fit Andis does not fit my Andis.  </li>
            <li> Made the mistake of ordering this for my Ceramic BGCR+ without realizing it does NOT fit detachable blade</li>
            <li> and this did not fit,</li>
            <li> You would think you do not need to mess with it!  </li>
            <li> NOT MUCH TO ELABORATE ON.</li>
            <li> Hope it helps save someone else some trouble!</li>
            <li> Horrible fit..</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this is one of those that I just chalked up as a negative experience.  </li>
            <li> The wrong attachment was sent - instead of a 1/16 clip, a 1/8 snap-on attachment was sent instead...  </li>
            <li> , unfortunately attachment comb broke, got this</li>
            <li> WRONG ATTACHMENT - THREW OUT.</li>
            <li> The labeled cutting depth isn&#x27;t even correct.</li>
            <li> The product description for this is also terribly written and does not mention this not fitting detachable blade clippers.</li>
            <li> Horribly designed.  </li>

            <li> NOT MUCH TO ELABORATE ON. SOLID. SHARP POINTS THOUGH ON THE ENDS. SNAPS PERFECTLY ON ANDIS PRODUCTS I OWN. SATIFIED</li>
            <li> This attachment is just as likely to pull your hair out by the root as it is to guide the cutting blade to a smooth cut.  Horribly designed.  The labeled cutting depth isn&#x27;t even correct.</li>
            <li> Made the mistake of ordering this for my Ceramic BGCR+ without realizing it does NOT fit detachable blade clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This should be noted more prominently. The product description for this is also terribly written and does not mention this not fitting detachable blade clippers. I usually skip the small list of &amp;#34;features&amp;#34; at the top of the page and go straight to the description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m rating this 1 star for the collective issues noted. Hope it helps save someone else some trouble!</li>
            <li> The wrong attachment was sent - instead of a 1/16 clip, a 1/8 snap-on attachment was sent instead...  I am going to try to return the incorrect item, but it&#x27;s almost not worth doing.  Hopefully, I&#x27;ll receive the correct attachment on the second try.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t fit my trimmer but seemed legit</li>
            <li> Only complaint is what feels like a micro-level of flash across the scalp as I cut my hair low.  Low level clippers should probably be the last with this problem out of the mfr&#x27;s door.  Lifelong Andis user, though...I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have the GTX experience, unfortunately attachment comb broke, got this and this did not fit, so if that&#x27;s what you have, save your money and don&#x27;t get this.</li>
            <li> The guard looks similar to the other guards with the clear exemption in the clip. My original guard had a #5 these however come with a 2. The difference will be felt when trying to snap the guard on any of my prior tools I use to enjoy.</li>
            <li> WRONG ATTACHMENT - THREW OUT.</li>
            <li> I had some clips like this before that were great. They were given to me by a co-worker. I am a barber.  I was excited to find replacements. However these are so sharp on the ends they really scratch up the customers scalp. Unusable because of this defect. If they were smooth would give 5 stars because the length is great.</li>
            <li> I got this but my other guard broke and this is identical to the ones I had</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a perfect fit It&#x27;s usable though</li>
            <li> Great Service and item</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed that a supposedly universal attachment intended to fit Andis does not fit my Andis.  Unfortunately, this is one of those that I just chalked up as a negative experience.  Too much hassle and too little money invested to bother shipping it back for a refund.</li>
            <li> instead of buying the whole set you can just get the one you need. GAME CHANGER and much better haircuts of course!</li>
            <li> Horrible fit.. this is not from Andis.. some knock-off!  I had to use a pair of plyers to adjust the clip.  It took good 15 minutes to get it fitted just right...even after that the guide did not sit flatly on.  But it will do for now.. for the price , it is not worth the hassle to return them.. I need it right now.  I would not order them if you do not want to have to adjust them.  You would think you do not need to mess with it!  The metal clip that attaches the comb is thinner than the actual ones that came from Andis.  Even after the adjustment, it did not snap on crisply like the original!</li>
            <li> Guards are a tad pointy so be careful as they may scratch a tender scalp</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered this product, one of the teeth had a crack in it and ended up breaking on the 2nd use.  I asked for a replacement, but realized it would be about the same amount to just buy another one after the return shipping would&#x27;ve been paid.  My second one is holding up fine after 2 months.</li>
            <li> The fit was as bit loose so I had to use pliers to make  them fit snugly to the  clipper</li>
