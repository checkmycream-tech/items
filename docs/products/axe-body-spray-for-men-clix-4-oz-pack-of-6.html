            <li>Great deodorant/body spray and a great price for the six pack</li>

            <li>My husband is happy he has the deodorant he likes, and I&#x27;m happy that I won&#x27;t have to go from store to store looking for this stuff.  </li>
            <li>The price on this product is also a great bargain.  </li>
            <li>Great product great price</li>

            <li>Always  Happy With Amazon</li>
            <li>It smells good and lasts for a while.</li>
            <li>I always keep a good amount of these Axe Sprays in stock.</li>
            <li>This has a good clean/masculine scent.</li>
            <li>Loved it.  </li>
            <li>so it’s great to be able to order it.  </li>
            <li>For me Clix is a great scent, and isn’t overpowering or overly “spiced” like many of newer scents tend to be.</li>
            <li>but when I tried it I was happy with my purchase and will gladly buy again.</li>
            <li>but they wanna charge $2 more on here but give you a discount as if you are getting a great deal...</li>
            <li>I loved the smell, my spouse and others liked the smell of it.</li>
            <li>Great products,  fast delivery and a very good price.</li>
            <li>I think that it is nice.</li>
            <li>good stuff, smells great, like a fresh shower sent.</li>
            <li>The smell is too strong, so it lingers, its not even pleasant that you could tolerate it.  </li>
            <li>BEEN USING AXE FOR MANY YEARS GOOD STUFF WOMAN LOVE IT</li>
            <li>Amazon got this 6 packs for over $17, best value I found so far.</li>
            <li>Good after shower clean smell.</li>
            <li>My favorite deoderant</li>
            <li>love smells, I&#x27;m going to order it again for my and hopefully for my wife:-)</li>
            <li>This is my favorite brand of deodorant.</li>
            <li>It seems like this happens a lot, so when I saw a six-pack available (WITH PRIME SHIPPING--BONUS!)</li>
            <li>We both love the scent.</li>
            <li>So in glad I found one that came in bulk</li>
            <li>his favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li>I really love this fragrence but in the tittle it says 6 pack and in the product features</li>
            <li>This is my favorite spray, I even use it as a car fragrance, I get compliments on the scent.</li>
            <li>This fragrance of Axe doesn&#x27;t seem to be available in stores any more in my area.</li>
            <li>I use this after I use the gel, especially on hot days, it helps that smooth out the sweaty snell you get when it&#x27;s humid.</li>
            <li>Best price on amazon (pack of 6 for $17), but its odor is cheaper than other axes</li>
            <li>I order most of my toiletries off of amazon (Look into getting prime, it&#x27;s worth it) but buying things you use every day in bulk can save you a lot of money.  </li>
            <li>My husband and boy&#x27;s love this, and were thrilled when I was able to get it thru this site due to they don&#x27;t sell this in stores.</li>
            <li>Fast ship recommend highly all good</li>
            <li>The item itself is great, love this smell but not sure whats going on with the price.</li>
            <li>And I work indoors where it&#x27;s not always cool temperatures.</li>
            <li>, the smell is crisp and clean.  </li>
            <li>love it quick fix especially after the gym and its cheap</li>
            <li>I have had to move out of any room that I sprayed this in, including the toilet because the smell is so strong you won&#x27;t be able to use it as a room/toilet freshener, let alone as a deo.</li>
            <li>The price for this will not be worth.</li>
            <li>Getting a pack of 6 with such a low price is amazing!</li>
            <li>… I can’t find it the Clix scent locally any more</li>
            <li>Same quality and better value</li>
            <li>Amazon is the only place I&#x27;ve been able to find this scent.</li>
            <li>Am going to definitely buy more.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping and product was as described.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I simply could not wait any longer and have now put in a claim with Amazon requesting a full refund.</li>
            <li>I am off to Walmart to purchase my deodorant and will pay a lot more however it will be far less stressful than this whole debacle!</li>
            <li>Less fragrance and more aerosol.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I highly recommend finding a scent that works for you them searching to see if you can get a multi pack.</li>
            <li>Had been using Axe over the past couple years, love the smell</li>
            <li>Which as far as I am concerned is unacceptable!</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than buying individually.</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin and yet this thing just itches.</li>
            <li>All of the other Axe sprays that I have smelled seem like something for a high school kid going on his first date.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I was little hesitant in the first place to buy this as no one else keep it for me to try and see how it smells.</li>

            <li> That&#x27;s way too long.  </li>
            <li> For some strange reason.</li>
            <li> Strange.</li>
            <li> This particular smell of Axe Body Spray is extremely hard to find.</li>
            <li> Stings less than other Axe products.</li>
            <li> Whilst Amazon has been very helpful I am VERY disappointed with the Vendor who has really let me down.</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> This is the worst possible deo anyone can buy.</li>
            <li> It has become extremely difficult to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Sorry Amazon,</li>
            <li> It in fact stinks, I can&#x27;t imagine someone would wear this one out of choice.</li>
            <li> Wasted 17$ Scent lasts 15 minutes after dousing oneself, and what scent does remain smells terrible.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s disappointing wasting time and money.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy and won&#x27;t ever buy Axe again</li>
            <li> Worst product from AXE.</li>
            <li> Which sounds outrageous but was still cheaper after the Vendor&#x27;s discount than buying the items from a store here in Hawaii.</li>

            <li> Great deodorant/body spray and a great price for the six pack… I can’t find it the Clix scent locally any more so it’s great to be able to order it.  For me Clix is a great scent, and isn’t overpowering or overly “spiced” like many of newer scents tend to be.</li>
            <li> This fragrance of Axe doesn&#x27;t seem to be available in stores any more in my area. I think that it is nice. All of the other Axe sprays that I have smelled seem like something for a high school kid going on his first date.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>

            <li> Good after shower clean smell.</li>
            <li> My favorite deoderant</li>
            <li> Worst product from AXE. I specifically logged online to write a review. This is the worst possible deo anyone can buy. It in fact stinks, I can&#x27;t imagine someone would wear this one out of choice. Great one though to prank your friends and family. The smell is too strong, so it lingers, its not even pleasant that you could tolerate it.  I have had to move out of any room that I sprayed this in, including the toilet because the smell is so strong you won&#x27;t be able to use it as a room/toilet freshener, let alone as a deo. My salute to anyone who likes it, I am never buying this again. Don&#x27;t say that you weren&#x27;t warned before.&lt;br /&gt;Personally to me it is a very fked up smell- like a cross between dead rodent and brute aftershave.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and product was as described.</li>
            <li> Awesome. WIll definitely buy it again</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.Those are Wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I love smells, I&#x27;m going to order it again for my and hopefully for my wife:-)</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brand of deodorant. It smells good and lasts for a while. This pack of 6 is an excellent deal. Much cheaper than buying individually.</li>
            <li> Best price on amazon (pack of 6 for $17), but its odor is cheaper than other axes</li>
            <li> This is the only type of deodorant my husband will use.  If we got to the store and they are out, we have to go to another store.  It seems like this happens a lot, so when I saw a six-pack available (WITH PRIME SHIPPING--BONUS!), I went for it.  The cans were properly packaged and arrived within the expected two-day period.  My husband is happy he has the deodorant he likes, and I&#x27;m happy that I won&#x27;t have to go from store to store looking for this stuff.  The price on this product is also a great bargain.  I hope they continue to stock this product.</li>
            <li> Wasted 17$ Scent lasts 15 minutes after dousing oneself, and what scent does remain smells terrible. To add insult to injury, one of the 6 cans doesn&#x27;t even spray. Very unhappy and won&#x27;t ever buy Axe again</li>
            <li> Best value when I got them.  Had been using Axe over the past couple years, love the smell, the smell is crisp and clean.  Amazon got this 6 packs for over $17, best value I found so far.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this smell. It has become extremely difficult to find in stores. However, a 6 pack on here is a very good price. The items arrived timely and undamaged. They were all packaged with wrapping so you could tell they had not been used.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend. We both love the scent. I would buy it again. Price was great!</li>
            <li> good stuff, smells great, like a fresh shower sent.</li>
            <li> Great deal - and best way to keep this item in stock and beat the box store prices</li>
            <li> I use this after I use the gel, especially on hot days, it helps that smooth out the sweaty snell you get when it&#x27;s humid. And I work indoors where it&#x27;s not always cool temperatures.</li>
            <li> Great product great price</li>
            <li> buy these often at rx .. Same quality and better value</li>
            <li> Great service, great price</li>
            <li> My husband and boy&#x27;s love this, and were thrilled when I was able to get it thru this site due to they don&#x27;t sell this in stores.</li>
            <li> Amazon is the only place I&#x27;ve been able to find this scent. Price was great. Thanks.</li>
            <li> This particular smell of Axe Body Spray is extremely hard to find. So in glad I found one that came in bulk so I could stick up for my boyfriend. He loves this scent &amp; so do I!</li>
            <li> love it quick fix especially after the gym and its cheap</li>
            <li> Fast ship recommend highly all good</li>
            <li> BEEN USING AXE FOR MANY YEARS GOOD STUFF WOMAN LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I always keep a good amount of these Axe Sprays in stock. This has a good clean/masculine scent.</li>
            <li> The item itself is great, love this smell but not sure whats going on with the price. The unit price here is 28.7/6&#x3D;4.79 when you can buy it at a local WalMart for 7.94/2&#x3D;3.97.....don&#x27;t understand why ???????</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Took about a month to get to me.  That&#x27;s way too long.  It had said would be one week. Yeah.</li>
            <li> Getting a pack of 6 with such a low price is amazing!</li>
            <li> The best deodorant ever seen.</li>
            <li> a gift for my son... his favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> Stocking up on it will ultimately save you a bunch of money</li>
            <li> I have two teenage boys and this is all they ask for..I need to buy in bulk</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin and yet this thing just itches. It smells like rotten eggs. Buy the Phoenix instead of this. The price for this will not be worth.</li>
            <li> I placed an order for 2x6 packs on March 9th and had to pay $22 in shipping fees for the delivery to Hawaii. Which sounds outrageous but was still cheaper after the Vendor&#x27;s discount than buying the items from a store here in Hawaii. It is now April 10th and the items have still not arrived even after paying $22 in shipping fees. I called Amazon a week ago with respect to this matter and they advised that they would contact the Vendor to investigate the matter which they duly did. I received an email back saying that they were looking into the matter. I replied saying that I would like a replacement order sent to me as a matter of urgency as my credit card had been debited on March 9th and I had still not received the order. Which as far as I am concerned is unacceptable! Especially after the $22 shipping fees and a 3 week wait! I was asked to wait even longer as the matter was being investigated. I simply could not wait any longer and have now put in a claim with Amazon requesting a full refund. This is taking another 7 days! Whilst Amazon has been very helpful I am VERY disappointed with the Vendor who has really let me down. After a month I have not received the items ordered, am awaiting a refund and have wasted an enormous amount of time and energy on this whole matter. I am off to Walmart to purchase my deodorant and will pay a lot more however it will be far less stressful than this whole debacle!</li>
            <li> Stings less than other Axe products. The price is very good. I just wish that they had a variety pack.</li>
            <li> For some strange reason. The item is not not the same. Less fragrance and more aerosol. Strange. O well. Not good.</li>
            <li> This seller is not responsive and this item is not returnable. I reordered what I had bought before, AXE Anarchy picked themselves and sent me this with different smell. I cannot use it even for my bathroom. That&#x27;s disappointing wasting time and money.</li>
            <li> Great deal!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this without knowing what it smells like but when I tried it I was happy with my purchase and will gladly buy again.</li>
            <li> I really love this fragrence but in the tittle it says 6 pack and in the product features it says  12  pack so  I took a gamble to see which was it and its the 6  pack so if you are looking for this scent because you cant find it (like me) this is great for you just remember its  a  6 pack</li>
            <li> Everything was excellent. Look forward to being a future customer.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite spray, I even use it as a car fragrance, I get compliments on the scent. Don&#x27;t listen to Max, it doesn&#x27;t smell like rotten eggs and dosnt make you itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I have to add is a can is $4.00 at Target but they wanna charge $2 more on here but give you a discount as if you are getting a great deal... SMH</li>
            <li> been wearing AXe for years</li>
            <li> Loved it.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Great products,  fast delivery and a very good price.</li>
            <li> Great deodorant.  Great price for the six pack.  Smells great.  Am going to definitely buy more.  is one of the best axe scents.</li>
            <li> Been using this scent for several years. Girlfriend just falls into my neck at every occasion to smell me!</li>
            <li> Smells great, I&#x27;ve had a lot of compliments. I order most of my toiletries off of amazon (Look into getting prime, it&#x27;s worth it) but buying things you use every day in bulk can save you a lot of money.  Sorry Amazon, but I&#x27;ve probably gouged you with 4x the price I paid to join (84 items in 3 months) lol.  Anyway, I highly recommend finding a scent that works for you them searching to see if you can get a multi pack.</li>
            <li> Great deal for 6 and great scent.</li>
            <li> Always  Happy With Amazon</li>
