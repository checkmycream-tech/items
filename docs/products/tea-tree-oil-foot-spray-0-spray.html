            <li>I love the product because it worked well.</li>
            <li>I sweat more since I was wearing boots</li>
            <li>I am in Afghanistan and made sure I packed 3X 4.0 Ounces bottles.  </li>
            <li>I am really satisfied with this</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I almost bought it from amazon, but then when I realized that shipping was almost $12 I thought better of it.</li>
            <li>but they look so cute in shoes without socks...</li>
            <li>Now my feet are cute and that&#x27;s all...</li>
            <li>I use it every morning for the refreshing feeling that lasts throughout the day, as well as for foot odor protection.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love Tea Tree Oil Foot Spray.</li>
            <li>This is the most refreshing spray I have found.</li>
            <li>Have recommended this for many family members and friends.  </li>
            <li>He is really pleased and so am I.</li>
            <li>and I love it and recommend it to everyone.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my feet, on the bottom and top, and also on my calves.  </li>
            <li>I ended up switching to my dressier crocks (which I still needed nylons with to prevent blisters) and tried the spray one more time thinking that it would be better with the improved airflow...</li>
            <li>/&gt; does contain organic ingredients including tea tree oil &amp; it is somewhat refreshing.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure how it was supposed to help.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for this item in stores and havent been able to find it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true love!</li>
            <li>It is pretty good and works most of the time.</li>
            <li>Pleasant smell and good value compared to the price of similar products.</li>
            <li>after long day of work, very effective!</li>
            <li>This is very useful for many purposes.</li>
            <li>It does work well as a natural deodorizer, but even if that is not a problem, it is still very nice.</li>
            <li>The smell of the product is quite strong and minty.  </li>
            <li>I like the way it smells, but it could be a bit strong.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, fine.  </li>
            <li>Not only has it made my feet feel great, but it is really easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I loved the Tea Tree brand anyway from previous experience so was hoping this experience would be just as good</li>
            <li>It is not unpleasant, just dont use it right before you are going out wearing sandals and your best cologne because this product will definitely compete.</li>
            <li>I spray it between her toes and lightly over the bottms of her feet after her evening shower and before she puts her shoes on in the am.  </li>
            <li>This is a light, cooling spray.</li>
            <li>Having soft, moisturized feet when in bed with your loved one is comforting.</li>
            <li>The second day I sprayed a bit more in my shoes and on my feet, hoping it would work better, but that day instead of tingling they felt more like they were burning.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product to deal with odor resulting from sweaty feet.  </li>
            <li>I spray it on my feet after my shower in the mornings and it keeps them fresh for most of the day on these hot summer days.</li>
            <li>Leaves feet feeling smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li>We love this stuff so much that we keep 3 bottles in a box in the fridge in the summer.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job, but I mainly buy it for its aroma, and the fact it makes a better, lasting room deodorant than any product product I have found; and it&#x27;s invigorating !</li>
            <li>The Tea Tree Oil worked great on toe nail discoloring due to fungal infection.  </li>
            <li>Apparently it makes your feet smell amazing as well.</li>
            <li>I also use it before and after yoga (practice bare foot) and its amazing.     </li>
            <li>This product feels great at first, but I thought it felt very sticky on my bare feet once applied.</li>
            <li>I bought this stuff because it&#x27;s suppose to calm, soothe and disinfect, so to speak.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see anything in the ingredients that would rule it out as a natural underarm deordorant, so also use it that way too and love it.</li>
            <li>and I was able to order it directly.    </li>
            <li>Oh, you can spray the insoles of your shoes and sandals, etc... with it to keep them fresh as well.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>The smell is fresh.</li>
            <li>No dangerous chemicals.  </li>
            <li>My feet stay fresh smelling throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Do not scrub or soak your feet in water first (maybe just quickly rinsed).  </li>
            <li>I find however, that it does sting quite a bit if you put it on right after having a bath or shower, or have just scrubbed your feet/washed between the toes</li>
            <li>When wearing sandals I just spray it right on my feet, you dont even have to take your sandals off.     </li>
            <li>You can put on a few squirts and cover with socks and feel the cool sensation for a good hour.  </li>
            <li>The spray makes your skin tingle and feel cool, and it is very relaxing.</li>
            <li>With this spray, even when I sweat, my feel smell nice all day long.  </li>
            <li>I received this the other day and it&#x27;s the perfect solution for cooling your feet and giving them a boost at the end of a long day.</li>
            <li>I find it especially refreshing in the summer, because it is hot and my feet feel less yucky when I wear open toed shoes or flip-flops.</li>
            <li>it is a bit pungent in a closed bathroom but really does feel good on the feet.</li>
            <li>The foot spray appears to be as good as the one I used previously from Crabtree and Evelyn.  .</li>
            <li>Very light and quick to dry.  </li>
            <li>It actually destroys odor and is refreshing to use.  </li>
            <li>This actually is quite enjoyable.</li>
            <li>and I will be ordering more from this company in the future.</li>
            <li>Hi I use this product a lot, and it works pretty well</li>
            <li>I have been looking for something to make my feet feel better for several years now and have gone through a number of products.  </li>
            <li>When I get home from work, after wearing hot boots and working out in the hot sun all day, I spray them again and put on my sandals.</li>
            <li>When I come home from a long hot day at work, I take my work shoes and socks off and spray the Foot Spray on my feet for instant cool relief that smells so good.</li>
            <li>However it works, we are both much happier!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, I am on my third bottle this year.</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more when this runs out.</li>
            <li>, This is exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>But if you really want to be rid of foot odor temporarily then buy on your toes foot powder, that stuff works!</li>
            <li>Softens hard calloused skin on the feet very quickly and easily and helps keep them clean and supple.</li>
            <li>its pretty easy to get some locally.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t even remember why I purchased this spray at Kohl&#x27;s a few months back, but I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>But after several uses, the fine mist sprayer got clogged up, and nothing would come out.</li>
            <li>When I return after a whole day of work I feel the difference.  </li>
            <li>I used to have really smelly feet.</li>
            <li>All I&#x27;m saying is, I really recommend this product, but I would check in with stores like Kohls before buying it from Amazon, as this may save you lots of money.</li>
            <li>This smells minty, not medicinal and feels very tingly/cooling/minty on your skin when you spray it on.</li>
            <li>no smell, really impress on how fast this stuff works.</li>
            <li>I should give 5 star if the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>The vendor was fast and I got the package before the estimated date.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product if you wear flip flops or sandals made with synthetic materials, which builds up stink and sweat pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>All natural with a clean scent and helps to clear athletes foot.  </li>
            <li>I tried powder, but the powder ends up around the edges of my black shoes and on the top of my feet.</li>
            <li>I did my research, tried stuffing her shoes with crumpled news paper (a quick fix only), bought powders, foot soaks and antimicrobial socks.  </li>
            <li>He was a loyal Desenex user which only helped on and off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m bothered by the high cost of toiletries, and when you throw in the postage, ouch.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to everyone</li>
            <li>After long, hot walks it rejuvenates tired and sore feet, so it&#x27;s great to use as a \\&quot;pick-me-up\\&quot; any time of day.</li>
            <li>No icky fingers to deal with when your done.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve repeated the spray a few more times to maintain it, but it works like a charm.</li>
            <li>It is very convenient to spray on, it literally takes seconds, no mess.</li>
            <li>I found it at walmart for a few bucks and defiently worth it!!</li>
            <li>The spay has a nice minty smell, but it lasted only a few hours.</li>
            <li>It slightly burns your skin which proves that it has useful and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>it is cooling and made my feet feel OK, but it&#x27;s no different from the other peppermint foot lotions and sprays that I have.  </li>
            <li>No messy cream all over your hands!  </li>
            <li>This Foot Spray not only smells better and doesnt leave a cloud of unbreathable powder in the air, his feet sweat less, and so far, no athlete&#x27;s foot.</li>
            <li>I spray it directly in the lower area of my feet and rub it in between my toes</li>
            <li>I still sweat a lot (and that can&#x27;t be reduced), but as far as I&#x27;m concerned my feet don&#x27;t smell and my shoes don&#x27;t smell either.</li>
            <li>Relief for your feet after a busy day, cooling and healing after a day of walking and standing.</li>
            <li>I bought this Tea Tree Oil spray for my boyfriend to use because he has really stinky feet, especially when he&#x27;s been wearing his Chacos.  </li>
            <li>My ten year old has a major foot odor problem that recently developed.  </li>
            <li>When you spray it on your feet, not only does it moisturize your dry/cracked calloused feet and make them soft again</li>
            <li>Ever have bare feet?  </li>
            <li>The inital smell is in my opinion a bit strong, but it does tame down to the point that it is barly noticable.</li>

            <li> I originally bought this product to deal with odor resulting from sweaty feet.  </li>
            <li> I spray it on my feet after my shower in the mornings and it keeps them fresh for most of the day on these hot summer days.</li>
            <li> Leaves feet feeling smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li> We love this stuff so much that we keep 3 bottles in a box in the fridge in the summer.  </li>
            <li> It does a good job, but I mainly buy it for its aroma, and the fact it makes a better, lasting room deodorant than any product product I have found; and it&#x27;s invigorating !</li>
            <li> The Tea Tree Oil worked great on toe nail discoloring due to fungal infection.  </li>
            <li> Apparently it makes your feet smell amazing as well.</li>
            <li> I also use it before and after yoga (practice bare foot) and its amazing.     </li>
            <li> This product feels great at first, but I thought it felt very sticky on my bare feet once applied.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff because it&#x27;s suppose to calm, soothe and disinfect, so to speak.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see anything in the ingredients that would rule it out as a natural underarm deordorant, so also use it that way too and love it.</li>
            <li> and I was able to order it directly.    </li>
            <li> Oh, you can spray the insoles of your shoes and sandals, etc... with it to keep them fresh as well.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> The smell is fresh.</li>
            <li> No dangerous chemicals.  </li>
            <li> My feet stay fresh smelling throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Do not scrub or soak your feet in water first (maybe just quickly rinsed).  </li>
            <li> I find however, that it does sting quite a bit if you put it on right after having a bath or shower, or have just scrubbed your feet/washed between the toes</li>
            <li> When wearing sandals I just spray it right on my feet, you dont even have to take your sandals off.     </li>
            <li> You can put on a few squirts and cover with socks and feel the cool sensation for a good hour.  </li>
            <li> The spray makes your skin tingle and feel cool, and it is very relaxing.</li>
            <li> With this spray, even when I sweat, my feel smell nice all day long.  </li>
            <li> I received this the other day and it&#x27;s the perfect solution for cooling your feet and giving them a boost at the end of a long day.</li>
            <li> I find it especially refreshing in the summer, because it is hot and my feet feel less yucky when I wear open toed shoes or flip-flops.</li>
            <li> it is a bit pungent in a closed bathroom but really does feel good on the feet.</li>
            <li> The foot spray appears to be as good as the one I used previously from Crabtree and Evelyn.  .</li>
            <li> Very light and quick to dry.  </li>
            <li> It actually destroys odor and is refreshing to use.  </li>
            <li> This actually is quite enjoyable.</li>
            <li> and I will be ordering more from this company in the future.</li>
            <li> Hi I use this product a lot, and it works pretty well</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something to make my feet feel better for several years now and have gone through a number of products.  </li>
            <li> When I get home from work, after wearing hot boots and working out in the hot sun all day, I spray them again and put on my sandals.</li>
            <li> When I come home from a long hot day at work, I take my work shoes and socks off and spray the Foot Spray on my feet for instant cool relief that smells so good.</li>
            <li> However it works, we are both much happier!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I am on my third bottle this year.</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more when this runs out.</li>
            <li> , This is exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> But if you really want to be rid of foot odor temporarily then buy on your toes foot powder, that stuff works!</li>
            <li> Softens hard calloused skin on the feet very quickly and easily and helps keep them clean and supple.</li>
            <li> its pretty easy to get some locally.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t even remember why I purchased this spray at Kohl&#x27;s a few months back, but I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> But after several uses, the fine mist sprayer got clogged up, and nothing would come out.</li>
            <li> When I return after a whole day of work I feel the difference.  </li>
            <li> I used to have really smelly feet.</li>
            <li> All I&#x27;m saying is, I really recommend this product, but I would check in with stores like Kohls before buying it from Amazon, as this may save you lots of money.</li>
            <li> This smells minty, not medicinal and feels very tingly/cooling/minty on your skin when you spray it on.</li>
            <li> no smell, really impress on how fast this stuff works.</li>
            <li> I should give 5 star if the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> The vendor was fast and I got the package before the estimated date.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product if you wear flip flops or sandals made with synthetic materials, which builds up stink and sweat pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> All natural with a clean scent and helps to clear athletes foot.  </li>
            <li> I tried powder, but the powder ends up around the edges of my black shoes and on the top of my feet.</li>
            <li> I did my research, tried stuffing her shoes with crumpled news paper (a quick fix only), bought powders, foot soaks and antimicrobial socks.  </li>
            <li> He was a loyal Desenex user which only helped on and off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m bothered by the high cost of toiletries, and when you throw in the postage, ouch.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend to everyone</li>
            <li> After long, hot walks it rejuvenates tired and sore feet, so it&#x27;s great to use as a \\&quot;pick-me-up\\&quot; any time of day.</li>
            <li> No icky fingers to deal with when your done.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve repeated the spray a few more times to maintain it, but it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> It is very convenient to spray on, it literally takes seconds, no mess.</li>
            <li> I found it at walmart for a few bucks and defiently worth it!!</li>
            <li> The spay has a nice minty smell, but it lasted only a few hours.</li>
            <li> It slightly burns your skin which proves that it has useful and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> it is cooling and made my feet feel OK, but it&#x27;s no different from the other peppermint foot lotions and sprays that I have.  </li>
            <li> No messy cream all over your hands!  </li>
            <li> This Foot Spray not only smells better and doesnt leave a cloud of unbreathable powder in the air, his feet sweat less, and so far, no athlete&#x27;s foot.</li>
            <li> I spray it directly in the lower area of my feet and rub it in between my toes</li>
            <li> I still sweat a lot (and that can&#x27;t be reduced), but as far as I&#x27;m concerned my feet don&#x27;t smell and my shoes don&#x27;t smell either.</li>
            <li> Relief for your feet after a busy day, cooling and healing after a day of walking and standing.</li>
            <li> I bought this Tea Tree Oil spray for my boyfriend to use because he has really stinky feet, especially when he&#x27;s been wearing his Chacos.  </li>
            <li> My ten year old has a major foot odor problem that recently developed.  </li>
            <li> When you spray it on your feet, not only does it moisturize your dry/cracked calloused feet and make them soft again</li>
            <li> Ever have bare feet?  </li>
            <li> The inital smell is in my opinion a bit strong, but it does tame down to the point that it is barly noticable.</li>
            <li> 4 oz does not sound like much but product goes along long way</li>
            <li> It still burned, it didn&#x27;t last as long, but I won&#x27;t be using this again.</li>
            <li> long lasting effect.</li>
            <li> In that regard it&#x27;s mildly irritating to get, with this product, a nice little sponge and sample packet of another foot treatment, simply because I&#x27;d rather have had another half ounce of what I ordered.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re always dry and cracky, yet somehow constantly sweating and getting athlete&#x27;s foot.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using this product on feet that are mostly dry from being outdoors and the skin is not highly absorbant or puffy.  </li>
            <li> It feels cooling and tingly on hot tired feet.  </li>
            <li> Tea Tree Oil Foot Spray is a soothing relief for hot tired feet.  </li>
            <li> Instant cooling of hot tired feet also kills the sock smell in 2 seconds or less.</li>
            <li> My biggest gripe has little to do with the individual product:  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once and found that it was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> (then it really stings and feels irritating for</li>
            <li> No real relief.  </li>
            <li> A few minutes later the coolness increases.</li>
            <li> When it gets down to about half, I fill the rest up with water to make it last</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but doesn&#x27;t seem to help much with the odor that is already there, and I noticed after the first day it tingled a little.</li>
            <li> I love this spray and am disappointed that Kohl&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t sell it alone anymore, just in a kit.  </li>
            <li> I am in the US Military and I wear boots all year around 5 days a week in average.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Great company and other products as well.</li>
            <li> Just before I want to buy another bottle from Amazon, I find it in Khol&#x27;s with less than $7 and use other discount to get it even less.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> , this will last me at least 3 months maybe longer.</li>
            <li> Unlike other foot sprays, you do not choke on the fumes, get power all over the place, or destroy your pedicure.  </li>
            <li> Needed a foot deodorizer badly; got this; pleasantly surprised so far.  </li>
            <li> up to half an hour afterwards I find).  </li>
            <li> After some research, I stumbled upon this little foot spray.</li>
            <li> My wife suggested me to use Earth Therapeutics Tea Tree Oil Foot Spray and shipped me a few bottles and ever since problem solved.  </li>
            <li> Now he can wear athletic shoes everyday without itching problem.</li>
            <li> I used everyday and my feet don&#x27;t smell anymore.</li>
            <li> I tried this for a few days, I&#x27;m on my feet all day in the hospital</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey and not easy to locate.</li>
            <li> I gave it a four because delivery was  a little slow.</li>
            <li> I usually spray this on my feet before putting on my socks, spray a bit in my shoes, and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> No more stinky feet.</li>
            <li> NO MORE SMELL.  </li>
            <li> well it&#x27;s a little frustrating.</li>
            <li> I am crazy about this stuff and not only for my feet.  </li>
            <li> It makes my feet softer as I have to keep my feet inside shoes for at least 5/6 hours every day (college, sports etc).   </li>
            <li> I mean you knew when she was entering the room because you could smell her foot odor.  </li>
            <li> When you are hot, or the weatherise, nothing beats a cold chilling spray on your tootsies AND neck!  </li>
            <li> I have been spraying this in his shoes and on his feet and there is no more stink!!</li>
            <li> I bought this strictly to pamper my tired feet.</li>
            <li> If you have tired tootsies grab this.</li>
            <li> Folks when you are spraying your tired feet  with this product after a tough&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it disinfects too so the odor and fungus can&#x27;t grow or get worse.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the spray nozzle doesn&#x27;t work consistently.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Basically, it masked unpleasant smell but does not do anything to treat the cause of the smell.</li>
            <li> My husband has really bad feet.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been wearing nylons with my dress shoes to prevent blisters, but the nylons tend to make my shoes smell bad.</li>
            <li> I wear a lot of sneakers and this helps reduce the nasty smell that can be created when you have the sneakers on for 10 hours a day!</li>
            <li> My husband has the worst smelling feet EVER..</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am crazy about this stuff and not only for my feet.  Didn&#x27;t see anything in the ingredients that would rule it out as a natural underarm deordorant, so also use it that way too and love it.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t even remember why I purchased this spray at Kohl&#x27;s a few months back, but I&#x27;m so glad I did.  It&#x27;s refreshing and since I wear sandals every day, they often get a bit smelly.  With this spray, even when I sweat, my feel smell nice all day long.  My husband commented that his sports socks don&#x27;t even smell after basketball anymore.  I love this spray and am disappointed that Kohl&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t sell it alone anymore, just in a kit.  Glad I found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I received this the other day and it&#x27;s the perfect solution for cooling your feet and giving them a boost at the end of a long day. I dance and so it&#x27;s also a great way to deodorize them after dancing.</li>
            <li> I never would have bought this item except for the favorable reviews.  That being said, I was amazed how well this product works!  It actually destroys odor and is refreshing to use.  Unlike other foot sprays, you do not choke on the fumes, get power all over the place, or destroy your pedicure.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> I love the product because it worked well. But after several uses, the fine mist sprayer got clogged up, and nothing would come out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once and found that it was a waste of money.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong...it is cooling and made my feet feel OK, but it&#x27;s no different from the other peppermint foot lotions and sprays that I have.  Just go on over to The Body Shop or Bath and Body Works and pick up something there.</li>
            <li> I had used this product for close to three years now and I will never stop using it.  I am in the US Military and I wear boots all year around 5 days a week in average.  For years I never had to worry about any foul odor in my feet however, when I deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan I sweat more since I was wearing boots almost 24/7.  My wife suggested me to use Earth Therapeutics Tea Tree Oil Foot Spray and shipped me a few bottles and ever since problem solved.  I spray it directly in the lower area of my feet and rub it in between my toes and that is it.  When I return after a whole day of work I feel the difference.  I am in Afghanistan and made sure I packed 3X 4.0 Ounces bottles.  Sometimes I use it combined with the Foot Repair Balm and it works.</li>
            <li> I used to have really smelly feet. I don&#x27;t whether it was just the way my body is or whether I should blame my parents for passing it on to me, but either way, I had smelly feet. After some research, I stumbled upon this little foot spray. I decided it wouldn&#x27;t kill me to try it out.   After about three weeks, I can honestly say this thing has done miracles. I still sweat a lot (and that can&#x27;t be reduced), but as far as I&#x27;m concerned my feet don&#x27;t smell and my shoes don&#x27;t smell either. I usually spray this on my feet before putting on my socks, spray a bit in my shoes, and that&#x27;s it. This spray has a minty smell to it, so when you spray it on your feet, it tingles. This actually is quite enjoyable. The package came in on time with the product wrapped nicely.   I am really satisfied with this and I will be ordering more from this company in the future.</li>
            <li> Hi I use this product a lot, and it works pretty well and I will continue to use it.  It feels cooling and tingly on hot tired feet.  I find however, that it does sting quite a bit if you put it on right after having a bath or shower, or have just scrubbed your feet/washed between the toes (then it really stings and feels irritating for up to half an hour afterwards I find).  I would recommend using this product on feet that are mostly dry from being outdoors and the skin is not highly absorbant or puffy.  Do not scrub or soak your feet in water first (maybe just quickly rinsed).  I definitely recommend this product if you wear flip flops or sandals made with synthetic materials, which builds up stink and sweat pretty quickly. You can spray the sandals too, with this product.  The smell of the product is quite strong and minty.  It is not unpleasant, just dont use it right before you are going out wearing sandals and your best cologne because this product will definitely compete.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It makes my feet feel and smell wonderful, and it&#x27;s so refreshing. I almost bought it from amazon, but then when I realized that shipping was almost $12 I thought better of it. A couple days later, I was at Kohls, and I found this product there for $9! In not buying from amazon, I saved $8 off the price of the product, plus $12 shipping and handling. All I&#x27;m saying is, I really recommend this product, but I would check in with stores like Kohls before buying it from Amazon, as this may save you lots of money.</li>
            <li> Softens hard calloused skin on the feet very quickly and easily and helps keep them clean and supple.</li>
            <li> The spay has a nice minty smell, but it lasted only a few hours. Basically, it masked unpleasant smell but does not do anything to treat the cause of the smell. I purchased some medicated powder from CVS instead (great results) and use this spray for my shoes in storage.</li>
            <li> If you have a problem with smelly feet, this is the product for you! I wear a lot of sneakers and this helps reduce the nasty smell that can be created when you have the sneakers on for 10 hours a day!</li>
            <li> I tend to get stinky, sweaty feet but they look so cute in shoes without socks... you get the picture. This stuff is AMAZING- I&#x27;ve been using tea tree oil for years and like it for a variety of purposes. This smells minty, not medicinal and feels very tingly/cooling/minty on your skin when you spray it on. Very light and quick to dry.  And..... it works. Now my feet are cute and that&#x27;s all...</li>
            <li> I have recently started using this product. I was not expecting the menthol/mint smell. Apparently it makes your feet smell amazing as well. It slightly burns your skin which proves that it has useful and natural ingredients. It makes my feet softer as I have to keep my feet inside shoes for at least 5/6 hours every day (college, sports etc).   Works great, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something to make my feet feel better for several years now and have gone through a number of products.  But this oil spray has finally done it.  Not only has it made my feet feel great, but it is really easy to apply.  No icky fingers to deal with when your done.  I would recommend  the Tree Tea Oil Spray to everyone.</li>
            <li> My ten year old has a major foot odor problem that recently developed.  I mean you knew when she was entering the room because you could smell her foot odor.  I did my research, tried stuffing her shoes with crumpled news paper (a quick fix only), bought powders, foot soaks and antimicrobial socks.  No real relief.  This foot spray cools her feet and has actually helped the unbearable foor odor!  I spray it between her toes and lightly over the bottms of her feet after her evening shower and before she puts her shoes on in the am.  I also spray the inside of her shoes every day when she takes them off.  This stuff works! The inital smell is in my opinion a bit strong, but it does tame down to the point that it is barly noticable.</li>
            <li> I use to get this product at my local Walmart, but they stopped carrying it. An online search brought me to Amazon.com and I was able to order it directly.    Earth Therapeutics Tea Tree Oil Foot Spray has a wonderful, minty scent. I use it every morning for the refreshing feeling that lasts throughout the day, as well as for foot odor protection. After long, hot walks it rejuvenates tired and sore feet, so it&#x27;s great to use as a \\&quot;pick-me-up\\&quot; any time of day.</li>
            <li> I bought this strictly to pamper my tired feet. It feels so refreshing when you put it on and it smells great. Such a treat...</li>
            <li> I loves how it leaves a LASTING cooling sensation on your feet. This is my second bottle. I love this stuff. Make your feet smell like a candy cane.</li>
            <li> I love it! I just wish the bottle was bigger. When it gets down to about half, I fill the rest up with water to make it last longer.&lt;br /&gt;  I spray it on my feet after my shower in the mornings and it keeps them fresh for most of the day on these hot summer days. When I get home from work, after wearing hot boots and working out in the hot sun all day, I spray them again and put on my sandals. Oh, you can spray the insoles of your shoes and sandals, etc... with it to keep them fresh as well.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;d recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> I loved the Tea Tree brand anyway from previous experience so was hoping this experience would be just as good and it was.  Very Nice!</li>
            <li> Product works! FYI it is a bit pungent in a closed bathroom but really does feel good on the feet. Instant cooling of hot tired feet also kills the sock smell in 2 seconds or less. I sprayed my shoes and 2 days later sill no smell, really impress on how fast this stuff works. 4 oz does not sound like much but product goes along long way, this will last me at least 3 months maybe longer. No complaints from this user...&lt;br /&gt;Great company and other products as well.</li>
            <li> The foot spray appears to be as good as the one I used previously from Crabtree and Evelyn.  .</li>
            <li> I love Tea Tree Oil Foot Spray. When I come home from a long hot day at work, I take my work shoes and socks off and spray the Foot Spray on my feet for instant cool relief that smells so good. A few minutes later the coolness increases. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000HWULKK Tea Tree Oil Foot Spray]] Needed a foot deodorizer badly; got this; pleasantly surprised so far.  My biggest gripe has little to do with the individual product:  I&#x27;m bothered by the high cost of toiletries, and when you throw in the postage, ouch.

Otherwise, fine.  --If, by the way, if there&#x27;s anyone else out there who always wondered whattea tree oil smells like, it&#x27;s a bit like mixing menthol, camphor, and cloves.</li>
            <li> My husband has the worst smelling feet EVER.. his shoes stink up the room. I have been spraying this in his shoes and on his feet and there is no more stink!! This stuff is great..I found it at walmart for a few bucks and defiently worth it!!</li>
            <li> Ive been using this spray for about 2 years. I keep it in my car actually and I will spray my feet after working all day (take off my socks and spray my feet) its a great way to calm the stress in your feet and refresh them on the way home. I also use it before and after yoga (practice bare foot) and its amazing.     My mom saw it in my car and sprayed it and was amazed at how great it makes your feet smell and feel. When wearing sandals I just spray it right on my feet, you dont even have to take your sandals off.     Plus, its anti-germ properties (the tea tree oil) reduce germs on your feet that cause odor and things like fungus.     You have to try it!    Ive seen it at my local grocery store, target, walmart and even ulta! its pretty easy to get some locally.</li>
            <li> Relief for your feet after a busy day, cooling and healing after a day of walking and standing.</li>
            <li> I have never used a foot spray, but I will say that this one feels great.  You can put on a few squirts and cover with socks and feel the cool sensation for a good hour.  Used it before my cycling session yesterday and my feet loved me.  I am sold.</li>
            <li> I should give 5 star if the price is reasonable. Just before I want to buy another bottle from Amazon, I find it in Khol&#x27;s with less than $7 and use other discount to get it even less.&lt;br /&gt;My husband suffered by the bacteria on his foot, some skin was wounded. The wounded skin was recovered within 2 spay! The smell is fresh. Now he can wear athletic shoes everyday without itching problem.</li>
            <li> This is the most refreshing spray I have found. If you have tired tootsies grab this. The vendor was fast and I got the package before the estimated date.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Have recommended this for many family members and friends.  I have found that it works great as an anti-itch spray.</li>
            <li> I bought this Tea Tree Oil spray for my boyfriend to use because he has really stinky feet, especially when he&#x27;s been wearing his Chacos.  He sprays it on his feet and his Chacos now.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to just cover up the smell, it seems to actually get rid of the smell.  However it works, we are both much happier!</li>
            <li> This product feels great at first, but I thought it felt very sticky on my bare feet once applied.</li>
            <li> My husband has really bad feet. They&#x27;re always dry and cracky, yet somehow constantly sweating and getting athlete&#x27;s foot. His work requires him to wear boots for 14 hrs a day which only aggravates it all. I bought this stuff because it&#x27;s suppose to calm, soothe and disinfect, so to speak. He was a loyal Desenex user which only helped on and off. Since trying Tea Tree Oil, he hasn&#x27;t gone back. This Foot Spray not only smells better and doesnt leave a cloud of unbreathable powder in the air, his feet sweat less, and so far, no athlete&#x27;s foot. He is really pleased and so am I. I gave it a four because delivery was  a little slow.</li>
            <li> I used everyday and my feet don&#x27;t smell anymore. I am going to keep using it. Love this kind of products</li>
            <li> I have been using this foot spray for a year now and I love it and recommend it to everyone.  This is a light, cooling spray. I use it on my feet, on the bottom and top, and also on my calves.  The spray makes your skin tingle and feel cool, and it is very relaxing. The smell is quite nice, without being overbearing. It does not smell medicinal, but has hints of both the tea tree oil and peppermint. It does work well as a natural deodorizer, but even if that is not a problem, it is still very nice. I find it especially refreshing in the summer, because it is hot and my feet feel less yucky when I wear open toed shoes or flip-flops. It is very convenient to spray on, it literally takes seconds, no mess. I use it after my morning shower, and after my evening shower before I get into bed.</li>
            <li> I tried this for a few days, I&#x27;m on my feet all day in the hospital and I&#x27;ve been wearing nylons with my dress shoes to prevent blisters, but the nylons tend to make my shoes smell bad. It&#x27;s gotten to the point that I can smell them even with the shoes on. I tried powder, but the powder ends up around the edges of my black shoes and on the top of my feet. So I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but doesn&#x27;t seem to help much with the odor that is already there, and I noticed after the first day it tingled a little. The second day I sprayed a bit more in my shoes and on my feet, hoping it would work better, but that day instead of tingling they felt more like they were burning. I ended up switching to my dressier crocks (which I still needed nylons with to prevent blisters) and tried the spray one more time thinking that it would be better with the improved airflow... It still burned, it didn&#x27;t last as long, but I won&#x27;t be using this again. Waist of money.</li>
            <li> The goot spray has very good smell, and relieves the pressure on my feet esp. after long day of work, very effective! I&#x27;d recommend this tee tree oil foot spray to my friends!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the spray nozzle doesn&#x27;t work consistently.&lt;br /&gt; Folks when you are spraying your tired feet  with this product after a tough&lt;br /&gt;  day  at work &amp; the product doesn&#x27;t spray well it&#x27;s a little frustrating. The product&lt;br /&gt; does contain organic ingredients including tea tree oil &amp; it is somewhat refreshing.</li>
            <li> Works great!  All natural with a clean scent and helps to clear athletes foot.  No messy cream all over your hands!  No dangerous chemicals.  No more stinky feet.</li>
            <li> I love this spray and have been unable to find it in stores any longer.&lt;br /&gt;The price is good and I will buy more when I run out.&lt;br /&gt;Makes your feet feel great.</li>
            <li> I like the way it smells, but it could be a bit strong. The minty mist is nice in the morning or in the afternoon. Keep spraying daily.</li>
            <li> This is a Great natural product that smells  great and we flind it to be very effective ! Would highly recommend to everyone</li>
            <li> Leaves feet feeling smooth and fresh. Eliminated my foot odor and can where shoes without socks and not have them smell!</li>
            <li> Tea Tree Oil Foot Spray is a soothing relief for hot tired feet.  This is my second bottle.  I use it at bedtime.  It is a little pricey and not easy to locate.</li>
            <li> It is pretty good and works most of the time. It serves its purpose.  .... ....... ..... . . . .</li>
            <li> I was gonna toss my Sperrys out.  They stank. Immediately.  Every time.  No matter how briefly I wore them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One application of tea tree oil into the shoes, though, and they smelled nicer immediately.  After wearing them again... NO MORE SMELL.  I&#x27;ve repeated the spray a few more times to maintain it, but it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I am on my third bottle this year. Each bottle has lasted me a quarter, using it in the morning every day (sometimes twice a day). When you spray it on your feet, not only does it moisturize your dry/cracked calloused feet and make them soft again but it disinfects too so the odor and fungus can&#x27;t grow or get worse. Having soft, moisturized feet when in bed with your loved one is comforting.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product to deal with odor resulting from sweaty feet.  It does a good job, but I mainly buy it for its aroma, and the fact it makes a better, lasting room deodorant than any product product I have found; and it&#x27;s invigorating !</li>
            <li> The Tea Tree Oil worked great on toe nail discoloring due to fungal infection.  The oil relieved the itching and eliminated the problem.  Pleasant smell and good value compared to the price of similar products.</li>
            <li> This is very useful for many purposes. Instead of putting the oil on from a bottle, you can just spray it wherever you like and it&#x27;s good for cuts, infections, and all sorts of things!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t an antiperspirant so I wasn&#x27;t sure how it was supposed to help. But, amazingly, it does! I spray it in each shoe and on the bottom of each foot each morning. My feet stay fresh smelling throughout the day. Will definitely buy more when this runs out.</li>
            <li> Ever have bare feet?  You want this stuff!  Tea Tree oil is a miracle substance and it is now available in a great smelling spray for your feet.  Use if you have gone swimming (even at the beach) and every time you take a shower.  We love this stuff so much that we keep 3 bottles in a box in the fridge in the summer.  When you are hot, or the weatherise, nothing beats a cold chilling spray on your tootsies AND neck!  By the way ladies, I could never have gotten thru menopause without it!  It&#x27;s true love!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this item in stores and havent been able to find it, This is exactly what I wanted and I couldnt be happier with this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this faithfully for years ...  I loved the companion foot wash, but they don&#x27;t make it anymore ...&lt;br /&gt;I have hyperhidrosis (sweaty feet) and this keeps my feet feeling cooler, and never smell ... even with manmade shoes.</li>
            <li> We have purchased this foot spray many times and find it the perfect solution for hot and burning Diabetic feet.  It is handy to spray on during the night, or anytime .</li>
            <li> this product is awesome. But if you really want to be rid of foot odor temporarily then buy on your toes foot powder, that stuff works! but this is a great refresher and a lot of people have asked me where to get this.</li>
            <li> this is wonderful spray for stinky feet. the spray works perfectly and immediately! long lasting effect. I will purchase it again!</li>
