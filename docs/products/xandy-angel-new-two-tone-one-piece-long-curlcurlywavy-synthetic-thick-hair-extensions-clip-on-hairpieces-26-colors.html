            <li>im very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>These are the kind of extensions that you should put in longer hair for a pop of color underneath.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried applying any kind of heat or product to it yet.</li>
            <li>arrival the quality was really nice, but the colors are a bit off in comparison to the pictures posted.</li>
            <li>but we decided to keep both because they are so nice for the price.</li>
            <li>The color is nice but two of the clips came unsewn just by opening the clip.  </li>
            <li>I ordered it when my own hair was longer, so now with shorter hair it doesn&#x27;t blend as well.</li>
            <li>They look amazing and they were so cheap!</li>
            <li>and it blends ok.</li>
            <li>the clips are sturdy &amp; secure too!</li>
            <li>but i love it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to wear it:)</li>
            <li>I ordered 3 more packages.</li>
            <li>but i was able to blend it in with some 15 in/80g hair extensions i</li>
            <li>love  to use them  for ny hair</li>
            <li>all, however, I recomend it &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Love these extensions.</li>
            <li>works best on long hair</li>
            <li>Hair falls out easily.</li>
            <li>They do no tangle to easily and are easy  to brush out.</li>
            <li>but I found mine smelled just fine.</li>
            <li>well this looks like plastic hair that you find on one of those cheap knock-off Barbie dolls at the dollar store.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much</li>
            <li>The hair piece is a great quality (similar to a high-quality cosplay wig) with no shine.</li>
            <li>I did use it for a play I was doing and after a bit of styling it looked fabulous.</li>
            <li>Overall, great purchase, and would buy again.</li>
            <li>Very nice .. kind of on the heavy side</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone looking for affordable hair extensions in fun ombre colors!</li>
            <li>so with some styling i was able to get it to look more natural.</li>
            <li>im super excited to use it for st pattys day</li>
            <li>I knew it wouldn&#x27;t look good (shes blonde)</li>
            <li>the hairs a cool color</li>
            <li>Product is only good wearing hair in updo.</li>
            <li>It actually looks pretty good, it&#x27;s easy to clip on your hair.</li>
            <li>Very nice very happy great product would definitely order again thank you will work better with thick hair rather than thin hair</li>
            <li>I wear lots of different kinds of hair from human to synthetic and this is one of the best colored synthetic extensions I have come across!!!!</li>
            <li>It is super inexpensive and beats frying your hair with bleach.</li>
            <li>First off it arrived amazingly quick!</li>
            <li>Im definitely going to buy a whole lot more!!</li>
            <li>and I think that they are very pretty</li>
            <li>its worth it and only for $6 you can&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
            <li>they are so full and pretty</li>
            <li>This product was just what I needed to add some fun to my hairstyle.</li>
            <li>It took a while to receive in the mail, but I had so much fun with these</li>
            <li>The colors blend beautifully into each other and it&#x27;s very soft, all i could do was run my fingers through it!</li>
            <li>Shipping was super quick coming from China, it reached New England in about a week.</li>
            <li>The seller was also quick to respond to an order error and fixed the issue just as quickly.</li>
            <li>they commented how pretty it was.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so pretty.</li>
            <li>Ill definitely be buying more, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t worth much</li>
            <li>It arrived before it was expected which I really liked...</li>
            <li>Looked exactly like it&#x27;s pictured.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and pictured.</li>
            <li>I let my daughter wear one for Halloween and it was a big hit, most people questioned if they were real.</li>
            <li>because I expected it to be long .other than that its really great</li>
            <li>One of the clips did start falling of but it was an easy fix I just sewed it back on.</li>
            <li>Quality was amazing only problem I had was the track was soooooo short .I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>very disapointed</li>
            <li>The clips are very sturdy.</li>
            <li>but I have yet to wear it, and I intend to buy a perfectly straight one.</li>
            <li>(Straight) 22-24 inches long&lt;br /&gt;*Came</li>
            <li>My daughter is in love with this product, arrived sooner than expected...</li>
            <li>Because they aren&#x27;t real hair, you can&#x27;t curl or straighten them (as they come already straightened) and you can&#x27;t really brush them either.  </li>
            <li>Pictures DO NOT accurately depict real product as pictures show real hair magically turning into the color extentions.</li>
            <li>I will probably try with a new color and may be straight rather than curly</li>
            <li>but the colors were not like the pictures and the material is very &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; it looks ok for halloween but not for everyday use...</li>
            <li>the color is more of a teal when I specifically ordered green</li>
            <li>I would recommend getting a few pairs if you plan on using them more than once.  </li>
            <li>The clips were a little tricky at first, but once I figured out the trick they were golden!</li>
            <li>I am a photography assisted and had a wedding on a very hot day, and the hair never felt too heavy or too hot.</li>
            <li>i originally bought the brown to milk tea and the dark green to light green.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it is a little tricky to get it to clip on comfortably, which means you may need to have someone help</li>
            <li>but with baby powder i was able to dull it done</li>
            <li>Maybe if your hair is too straight you will have to put an extra clip.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I bought them in 4 different colors, and now some in the straight style.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of extensions and these are among my least favorite.</li>
            <li>i ordered for Saint Patty&#x27;s Day party and didn&#x27;t wear becasue was not green....... .....</li>
            <li>I curled my real hair and pinned the sides back -</li>
            <li>Great colors and really thick without being too heavy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always dyed my own hair but sooo tired of the fading &amp; it bleeding on2 towels &amp; bedding...</li>
            <li>It is think and full but weighs down on your head even with 5 clips.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the color (dark green to light green) and was amazed at how full and long it was for the price i paid.</li>
            <li>nice, but a little heavy</li>
            <li>They are soft and pretty, but you will need at least two of them to really fill out your hair.</li>
            <li>bought the dark blue that fades into light blue for my sister because she was begging me for it.</li>
            <li>It was better than I expected!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I bought the dark green to light green that looks more turquoise and blue in the picture, and the color of the actual piece matched the picture, which is what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>It is blue not green.</li>
            <li>Beautiful color, goes round the whole head, which is bad</li>
            <li>really don&#x27;t need much to blend in since its so thick).</li>

            <li> really don&#x27;t need much to blend in since its so thick).</li>
            <li> I got dark green 2 light green 2pcs because i have short hair</li>
            <li> (Dark green to light green)</li>
            <li> Came way earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Wish it was somewhat shorter since its VERY long.</li>
            <li> of course blue hair will look fake right?</li>
            <li> I had forgotten about the order it took so long (even other items I have bought from overseas</li>
            <li> I have brushed them out a lot, straitened them (on the lowest setting on my flat iron), washed them and very little hair has been lost.</li>
            <li> I also got a pink and purple one</li>
            <li> so I have bought the blue and green extensions</li>
            <li> The hair extension its very wide and is almost to wide for me head which is a pain.</li>
            <li> main issue is that they&#x27;re a bit thin.</li>
            <li> I dusted it with a little baby powder just to take off the little extra shine it had.</li>
            <li> I understand its not real hair but it looks so tacky!</li>
            <li> Really pretty and doesn&#x27;t look fake.</li>
            <li> seems to be about average quality (tangles)</li>
            <li> If you order this, prepare to receive it in a month/month and a half.  </li>

            <li> I ordered the two tone green from Betepek and it arrived before the date.</li>

            <li> skiny. but with baby powder i was able to dull it done and it blends ok.</li>
            <li> got the wrong colors n bairly any hair n not as long as said. very disapointed but i shud expect this with fake hair and cheap price never buying fake hair again</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted this to play with and put in her hair- seems to be about average quality (tangles) but she loves the color. Wish it was somewhat shorter since its VERY long.</li>
            <li> you cant brush it or you will rip out some of the hair</li>
            <li> I loveeeeeee these!! I got dark green 2 light green 2pcs because i have short hair they are so full and pretty the clips are sturdy &amp; secure too! Im definitely going to buy a whole lot more!!</li>
            <li> These are the kind of extensions that you should put in longer hair for a pop of color underneath. They are soft and pretty, but you will need at least two of them to really fill out your hair. Happily they are inexpensive. The seller was also quick to respond to an order error and fixed the issue just as quickly.</li>
            <li> bought the dark blue that fades into light blue for my sister because she was begging me for it. received it about a week ago &amp; shes never worn it. it looks fake. of course blue hair will look fake right? well this looks like plastic hair that you find on one of those cheap knock-off Barbie dolls at the dollar store. I knew it wouldn&#x27;t look good (shes blonde) but she kept begging so I bought it.</li>
            <li> i was a bit doubtful about this product but i love it. its a very beautiful hair extension. works best on long hair but you can make it work with short hair. youd have to have 2 or three pieces for short hair. everyone loved it. they commented how pretty it was. im very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Very nice very happy great product would definitely order again thank you will work better with thick hair rather than thin hair</li>
            <li> Looove this...I&#x27;ve always dyed my own hair but sooo tired of the fading &amp; it bleeding on2 towels &amp; bedding...just what I wanted! &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li> It actually looks pretty good, it&#x27;s easy to clip on your hair. Maybe if your hair is too straight you will have to put an extra clip.&lt;br /&gt;It looks awesome in a pony tail.&lt;br /&gt;It came faster than I thought and well packed.</li>
            <li> I received the hair today and I love it!!!!! The curl was great the color was awesome!!!!! It was better than I expected!!!!!! I can&#x27;t wait to wear it:) the hair wasn&#x27;t shiny it was perfect! I wear lots of different kinds of hair from human to synthetic and this is one of the best colored synthetic extensions I have come across!!!! I liked it so much I ordered 3 more packages. I ordered the two tone green from Betepek and it arrived before the date. The other 3 packages I ordered from Nicoleshop on the March 9th and still haven&#x27;t received them or any information on it&#x27;s delivery process:( fingers crossed!!!! I hope it comes soon but in all the product is super cute!!!!</li>
            <li> This is /amazing/. I got the blue/cyan and it&#x27;s so pretty. The clips are very sturdy. A lot of people complained about a smell but I found mine smelled just fine. The hair is soft and shiny. It didn&#x27;t budge at all when clipped in. I was nervous the piece would slip out or slid but it didn&#x27;t. I am a photography assisted and had a wedding on a very hot day, and the hair never felt too heavy or too hot. I also got a pink and purple one but I have yet to wear it, and I intend to buy a perfectly straight one. These are addictive.</li>
            <li> For synthetic, this hair is great. I bought the dark green to light green that looks more turquoise and blue in the picture, and the color of the actual piece matched the picture, which is what I was hoping for. I haven&#x27;t tried applying any kind of heat or product to it yet. Shipping was super quick coming from China, it reached New England in about a week. Ill definitely be buying more, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Well made for the price! Also, beautiful coloring!!!!</li>
            <li> for the price, it&#x27;s great. i originally bought the brown to milk tea and the dark green to light green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;upon arrival the quality was really nice, but the colors are a bit off in comparison to the pictures posted. not a big deal though still looks good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my main issue is that they&#x27;re a bit thin. i have a lot of hair so i put the one in halfway up in my hair. it looked kinda silly because my natural hair kinda stopped, and the extension continued. so with some styling i was able to get it to look more natural. but if you have thick hair i recommend buying two</li>
            <li> Has a lot of hair in it surprisingly. Beautiful color, goes round the whole head, which is bad cause I have an undercut. Lol.</li>
            <li> We got the wrong color so ordered another but we decided to keep both because they are so nice for the price. ery very good product.</li>
            <li> Very nice .. kind of on the heavy side</li>
            <li> This product was just what I needed to add some fun to my hairstyle. It is super inexpensive and beats frying your hair with bleach. It took a while to receive in the mail, but I had so much fun with these I bought them in 4 different colors, and now some in the straight style. I let my daughter wear one for Halloween and it was a big hit, most people questioned if they were real. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for affordable hair extensions in fun ombre colors!</li>
            <li> First off it arrived amazingly quick! I absolutely love the color (dark green to light green) and was amazed at how full and long it was for the price i paid. The colors blend beautifully into each other and it&#x27;s very soft, all i could do was run my fingers through it! I dusted it with a little baby powder just to take off the little extra shine it had. I have very short chin length hair but i was able to blend it in with some 15 in/80g hair extensions i have(you really don&#x27;t need much to blend in since its so thick). I am definitely buying the rest of the colors as soon as possible.</li>
            <li> Looks nothing like the picture. I understand its not real hair but it looks so tacky! Wasn&#x27;t worth much but I&#x27;m never buying from here again! I put it once and the clip broke already! Do NOT buy!</li>
            <li> Amazing quality for the price!</li>
            <li> They look amazing and they were so cheap!</li>
            <li> Pros: (Dark green to light green) btw these extensions are (Straight) 22-24 inches long&lt;br /&gt;*Came within a week of ordering&lt;br /&gt;*Very thick&lt;br /&gt;*Can straighten or be curled with low heat&lt;br /&gt;*Not to shiny&lt;br /&gt;*Compliments (:&lt;br /&gt;*Comfortable&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;*Kinda heavy (to heavy for thin hair)&lt;br /&gt;*A lot of hair falls out when brushed&lt;br /&gt;*Doesn&#x27;t reach all the way around head&lt;br /&gt;*frizzy&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review helped some people choose if they want these extensions, they are beautiful i will recommend them to everyone!</li>
            <li> love  to use them  for ny hair</li>
            <li> The hair piece is a great quality (similar to a high-quality cosplay wig) with no shine. It does weight a bit and it is a little tricky to get it to clip on comfortably, which means you may need to have someone help you.&lt;br /&gt;Over all, however, I recomend it &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Quality was amazing only problem I had was the track was soooooo short .I&#x27;m sad  because I expected it to be long .other than that its really great</li>
            <li> It jst took 7days to get my package.. and im loving my clip ons!</li>
            <li> It arrived before it was expected which I really liked...but the colors were not like the pictures and the material is very &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; it looks ok for halloween but not for everyday use... I will probably try with a new color and may be straight rather than curly</li>
            <li> Looked exactly like it&#x27;s pictured. Plus took no time to get here!</li>
            <li> If you order this, prepare to receive it in a month/month and a half.  I had forgotten about the order it took so long (even other items I have bought from overseas have had shorter deliveries with standard shipping).  The color is nice but two of the clips came unsewn just by opening the clip.  It is think and full but weighs down on your head even with 5 clips.  I have a lot of extensions and these are among my least favorite.</li>
            <li> the hairs a cool color im super excited to use it for st pattys day but..... the color is more of a teal when I specifically ordered green so look at each color before bought</li>
            <li> Really pretty and doesn&#x27;t look fake. VERY good quality&lt;br /&gt;But I got a different color than what I ordered...</li>
            <li> It is blue not green. i ordered for Saint Patty&#x27;s Day party and didn&#x27;t wear becasue was not green....... .....</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and pictured.</li>
            <li> My daughter is in love with this product, arrived sooner than expected...beautiful hair &amp; curls... easy to manage! its worth it and only for $6 you can&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
            <li> I loved this hair!! I ordered it when my own hair was longer, so now with shorter hair it doesn&#x27;t blend as well. I did use it for a play I was doing and after a bit of styling it looked fabulous. It was perfect mermaid hair!! The clips were a little tricky at first, but once I figured out the trick they were golden! And what a great bargain!!</li>
            <li> nice, but a little heavy</li>
            <li> Came way earlier than expected. Great colors and really thick without being too heavy. Love these extensions.</li>
            <li> Hair falls out easily. Pictures DO NOT accurately depict real product as pictures show real hair magically turning into the color extentions. Product is only good wearing hair in updo.</li>
            <li> I curled my real hair and pinned the sides back - it made keeping the clip in extensions in place alot easier, as well as gave the illusion that I had multiple layers.  I wore this to a Halloween concert as a mermaid and they were perfect!  Although, after a night of dancing, they didn&#x27;t look very nice.  I would recommend getting a few pairs if you plan on using them more than once.  Because they aren&#x27;t real hair, you can&#x27;t curl or straighten them (as they come already straightened) and you can&#x27;t really brush them either.  Overall, great purchase, and would buy again.</li>
            <li> so I have bought the blue and green extensions and I think that they are very pretty and they are thick. I have brushed them out a lot, straitened them (on the lowest setting on my flat iron), washed them and very little hair has been lost. I did try dyeing them but that didn&#x27;t work at all. One of the clips did start falling of but it was an easy fix I just sewed it back on. The hair extension its very wide and is almost to wide for me head which is a pain. They do no tangle to easily and are easy  to brush out.</li>
