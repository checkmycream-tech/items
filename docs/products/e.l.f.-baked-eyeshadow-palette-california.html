            <li>I want to buy more for when this one runs out!</li>
            <li>Love this palette though!</li>
            <li>I love them as all colors are rich pigmented and fits perfectly all the day.</li>
            <li>I love this shadow!</li>
            <li>I love this eyeshadow!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Pretty good but wears off quickly, good product for price paid though!</li>
            <li>The packaging was very good and the mirror is quite useful.</li>
            <li>You have to build it up a lot to be able to get a bright color.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice collection of colors.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t show up nicely at all</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice edition.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s always nice to give another makeup company a chance</li>
            <li>Nice smoky colors.</li>
            <li>Nice sparkle.</li>
            <li>Nice eyeshadows...</li>
            <li>I was so happy and excited to get these eyeshadows</li>
            <li>Used once so far and seemed to do well and look great on!</li>
            <li>If this hadn&#x27;t happened I maybe would have liked it more.</li>
            <li>pretty good product, not as good as i thought it would be</li>
            <li>Over-all very happy, definitely a perchance I am satisfied with every time I do my make up!</li>
            <li>, i love ELF products the last eye shadow i bought from Elf was amazing this one is good but not as good, the colors dont show as bright as i thought it would.</li>
            <li>I wanted something that would make a good smokey eye, but didn&#x27;t turn out too bold.</li>
            <li>They are well packaged and the large mirror is great.</li>
            <li>So worth the money really good quality.</li>
            <li>I love this palette.</li>
            <li>that might make them more pigmented.</li>
            <li>, I LOVE MAKE UP</li>
            <li>The lighter colors are more for a glittery effect.</li>
            <li>Also the pigments are not as they seem and you have to work your way rubbing more and more.</li>
            <li>I love doing my makeup, always have.</li>
            <li>If the eyes are the windows to our soul, then u better believe mine are gonna look outstanding, to match what&#x27;s on the inside.</li>
            <li>This eyeshadow palette is okay, but nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will for sure being buying more colors.</li>
            <li>and hey I love it</li>
            <li>I purchased this palette and the one of the coastal scents palette and this one is much more pigmented and has more quantity of the product for your money.</li>
            <li>I love the range of this pallet.</li>
            <li>I love the colors and would recommend this product to any one</li>
            <li>and i love them</li>
            <li>(no damages on two separate purchases of this palette), and most of the colors are sparkly and shimmery.</li>
            <li>I love eyes</li>
            <li>Love the quality and colors.</li>
            <li>They might not be as good of a quality that you would get from Amazon, but it is worth checking them out</li>
            <li>Received this today and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.......saw e.l.f.</li>
            <li>my daughter is so happy i finally ordered her her own palette, now she don&#x27;t have to always use mine and</li>
            <li>I needed to spend 10 more dollars to get free shipping</li>
            <li>But if that was not broken it would be a good product.</li>
            <li>Beautiful rich and soft colours.</li>
            <li>Beautiful and really amazing colors, great pigmentation, long last.</li>
            <li>The white is good to use as primer too if you do not have eye primer!</li>
            <li>Really nice eyeshadow palette, I really like the colors :)</li>
            <li>Easy to blend.</li>
            <li>Comes off easily throughout the day</li>
            <li>These are beautiful and will probably last for 10 years!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Bottom row of eyes shadows too dark for me, but otherwise great, amazing eye shadow.</li>
            <li>I get compliments but mostly feel pretty so that what matters!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying another one, I love it so much!!</li>
            <li>but this is simple and great.</li>
            <li>They appear cheap.</li>
            <li>It feels &#x27;cheap&#x27; which I guess if you buy it for this price you pay for what you get.</li>
            <li>the 2 colors available, Was suposed to receve this palette</li>
            <li>The colors are great and they actually last all day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too light and also too shimmery</li>
            <li>I love the large mirror!</li>
            <li>Great colors, but not enough pigment to be true</li>
            <li>I LOVE these bold, fun colors.</li>
            <li>and pretty i love them</li>
            <li>This is a awsome palette I have so many different kind of makeup like Mac coastal scent ect</li>
            <li>They are glittery but not bad</li>
            <li>I always use eye primer, so it stays in place well and is as bold looking as I want.</li>
            <li>Have to apply a lot to get the bold color.</li>
            <li>they perform as well as well as the higher end products without the huge price.</li>
            <li>The colors are glittery and very pretty on the eyes.</li>
            <li>I got this palette because of all the great dark colors.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good but didn&#x27;t stay to long.</li>
            <li>I love my new eye shadow palette.</li>
            <li>I love these new baked eye shadows.</li>
            <li>the colors are very pigmented and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This set was easier to apply, and the colors really stick!!</li>
            <li>Amazing lasting colors.</li>
            <li>Nice color selection for my eye color blue</li>
            <li>colors are nice, but they are very sheer.  </li>
            <li>Some of the colors I probably won&#x27;t use, but overall they are nice.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nice and last all day.</li>
            <li>This is a nice addition to that color family, kind of like an expansion pack :) They come off a little lighter than the Urban Decay, but if you dampen your brush first</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t use the right brush (which e.l.f.</li>
            <li>I use them wet mostly, but they are also great dry.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really try and clean it  </li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant and fantastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for those who want the shiney smokey look but not go overboard.</li>
            <li>I have to admit that it does give a very nice look, but just a little too much effort for me.</li>
            <li>My brushes couldn&#x27;t pick up these eyeshadows and when finally I was able to apply on my eyes</li>
            <li>When I first received these I thought they would be too glittery</li>
            <li>It has pretty colors for day and night.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty, packaged well</li>
            <li>but it is mostly just shimmer and no actual color.</li>
            <li>They remind me of the higher end brand&#x27;s baked eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just same as my Chanel eyeshadow if it&#x27;s better .</li>
            <li>The pigmentation is not as strong as you would imagine due to the strong colors.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a nice variety of colors, they go on smoothly and last long.  </li>
            <li>Love these eyeshadows i have had alot of fun creating new looks with different combinations of the eyeshadows</li>
            <li>The colors are quite sparkly, (I love it) which can be a negative if you&#x27;re not into glitter, but they don&#x27;t spread out all over ur face like most glittery shadows do.</li>
            <li>These are just as good as the more expensive ones out there.</li>
            <li>colors aren&#x27;t as pigmented as wished not as comparable to ud as advertised , not very unhappy, but wont order again.</li>
            <li>I love this eye showdown, it stays all day long and no need to retouch.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t try to use them dry because you will not be satisfied.</li>
            <li>I feel like every eyeshadow should be shimmery, and this certainly fits the bill.</li>
            <li>The colors are very nice and very pigmented can use wet or dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing, stays on and definitely not cheap.</li>
            <li>Really like this.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear makeup much</li>
            <li>The only way to use these shadows and actually enjoy them is to 1)</li>
            <li>I do really like the mirror in the case though.  </li>
            <li>Too much fall out.</li>
            <li>I love the palette colors but perhaps due to my skin tone the pigments dont appear in their full color potential.</li>
            <li>Good colors, wet or dry.</li>
            <li>dry works just fine for me.</li>
            <li>Price was decent but the shadow itself.  </li>
            <li>I only use it every once in a while mostly the lighter colors for an inner corner highlight.</li>
            <li>I frickin LIVE this eye shadow.</li>
            <li>AND IT HAS ALREADY BECOME MY NEW BFF</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll splurge and get new makeup.  </li>
            <li>I was actually hoping it to be more pigmented but other than that I like the colors.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smaller then I thought pretty colors but not pigmented you can even see the colors on even with primer or mac fix</li>
            <li>Start with a light hand and then deepen to prevent shadow smudges and/or too dark an application.</li>
            <li>They are easy to apply with just a little practice to get the depth of color you desire.</li>
            <li>I love usig the colors wet as bases for more dramatic &amp;#34;night&amp;#34; looks.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a little more from this product but yet again it was only $10.</li>
            <li>From what I can tell, it&#x27;s a near dupe of Sephora&#x27;s moonshine(?) palette.</li>
            <li>i completely  regret purchasing  two of them....</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>I recently got into this whole &amp;#34;baked&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>As an almost 40 year old, I can wear these to work or out and about.</li>
            <li>If you use them wet then yes the cost is worth if it, if you&#x27;re not then you are going to regret this buy.</li>
            <li>These colors are deeply pigmented and I love the wet or dry choice.</li>
            <li>I used mainly the brown and white.</li>
            <li>some of their products are now available at my local Wal-mart store, and they seem to be slightly less in price than they are on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Its just a shimmery, glittery mess that doesn&#x27;t really produce much color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it is designed this way, but the shadows above and below each other compliment perfectly in this palate, so I usually match them that way when I&#x27;m doing a two tone look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking ill buy the California palette since I love this one so much.</li>
            <li>A bit difficult to apply (wet application helps), but relative to the price of a similar color palette, just as good as the higher end.</li>
            <li>This color palette is intense and last all day long.  </li>
            <li>Barely any pigment</li>
            <li>The dark colors show really well.</li>
            <li>Only problem is that the palette itself seems to flake so it&#x27;s pretty messy.</li>
            <li>Slightly disappointed by this, I would rather spend a little more and buy a better pigmented color palette</li>
            <li>It has so much fallout that you can&#x27;t even wear without making a mess in the palette.</li>
            <li>I was looking for eyeshadow that is a little shimmery, but not too much.</li>

            <li> You have to build it up a lot to be able to get a bright color.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice collection of colors.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t show up nicely at all</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice edition.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s always nice to give another makeup company a chance</li>
            <li> Nice smoky colors.</li>
            <li> Nice sparkle.</li>
            <li> Nice eyeshadows...</li>
            <li> I was so happy and excited to get these eyeshadows</li>
            <li> Used once so far and seemed to do well and look great on!</li>
            <li> If this hadn&#x27;t happened I maybe would have liked it more.</li>
            <li> pretty good product, not as good as i thought it would be</li>
            <li> Over-all very happy, definitely a perchance I am satisfied with every time I do my make up!</li>
            <li> , i love ELF products the last eye shadow i bought from Elf was amazing this one is good but not as good, the colors dont show as bright as i thought it would.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that would make a good smokey eye, but didn&#x27;t turn out too bold.</li>
            <li> They are well packaged and the large mirror is great.</li>
            <li> So worth the money really good quality.</li>
            <li> I love this palette.</li>
            <li> that might make them more pigmented.</li>
            <li> , I LOVE MAKE UP</li>
            <li> The lighter colors are more for a glittery effect.</li>
            <li> Also the pigments are not as they seem and you have to work your way rubbing more and more.</li>
            <li> I love doing my makeup, always have.</li>
            <li> If the eyes are the windows to our soul, then u better believe mine are gonna look outstanding, to match what&#x27;s on the inside.</li>
            <li> This eyeshadow palette is okay, but nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will for sure being buying more colors.</li>
            <li> and hey I love it</li>
            <li> I purchased this palette and the one of the coastal scents palette and this one is much more pigmented and has more quantity of the product for your money.</li>
            <li> I love the range of this pallet.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and would recommend this product to any one</li>
            <li> and i love them</li>
            <li> (no damages on two separate purchases of this palette), and most of the colors are sparkly and shimmery.</li>
            <li> I love eyes</li>
            <li> Love the quality and colors.</li>
            <li> They might not be as good of a quality that you would get from Amazon, but it is worth checking them out</li>
            <li> Received this today and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.......saw e.l.f.</li>
            <li> my daughter is so happy i finally ordered her her own palette, now she don&#x27;t have to always use mine and</li>
            <li> I needed to spend 10 more dollars to get free shipping</li>
            <li> But if that was not broken it would be a good product.</li>
            <li> Beautiful rich and soft colours.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and really amazing colors, great pigmentation, long last.</li>
            <li> The white is good to use as primer too if you do not have eye primer!</li>
            <li> Really nice eyeshadow palette, I really like the colors :)</li>
            <li> Easy to blend.</li>
            <li> Comes off easily throughout the day</li>
            <li> These are beautiful and will probably last for 10 years!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Bottom row of eyes shadows too dark for me, but otherwise great, amazing eye shadow.</li>
            <li> I get compliments but mostly feel pretty so that what matters!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying another one, I love it so much!!</li>
            <li> but this is simple and great.</li>
            <li> They appear cheap.</li>
            <li> It feels &#x27;cheap&#x27; which I guess if you buy it for this price you pay for what you get.</li>
            <li> the 2 colors available, Was suposed to receve this palette</li>
            <li> The colors are great and they actually last all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too light and also too shimmery</li>
            <li> I love the large mirror!</li>
            <li> Great colors, but not enough pigment to be true</li>
            <li> I LOVE these bold, fun colors.</li>
            <li> and pretty i love them</li>
            <li> This is a awsome palette I have so many different kind of makeup like Mac coastal scent ect</li>
            <li> They are glittery but not bad</li>
            <li> I always use eye primer, so it stays in place well and is as bold looking as I want.</li>
            <li> Have to apply a lot to get the bold color.</li>
            <li> they perform as well as well as the higher end products without the huge price.</li>
            <li> The colors are glittery and very pretty on the eyes.</li>
            <li> I got this palette because of all the great dark colors.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but didn&#x27;t stay to long.</li>
            <li> I love my new eye shadow palette.</li>
            <li> I love these new baked eye shadows.</li>
            <li> the colors are very pigmented and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This set was easier to apply, and the colors really stick!!</li>
            <li> Amazing lasting colors.</li>
            <li> Nice color selection for my eye color blue</li>
            <li> colors are nice, but they are very sheer.  </li>
            <li> Some of the colors I probably won&#x27;t use, but overall they are nice.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice and last all day.</li>
            <li> This is a nice addition to that color family, kind of like an expansion pack :) They come off a little lighter than the Urban Decay, but if you dampen your brush first</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t use the right brush (which e.l.f.</li>
            <li> I use them wet mostly, but they are also great dry.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really try and clean it  </li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant and fantastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for those who want the shiney smokey look but not go overboard.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that it does give a very nice look, but just a little too much effort for me.</li>
            <li> My brushes couldn&#x27;t pick up these eyeshadows and when finally I was able to apply on my eyes</li>
            <li> When I first received these I thought they would be too glittery</li>
            <li> It has pretty colors for day and night.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty, packaged well</li>
            <li> but it is mostly just shimmer and no actual color.</li>
            <li> They remind me of the higher end brand&#x27;s baked eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just same as my Chanel eyeshadow if it&#x27;s better .</li>
            <li> The pigmentation is not as strong as you would imagine due to the strong colors.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a nice variety of colors, they go on smoothly and last long.  </li>
            <li> Love these eyeshadows i have had alot of fun creating new looks with different combinations of the eyeshadows</li>
            <li> The colors are quite sparkly, (I love it) which can be a negative if you&#x27;re not into glitter, but they don&#x27;t spread out all over ur face like most glittery shadows do.</li>
            <li> These are just as good as the more expensive ones out there.</li>
            <li> colors aren&#x27;t as pigmented as wished not as comparable to ud as advertised , not very unhappy, but wont order again.</li>
            <li> I love this eye showdown, it stays all day long and no need to retouch.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try to use them dry because you will not be satisfied.</li>
            <li> I feel like every eyeshadow should be shimmery, and this certainly fits the bill.</li>
            <li> The colors are very nice and very pigmented can use wet or dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing, stays on and definitely not cheap.</li>
            <li> Really like this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup much</li>
            <li> The only way to use these shadows and actually enjoy them is to 1)</li>
            <li> I do really like the mirror in the case though.  </li>
            <li> Too much fall out.</li>
            <li> I love the palette colors but perhaps due to my skin tone the pigments dont appear in their full color potential.</li>
            <li> Good colors, wet or dry.</li>
            <li> dry works just fine for me.</li>
            <li> Price was decent but the shadow itself.  </li>
            <li> I only use it every once in a while mostly the lighter colors for an inner corner highlight.</li>
            <li> I frickin LIVE this eye shadow.</li>
            <li> AND IT HAS ALREADY BECOME MY NEW BFF</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll splurge and get new makeup.  </li>
            <li> I was actually hoping it to be more pigmented but other than that I like the colors.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller then I thought pretty colors but not pigmented you can even see the colors on even with primer or mac fix</li>
            <li> Start with a light hand and then deepen to prevent shadow smudges and/or too dark an application.</li>
            <li> They are easy to apply with just a little practice to get the depth of color you desire.</li>
            <li> I love usig the colors wet as bases for more dramatic &amp;#34;night&amp;#34; looks.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a little more from this product but yet again it was only $10.</li>
            <li> From what I can tell, it&#x27;s a near dupe of Sephora&#x27;s moonshine(?) palette.</li>
            <li> i completely  regret purchasing  two of them....</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> I recently got into this whole &amp;#34;baked&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> As an almost 40 year old, I can wear these to work or out and about.</li>
            <li> If you use them wet then yes the cost is worth if it, if you&#x27;re not then you are going to regret this buy.</li>
            <li> These colors are deeply pigmented and I love the wet or dry choice.</li>
            <li> I used mainly the brown and white.</li>
            <li> some of their products are now available at my local Wal-mart store, and they seem to be slightly less in price than they are on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Its just a shimmery, glittery mess that doesn&#x27;t really produce much color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is designed this way, but the shadows above and below each other compliment perfectly in this palate, so I usually match them that way when I&#x27;m doing a two tone look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking ill buy the California palette since I love this one so much.</li>
            <li> A bit difficult to apply (wet application helps), but relative to the price of a similar color palette, just as good as the higher end.</li>
            <li> This color palette is intense and last all day long.  </li>
            <li> Barely any pigment</li>
            <li> The dark colors show really well.</li>
            <li> Only problem is that the palette itself seems to flake so it&#x27;s pretty messy.</li>
            <li> Slightly disappointed by this, I would rather spend a little more and buy a better pigmented color palette</li>
            <li> It has so much fallout that you can&#x27;t even wear without making a mess in the palette.</li>
            <li> I was looking for eyeshadow that is a little shimmery, but not too much.</li>
            <li> It very hard to clean when it falls under your eyes.  </li>
            <li> The colors are too metallic, and they don&#x27;t stay on the brush well OR last very long on.</li>
            <li> only bad thing I really have to say about it is the tremendous amount of fallout you get.  </li>
            <li> So How to know if you buy only 1 if u r going to receive the original or the fake one...????</li>
            <li> IT STAYS ON FOR A LONG TIME AND</li>
            <li> Not enough pigmentation even when wet.</li>
            <li> Dry.</li>
            <li> I wish the blue was like the picture but takes a few brush strokes to get it that blue.</li>
            <li> but 1 beautful, rich color, original and other was fake, terrible product,, suposed to be same color as de original</li>
            <li> A bit disappointed, to be honest.</li>
            <li> I use them dry and wet ways.</li>
            <li> It can be worn wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> I have the Naked 2 &amp; 3 palettes and they only include a few dark colors.</li>
            <li> It seems very caked on to the palette and very hard to get any color transfer onto your makeup brush to apply.</li>
            <li> The blue shade came broken, which I was a little upset about, but I wasn&#x27;t going to use it much anyway.</li>
            <li> I did not try them wet</li>
            <li> I would recommend getting your eyeshadow brush wet before applying.</li>
            <li> I apply some to my brush and all that apply s  is glitter absolutely no color</li>
            <li> use them wet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read the reviews about putting it on wet, so that&#x27;s what I tried, but it seems as if I almost have to scratch at it to get any color on my brush when doing so.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them wet yet though...</li>
            <li> i tried using thm wet</li>
            <li> Poor quality makeup, it doesn&#x27;t go on very well.</li>
            <li> Other than that, the pigments are gorgeous, The palette came with several colors broken which was disappointing but not a huge deal.</li>
            <li> i bought this because the colors looked unbelievable, however they don&#x27;t seem to provide actual color on my eyes unless i use them wet.</li>
            <li> A little stays all day long.</li>
            <li> You choices are endless.</li>
            <li> I would Recommend for any eye color (mine is dark brown) as there is a wide range of colors.</li>
            <li> I think it isn&#x27;t as dark without the primer, but using it wet would probably remedy that issue.</li>
            <li> The color payoff on the other hand, is not.</li>
            <li> but u can see that was made in other coutntry..</li>
            <li> no quality, other product and smell.</li>
            <li> instead these were not worth the money</li>
            <li> Other than that shimmery goodness!</li>
            <li> it looked like a little bit of sparkle on my eyes</li>
            <li> There was a little bit of creasing after wearing it all day, but nothing horrible.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also a little too shimmery for my liking.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t go on very dark.  </li>
            <li> I ordered Californian and New York big disappointed.</li>
            <li> Also, this has never happened before but when I try to dab the shadow with a brush very little eyeshadow comes off?</li>
            <li> This is my go to look for everyday!</li>
            <li> Similar to expensive baked eyeshadow with designer names.</li>
            <li> This eyeshadows are so hard to apply...</li>
            <li> and you can hardly see the color..</li>
            <li> Hard to apply.</li>
            <li> everywhere Packaging was poor nothing to protect it colors are hard to see and I had a hard time picking up the product on my brush</li>
            <li> And being that they are a glittery finish, that&#x27;s not good.  </li>
            <li> The shadows are very hard to get any pigment from.</li>
            <li> This Product arrived broken With eyeshadow</li>
            <li> Broken eyeshadow</li>
            <li> received a broken shipment.</li>
            <li> one of the eye shadows were broken and the color got on all of them.</li>
            <li> The quality is ver poor and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> The pallette was damaged and broken</li>
            <li> two of the colors which happened to be the darkest ones were broken off before I opened it.</li>
            <li> One downside is that once you start using them the case does get dirty</li>
            <li> It goes on very faint</li>
            <li> very difficult to get it on the brush.</li>
            <li> the color of the shadow&#x27;s didn&#x27;t show at all horrible product I wish I purchased a bh pallet</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great colors, but not enough pigment to be true if you don&#x27;t use the right brush (which e.l.f. Has a great set to help.</li>
            <li> I just use a q tip with this palette. The colors are glittery and very pretty on the eyes. I want to buy more for when this one runs out! Stays on all day too</li>
            <li> Good colors, wet or dry. Only problem is that the palette itself seems to flake so it&#x27;s pretty messy. Still, it&#x27;s a good deal. I love usig the colors wet as bases for more dramatic &amp;#34;night&amp;#34; looks.</li>
            <li> Pretty good but wears off quickly, good product for price paid though!</li>

            <li> This eyeshadows are so hard to apply...my brush can&#x27;t  even pick up the product....i completely  regret purchasing  two of them....</li>
            <li> It goes on very faint and you can hardly see the color.. It feels &#x27;cheap&#x27; which I guess if you buy it for this price you pay for what you get. I would recommend getting your eyeshadow brush wet before applying.</li>
            <li> Price was decent but the shadow itself.  Well lets say not to good. I apply some to my brush and all that apply s  is glitter absolutely no color</li>
            <li> I LOVE these bold, fun colors. My go-to night time look. I feel like every eyeshadow should be shimmery, and this certainly fits the bill. I&#x27;m not sure if it is designed this way, but the shadows above and below each other compliment perfectly in this palate, so I usually match them that way when I&#x27;m doing a two tone look. I get compliments but mostly feel pretty so that what matters! I would Recommend for any eye color (mine is dark brown) as there is a wide range of colors. I always use eye primer, so it stays in place well and is as bold looking as I want. I think it isn&#x27;t as dark without the primer, but using it wet would probably remedy that issue. Over-all very happy, definitely a perchance I am satisfied with every time I do my make up!</li>
            <li> Too flaky and sparkly.</li>
            <li> The color payoff on the other hand, is not. The only way to use these shadows and actually enjoy them is to 1) wear primer and 2) use them wet. Don&#x27;t try to use them dry because you will not be satisfied. If you use them wet then yes the cost is worth if it, if you&#x27;re not then you are going to regret this buy.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS ABOUT 3 MONTHS AGO AND IT HAS ALREADY BECOME MY NEW BFF, I LOVE MAKE UP AND THOSE EYESHADOW IS REALLY GREAT. IT STAYS ON FOR A LONG TIME AND THE QUALITY SHINE WOW. THE BEST EYESHADOW EVER!</li>
            <li> This is a nice collection of colors. I&#x27;ve used them all. The dark colors show really well. The lighter colors are more for a glittery effect.</li>
            <li> I was so happy and excited to get these eyeshadows I ordered Californian and New York big disappointed. My brushes couldn&#x27;t pick up these eyeshadows and when finally I was able to apply on my eyes it didn&#x27;t show up nicely at all it looked like a little bit of sparkle on my eyes the color of the shadow&#x27;s didn&#x27;t show at all horrible product I wish I purchased a bh pallet instead these were not worth the money</li>
            <li> It has so much fallout that you can&#x27;t even wear without making a mess in the palette. Also the pigments are not as they seem and you have to work your way rubbing more and more.</li>
            <li> received a broken shipment. one of the eye shadows were broken and the color got on all of them. I will be asking for a refund if possible. But if that was not broken it would be a good product.</li>
            <li> I love doing my makeup, always have. So, I have always loved searching for beautiful colors for what I consider to be the most important application....eye shadow! If the eyes are the windows to our soul, then u better believe mine are gonna look outstanding, to match what&#x27;s on the inside. Lol.&lt;br /&gt;I saw this pallet, saw the beautiful colors, then saw the price and figured WTH. The shadows are very hard to get any pigment from. I&#x27;ve read the reviews about putting it on wet, so that&#x27;s what I tried, but it seems as if I almost have to scratch at it to get any color on my brush when doing so. I have to admit that it does give a very nice look, but just a little too much effort for me. Might as well just spend the extra money and get a pallet from Urban Decay.</li>
            <li> This eyeshadow palette is okay, but nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are nice, but they are very sheer.  You have to build it up a lot to be able to get a bright color.  There is also A LOT of fallout from these shadows.  And being that they are a glittery finish, that&#x27;s not good.  It very hard to clean when it falls under your eyes.  There was a little bit of creasing after wearing it all day, but nothing horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing I really have to say about it is the tremendous amount of fallout you get.  But, for the price, who cares?  Besides, it&#x27;s e.l.f., not Mac.  I do really like the mirror in the case though.  It&#x27;s a nice edition.</li>
            <li> Good product. Cheap, good quality, not the best.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a nice variety of colors, they go on smoothly and last long.  I wish this came with a brush.</li>
            <li> Bought 2 of them.. the 2 colors available, Was suposed to receve this palette but what I got was 2 of the ither color same palette.. but 1 beautful, rich color, original and other was fake, terrible product,, suposed to be same color as de original but u can see that was made in other coutntry.. no quality, other product and smell. So How to know if you buy only 1 if u r going to receive the original or the fake one...????</li>
            <li> Great colors! Good quality for its price.</li>
            <li> I used mainly the brown and white. Even after after applying several times, the color still did not show; it was too lite and not as shown.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t go on very dark.  Have to apply a lot to get the bold color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller then I thought pretty colors but not pigmented you can even see the colors on even with primer or mac fix + ugh im dissapointed</li>
            <li> Dry. Hard to apply. Dont have time for it. Need something that actually works.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to get this in. I love E.L.F Products and the colors are perfect not too shimmery. I will for sure being buying more colors.</li>
            <li> This is a awsome palette I have so many different kind of makeup like Mac coastal scent ect but it&#x27;s always nice to give another makeup company a chance so I did and hey I love it</li>
            <li> Too much fall out. Not enough pigmentation even when wet. Also a little too shimmery for my liking. I was expecting a little more from this product but yet again it was only $10. I only use it every once in a while mostly the lighter colors for an inner corner highlight. This palette is just &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Colors are a bit different than advertised. Unpigmented. Fallouts to the max. Too shimmery. Also, this has never happened before but when I try to dab the shadow with a brush very little eyeshadow comes off? The quality is ver poor and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my teenage daughter and she loves them, I ordered another set for my Mother and she loves them, so next I will order for myself. Amazing lasting colors.</li>
            <li> Really nice eyeshadow palette, I really like the colors :)</li>
            <li> colors aren&#x27;t as pigmented as wished not as comparable to ud as advertised , not very unhappy, but wont order again.</li>
            <li> The pallette was damaged and broken</li>
            <li> When I first received these I thought they would be too glittery but they are perfect. They blend wonderfully, the quality is great &amp; the palette works for night &amp; day. Completely happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The colors are too metallic, and they don&#x27;t stay on the brush well OR last very long on. A bit disappointed, to be honest.</li>
            <li> two of the colors which happened to be the darkest ones were broken off before I opened it. Didn&#x27;t really try and clean it  looked ruined to me. So I let my niece have it, and she said it was know good. If this hadn&#x27;t happened I maybe would have liked it more. The casing of the eyeshadow is nice and the mirror is awesome!</li>
            <li> I purchased this palette and the one of the coastal scents palette and this one is much more pigmented and has more quantity of the product for your money. The colors are quite sparkly, (I love it) which can be a negative if you&#x27;re not into glitter, but they don&#x27;t spread out all over ur face like most glittery shadows do. I&#x27;m thinking ill buy the California palette since I love this one so much. Nice smoky colors.</li>
            <li> I recently got into this whole &amp;#34;baked&amp;#34; eyeshadow thing. These are just as good as the more expensive ones out there. They are shimmery, but they are not teenager shimmery. As an almost 40 year old, I can wear these to work or out and about. They do need to be blended and you&#x27;ll need a really good brush to apply.  I haven&#x27;t used them wet yet though... dry works just fine for me.</li>
            <li> These colors are awesome..I want to purchase more!!</li>
            <li> Good price and nice colors. I love the range of this pallet. It has pretty colors for day and night.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. Its just a shimmery, glittery mess that doesn&#x27;t really produce much color.</li>
            <li> Coverage is on the sheer end of the spectrum, which was not a surprise. Other than that, the pigments are gorgeous, The palette came with several colors broken which was disappointing but not a huge deal.</li>
            <li> I love them as all colors are rich pigmented and fits perfectly all the day. I use them dry and wet ways.</li>
            <li> Bought this item for my granddaughter for Christmas.  It looks great...we will see....</li>
            <li> Love these eyeshadows i have had alot of fun creating new looks with different combinations of the eyeshadows</li>
            <li> Product came quicly and was packaged very good. I love the colors and would recommend this product to any one</li>
            <li> this stuff is awesome the colors are so shimmery and pretty i love them i tried using thm wet and i love them</li>
            <li> I love this shadow! It&#x27;s pretty, packaged well (no damages on two separate purchases of this palette), and most of the colors are sparkly and shimmery. Not the greatest pigment, but it builds well. Could be improved with an included applicator.</li>
            <li> my daughter is so happy i finally ordered her her own palette, now she don&#x27;t have to always use mine and me yelling don&#x27;t drop it.</li>
            <li> I love my new eye shadow palette. The colors are great and they actually last all day. I love the large mirror!</li>
            <li> very cheap, very good quality, just what i was looking for! I love eyes lips face products because of their quality and affordability!</li>
            <li> They are beautiful colors but it is mostly just shimmer and no actual color. It seems very caked on to the palette and very hard to get any color transfer onto your makeup brush to apply. Manufacturer /product issue, great seller.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors. Nice sparkle.</li>
            <li> I used a primer but the color doesn&#x27;t go on well. It&#x27;s too light and also too shimmery</li>
            <li> Nice eyeshadows... Some of the colors I probably won&#x27;t use, but overall they are nice.  One downside is that once you start using them the case does get dirty</li>
            <li> Did not like the feel of it at all.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeshadow! I needed to spend 10 more dollars to get free shipping so I was like, what the hell I&#x27;ll splurge and get new makeup.  The colors come out so nice! They are glittery but not bad, I wear the browns on my eyes to work. The white is good to use as primer too if you do not have eye primer!</li>
            <li> pretty good product, not as good as i thought it would be , i love ELF products the last eye shadow i bought from Elf was amazing this one is good but not as good, the colors dont show as bright as i thought it would.</li>
            <li> I have every color of these palettes. The colors are vibrant and fantastic. I use them wet mostly, but they are also great dry. They remind me of the higher end brand&#x27;s baked eyeshadow. They are well packaged and the large mirror is great. I have one palette I have had for over a year (with almost daily use) and there is still quite a bit of eyeshadow left. These last a while. would recommend these to everyone!</li>
            <li> These are beautiful and will probably last for 10 years!! You receive a lot of shadow and the price was great! These colors are deeply pigmented and I love the wet or dry choice. They are easy to apply with just a little practice to get the depth of color you desire. Start with a light hand and then deepen to prevent shadow smudges and/or too dark an application. Very, very nice colors. Good set and great value. Similar to expensive baked eyeshadow with designer names. I&#x27;ve already recommended to friends.</li>
            <li> I was looking for eyeshadow that is a little shimmery, but not too much. I wanted something that would make a good smokey eye, but didn&#x27;t turn out too bold. This is perfect! I now use it every day.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors and excellent makeup</li>
            <li> This set was easier to apply, and the colors really stick!! Love it!</li>
            <li> This color palette is intense and last all day long.  It can be worn wet or dry.  The price was excellent which made it a no-brainer!  The variety gives you multiple looks for your eyes.</li>
            <li> very difficult to get it on the brush.</li>
            <li> Love the quality and colors.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice and last all day. It&#x27;s just same as my Chanel eyeshadow if it&#x27;s better .</li>
            <li> The colors are very nice and very pigmented can use wet or dry.</li>
            <li> just love the colors and impressed with e.l.f. cosmetics...they perform as well as well as the higher end products without the huge price. Will be buying a lot of my cosmetics from this company from now on. FYI...some of their products are now available at my local Wal-mart store, and they seem to be slightly less in price than they are on Amazon. They might not be as good of a quality that you would get from Amazon, but it is worth checking them out</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Beautiful rich and soft colours. Easy to blend. Can be worn day or night! Would recommend &amp; will repurchase. Thank you...</li>
            <li> Bottom row of eyes shadows too dark for me, but otherwise great, amazing eye shadow. Just as good as MAC.</li>
            <li> Poor quality makeup, it doesn&#x27;t go on very well.</li>
            <li> I love this eye showdown, it stays all day long and no need to retouch. A little stays all day long. I&#x27;m buying another one, I love it so much!!</li>
            <li> Received this today and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.......saw e.l.f. On Pintrest and decided to give it a try.  Very pleased with the colors and application. I would give it 5 stars but it didn&#x27;t come with any applicators.  I do use brushes and it applied wonderfully</li>
            <li> I love these new baked eye shadows. They have great pigmentation, good pick up, and the palette itself is very attractive. The eye shadows goes on very smooth and blends very good too. I am very satisfied with this palette. It came on time, undamaged, which was my biggest fear. It was solid. Definitely a great addition to my makeup collection. I can&#x27;t wait to add the rest of the Elf Baked Palettes to my collection!!!</li>
            <li> Not so great quality makeup. Comes off easily throughout the day</li>
