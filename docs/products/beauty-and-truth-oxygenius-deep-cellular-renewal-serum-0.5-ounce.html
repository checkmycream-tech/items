    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It is a great moisturizer, but not a miracle in a bottle.</li>
            <li>and like i said use them together and make sure to get the $20 a month package - you can&#x27;t lose!!</li>
            <li>even so it makes my skin feel good.</li>
            <li>Good day,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please, let this be a fair warning to you.</li>
            <li>I have seen an amazing improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>It feels great going on, but I have not noticed a huge difference in my complexion.</li>
            <li>If you have not purchased their &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; samples but want to try the product I recommend that you buy from Mystique Rose Boutique for two reasons....</li>
            <li>liked the feel but results?</li>
            <li>and there is more bottle than product....</li>
            <li>OK everyone - here is the deal.  </li>
            <li>Having said that, I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>the more i use these 2 products.  </li>
            <li>(Be sure that you use Oxygenious AND Wrinkle Rewind together to get the desired results.)</li>
            <li>so I have to unscrew the top and get to the product that way.  </li>
            <li>I love the product.  </li>
            <li>and I love the product.</li>
            <li>I applied it twice a day, and was pleased with the moisturizing effect it had on the skin.</li>
            <li>I can buy better serums at the corner drug  </li>
            <li>so they don&#x27;t attempt to steal even more money from me.  </li>
            <li>Whether their product works or not is not the point, they are shysters and the word needs to get out there before more women are duped by them.</li>
            <li>want all of my money and you had better not charge another dime on my card.  </li>
            <li>If you got their free samples and do not wish to continue receiving the 2 products for almost $200/month be sure to contact B &amp; T within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Once people like me, get the word out about your company and the exposure that I can easily bring, it will hopefully destroyed your company efforts in scamming customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I THINK THIS MAY BE A FINE PRODUCT, BUT YOU CANNOT GET IT OUT OF THEM BOTTLE.  </li>
            <li>thing is for certain, I am going to complain to the BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU.</li>
            <li>He would give me a refund of $50 and $48.54 even though I repeatedly told him that I wanted a full refund which he wouldn&#x27;t hear of.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use enough to tell if the product was any good.  </li>
            <li>First of all I thought that the product was free if I paid the shipping price of $3.95 each for the Wrinkle Rewind and the OxyGenius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>THEY REALLY DO WORK!!  </li>
            <li>The serum penetrates and puffs the skin to a sheen that feels softer, erases very fine wrinkles, and, simply put, makes the skin feel refreshed or plumped.</li>
            <li>Yes, many people tried this cellular renewal serum when offers were made that seemed to entrap the customer in an endless subscription for buying the product repeatedly, but now that that problem has been corrected it is time to evaluate the product on its own merits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I finally unscrewed the top and the &amp;#34;straw&amp;#34; came off.  </li>
            <li>If I do not receive a full refund for something that I did not authorize you take, I will be contacting a consumer lawyer, who loves to take down companies like yours, and reporting you to the Better Business Bureau.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE the product and am purchasing another bottle of Oxygenious from Mystique Rose Boutique because I do not have enough to last with the amount of Wrinkle Rewind that I received with B &amp; T&#x27;s supposedly FREE trial....which is not free at all...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all kinds of different products to try to erase fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>they are really making a killing.  </li>
            <li>you are not signed up for monthly shipments and MRB sells it for a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li>I really like the product but</li>
            <li>I really do like the product but</li>
            <li>There is much that I did not understand when I responded to the advertise.  </li>
            <li>used as directed - two drops or pumps form the very well designed dispenser massaged into the face and neck twice a day - there is an immediate effect that is visibly and tactically noticeable.</li>
            <li>store much cheaper.</li>
            <li>so I could send it back to get a full refund.  </li>
            <li>I must have used too much at first because I am already almost completely out of</li>
            <li>I  personally wasn&#x27;t pleased with the serum and there was hardly enough in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I wasnt able to use it long enough to really tell if it was beneficial.</li>
            <li>The company allowed me to return it and sent a new bottle.</li>
            <li>The product came on time and in new packaging.</li>
            <li>so I  tried it again and the same thing - for as much money as it costs</li>
            <li>The price for the amount of product that one receives makes it&#x27;s value far below expectations.</li>
            <li>If you do want the product, do not buy direct from the company.  </li>
            <li>I used it once so far</li>
            <li>The bottle design doesn&#x27;t work in more than one way: it falls apart, also the gel is to thick</li>
            <li>Bought as a gift, bottle half full.  </li>
            <li>But, much to my surprise, however, my credit card was not charged $3.95 in shipping and handling for each product, but a flat $39.95 from &amp;#34;Spadelightful&amp;#34; - whatever the heck that is.  </li>
            <li>I really liked this product, the only problem I have is that the bottle is so small and you don&#x27;t get enough of the serum in it.</li>
            <li>I have fine lines around my mouth due to smoking and I can tell you they have gotten smaller and smaller</li>
            <li>You are violating legal business practice and you are operating on fine thin line.  </li>
            <li>Barely okay as its much too expensive</li>
            <li>Expensive product and wasn&#x27;t that impressed with the half empty bottle.</li>
            <li>because Yes, it does run out quick, however if you use less it will last you.  </li>
            <li>Now that the little &#x60;problem&#x27; is over, try your product again and be consistent with its use and see the difference after 2 to 4 weeks time.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> My experience is about the same as other consumers.  </li>
            <li> When coupled with the company&#x27;s other product Wrinkle Rewind&#x27; there is a very definite improvement in skin appearance and feel.</li>
            <li> I read other reviewers say the same thing</li>
            <li> I do not give you authorization to charge nothing only to reimburse all funds due to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finally I agreed with him and I will call them back and will try cancelling it in a few days.  </li>
            <li> Not very much in the bottle.....</li>
            <li> I actually wanted to give the product a 2.5 star rating: 5 stars for the product itself, but for the company, Beauty &amp; Truth, 0 stars for their business practices and the cost for such a small amount of product.</li>
            <li> and they are very stingy with the amount in the bottle, and you have to push really hard to get what little is in there out.</li>
            <li> The way the bottle is made you can&#x27;t even get the last little bit out &amp;#34;ugh&amp;#34;.....</li>
            <li> Not as expected for the price.  </li>
            <li> For the cost I would think that this should work properly, the instructions state 2 pumps, so I am not sure what amount 2 pumps is because I received a defective bottle.</li>
            <li> AS  other users say..I do see an improvement in my skin..however I emptied the bottle in a week...</li>
            <li> Did get a little out by shaking it out but TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY.  </li>
            <li> It really made me angry that he would not let me out of the program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have seen several complaint about your trickery business practice.  </li>
            <li> THEN while you have them on the phone you can talk them DOWN IN PRICE to $20 per month.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of Money!!</li>
            <li> I got a little out for a couple of days and then couldn&#x27;t get any to come out.  </li>
            <li> It is a little pricey if ordered through Beauty &amp; Truth.  </li>
            <li> i used it a few times didn&#x27;t see a difference</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste yours.</li>
            <li> This really made me very angry.  </li>
            <li> By the time you figure out if whether or not you like, there is no more.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of wrinkle rewind, but no more Oxygenius.</li>
            <li> After that is gone I am not sure whether I will continue with B &amp; T products...depends on if I find another product I like as well.</li>
            <li> and my skin has changed dramatically in the past 10 years as I am going through menopause.</li>
            <li> And you put it in small letters in an email.  </li>
            <li> Theres a sucker born every minute</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I bid you failure in all that you do, because you are a thieving</li>
            <li> no good</li>
            <li> oxygenius is so over priced and the small amount is laughable.</li>
            <li> I received my order very quickly....but have been very disappointed in the product....</li>
            <li> What I did not know was that I had two weeks to try these two products and if I did not cancel in that period of time, I would be charged for the trial products of approximately $80 each.  </li>
            <li> My disappointment was its failure to reduce the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> so it can be very expensive to use</li>
            <li> BAD</li>
            <li> BAD  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the qty of serum</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I had tried it once before and the bottle is terrible</li>
            <li> the packaging is terrible.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with the price paid!!!</li>

            <li> used the entire container as directed and my skin felt tighter but almost sticky.  no lasting effects...</li>
            <li> I received my order very quickly....but have been very disappointed in the product....the pump only worked 2-3 times...now I have to open the bottle and get the product out....and there is more bottle than product....such a disappointment...and I have seen NO changes in my face...</li>
            <li> I really liked this product, the only problem I have is that the bottle is so small and you don&#x27;t get enough of the serum in it. By the time you figure out if whether or not you like, there is no more. I have a lot of wrinkle rewind, but no more Oxygenius. The way the bottle is made you can&#x27;t even get the last little bit out &amp;#34;ugh&amp;#34;.....</li>
            <li> OK everyone - here is the deal.  You have to cancel your membership with them after you get the $3.95 trial offer - THEN while you have them on the phone you can talk them DOWN IN PRICE to $20 per month.  I happen to get the oxigenius delivered twice in a month because Yes, it does run out quick, however if you use less it will last you.  Having said that, I LOVE this product.  HOWEVER, you MUST use it with the Wrinkle Rewind like it says to.  I have fine lines around my mouth due to smoking and I can tell you they have gotten smaller and smaller the more i use these 2 products.  THEY REALLY DO WORK!!  Give it another try and like i said use them together and make sure to get the $20 a month package - you can&#x27;t lose!!</li>
            <li> I would not buy this product again.  I had tried it once before and the bottle is terrible I finally unscrewed the top and the &amp;#34;straw&amp;#34; came off.  What a joke.  I thought it was probably just a fluke so I  tried it again and the same thing - for as much money as it costs they are really making a killing.  Theres a sucker born every minute and I proved that.  Don&#x27;t buy it!!!!</li>
            <li> I actually wanted to give the product a 2.5 star rating: 5 stars for the product itself, but for the company, Beauty &amp; Truth, 0 stars for their business practices and the cost for such a small amount of product. I absolutely LOVE the product and am purchasing another bottle of Oxygenious from Mystique Rose Boutique because I do not have enough to last with the amount of Wrinkle Rewind that I received with B &amp; T&#x27;s supposedly FREE trial....which is not free at all...it cost me almost $90 when all was said and done. After that is gone I am not sure whether I will continue with B &amp; T products...depends on if I find another product I like as well. If you got their free samples and do not wish to continue receiving the 2 products for almost $200/month be sure to contact B &amp; T within 2 weeks. If you have not purchased their &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; samples but want to try the product I recommend that you buy from Mystique Rose Boutique for two reasons....you are not signed up for monthly shipments and MRB sells it for a much cheaper price. (Be sure that you use Oxygenious AND Wrinkle Rewind together to get the desired results.)</li>
            <li> I really like the product but the packaging is terrible. The price for the amount of product that one receives makes it&#x27;s value far below expectations. I will not order this product again .</li>
            <li> Recently purchased.  The Serum pump does not work,  suggest QC people work on this!!!!</li>
            <li> I had the same experience everybody else had with the trial.  I really do like the product but the pump only worked twice.  I have to take the pump out of the bottle every time to use the serum.  The quantity on both the serum and the wrinkle cream was an issue with me.  I will not buy it again because of my experience with it.  If you do want the product, do not buy direct from the company.  They are running a scam.  Kathy S.</li>
            <li> Not very much in the bottle.....</li>
            <li> My experience is about the same as other consumers.  There is much that I did not understand when I responded to the advertise.  First of all I thought that the product was free if I paid the shipping price of $3.95 each for the Wrinkle Rewind and the OxyGenius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty days after I had ordered these products, I called to cancel the orders.  Then a couple days later, I noticed that my checking account had been charged $78.49 and &amp;79.95 for the two samples, two and five days before this.  What I did not know was that I had two weeks to try these two products and if I did not cancel in that period of time, I would be charged for the trial products of approximately $80 each.  The trial products were not free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I called, the customer support person (for these two products) would not give me my money back.  He said that he could allow me to pay just $29.95 for each one because I was within the 30 day window.  He would give me a refund of $50 and $48.54 even though I repeatedly told him that I wanted a full refund which he wouldn&#x27;t hear of.  Out of shear frustration, I agreed to the $50 and $48 refunds.  Before this, I told him that I had not opened the product yet so I could send it back to get a full refund.  He would not consider it.  He kept repeating to me the $29.95 per month per product deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I told him that I wanted out of the program.  Another thing that was not an option.  This really made me very angry.  He said that he would give me until February 15th to call and cancel the products or there would be a withdrawal of $29.95 per product.  I repeatedly told him that I wanted to be totally cancelled. He just kept telling me I had until Feb. 15th to try the product and if I did not like the product I should cancel befor February 15th.  Finally I agreed with him and I will call them back and will try cancelling it in a few days.  It really made me angry that he would not let me out of the program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing is for certain, I am going to complain to the BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU.</li>
            <li> Total waste of Money!! I don&#x27;t think their was anything in the bottle to start with. I got a little out for a couple of days and then couldn&#x27;t get any to come out.  The tube in the bottle came off so can&#x27;t get any out.  Did get a little out by shaking it out but TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY.  I didn&#x27;t use enough to tell if the product was any good.  Should have 0 Stars.</li>
            <li> I cannot evaluate the product itself at this time, however, the pump is defective, it will not pump the product out.  so I have to unscrew the top and get to the product that way.  For the cost I would think that this should work properly, the instructions state 2 pumps, so I am not sure what amount 2 pumps is because I received a defective bottle.</li>
            <li> I THINK THIS MAY BE A FINE PRODUCT, BUT YOU CANNOT GET IT OUT OF THEM BOTTLE.  BAD BAD  IDEA TRYING TO PUMP OUT SINCE IT IS SO THICK.&lt;br /&gt;I WILL NOT ORDER AGAIN JUST TOO COSTLY TO USE ONLY 3 OR 4 TIMES</li>
            <li> I love the product.  I have seen an amazing improvement in my skin.  It is a little pricey if ordered through Beauty &amp; Truth.  I will order from amazon because it saves me money and I love the product. Besides I like to be in control of when I want to order.</li>
            <li> Yes, many people tried this cellular renewal serum when offers were made that seemed to entrap the customer in an endless subscription for buying the product repeatedly, but now that that problem has been corrected it is time to evaluate the product on its own merits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When used as directed - two drops or pumps form the very well designed dispenser massaged into the face and neck twice a day - there is an immediate effect that is visibly and tactically noticeable. The serum penetrates and puffs the skin to a sheen that feels softer, erases very fine wrinkles, and, simply put, makes the skin feel refreshed or plumped. When coupled with the company&#x27;s other product Wrinkle Rewind&#x27; there is a very definite improvement in skin appearance and feel. Now that the little &#x60;problem&#x27; is over, try your product again and be consistent with its use and see the difference after 2 to 4 weeks time. Grady Harp, July 14</li>
            <li> I applied it twice a day, and was pleased with the moisturizing effect it had on the skin. My disappointment was its failure to reduce the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Barely okay as its much too expensive and they are very stingy with the amount in the bottle, and you have to push really hard to get what little is in there out.I can buy better serums at the corner drug  store much cheaper.</li>
            <li> AS  other users say..I do see an improvement in my skin..however I emptied the bottle in a week...so it can be very expensive to use</li>
            <li> i used it a few times didn&#x27;t see a difference</li>
            <li> I  personally wasn&#x27;t pleased with the serum and there was hardly enough in the bottle.  It lasted only two days.</li>
            <li> I will not be purchasing again. Product did not help my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the qty of serum&lt;br /&gt;I thought my bottle had an air bubble because it didn&#x27;t last a week&lt;br /&gt;But I read other reviewers say the same thing so it must have been intentional.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the feel but results? No!&lt;br /&gt;Waste of my money. Don&#x27;t waste yours.</li>
            <li> oxygenius is so over priced and the small amount is laughable. I wasnt able to use it long enough to really tell if it was beneficial. i will not ever be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Wish I could use it. Had an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> works if keep regimen. like it and will continue</li>
            <li> Expensive product and wasn&#x27;t that impressed with the half empty bottle. I sent it back for refund.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s and my skin has changed dramatically in the past 10 years as I am going through menopause. I&#x27;ve used all kinds of different products to try to erase fine lines and wrinkles. I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my appearance with this product even so it makes my skin feel good.The bottle design doesn&#x27;t work in more than one way: it falls apart, also the gel is to thick so the pump doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m moving on to another product...</li>
            <li> Amazing. I must have used too much at first because I am already almost completely out of it.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is smother and younger looking!  I need to re-order!</li>
            <li> If I could give Truth &amp; Beauty zero stars, I would.  I just wish I&#x27;d found these reviews BEFORE placing an order for each of the two products, Oxygenius serum and Wrinkle Rewind moisturizer.  The cap to the serum bottle would not stay on, and I also could not get it to pump out any product. I called the company and was told to remove the cap and stir the product with the tube inside the bottle. The first time I did so, it did pump out a small amount, twice, BUT the next time I tried, nothing came out again. So, I tried the unscrew and stir technique and the tube broke off from the cap inside the bottle. The company allowed me to return it and sent a new bottle. I used it once so far and it did work.  But, much to my surprise, however, my credit card was not charged $3.95 in shipping and handling for each product, but a flat $39.95 from &amp;#34;Spadelightful&amp;#34; - whatever the heck that is.  I did not authorize a $39.95 charge to my card, so I called my bank to report an unauthorized charge by a company name I didn&#x27;t recognize, and then filed a dispute for the charge, which the bank is now working on.  I then phoned Truth &amp; Beauty and cancelled both items via their phone number (866-710-5109). After seeing this unauthorized charge, I don&#x27;t trust this company at all and will likely have to put a block on them so they don&#x27;t attempt to steal even more money from me.  As others have said, DO NOT ORDER FROM THESE FOLKS.  Whether their product works or not is not the point, they are shysters and the word needs to get out there before more women are duped by them.</li>
            <li> The product came on time and in new packaging. It feels great going on, but I have not noticed a huge difference in my complexion. It is a great moisturizer, but not a miracle in a bottle. Although I suppose nothing truly is.</li>
            <li> If you order this you will get a repeat order weather you want it or not. It is a scam.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift, bottle half full.  Not as expected for the price.  Very disappointed.  Very big expense for what you get, wouldn&#x27;t fill a teaspoon..  .</li>
            <li> Good day,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please, let this be a fair warning to you. If for some reason, you find it necessary to use your trickery in gaining money from me, you might as well cancel that thought.  You have played games and actually stole my money from me.  If I do not receive a full refund for something that I did not authorize you take, I will be contacting a consumer lawyer, who loves to take down companies like yours, and reporting you to the Better Business Bureau.  Not only myself, but I have seen several complaint about your trickery business practice.  You are violating legal business practice and you are operating on fine thin line.  Once people like me, get the word out about your company and the exposure that I can easily bring, it will hopefully destroyed your company efforts in scamming customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How in the Hell can you offer a 30 day trail and you charge people 14 days after the product is ordered...not received?  And you put it in small letters in an email.  You are being deceptive to customers.  You do not disclose the truth upfront.  How in the hell can you call yourself \\&quot;Beauty and Truth\\&quot;, when you are built on lying to customers.&lt;br /&gt;By the way...the ingredients you have in the product is a lie.  Yes, I found that out to.  The s*** irritates my skin, so I had it checked out for the ingredients.  YOU ARE such a LIAR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want all of my money and you had better not charge another dime on my card.  I do not give you authorization to charge nothing only to reimburse all funds due to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have the gall to have me to pay for the return shipment! I&#x27;ve been reading about you charging people restock fee.  How in the hell do you restock use product?  Stop doing this to people!!!  I bid you failure in all that you do, because you are a thieving no good company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please share this letter with whom ever will be affected by it&#x27;s content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ms. Deborah Reese&lt;br /&gt;A disgruntle former customer</li>
            <li> I did not see the results that were advertised.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference or improvement</li>
            <li> Only enough product for a week and the pump works for 3 days of that.  Very disappointed with the price paid!!!</li>
