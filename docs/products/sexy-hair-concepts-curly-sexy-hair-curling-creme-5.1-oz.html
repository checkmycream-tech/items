    <ol>
            <li>Works great with my perm!</li>
            <li>Neither are perfect for getting rid of the frizz 100% though..</li>
            <li>THE BEST HAIR CURL CREAM EVER!!</li>
            <li>Best hair cream I have found.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Good product for curly hair, with ease.</li>
            <li>still good control</li>
            <li>I was very pleased to find this product again.  </li>
            <li>did a nice job in creating and holding curls, but this product is not that good at controlling frizz.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>This is probably the best product out there for very curly hair.</li>
            <li>my curls nice hold without that crunchy look and feel</li>
            <li>Showing Curly Sexy Hair before they changed it.</li>
            <li>Great hair treatment - just have to use a very very little to get great results.</li>
            <li>I find it works best when applied to wet hair (after shower or just damp using water from the sink).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is really best for hair that&#x27;s already curly and needs some taming without weighing the curls down.</li>
            <li>it actually seemed like I had fly away frizz</li>
            <li>Keeps hair soft, smells good and keeps those curls manageable too.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and fine hair and have never found a product that gave me such volume and shine!</li>
            <li>This smells pretty good and it made my hair feel SO soft!  </li>
            <li>I use it along with a leave in conditioner and it makes my hair feel nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Sending new Curly Sexy Hair.</li>
            <li>Love this product and it does give soft well defined curl.</li>
            <li>This works perfectly for my thin hair.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have extremely curly hair so was looking for something to keep the curl I have looking good all day.  </li>
            <li>Used this in addition to Curl Power Enhancer - just the right mix.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to my hair dresser Cassie for suggesting this product !</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s a first for me.  </li>
            <li>I wait until my hair is completely dry before combing it; so it has more body.</li>
            <li>I used it sooooo much that when the cream got to the very bottom of the tube I cut it off</li>
            <li>If you have very curly hair and need something that prevents frizz without overdrying and making your hair crunchy, this is it.</li>
            <li>I really like this curl cream.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always battled with my somewhat curly-more frizzy hair and this is something I can&#x27;t live without.&lt;br /&gt;Gives</li>
            <li>and I think makes my hair just as soft.  </li>
            <li>Mousse is too light, gel is too heavy.  </li>
            <li>I put a small amount in my palm, rub it on my hands and then lightly add it to the ends of my hair.  </li>

            <li> Works great with my perm!</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple curly hair creams, this one does do a thing for my hair. It was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> actually it did not hold as well as i thought</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!  I have fair skin and fine hair and have never found a product that gave me such volume and shine! I will keep buying this stuff until the daisies pop up!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to find this product again.  I used it sooooo much that when the cream got to the very bottom of the tube I cut it off so I could use the very last smidgen.  I never done that with any other product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have extremely curly hair so was looking for something to keep the curl I have looking good all day.  Used this in addition to Curl Power Enhancer - just the right mix.  Thanks to my hair dresser Cassie for suggesting this product !</li>

            <li> This smells pretty good and it made my hair feel SO soft!  Too bad it didn&#x27;t get rid of the frizz.. it actually seemed like I had fly away frizz and my hair is thick so that&#x27;s a first for me.  I&#x27;m going to use the sleek look products.. it works for curly hair as well and I think makes my hair just as soft.  Neither are perfect for getting rid of the frizz 100% though..</li>
            <li> This is probably the best product out there for very curly hair. If you have very curly hair and need something that prevents frizz without overdrying and making your hair crunchy, this is it. I find it works best when applied to wet hair (after shower or just damp using water from the sink).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a product that is meant to make your hair curlier if you&#x27;re somewhere in between. This is really best for hair that&#x27;s already curly and needs some taming without weighing the curls down.</li>
            <li> NO FRIZZIES ANYMORE. Keeps hair soft, smells good and keeps those curls manageable too.</li>
            <li> Good product. Delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Depends on your hair texture. Made mine sticky. Use conditioner instead.</li>
            <li> Great hair treatment - just have to use a very very little to get great results. I will order this again.</li>
            <li> did a nice job in creating and holding curls, but this product is not that good at controlling frizz.</li>
            <li> I really like this curl cream.  I use it along with a leave in conditioner and it makes my hair feel nice and soft.</li>
            <li> THE BEST HAIR CURL CREAM EVER!!</li>
            <li> I need this to keep my curly hair in check. I hate it when I run out.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve always battled with my somewhat curly-more frizzy hair and this is something I can&#x27;t live without.&lt;br /&gt;Gives my curls nice hold without that crunchy look and feel</li>
            <li> Love this product and it does give soft well defined curl.</li>
            <li> Good product for curly hair, with ease.</li>
            <li> This product smelled bad and did not work in my hair the way it usually does. I&#x27;m wondering if it is a knock off?</li>
            <li> Best hair cream I have found.  Not to stiff but still good control</li>
            <li> Will order moore as soon as they get some in.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the feeling of &#x27;stuff&#x27; in my hair.  Mousse is too light, gel is too heavy.  This works perfectly for my thin hair.  I put a small amount in my palm, rub it on my hands and then lightly add it to the ends of my hair.  That way my scalp doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  I wait until my hair is completely dry before combing it; so it has more body.</li>
