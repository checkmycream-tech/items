            <li>I love this scrub</li>

            <li>I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this body butter.  </li>
            <li>It has a magical smell.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my skin feel and smell.</li>
            <li>and I just love the way it smells</li>
            <li>Like most people I was approached by the Kiosk people.</li>
            <li>This not only smells great but has good moisturizing power.  </li>
            <li>It also stays better than  any lotions when you wash your hands</li>
            <li>VIVO per lei body butter is what I recommend and the devotion is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>What more can I say?  </li>
            <li>Always make sure that Vivo products were made in Israel.</li>
            <li>No matter how much I like this, I would not buy it without this great price break.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS LOTION.  </li>
            <li>I LIKE IT BETTER THAN BABY OIL.  </li>
            <li>I love love love this body butter.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Great product, great price, fast delivery, Thanks,</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased the product here, it turned put well.</li>
            <li>Functionally this has been a good product, but it appears to be a pirated copy of the real product.  </li>
            <li>so I purchased it - this company&#x27;s products have REALLY strong scents and they are sort of musky for my taste</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with how fast it was sent to me.</li>
            <li>Bought this while on vacation for the first time and really liked it.  </li>
            <li>Not too strong and not too light.  </li>
            <li>i really like them because i work with strong liquids so after work y take shower and put some of this and works amazing....</li>
            <li>This body butter makes your skin feel so smooth.</li>
            <li>This was not what I ordered and the container was filled with another lotion.</li>
            <li>, you&#x27;ll want to wear it just for that light fragrance</li>
            <li>I ordered this from Amazon and recieved it in 4 days, with free shipping.  </li>
            <li>Use it in the shower and have smooth skin again</li>
            <li>Also the scent is a light scent and it doesn&#x27;t overpower your perfume.</li>
            <li>Genuine Vivo products are made in Israel and the jar for this variety of genuine Vivo is made of glass.  </li>
            <li>It just made me feel pretty. :)</li>
            <li>My skin is softer and smells wonderful but not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>The original product was made in Israel not China.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderfully&lt;br /&gt;Fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of Devotion and it is very creamy and rich.</li>
            <li>Nice soft sent.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin smooth and hydrated, and the Devotion scent is just right.  </li>
            <li>My psoriasis has greatly diminished, mostly due to this body butter.  </li>
            <li>This is a very good Shea butter product, an effective smoother and moisturizer, but it is difficult to apply.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li>Plus the smell is so light and delicate but beautiful</li>
            <li>The price, even as good as it is on Amazon, may seem daunting, but it is worth every single penny.  </li>
            <li>I tried to find it cheaper, and finally when I found it here for this amazing price I bought it immediately.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>right online</li>
            <li>Okay not only does it smell FANTASTIC but it is so much cheaper on amazon then in the mall, the mall was</li>
            <li>AND IS EFFECTIVE ALL DAY LONG.</li>
            <li>We had tried every kind of ointment, cream and lotion to help his dry hand problem.     </li>
            <li>The first introduction to this product was in the mall</li>
            <li>It actually seem more like a lotion than a butter to me.</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin moisturized, soft, velvety smooth.  </li>
            <li>i first tried it the lady told me that is was $49.99 for the 10 oz bottle</li>
            <li>This makes my hands feel soft and smooth all day.</li>
            <li>Makes skin so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>So love the product but the way the seller handles shipping and customers is a total shame.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that if I splash a little water on my skin, it spreads more easily, but friends have told me this reduces the effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The relaxing clean scent is not too overpowering but very soft.  </li>
            <li>Pure indulgence.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several --this one is light and smooth and absorbs almost instantly but doesn&#x27;t wash off with the first hand wash of the day.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Much appreciated thank you for this product</li>
            <li>I notice very scaley skin on my ankles.</li>
            <li>Also, they answered any question I had with fast responce.</li>
            <li>i was thinking that&#x27;s was way to much</li>
            <li>and i could believe how much cheaper it was here..</li>
            <li>They want 5 times as much in the mall.</li>
            <li>This is not the real product.</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth and makes your skin feel soft and the fragrance is so soft.</li>
            <li>Glad I could find it on Amazon for a lot less than I paid the first time.</li>
            <li>With my extreme skin issues, my jar will probably last about 4-6 weeks (that is with two all over applications a day, plus one to two light touch ups on my more severe psoriasis patches).  </li>
            <li>Everyone said this probably wasn&#x27;t the same thing because it was such a good deal, but it was exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>I have not had any skin reactions to the product other than healthy, moisturized skin.</li>
            <li>It is a Chinese copy of the original product.</li>
            <li>I really like this product with the salt, the 2 together live my hand so</li>
            <li>Highly reCommended to every body.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend the two products.</li>
            <li>I have been using dead sea products for many years.  </li>
            <li>it last all day i would say its kinda like a perfume body butter its worth it.</li>
            <li>I purchased this in the mall last week and am thrilled to see it here on Amazon for less.  </li>
            <li>His hand used to feel like lizard skin, now they are soft and normal!    </li>
            <li>Used in conjunction with the Swisa Pineapple/Mango scrub (also here for much cheaper on Amazon), I was pretty surprised to see such immediate results.  </li>
            <li>I live in the desert.</li>
            <li>Devotion gives such a light smell that I just can&#x27;t get enough of!!!!!  </li>
            <li>Also applied after a bit too much sun at the pool one day and a missed sun blocked spot on my shoulder, my bright pink sunburn was considerably less irritated the next morning and never did develop a sting.  </li>
            <li>While I wouldn&#x27;t tell her, after using it daily ever since, I&#x27;d pay double for each product now, but am glad I won&#x27;t have to since Amazon has such a deal.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, so for someone with normal skin, this tub should last several months and is supposed to stay good for two years after first opening.  </li>
            <li>I would have given it 5 stars if only it were a little more &amp;#34;buttery&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>so so soft....</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel silky and so soft.</li>
            <li>It is keeping my skin soft and wrinkles not as noticeable.</li>
            <li>if it had a different and less strong scent I would have given it 4 stars instead of 3</li>
            <li>- I have ordered more even though a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>The only reason I  didn&#x27;t give full 5 stars is because at the time of arrival, I was told by the postman that i had to pay 2 bucks extra because the seller claimed that he didn&#x27;t charge enough for shipping.</li>
            <li>Within 2 days of using this product, my son&#x27;s hands were back to normal.    </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to someone with extremely dry skin, it has certainly helped me.</li>
            <li>and it really quenches dry skin.</li>
            <li>As such I am rather suspect of it containing genuine Dead Sea minerals as labeled.</li>
            <li>The smell is so light and delicate...</li>
            <li>The psoriasis, which was dark purplish/red and cracking and bleeding at the time I was wrangled into the demo, is now smoother, softer, barely flaking and a light pink.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 55 yr old male (still dealing with that).</li>
            <li>This is one I highly recommend for moisture and those with dry skin problems.  </li>
            <li>It did not smell the same or feel the same but was in the container marked Vivo</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry climate and my skin dries off before I can apply this.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Keeps my skin smooth and hydrated, and the Devotion scent is just right.  </li>
            <li> My psoriasis has greatly diminished, mostly due to this body butter.  </li>
            <li> This is a very good Shea butter product, an effective smoother and moisturizer, but it is difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li> Plus the smell is so light and delicate but beautiful</li>
            <li> The price, even as good as it is on Amazon, may seem daunting, but it is worth every single penny.  </li>
            <li> I tried to find it cheaper, and finally when I found it here for this amazing price I bought it immediately.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> right online</li>
            <li> Okay not only does it smell FANTASTIC but it is so much cheaper on amazon then in the mall, the mall was</li>
            <li> AND IS EFFECTIVE ALL DAY LONG.</li>
            <li> We had tried every kind of ointment, cream and lotion to help his dry hand problem.     </li>
            <li> The first introduction to this product was in the mall</li>
            <li> It actually seem more like a lotion than a butter to me.</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin moisturized, soft, velvety smooth.  </li>
            <li> i first tried it the lady told me that is was $49.99 for the 10 oz bottle</li>
            <li> This makes my hands feel soft and smooth all day.</li>
            <li> Makes skin so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> So love the product but the way the seller handles shipping and customers is a total shame.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that if I splash a little water on my skin, it spreads more easily, but friends have told me this reduces the effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The relaxing clean scent is not too overpowering but very soft.  </li>
            <li> Pure indulgence.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several --this one is light and smooth and absorbs almost instantly but doesn&#x27;t wash off with the first hand wash of the day.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Much appreciated thank you for this product</li>
            <li> I notice very scaley skin on my ankles.</li>
            <li> Also, they answered any question I had with fast responce.</li>
            <li> i was thinking that&#x27;s was way to much</li>
            <li> and i could believe how much cheaper it was here..</li>
            <li> They want 5 times as much in the mall.</li>
            <li> This is not the real product.</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> It goes on so smooth and makes your skin feel soft and the fragrance is so soft.</li>
            <li> Glad I could find it on Amazon for a lot less than I paid the first time.</li>
            <li> With my extreme skin issues, my jar will probably last about 4-6 weeks (that is with two all over applications a day, plus one to two light touch ups on my more severe psoriasis patches).  </li>
            <li> Everyone said this probably wasn&#x27;t the same thing because it was such a good deal, but it was exactly the same.  </li>
            <li> I have not had any skin reactions to the product other than healthy, moisturized skin.</li>
            <li> It is a Chinese copy of the original product.</li>
            <li> I really like this product with the salt, the 2 together live my hand so</li>
            <li> Highly reCommended to every body.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend the two products.</li>
            <li> I have been using dead sea products for many years.  </li>
            <li> it last all day i would say its kinda like a perfume body butter its worth it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in the mall last week and am thrilled to see it here on Amazon for less.  </li>
            <li> His hand used to feel like lizard skin, now they are soft and normal!    </li>
            <li> Used in conjunction with the Swisa Pineapple/Mango scrub (also here for much cheaper on Amazon), I was pretty surprised to see such immediate results.  </li>
            <li> I live in the desert.</li>
            <li> Devotion gives such a light smell that I just can&#x27;t get enough of!!!!!  </li>
            <li> Also applied after a bit too much sun at the pool one day and a missed sun blocked spot on my shoulder, my bright pink sunburn was considerably less irritated the next morning and never did develop a sting.  </li>
            <li> While I wouldn&#x27;t tell her, after using it daily ever since, I&#x27;d pay double for each product now, but am glad I won&#x27;t have to since Amazon has such a deal.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so for someone with normal skin, this tub should last several months and is supposed to stay good for two years after first opening.  </li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars if only it were a little more &amp;#34;buttery&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> so so soft....</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel silky and so soft.</li>
            <li> It is keeping my skin soft and wrinkles not as noticeable.</li>
            <li> if it had a different and less strong scent I would have given it 4 stars instead of 3</li>
            <li> - I have ordered more even though a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The only reason I  didn&#x27;t give full 5 stars is because at the time of arrival, I was told by the postman that i had to pay 2 bucks extra because the seller claimed that he didn&#x27;t charge enough for shipping.</li>
            <li> Within 2 days of using this product, my son&#x27;s hands were back to normal.    </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to someone with extremely dry skin, it has certainly helped me.</li>
            <li> and it really quenches dry skin.</li>
            <li> As such I am rather suspect of it containing genuine Dead Sea minerals as labeled.</li>
            <li> The smell is so light and delicate...</li>
            <li> The psoriasis, which was dark purplish/red and cracking and bleeding at the time I was wrangled into the demo, is now smoother, softer, barely flaking and a light pink.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 55 yr old male (still dealing with that).</li>
            <li> This is one I highly recommend for moisture and those with dry skin problems.  </li>
            <li> It did not smell the same or feel the same but was in the container marked Vivo</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate and my skin dries off before I can apply this.</li>
            <li> So he stopped the other creams, ointments, lotions, medications so far.  </li>
            <li> Stopped for the demonstration only because of my son&#x27;s extremely dry, chapped and cracked hands.</li>
            <li> Once washed off skin is back to its dry self.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the best but certainly not the worst body butter</li>
            <li> A bit heavy but leaves skin soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewer, we were introduced to this product at our local mall.</li>
            <li> I use it before drying off and then pat dry.</li>
            <li> Recommended for those who have dry skin all over.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this product for dry skin.</li>
            <li> DRY, FLAKEY.  </li>
            <li> However the product I received is bottled in a look-a-like jar made of plastic and has an almost hidden tiny sticker that says made in Japan.  </li>
            <li> Cant wait to try the other</li>
            <li> because ordering direct from Vivo, you will be spending $800-1000 for a small kit.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Well no more,  I was so shocked that it works better than even what my dematologist prescribed.  </li>
            <li> but it is not listed in the ingredients (unless the long words I can&#x27;t read mean shea butter.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I tried this product along with the dead sea salt scrub; within days the condition was gone.</li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> I hate going to the little kiosks to get this product because the sale reps are allows hassling you to buy other things.  </li>
            <li> Ive never experienced anything like that before.</li>
            <li> I found this product in Hawaii and had not bought it again because it was so expensive.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fake.</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, I like the faint fragrance.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed that it did not tell you this ,because I never would have bought it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This has a nice scent to it. I use it with the scrub. I was expecting the body butter to be thicker than it was, but I like the way it goes on my skin. It makes my skin feel nice and silky and the the scent is not overpowering to me. I used it on my elbows and they are very smooth as wells as my heels. If you want something to make you silky from head to toe - buy this body butter. It just made me feel pretty. :)</li>
            <li> This body butter makes your skin feel so smooth. I use it before drying off and then pat dry. Has a nice scent. I would recommend this to someone with extremely dry skin, it has certainly helped me.</li>
            <li> I like it.It seems very good on skin.&lt;br /&gt;It is effective all day. You should have some by oneself.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I live in the desert. This cream helps to keep my skin from drying out. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I used this at a friends and had to have some for myself!  Love the smell and it really quenches dry skin.</li>
            <li> This was not what I ordered and the container was filled with another lotion. It did not smell the same or feel the same but was in the container marked Vivo Per Lei devotion.</li>
            <li> I love this scrub&lt;br /&gt;the best one</li>
            <li> I purchased this in the mall last week and am thrilled to see it here on Amazon for less.  I was roped into a trial at a kiosk and originally thought \\&quot;Give it your best shot\\&quot; when the sales person claimed it would help my severe psoriasis.  Used in conjunction with the Swisa Pineapple/Mango scrub (also here for much cheaper on Amazon), I was pretty surprised to see such immediate results.  I still wasn&#x27;t buying this or the scrub at $70 each, until the consultant gave me both for $70.  While I wouldn&#x27;t tell her, after using it daily ever since, I&#x27;d pay double for each product now, but am glad I won&#x27;t have to since Amazon has such a deal.  My psoriasis has greatly diminished, mostly due to this body butter.  Unlike most Shea butter products-- I&#x27;ve tried several --this one is light and smooth and absorbs almost instantly but doesn&#x27;t wash off with the first hand wash of the day.  I see best results when used right after showering.  My skin is softer and smells wonderful but not overwhelming.  The psoriasis, which was dark purplish/red and cracking and bleeding at the time I was wrangled into the demo, is now smoother, softer, barely flaking and a light pink.  Also applied after a bit too much sun at the pool one day and a missed sun blocked spot on my shoulder, my bright pink sunburn was considerably less irritated the next morning and never did develop a sting.  A little goes a long way, so for someone with normal skin, this tub should last several months and is supposed to stay good for two years after first opening.  With my extreme skin issues, my jar will probably last about 4-6 weeks (that is with two all over applications a day, plus one to two light touch ups on my more severe psoriasis patches).  The price, even as good as it is on Amazon, may seem daunting, but it is worth every single penny.  The feel and look of my skin has changed dramatically after the use of this product and I am a converted user.  Plus the smell is so light and delicate but beautiful, you&#x27;ll want to wear it just for that light fragrance you sense every time you brush your skin against something.  It really is an amazing product.  UPDATE: I ordered this from Amazon and recieved it in 4 days, with free shipping.  Fastest I have ever recieved a product from Amazon.  It was well packed and in pristine condition when I opened it.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love the smell &amp; the result</li>
            <li> Its like putting cream all over and feeling good about it. The scent is nice and the feel is better.  Recommended for those who have dry skin all over.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewer, we were introduced to this product at our local mall. Stopped for the demonstration only because of my son&#x27;s extremely dry, chapped and cracked hands. we used the salt scrub along with this cream and the results were instantly noticeable. Within 2 days of using this product, my son&#x27;s hands were back to normal.    We had tried every kind of ointment, cream and lotion to help his dry hand problem.     His hand used to feel like lizard skin, now they are soft and normal!    Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I really like this product with the salt, the 2 together live my hand so so so soft....i really like them because i work with strong liquids so after work y take shower and put some of this and works amazing....</li>
            <li> This lotion smells AMAZING!  Highly reCommended to every body.  Truly a great pRoduct. Much appreciated thank you for this product</li>
            <li> This is one of the best moisture creams I have ever used. Makes my skin feel silky and so soft. Like satin.MUST try it - I have ordered more even though a little goes a long way. I like to have an extra for travel.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.  All their products are wonderful.  It is keeping my skin soft and wrinkles not as noticeable.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and well packaged. Great body butter, wonderful scent and rubs in completely. Would recommend this product for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this body butter.  Makes my skin look and feel really good.  Scent is also wonderful.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Bought this while on vacation for the first time and really liked it.  Glad I could find it on Amazon for a lot less than I paid the first time.</li>
            <li> All my friends asked me about this product. I bought it from a store before two years for $60. I tried to find it cheaper, and finally when I found it here for this amazing price I bought it immediately. It has a magical smell.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel and smell. The relaxing clean scent is not too overpowering but very soft.  The first introduction to this product was in the mall and it was not at this price.  Great bargain.</li>
            <li> Devotion gives such a light smell that I just can&#x27;t get enough of!!!!!  I hate going to the little kiosks to get this product because the sale reps are allows hassling you to buy other things.  On amazon I can just buy what I want and not have to go through any hassles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vivo Per Lei Body Butter feels really good on my skin and I just love the way it smells and so does my fianc&amp;eacute;.  LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this product to anyone!!!!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Devotion and it is very creamy and rich. I would have given it 5 stars if only it were a little more &amp;#34;buttery&amp;#34;. It actually seem more like a lotion than a butter to me. The container says it has shea butter in it but it is not listed in the ingredients (unless the long words I can&#x27;t read mean shea butter. I will continue to order it but I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have been using dead sea products for many years.  Skin is very smooth.  It is worth every penny.  Pure indulgence.</li>
            <li> Like most people I was approached by the Kiosk people. I&#x27;m a 55 yr old male (still dealing with that). I notice very scaley skin on my ankles. I asked my dermatologist about it and she just shrugged her shoulders and said there was nothing I could do. I started to put aloe vera on it which hid the condition but did not heal it.    I tried this product along with the dead sea salt scrub; within days the condition was gone. Highly recommend the two products.</li>
            <li> This not only smells great but has good moisturizing power.  I really like it! Would order this again to always have a backup.</li>
            <li> Just the lotion I needed</li>
            <li> Great Great Great! I was very pleased with how fast it was sent to me. Also, they answered any question I had with fast responce.</li>
            <li> Shae butter to the rescue!  My sj&amp;ouml;grens leaves my skin with no moisture at all.  DRY, FLAKEY.  Well no more,  I was so shocked that it works better than even what my dematologist prescribed.  I told him about switching and he told me to continue with it.  So he stopped the other creams, ointments, lotions, medications so far.  It leaves my skin moisturized, soft, velvety smooth.  I almost don&#x27;t think it is the same skin.  It also stays better than  any lotions when you wash your hands they are still just as silky as ever without drying out at all.  VIVO per lei body butter is what I recommend and the devotion is my favorite.  I gave this product five stars and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever given any product five to be fair!  But VIVO makes an excellent products.  This is one I highly recommend for moisture and those with dry skin problems.  You can get a fair price for it off Amazon.  You might also try their face lift serum or eye care products-they rock!</li>
            <li> I found this product in Hawaii and had not bought it again because it was so expensive.  Everyone said this probably wasn&#x27;t the same thing because it was such a good deal, but it was exactly the same.  Thank you for a great product at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;A+ seller</li>
            <li> Vivo Per Lei Body Butter is an excellent moisturizer for body AND face. I have not had any skin reactions to the product other than healthy, moisturized skin. I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> nice perfume body lotion, and also a skin softener.  i like to wear it occasionally because it almost serves like a body scent.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Mother-in-law loves it too.  What more can I say?  I will buy again.  But always looking for good price and good source.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fake.Smells different and feels different on your skin.Always make sure that Vivo products were made in Israel.This one was made in Japan.</li>
            <li> The product takes care of dryness on my legs and arms.  Use it in the shower and have smooth skin again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the best but certainly not the worst body butter I have ever purchased.  The price right online so I purchased it - this company&#x27;s products have REALLY strong scents and they are sort of musky for my taste but the results are good for moisturizing....if it had a different and less strong scent I would have given it 4 stars instead of 3</li>
            <li> Okay not only does it smell FANTASTIC but it is so much cheaper on amazon then in the mall, the mall was were i first tried it the lady told me that is was $49.99 for the 10 oz bottle i was thinking that&#x27;s was way to much so i came home and checked online i saw it for $$50, and another website for $35 i finally went to amazon and i could believe how much cheaper it was here.. it smells great it last all day i would say its kinda like a perfume body butter its worth it.I WILL BE ORDERING MORE TO STOCK UP!!</li>
            <li> This makes my hands feel soft and smooth all day. I can&#x27;t use products with fragrance. This has a bit, but not enough to bother me. As a matter of fact, I like the faint fragrance. And the price of $12 . . . Wow! They want 5 times as much in the mall. No matter how much I like this, I would not buy it without this great price break.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS LOTION.  IT FEELS GREAT ON THE SKIN IN THE WINTER AND IN THE SUMMER.  I LIKE IT BETTER THAN BABY OIL.  IT COATS THE SKIN WITHOUT BEING GREASY AND IS EFFECTIVE ALL DAY LONG.</li>
            <li> This is not the real product. It is a Chinese copy of the original product. The original product was made in Israel not China. I was very disappointed that it did not tell you this ,because I never would have bought it.</li>
            <li> Last on your body all day.  Makes skin so smooth and soft.  The smell is so light and delicate...nothing overpowering.  Cant wait to try the other smells they have.&lt;br /&gt;All vivo products are awesome...and I am so happy I was able to find this on amazon...which is much more affordable...because ordering direct from Vivo, you will be spending $800-1000 for a small kit.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li> I like the body butter. Its soft, creamy and sinks into your skin. Also the scent is a light scent and it doesn&#x27;t overpower your perfume. The only reason I  didn&#x27;t give full 5 stars is because at the time of arrival, I was told by the postman that i had to pay 2 bucks extra because the seller claimed that he didn&#x27;t charge enough for shipping. Ive never experienced anything like that before. Really? So love the product but the way the seller handles shipping and customers is a total shame.</li>
            <li> This product works great on neck and decolletage.  Smells wonderfully&lt;br /&gt;Fresh and clean. Definitely recommend for all over use, but I buy it specifically&lt;br /&gt;For my neck and chest.</li>
            <li> I love love love this body butter. It goes on so smooth and makes your skin feel soft and the fragrance is so soft. It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> Functionally this has been a good product, but it appears to be a pirated copy of the real product.  Genuine Vivo products are made in Israel and the jar for this variety of genuine Vivo is made of glass.  However the product I received is bottled in a look-a-like jar made of plastic and has an almost hidden tiny sticker that says made in Japan.  As such I am rather suspect of it containing genuine Dead Sea minerals as labeled.</li>
            <li> This is a very good Shea butter product, an effective smoother and moisturizer, but it is difficult to apply. I live in a very dry climate and my skin dries off before I can apply this. I&#x27;ve found that if I splash a little water on my skin, it spreads more easily, but friends have told me this reduces the effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;This arrived quickly and in good shape.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Nice soft sent.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work like they describe it works like a .99 cents lotion / .99 cents face scrubber.&lt;br /&gt;a waste of money.</li>
            <li> A bit heavy but leaves skin soft and shiny. Once washed off skin is back to its dry self. Good if not wearing pants and want legs to look moisturize</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin smooth and hydrated, and the Devotion scent is just right.  Not too strong and not too light.  I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, fast delivery, Thanks,</li>
            <li> This is my all time fave lotion! I will never again buy it from vendors at the mall.. I suggest those of you reading this do the same! You can get 10x more product if you buy it online! Thank you for providing me with an amazing product for an unbeatable price!</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased the product here, it turned put well. Great quality and price! My friend recommended purchasing here. I am glad I did!</li>
            <li> This is a great deal compared to what they are trying to sell it to you for in the mall.  That said it is a good / fair price for a wonderful body butter.  The smell is very nice and I bought it for me and a friend. Will purchase again.</li>
