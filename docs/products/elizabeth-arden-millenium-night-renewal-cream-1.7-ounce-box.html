            <li>They love it and become Elizabeth Arden users.</li>
            <li>So far it seems to be working great</li>
            <li>Any way the product is good delivery is fast.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t particularly strike me as good smelling</li>
            <li>EA no longer produce this product but still available in the market</li>
            <li>It is a perfect night cream without being too heavy.</li>
            <li>It gives the skin a rich feel.</li>
            <li>I would pay $30+ for it, but they almost always carry this exact cream at TJMaxx for $16, so I would check there before paying more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 68 year old healthy woman, that has a light olive skin, I&#x27;ve always used only  evo, oatmeal, rose hip oil and rose hip water on my face, But about a year ago</li>
            <li>It is  a great product, the skin looks fresh in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;The texture is light, not greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;Exactly what I need after a long day.</li>
            <li>Quickly absorbs and adds nourishment for clean skin during the night.</li>
            <li>just love this so much...</li>
            <li>I like it very much and will order it again if it is available.</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s really working it in and spreading it around!!</li>
            <li>but if it works, well then who cares right?</li>
            <li>Arrived in sealed box; contents were secure and in new condition.</li>
            <li>thanks E.A.!</li>
            <li>If I had read the ingredients first, I wouldn&#x27;t have made that mistake.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for as long as it has been on the market and believe it has kept my skin softer and more youthful looking.  </li>
            <li>certain age&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li>I really like this cream.</li>
            <li>Strangers have stopped to tell her so, so this isn&#x27;t just an adoring daughter speaking.</li>
            <li>but thanks Amazon</li>
            <li>Very good!Very</li>
            <li>, I use it every other nite and love the results.  </li>
            <li>and I am a true believer in external nourishing your skin.</li>
            <li>My skins is very dry and this product is light while being very moisturizing and soothing.</li>
            <li>The quality has remained consistently high, and she has no intention of switching.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to go very far for the cost.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 61 and are alway taken for early 50&#x27;s......</li>
            <li>Even when you wake in the morning you can still feel how soft your face is.....</li>
            <li>On the downside, it has a lot of parabens which I&#x27;m sensitive to.</li>
            <li>For someone without a sensitivity to parabens, this may be the gift of the gods for soft, hydrated skin.</li>
            <li>Have used it for years and no other night cream provides the moisture that this does without being greasy</li>
            <li>, just not thrilled with the fact that I have to slather on two big fingers full of this to cover my face and part of my neck.</li>

            <li> This is a miracle cream for me.</li>

            <li> I was so upset when Elizabeth Arden Millenium products were taken off the market because I had used them since they were introduced. I have tried all the so-called replacements but nothing works for me like Millenium!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. Always delivers great results.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream. It is so moisturizing and forms a kind of barrier on your skin. My favorite night cream.</li>
            <li> This is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; night cream.  I&#x27;ve used it for years, absorbs within a few minutes and stays on all night.</li>

            <li> This is a wonderful rich cream. It gives the skin a rich feel.</li>
            <li> I wish Elizabeth Arden hadn&#x27;t taken this off the market.&lt;br /&gt;I love it. Always have, always will. Glad someone thought to stockpile it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my mother who uses this (together with the daytime emulsion).  She&#x27;s been using them for years, and has truly beautiful skin.  Strangers have stopped to tell her so, so this isn&#x27;t just an adoring daughter speaking.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  I have been using Elizabeth Arden moisturizer, eye cream and serum for the past 25 years.  I&#x27;m 61 and are alway taken for early 50&#x27;s......and, I don&#x27;t have any crows feet in t.he corners of my eyes.</li>
            <li> EA no longer produce this product but still available in the market don&#x27;t know why, left over inventor? Any way the product is good delivery is fast.</li>
            <li> This is a great night cream for ladies of &amp;#34;a certain age&amp;#34;...It&#x27;s wonderfully moisterizing and fragrant.  Even when you wake in the morning you can still feel how soft your face is.....</li>
            <li> This is the most wonderful night cream and I have used it for many many years and would not use anything else. It is a perfect night cream without being too heavy. This is the most important product for me in keeping my skin in good condition. Love it.</li>
            <li> This product is the very best for all women after 40, please don&#x27;t discontinue it. We used to buy it at the Base at Camp Pendleton, Oceanside California, but for a long time it&#x27;s not available anymore. We wish you peole would reconsider and put it back in the stores. Thank you, Anna</li>
            <li> Fabulous product - so sorry they are no longer producing it but thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> this cream was used by my mom and now I&#x27;m using it ! it is great and will continue to use it</li>
            <li> I have used Elizabeth Arden products since 1970. There is an outlet here in the Roanoke, Virginia area and I usually buy my products when there is a warehouse sale. However, I missed the last one and the price for this from Amazon was less than the wholesale/warehouse prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People cannot believe my age due to my skin&#x27;s appearance. I have taken care of my skin since age 25, when I read that is the time to start replenishing your skins&#x27; needs. I started with Charles of the Ritz and switched over to EA at my friends suggestion and I am a true believer in external nourishing your skin.</li>
            <li> Also being using this for years love it.</li>
            <li> this made my face puffy.. I looked like I had been crying all night. I was asked if I didn&#x27;t get any sleep.</li>
            <li> The consistency of this cream is wonderful. It leaves my skin feeling nourished in the morning. It does have a floral fragrance that I wasn&#x27;t expecting. I would pay $30+ for it, but they almost always carry this exact cream at TJMaxx for $16, so I would check there before paying more.</li>
            <li> My skins is very dry and this product is light while being very moisturizing and soothing. Great buy for the money.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  This cream is wonderful for moisturizing. On the downside, it has a lot of parabens which I&#x27;m sensitive to. I could only use it for a few days before my face started reacting to it.  If I had read the ingredients first, I wouldn&#x27;t have made that mistake.  For someone without a sensitivity to parabens, this may be the gift of the gods for soft, hydrated skin.</li>
            <li> It is  a great product, the skin looks fresh in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;The texture is light, not greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;Exactly what I need after a long day.</li>
            <li> I could not believe I found this on Amazon at half the price of department stores. This cream works!  It&#x27;s perfect for night use and you will notice a difference in your skin within 3 days. In the winter, I use it day and night!  I am always guessed to be 15 years younger than I am. I use their night cream and their foundation. We spend and we invest. This is an investment in your skin. When we look good, we do better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helpful! I love it! Very good!Very good!Very good!Very good!Very good!Very good!Very good!Very good!Very good!Very good!Very good!Very good!Very good!Very good!Very good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 68 year old healthy woman, that has a light olive skin, I&#x27;ve always used only  evo, oatmeal, rose hip oil and rose hip water on my face, But about a year ago I noticed my skin was loosing some of its glow, so I tried this, I use it every other nite and love the results.  really lovely product</li>
            <li> Terrific night dream - disappointed that Aarden is discontinuing this lotion.  Have used it for years and no other night cream provides the moisture that this does without being greasy</li>
            <li> Great product and good turn-around service from the seller!</li>
            <li> I purchase this product for friends as a gift.  They love it and become Elizabeth Arden users. It&#x27;s a great night cream for those wanting great looking skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to go very far for the cost. I do like the feel. The smell is..whatever. Doesn&#x27;t particularly strike me as good smelling but if it works, well then who cares right? Reminds me of oil of Olay (the smell, texture and consistency) and the finish is similar. So far it seems to be working great, just not thrilled with the fact that I have to slather on two big fingers full of this to cover my face and part of my neck. And that&#x27;s really working it in and spreading it around!!</li>
            <li> I will buy it again, when I run out, it seems to last a long time.  The price seemed fair .</li>
            <li> just love this so much...hope you keep it in stock cause I am 62 and use it every night...have for probably 20 years...everyone says I look younger than I am...</li>
            <li> I like it very much and will order it again if it is available. Thank you</li>
