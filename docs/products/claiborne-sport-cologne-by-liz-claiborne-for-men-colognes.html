            <li>So glad to have found this item.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure how I feel about it...</li>
            <li>As it stands it&#x27;s probably an okay smell for day to day.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for making good on this.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>I love the unique smell.</li>
            <li>give it a 4 for being office friendly, but don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s really outstanding and</li>
            <li>Scent is not to strong, and women have complimented me on the scent, so I would buy again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, fresh, clean and sporty!!</li>
            <li>Meant for someone that wants to come across as clean and smells really good.</li>
            <li>This cologne has a nice fresh clean man scent.</li>
            <li>A good Clean Fragrance at a reasonable price for every day use, and my wife likes it.</li>
            <li>Smells much better on my skin after a while than fresh from the bottle.</li>
            <li>Great Father&#x27;s Day present!  </li>
            <li>I wore this cologne on the bus one day and a lady came up to me and said you really smell really nice  and asked for the name of the cologne</li>
            <li>, I am known for the colognes I wear and this is up there on my list, enjoy</li>
            <li>Good, CLEAN, masculine scent!</li>
            <li>the scent is pretty mild and kind of a &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; scent...  </li>
            <li>If you love a clean fresh smell, then this is for you.</li>
            <li>But this is a strong sporty smell, I like the lighter sweet, but not too sweet smells.</li>
            <li>it was exactly what I was looking for and that itone of favorite cologne</li>
            <li>So it is worth what you pay for it!</li>
            <li>so got it for him, it is the ORIGINAL cologne.</li>
            <li>Pleasant, warm, a little sweet.  </li>
            <li>The bottle was larger than I expected and the price is incredible for this amazing fragrance.</li>
            <li>I am just going to start going to the stores and smelling the different colognes then going on here to get a good deal on it.</li>
            <li>Low price for a good smelling cologne, can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li>It does not smell too sweet and lasts all day for me.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming smell and it is very pleasing to smell.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>we received is quickly.  </li>
            <li>Smells great, but its not very strong.</li>
            <li>and I was concerned because it seemed a little strong, but he loved it.  </li>
            <li>:) I used so many branded perfume, I feel smell same great but no long lasting.</li>
            <li>Some colognes have their own specific smell and this is one of them.</li>
            <li>It is priced about right.</li>
            <li>This one has a nice crisp scent that remains subtly present all day.</li>
            <li>This was my first bottle of cologne, and I got a compliment on this scent the first day I wore it!</li>
            <li>Awesome,  so hard to find!!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t so strong that I can smell it from a distance, but I can smell it when I put my face near his.  </li>
            <li>It has a soft smell and is not too strong.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s an ok smell, nothing particular, also very generic, at least is very safe , more like sth you could wear going to the gym...</li>
            <li>My husband has been wearing Claiborne Sport for many years, it&#x27;s the only scent he will buy.</li>
            <li>I first caught wind of this scent 10 years ago.</li>
            <li>Thanks Liz!</li>
            <li>but this one is my personal favorite.</li>
            <li>Definitely will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>Smells great, doesn&#x27;t late scent.</li>
            <li>Moral booster for sure</li>
            <li>get the most compliments all these years later.</li>
            <li>FAST shipping too!  </li>
            <li>Try once you love it plus long lasting smell... :)</li>
            <li>Subtle scent, great for work or weekends.  </li>
            <li>It not only smells good, it last way longer then any I ever used.</li>
            <li>I will say it seems to be the real deal, not a fake knock off.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t be overpowering for an office setting, and also doesn&#x27;t have any strong spicy or woodsy notes that can give some people a headache (myself included often enough).  </li>
            <li>It has a very nutty, fruity smell.  </li>
            <li>so people that want to smell you have to be very close.</li>
            <li>I really like this cologne</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Guys not so much.</li>
            <li>Came early and was exactly what I hoped for.</li>
            <li>Liz Clairborne usually provide nice scented perfumes, so this did not require a referral from anyone, I just purchased based on the brand&#x27;s history.</li>
            <li>not enough words to describe women love the smell enough said</li>
            <li>Not only was I happy to find a cologne I used to wear but could no longer find in stores, I found it for a reasonable price and received it in only a few days.</li>
            <li>I have been using this cologne since high school, over 10 years now.</li>
            <li>Classic fresh scent, if you want to smell different then please wear this...</li>
            <li>I received my order fairly quick &amp; the product was exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised how much I like it</li>
            <li>It is nice smelling but not amazing.</li>
            <li>Since I am playing college football I thought I should get a sporty smell to live up to what I do.</li>
            <li>I usually wear Acqua Di Gio (I am in love with this one)....</li>
            <li>I used to wear this cologne back when it first came out.</li>
            <li>People will ask you about it , it does get positive feed back.</li>
            <li>He had an old one that had maybe 2 drops in it</li>
            <li>Works well with my natural smell.</li>
            <li>Original fragance,also received a small tube tester and a coupon discount for my next purchase, fast shipping, I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>The perfume smells great the first hour, but eventually turns to a really feminine fragrance which I personally hated!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t worn it out yet, so don&#x27;t really have any other people&#x27;s opinions to go by just yet.  </li>
            <li>Very manly and only a little dab is necessary...</li>

            <li> it was exactly what I was looking for and that itone of favorite cologne</li>
            <li> So it is worth what you pay for it!</li>
            <li> so got it for him, it is the ORIGINAL cologne.</li>
            <li> Pleasant, warm, a little sweet.  </li>
            <li> The bottle was larger than I expected and the price is incredible for this amazing fragrance.</li>
            <li> I am just going to start going to the stores and smelling the different colognes then going on here to get a good deal on it.</li>
            <li> Low price for a good smelling cologne, can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> It does not smell too sweet and lasts all day for me.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming smell and it is very pleasing to smell.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> we received is quickly.  </li>
            <li> Smells great, but its not very strong.</li>
            <li> and I was concerned because it seemed a little strong, but he loved it.  </li>
            <li> :) I used so many branded perfume, I feel smell same great but no long lasting.</li>
            <li> Some colognes have their own specific smell and this is one of them.</li>
            <li> It is priced about right.</li>
            <li> This one has a nice crisp scent that remains subtly present all day.</li>
            <li> This was my first bottle of cologne, and I got a compliment on this scent the first day I wore it!</li>
            <li> Awesome,  so hard to find!!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t so strong that I can smell it from a distance, but I can smell it when I put my face near his.  </li>
            <li> It has a soft smell and is not too strong.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an ok smell, nothing particular, also very generic, at least is very safe , more like sth you could wear going to the gym...</li>
            <li> My husband has been wearing Claiborne Sport for many years, it&#x27;s the only scent he will buy.</li>
            <li> I first caught wind of this scent 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> Thanks Liz!</li>
            <li> but this one is my personal favorite.</li>
            <li> Definitely will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> Smells great, doesn&#x27;t late scent.</li>

            <li> FAST shipping too!  </li>
            <li> Try once you love it plus long lasting smell... :)</li>
            <li> Subtle scent, great for work or weekends.  </li>
            <li> It not only smells good, it last way longer then any I ever used.</li>
            <li> I will say it seems to be the real deal, not a fake knock off.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t be overpowering for an office setting, and also doesn&#x27;t have any strong spicy or woodsy notes that can give some people a headache (myself included often enough).  </li>
            <li> It has a very nutty, fruity smell.  </li>
            <li> so people that want to smell you have to be very close.</li>
            <li> I really like this cologne</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Guys not so much.</li>
            <li> Came early and was exactly what I hoped for.</li>
            <li> Liz Clairborne usually provide nice scented perfumes, so this did not require a referral from anyone, I just purchased based on the brand&#x27;s history.</li>
            <li> not enough words to describe women love the smell enough said</li>
            <li> Not only was I happy to find a cologne I used to wear but could no longer find in stores, I found it for a reasonable price and received it in only a few days.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cologne since high school, over 10 years now.</li>
            <li> Classic fresh scent, if you want to smell different then please wear this...</li>
            <li> I received my order fairly quick &amp; the product was exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised how much I like it</li>
            <li> It is nice smelling but not amazing.</li>
            <li> Since I am playing college football I thought I should get a sporty smell to live up to what I do.</li>
            <li> I usually wear Acqua Di Gio (I am in love with this one)....</li>
            <li> I used to wear this cologne back when it first came out.</li>
            <li> People will ask you about it , it does get positive feed back.</li>
            <li> He had an old one that had maybe 2 drops in it</li>
            <li> Works well with my natural smell.</li>
            <li> Original fragance,also received a small tube tester and a coupon discount for my next purchase, fast shipping, I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> The perfume smells great the first hour, but eventually turns to a really feminine fragrance which I personally hated!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t worn it out yet, so don&#x27;t really have any other people&#x27;s opinions to go by just yet.  </li>
            <li> Very manly and only a little dab is necessary...</li>
            <li> not sure how much I like it myself.  </li>
            <li> Smell great,and last all day long.</li>
            <li> The bottle was much bigger than I expected it to be.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also being a little unfair giving it 3 stars instead of 5, only because I feel it was a little over-hyped, with most of the reviews being from people with almost no description who have only given 5 star</li>
            <li> Kind of disappointed.</li>
            <li> Half of what I have traditionally paid @</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a subtle and not overpowering cologne.</li>
            <li> I bought this over a year ago and my husband uses it everyday, he still has some left.</li>
            <li> get tired of wearing cologne that everyone is wearing, this is an eccentric cologne.</li>
            <li> A little small.</li>
            <li> we had been unable to purchase it at local stores.  </li>
            <li> I like this small size for traveling because it meets the FAA liquid travel restrictions.</li>
            <li> hardly, spray twice for daytime use during work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a lot of expensive fragrances</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> if it discontinues anytime soon...i would seriously be hurt!!!!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> LOVE this colgne!!! IT&#x27;s the cheapest online rather than some retailers that sale it.</li>
            <li> Classic fresh scent, if you want to smell different then please wear this...&lt;br /&gt;I get tired of wearing cologne that everyone is wearing, this is an eccentric cologne. Meant for someone that wants to come across as clean and smells really good.</li>
            <li> I love the way this cologne smell on my husband and my sons.  When my sons  wear the cologne they often get asked what are they wearing and they say Liz Claiborne Sport.  I am glad that I was able to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Awesome,  so hard to find!!</li>
            <li> now if theres one thing a woman loves....its a papi who smells of masculinity and euphoria, this is the cologne that puts all others aside....i spray this on my clothes before i go out...after i detail my car....i spray it inside my ride...and when the scent hits the sences of the woman i just picked up...everything goes according to plan...and nothing ever falls through....been sporting this cologne since i was 15....if it discontinues anytime soon...i would seriously be hurt!!!!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cologne and the stores don&#x27;t carry it anymore. Love that we can still get it online at amazon.</li>

            <li> I first caught wind of this scent 10 years ago. In my opinion, it is a better \\&quot;sport\\&quot; cologne than POLO Sport.</li>
            <li> It has a very nutty, fruity smell.  I like it, and it fades just enough so people that want to smell you have to be very close.</li>
            <li> Bought this because the reviews were very good.  I was pleasantly surprised how much I like it and I would recommend it.</li>

            <li> My all time favorite men&#x27;s cologne</li>
            <li> I used this cologne before, so I already knew what to expect. After 10 years it is still a very nice, sport, unique and discrete fragance. The price was great so I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Not only was I happy to find a cologne I used to wear but could no longer find in stores, I found it for a reasonable price and received it in only a few days.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price. I use this one daily so my fancy ones dont run out. It is priced about right.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!!!! Great jobs from these peeps</li>
            <li> This is the one for men to get if you don&#x27;t want that overpowering smell. I have had more compliments on the great odor of this cologne.</li>

I remember name of this perfume and seen on Amazon.. :) I used so many branded perfume, I feel smell same great but no long lasting. This perfume stays just 3hours to 4hours hardly, spray twice for daytime use during work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am cocktail claiborne sport perfume with Halston Z-14 by Halston for Men, Cologne Spray, 4.2 Ounce.. Try once you love it plus long lasting smell... :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-HP</li>
            <li> Ya know, I went out on a limb and made 3 fragrance purchases online. Each of the 3 products were very good values. Half of what I have traditionally paid @ department stores. This one has a nice crisp scent that remains subtly present all day. I really like it. Thanks Liz!</li>
            <li> for men... he gets a lot of compliments on the cologne when he wears it - great smell - great price - not over-popular</li>
            <li> Smell great,and last all day long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read about this cologne saying how amazing it is. I decided to trust what everyone was saying and bought it. It is nice smelling but not amazing. I usually wear Acqua Di Gio (I am in love with this one).... Now that is an amazing smell. But this is a strong sporty smell, I like the lighter sweet, but not too sweet smells. Since I am playing college football I thought I should get a sporty smell to live up to what I do. It only last for an hour or two as well. I am just going to start going to the stores and smelling the different colognes then going on here to get a good deal on it.</li>
            <li> Low price for a good smelling cologne, can&#x27;t beat that. Scent is not to strong, and women have complimented me on the scent, so I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Original fragance,also received a small tube tester and a coupon discount for my next purchase, fast shipping, I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my dad for Christmas and I was concerned because it seemed a little strong, but he loved it.  Must use sparingly.</li>
            <li> My husband has worn this cologne for 10 years and I absolutely love it.  It isn&#x27;t so strong that I can smell it from a distance, but I can smell it when I put my face near his.  It was difficult to find, but I am glad I finally did.  I hope he wears it forever.</li>
            <li> Ordered by someone else.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite cologne. Shipping was quick and the price was fair.</li>
            <li> This product has a good scent.  Quick delivery at a good price.</li>
            <li> Have tried various colognes over the years.  This is the one that people spontaneously compliment.  My teenage son likes it, too, for the same reason.  Pleasant, warm, a little sweet.  Have repeatedly ordered this now.</li>
            <li> Subtle scent, great for work or weekends.  I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a subtle and not overpowering cologne.</li>
            <li> Got here when it said it would. Smells great, but its not very strong. I will say it seems to be the real deal, not a fake knock off.</li>
            <li> I love this. It&#x27;s light, fresh, clean and sporty!!</li>
            <li> This cologne has a nice fresh clean man scent. The ladies seem to love it too.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my son he really loved the scent and said that it was not too overpowering but a clean refreshing scent</li>
            <li> my hubby wore this loooooooooooong time ago.  we had been unable to purchase it at local stores.  so i decided to buy it on line.  we received is quickly.  Love this cologne on my hubby.  Brings back memories just smelling it.</li>
            <li> This cologne is good for 24/7.  During the day and at night.  Very manly and only a little dab is necessary...</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful!!!!!!!!! I love this as part of my cologne collection. I have a lot of expensive fragrances but this one is my personal favorite. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cologne since high school, over 10 years now. I always get complimented on the smell and people always ask me what I am wearing! I have been stopped many times over the years and asked what cologne I have on. I have purchased many expensive colognes over the years but I always go back to Claiborne Sport. It does not smell too sweet and lasts all day for me. My girlfriend loves it!</li>
            <li> My hubby loves this cologne. It doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming smell and it is very pleasing to smell. Definitely will be purchasing more. I bought this over a year ago and my husband uses it everyday, he still has some left. So it is worth what you pay for it!</li>
            <li> A little small. Fits to your skin.  Fabric is nice.</li>
            <li> My husband has a collection of colognes but this one somehow is his favorite.  He had an old one that had maybe 2 drops in it and as I was going to toss it out he looked at me as if I was going nuts - he was saving it for a &amp;#34;special occasion&amp;#34; as he can no longer find it.  I found it on amazon at a GREAT price so got it for him, it is the ORIGINAL cologne. Smells GREAT!</li>
            <li> Best ever... Smooth throught the day smell that make plp wonder what it is..?!</li>
            <li> Excellent price- excellent product!  Have been looking for this fragrance for a couple of years since I received it as a gift; can not find it anymore in local department or retail stores.  Good, CLEAN, masculine scent!</li>
            <li> Smells great, doesn&#x27;t late scent.</li>
            <li> Definitely one of my go to&#x27;s when ordering.  I have been extremely happy with the simplicity of order item and receiving it with ease.</li>
            <li> This was just what I wanted!! The bottle was much bigger than I expected it to be.  I am very happy with this purchase!!!</li>
            <li> A good Clean Fragrance at a reasonable price for every day use, and my wife likes it. What more can you ask!</li>
            <li> The scent is very strong. The scent doesn&#x27;t last all day. It doesn&#x27;t smell the same as the product sold in the retail stores. Kind of disappointed. I saved money but get the same scent.</li>
            <li> Chicks love it!! Your gf does too!!</li>
            <li> Came early and was exactly what I hoped for. Great Father&#x27;s Day present!  The packaging is nice and the smell is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I wore this cologne on the bus one day and a lady came up to me and said you really smell really nice  and asked for the name of the cologne and she said she will buy it for her husband, I am known for the colognes I wear and this is up there on my list, enjoy</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for christmas.  One of our mutual friends always wears this cologne, and he always smells so good.  So I bought it for my boyfriend...if he thought I was all over him before...I guess he&#x27;s got another thing coming.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Great wonderful past all of my expectations not enough words to describe women love the smell enough said</li>
            <li> I love this cologne and have for many years but the stores don&#x27;t carry it anymore.  It has a soft smell and is not too strong.</li>
            <li> Very good product.  Packaging was intact. Enjoying my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love how it smells and So does every girl I dance with our give a hug to. Moral booster for sure</li>
            <li> I received my order fairly quick &amp; the product was exactly what I expected! Would definitely recommend this. Smells awesome!! My wife loves the smell of this!</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling mens cologne. I get a ton of complements when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Liz Clairborne usually provide nice scented perfumes, so this did not require a referral from anyone, I just purchased based on the brand&#x27;s history. I purchased it for my boyfriend and he loved it.</li>
            <li> The bottle was larger than I expected and the price is incredible for this amazing fragrance. I have been complimented numerous times on this scent.</li>
            <li> Love this scent, great value. I remember paying like $65 at maceys back in the day. Got this for about 20 bux</li>
            <li> This is the one of the  best colognes for me. Works well with my natural smell. Women love it. Guys not so much. pI can&#x27;t blame them, it smells phenomenal on him. Great price as well!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an ok smell, nothing particular, also very generic, at least is very safe , more like sth you could wear going to the gym...</li>
            <li> We love this cologne my nephew has been using it for years.  We would recommend it to men who like to smell very good</li>
            <li> I been using this cologne for many years. It not only smells good, it last way longer then any I ever used. People will ask you about it , it does get positive feed back.</li>
            <li> excelent, everything was as advertised.</li>
            <li> This cologne is very light, refreshing and great compliments received when I wear this fragrance.  I like this small size for traveling because it meets the FAA liquid travel restrictions.</li>
            <li> Excellent, nice perfume...</li>
            <li> Very happy with the cologne</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for making good on this.&lt;br /&gt;Love this cologne. I have over 20 colognes, from Giorgio Armani, Calvin Klein, Clinique, Marc Ecko, pack rabbanne, polo, and this remains my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;I get the most compliments all these years later.</li>
            <li> Please men, do yourself a favor, and do not go on to buying this fragrance. I had got it trusting the reviews, but it turned out to be one of the most stupidest thing I have done. The perfume smells great the first hour, but eventually turns to a really feminine fragrance which I personally hated!</li>
            <li> So glad to have found this item.  Bought it as a gift for someone and they LOVE it!  FAST shipping too!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I used to wear this cologne back when it first came out. I love the unique smell. Some colognes have their own specific smell and this is one of them. If you love a clean fresh smell, then this is for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure how I feel about it... the scent is pretty mild and kind of a &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; scent...  I haven&#x27;t worn it out yet, so don&#x27;t really have any other people&#x27;s opinions to go by just yet.  As it stands it&#x27;s probably an okay smell for day to day.  It won&#x27;t be overpowering for an office setting, and also doesn&#x27;t have any strong spicy or woodsy notes that can give some people a headache (myself included often enough).  I&#x27;m also being a little unfair giving it 3 stars instead of 5, only because I feel it was a little over-hyped, with most of the reviews being from people with almost no description who have only given 5 star reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give it a 4 for being office friendly, but don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s really outstanding and not sure how much I like it myself.  If I&#x27;m wearing it out and get a lot of complements, I&#x27;ll adjust my review accordingly.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Best smelling mens cologne ever! Stays on you for a good amount of time and is not overbearing or too stout! Ladies seem to like it so I will not complain!</li>
            <li> This was my first bottle of cologne, and I got a compliment on this scent the first day I wore it!</li>
