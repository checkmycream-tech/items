            <li>Oh and came very quickly!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had it a week, it does smell wonderful but for some reason my skin is not doing too good with it,and I&#x27;ve seen people say that it&#x27;s good for your hair, not for a Caucasian it makes your hair very greasy.</li>

            <li>Best oil for your skin especially in the winter.  </li>
            <li>Best coconut oil for tanning, hair therapy, skin, moisturizer, lotion and everything body related!</li>
            <li>It is great to moisturize skin while still wet at the end of a shower, or to use as a tanning oil, or a dab rubbed into the ends of my hair gives a great suttle shine and texture.</li>
            <li>This oil is my favorite of all the coconut oils.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>Love the oil...</li>

            <li>I know many use this for tanning, but I have found it to be fabulous as a moisturizing body oil.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Has a great scent, makes your skin so soft,</li>
            <li>Only been using a month and everyone compliments me on my beautiful tan.</li>
            <li>Hawaiian Beachcomber Budds coconut oil works great in hot dry Arizona,and smells really good to.</li>
            <li>Super replenishing!</li>
            <li>The scent is lovely and mild, definately coconut scented but it does not linger, I wish it did.  </li>
            <li>best tanning oil HANDS DOWN!</li>
            <li>Smeels fantastic and leaves skin feeling so smooth</li>
            <li>Use it at the beach, on my hair for deep conditioning, smells great and convenient squeeze bottle.</li>
            <li>Beachcomber Budd&#x27;s Cocoanut Oil smells like rich, tropical cocoanut.  </li>
            <li>I love the smoothness and the non-oily feeling of pure coconut oil when I make them...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light, absorbs quickly and has a light, natural coconut scent.</li>

            <li>I love that classic coconut scent.</li>
            <li>but it makes for a good lotion on dry winter skin as well.</li>
            <li>so it keeps my hair and skin very soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>I make a lot of my own cosmetics... especially lotions and creams.</li>
            <li>And right after that I look for it online, found it here</li>
            <li>It is the exact same kind I purchased in Hawaii it didn&#x27;t make my skin burn.</li>
            <li>The best tanning lotion for a deep dark tan..</li>
            <li>Fell in love with this last year in Hawaii.</li>
            <li>I love this product and wish it was sold locally.</li>
            <li>I have to run it under hot water to get it to liquify</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced and packaged well!</li>
            <li>I use it all year long and mostly on my hair</li>
            <li>fast ship, just as described</li>
            <li>Well packaged,,,,, very well, not a drop leaked.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It is more than I expected.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t want to get oil all over the floor</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I actually used my regular coconut lotion over this oil just because I love to be wrapped in coconut all day, but the oil definately made a huge difference in my skin that my regular lotion doesn&#x27;t do.  </li>
            <li>Amazing as a skin softener and the smell is pure coconut - not the fake, overly sweet coconut smell some brands try to pass off as the real thing.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it to anyone concerned about their skin elasticity.  </li>
            <li>This product is a good stand alone tanning oil that provides deep dark tanned skin in a short period of time.</li>
            <li>i LIVE THIS STUFF.  </li>
            <li>I usually boost the coconut scent with a coconut perfume oil.... and the sexy smell makes you feel yummy all day.</li>
            <li>me think of the beach/Hawaii/the tropics even when I&#x27;m far from it.</li>
            <li>I started using this coconut oil and eczema has completely resolved.</li>
            <li>My 8 year old got wind chap</li>
            <li>I have really long curly hair that gets really frizzy</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and got rid of red areas!!  </li>
            <li>A little vanilla, would prefer more of a coconut smell but none the less it is a product that I would purchase again.</li>

            <li> My skin is so soft and got rid of red areas!!  </li>
            <li> A little vanilla, would prefer more of a coconut smell but none the less it is a product that I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> In the summer it&#x27;s usually already melted and ready for use.</li>
            <li> Ive tried other scented coconut oils as opposed to natural edible versions to remind me of the beaches of Hawaii.. and this truly has the closest scent to me.&lt;br /&gt;Hydrating and just a little bit mixed with water after a shower.</li>
            <li> I used it on my problem areas: feet (dry heels and toes),</li>
            <li> It does wonders for dry skin.</li>
            <li> It also helped those little bumps on the back of my arms to go away.</li>
            <li> I buy this oil every summer and it has helped my skin maintain a tan longer than any other oil or brand</li>
            <li> I have extreme eczema on my hands for two years now.</li>
            <li> but I buy it at other online sites for $5-8.00 and the shipping doesn&#x27;t even come up to $13.00!</li>
            <li> I have used previously.  </li>
            <li> My wife loves this product and uses everyday.</li>
            <li> The only thing that is wrong with it is that my skin burns when I use it.</li>
            <li> It turns solid in cold temperatures so in the winter, I just bring into the shower with me so it can melt or</li>
            <li> It changes from a thick lotion to an oil depending on the temperature.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and was quite skeptical.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry if you buy it, too!</li>
            <li> This oil is very weird.</li>
            <li> I would give this 5 stars except that I hate that it solidifies at about 70 degrees.</li>

            <li> Love this product.  It smells so good.  A little vanilla, would prefer more of a coconut smell but none the less it is a product that I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I so underestimated this product.  I read the reviews and was quite skeptical.  I ordered simply on good faith and I just love coconut scents.  When it arrived, the oil was hardened, as coconut oil tends to do, and while it took a bit of effort to get it out of the bottle, once softened in my hands I used it on my problem areas: feet (dry heels and toes), backs of upper arms, and bikini area.  I am amazed at how awesome this product is!!  I have used countless creams to get these areas to soften and get rid of pimply/rash type issues.  I love this stuff!!  I used it all over as well.  My skin is so soft and got rid of red areas!!  The scent is lovely and mild, definately coconut scented but it does not linger, I wish it did.  I actually used my regular coconut lotion over this oil just because I love to be wrapped in coconut all day, but the oil definately made a huge difference in my skin that my regular lotion doesn&#x27;t do.  I plan to use this lotion all the time.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I had seen this oil on someone&#x27;s bathroom. And right after that I look for it online, found it here&lt;br /&gt;  Smeels fantastic and leaves skin feeling so smooth&lt;br /&gt;Little pricy but whorth the money&lt;br /&gt; Very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> This product is a good stand alone tanning oil that provides deep dark tanned skin in a short period of time.</li>
            <li> I tried this while vacationing in Kauai.  I have had to order more ever since because I love it and the smell reminds me of Kauai.  THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> RAN ACROSS THIS ON A TRIP TO THE ISLANDS.  i LIVE THIS STUFF.  FINALLY FOUND IT HERE. YOU CAN USE IT IN UR HAIR AS WELL.  GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff to get brown quickly - just use your sunscreen first!</li>
            <li> Beachcomber Budd&#x27;s Cocoanut Oil smells like rich, tropical cocoanut.  It is more than I expected. I love this product and wish it was sold locally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this a one star because I have broke out both times I sat out in the Sun with this coconut oil.I&#x27;ve only had it a week, it does smell wonderful but for some reason my skin is not doing too good with it,and I&#x27;ve seen people say that it&#x27;s good for your hair, not for a Caucasian it makes your hair very greasy.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product and uses everyday. Would recommend this to anyone.  Great for tanning and smooth skin also.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I use it all year long and mostly on my hair but I buy it at other online sites for $5-8.00 and the shipping doesn&#x27;t even come up to $13.00! I have really long curly hair that gets really frizzy and I spend a lot of time at the beach so it keeps my hair and skin very soft and smooth! I just love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This oil is very weird. It&#x27;s in solid form. But I like that its like that. I really don&#x27;t want to get oil all over the floor so this is great. I popped in the microwave for about 30 seconds and I was perfect to put on before the tanning bed. And it does not get all over the floor. This is awesome For that and the smell is not bad at all. They say you can use this on your hair but I can&#x27;t do the greesy look. For a oil this is going to be it for me on sold!</li>
            <li> Fell in love with this stuff when I went to Hawaii and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. It turns solid in cold temperatures so in the winter, I just bring into the shower with me so it can melt or I leave it in the sink soaking in warm water. When I get out, it&#x27;s melted enough. In the summer it&#x27;s usually already melted and ready for use. Love it. Skin is soft and smooth plus it smells awesome and reminds me of the beach.</li>
            <li> I would give this 5 stars except that I hate that it solidifies at about 70 degrees. I have to run it under hot water to get it to liquify so I can use it as a tanning lotion. It does give you a stunning tan and very quickly. Keeps the skin well oiled but is greasy so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for a body lotion.</li>
            <li> This product is by far the best moisturizer I have ever used! It does wonders for dry skin. It also helped those little bumps on the back of my arms to go away. Great for hair also. Smells fantastic! I would highly recommend this product! Wish it came in larger quantity.</li>
            <li> I know many use this for tanning, but I have found it to be fabulous as a moisturizing body oil. It&#x27;s very light, absorbs quickly and has a light, natural coconut scent. My skin has never felt softer!</li>
            <li> love the scent of this and its supple, wonderful... great for just out of the shower moisturizer not only a tanning oil!</li>
            <li> &#x27;Love the fragrance. It&#x27;s not the &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; smell.&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;Makes me think of the beach/Hawaii/the tropics even when I&#x27;m far from it.</li>
            <li> Best oil for your skin especially in the winter.  Soaks in quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy. Learned about this in Hawaii and you can see why they&#x27;re skin looks good</li>
            <li> I make a lot of my own cosmetics... especially lotions and creams. I love the smoothness and the non-oily feeling of pure coconut oil when I make them... I usually boost the coconut scent with a coconut perfume oil.... and the sexy smell makes you feel yummy all day.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve wondered  how to use oil in the sun without burning your wonderment will  be satisfied when you use this! It changes from a thick lotion to an oil depending on the temperature. Not only can you use it for tanning but it makes for a good lotion on dry winter skin as well. You almost want to taste it but I wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Hawaiian Beachcomber Budds coconut oil works great in hot dry Arizona,and smells really good to.I would recommend this seller and product to everyone.</li>
            <li> Best coconut oil for tanning, hair therapy, skin, moisturizer, lotion and everything body related! smells like coconut yum</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this stuff while vacationing on Oahu! I was thrilled to get it at home as well. It is great to moisturize skin while still wet at the end of a shower, or to use as a tanning oil, or a dab rubbed into the ends of my hair gives a great suttle shine and texture. When I run out I will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> It works as advertised</li>
            <li> This oil is my favorite of all the coconut oils. I love that classic coconut scent. I use it daily as a moisturizer in my hair and on my skin. Love the product. The seller is fast and product arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best, the package even came with a nice note from the shipper. Will definitely be  ordering again!</li>
            <li> The oil dries without greasiness, smells amazing, moisturizes my skin...</li>
            <li> Love the oil... But it smells more like bananas then coconuts.</li>
            <li> I buy this oil every summer and it has helped my skin maintain a tan longer than any other oil or brand I have used previously.  It is awesome and smells great too!!  LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!</li>
            <li> Love this Coconut Oil.</li>
            <li> I have extreme eczema on my hands for two years now. I started using this coconut oil and eczema has completely resolved. The seller sent me a hand written note thanking me for my purchase.  If I could get to Hawaii I would look them up. What a blessing and truly wonderful experience with this seller.</li>
            <li> Worked just the way it is supposed to. Only been using a month and everyone compliments me on my beautiful tan.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Use it at the beach, on my hair for deep conditioning, smells great and convenient squeeze bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this product! So glad I was able to find it on line! Reasonably priced and packaged well!</li>
            <li> I love this coconut oil.  The best tanning lotion for a deep dark tan..&lt;br /&gt;Has a great scent, makes your skin so soft,</li>
            <li> Award winning product.  Highly recommend it to anyone concerned about their skin elasticity.  Repeat customer for sure!!!  I wish there were a way to improve the viscosity of the product...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best Regards,&lt;br /&gt;Kevin (Reno, NV)</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!!! Amazing as a skin softener and the smell is pure coconut - not the fake, overly sweet coconut smell some brands try to pass off as the real thing. I actually like that the product is usually a solid in the bottle.  I find it is easier to get out that way and it melts within seconds into my hand for applying on my skin. My bottle is almost gone and you can bet I&#x27;ll be buying lots more of this great product.  You won&#x27;t be sorry if you buy it, too!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Put bottle i. Shower with you.  When done showering use oil on your skin.  Great coconut smell!  Also comes in unscented.</li>
            <li> I love it, great feel and awesome smell. My 8 year old got wind chap and she loved it too, no sting like lots of lotion and without knowing the scent said &amp;#34;mmm I love coconut&amp;#34; we are both happy customers. Oh and came very quickly!</li>
