            <li> I plan to repurchase and try other products from The Naked Bee.</li>
            <li> so I can use it whenever my hands feel dry - which can be often during the winter months despite the fact that we have lots of rain around here.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried one body wash after another because I have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> This tube will last quite awhile since I only need to use about half as much as other body washes.</li>
            <li> I suffer from allergies and always have to be careful of fragrances, this one agrees with me.</li>
            <li> Besides the fact that its free of all the bad ingredients this is</li>
            <li> I have used a few Naked Bee products for the past couple of years.</li>
            <li> just a little amount...</li>
            <li> The scent of this is unbelievable and a little bit gives a lot of suds.</li>
            <li> Not a big fan of that smell - and too expensive for what it is.</li>
            <li> Not really moisturizing and expensive for body wash.</li>
            <li> thick</li>
            <li> Needless to say as soon as I got home</li>

            <li> Smells heavenly- not perfumey!</li>
            <li> I was looking for something with a cleaner Orange Blosson scent. Not a big fan of that smell - and too expensive for what it is.</li>
            <li> The scent of this is unbelievable and a little bit gives a lot of suds. This tube will last quite awhile since I only need to use about half as much as other body washes. The scent is sweet and not over-powering.</li>
            <li> this stuff smells like old car. I dont know why the label says \\&quot;Orange Blossom Honey\\&quot; as both the bodywash &amp; the shampoo/conditioner stink like old leather. Im getting a refund.</li>
            <li> I have problems with &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; soaps and was excited to see this. I love it. My skin is so soft and the smell is attractive and not overpowering. I am so glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is quite lovely - luxurious, a delightfully fresh scent. I brought it with me on vacation and now every time I use it I am reminded of that lovely time.</li>
            <li> One of the best smelling body wash soaps ever purchased. Highly recommend to others. Great way to start the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GG</li>
            <li> I love Naked Bee products. This is a very good body wash. The smell is heavenly!!!&lt;br /&gt;A truly wonderful bath product.</li>
            <li> Smells soooo good!  It is very moisturizing.  I love the way my skin feels after showering with this.  I will definitely keep buying this.  I wish that it was available in my local stores.</li>
            <li> I order this product a lot &amp; love it but this tube was not full,didn&#x27;t have a seal on it &amp; you could see where it had leaked out onto the outside of the tube.</li>
            <li> I love it! Purchased it originally on vacation in Florida.  Was thrilled to be able to find it on your webisite and have it delivered to my door.&lt;br /&gt;Love the smell!  Also, purchased it for a friend.</li>
            <li> Great scent! And leaves you silky soft, not dried out like some of the regular brands that you can pick up at target or wal-mart.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t order this again because the tangy, sour-honey smell reminds me of something like medicine, so I can&#x27;t stand to have it on. It&#x27;s nice and creamy, but the smell is too much.</li>
            <li> I love everything about The Naked Bee products.  I use the body wash, lotion, sunscreen as well as the hand lotion.  Love this product!!</li>
            <li> I found this product at a museum.  Samples were available and I smelled it and fell in love with one whiff. I love the orange blossom scent.  It reminds me of spring/summer in the park.  It leaves behind the pleasant scent of orange blossoms.  It is not over powering. It leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Great scent; great product. I&#x27;ve been ordering this body wash for years. I only wish it created more lather and that the clean scent stuck with you. I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
            <li> This Naked Bee Orange Blossom Honey Body Wash is Awesome ! Besides the fact that its free of all the bad ingredients this is 70% certified Organic,Hypoallergenic,Paraben free,Gluten free,No Dyes or pigments Etc,This stuff has an awesome light scent that I especially like first thing when I wake up.Leaves my skin so soft and hydrated.Every one in my family likes this.</li>
            <li> Love orange blossom body wash.  Does not irritate my skin &amp; smells great.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based upon the reviews I read about it and love it.  I am someone who hates lauryl sulfate and so I search for body washes that have none.  Some are good, some are great and this one is great.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I wanted I wanted the hand and Body Lotion</li>
            <li> Love this! Bought it recently for the first time as a warehouse deal and it is great! It smells amazing and produces great lather. I plan to repurchase and try other products from The Naked Bee. And you really get a lot of product for the very reasonable price!</li>
            <li> Great fragrance, nice and sudsy.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. Comes out of the tube&lt;br /&gt;very thick so it doesn&#x27;t take but just a little amount...&lt;br /&gt;unlike many of the &amp;#34;gels&amp;#34;. Suds up great and does a&lt;br /&gt;great job moisturizing the skin. Has a very nice&lt;br /&gt;and light honey/orange fragrance. All in all....very&lt;br /&gt;satisfied with this product and will be buying more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to pretty much every shampoo and body wash, but when I tried this product my problems are gone! I absolutely love the smell and how clean it leaves me! Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Love the scent of this lotion!  I layer it with Jo Malone Orange Blossom!  So fresh, so original.  Love it!</li>
            <li> A friend of mine had this lotion and let me try it, OMG...the smell is awesome, soft &amp; clean not overpowering at all.  The lotion is not greasy, goes on nice and obsorbs into the skin, last through a few hand washes too.  Needless to say as soon as I got home I had to order some for me.  I can&#x27;t tell you how many compliments I received on the smell.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  Makes me happy.  Smells good, moisturizing, silky.  The Naked Bee Products are a new favorite.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I have become hooked on the lotion so I thought that the body wash would be as good - and it is.  It is very rich - you don&#x27;t need much to get a silky feeling on your skin, and the fresh smell of orange blossom and honey feels real clean!</li>
            <li> I love these products as they not only smell fresh, but leave your body feeling smooth and fresh and smelling good!</li>
            <li> I have used a few Naked Bee products for the past couple of years. I love the products and the company. I recently discovered this body wash, and no surprise, I love it as well. Great scent, light and fresh. I will definitely continue to use it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I enjoy that this product is natural, and very resonably priced.  Might I add the fragrance is very clean and not overpowering.  I suffer from allergies and always have to be careful of fragrances, this one agrees with me.</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent. I use this daily. Leaves skin silky smooth</li>
            <li> GREAT BODY WASH SMELLS TERRIFIC..</li>
            <li> Smells great and has recognizable ingredients! Shipped fast and cleans/mosturizes great! Will order more in the future!</li>
            <li> I live in New Mexico where the need to moisturize your skin is a daily necessity. I love this body wash! Refreshing fragrance.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering again.arrived on time and is a great product.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance of this product, and it soaps and cleanses well too.  All of the Naked Bee products I have tried are excellent.</li>
            <li> My daughter turned me on to this lotion and I absolutely love it.  I have it sitting on my desk at home so I can use it whenever my hands feel dry - which can be often during the winter months despite the fact that we have lots of rain around here.  It smells lovely and is not greasy feeling after putting it on.  I recommend the product.  In fact, just bought my daughter another supply for Christmas.</li>
            <li> What I like best about this gel is that is makes my skin feel soft and moisturized after the shower. The scent is light and uplifting. There is a nice amount of lather. Plus it&#x27;s gluten free, paraben free and no fake fragrances! Do something nice for yourself and try this!</li>
            <li> Great product great brand. This is just such an indulging product and feels so great on your skin!</li>
            <li> Great product got it on time great provider.ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of their products!  Love the fragrance, and it lathers very well.  Don&#x27;t have to use a huge amount at a time, either. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love everything I have tried from this company.  I am a big citrus fan and this stuff (especially the lotion!) smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Not really moisturizing and expensive for body wash.</li>
            <li> Love all the Naked Bee products  -</li>
            <li> I love the light, beautiful scent of this product.  I use it along with the matching lotion and just love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried one body wash after another because I have dry skin.  The Naked Bee left my skin clean and soft and it also smells great!  I was very pleased.</li>
