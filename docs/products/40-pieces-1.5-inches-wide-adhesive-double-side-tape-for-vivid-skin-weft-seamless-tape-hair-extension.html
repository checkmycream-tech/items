    <ol>
            <li>This tape works the best</li>
            <li>This adheres great to the hair extensions and to your own hair.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, I&#x27;ve ordered two and will continue to be a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>I would recommend them to anyone wanting to put in their own hair extensions.</li>
            <li>I have been doing my own extensions for two years now.</li>
            <li>This tape was very easy to work with and held well.</li>
            <li>If you use seamless extensions, this tape is great!!</li>
            <li>This tape is very good quality, I have used it to retape two different types of seamless extensions and worked great on both!</li>
            <li>I think it worked way better than the tape that was already on them.</li>
            <li>Easy to replace and hold well.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to apply and held well in my hair.</li>
            <li>You need the right product to remove of which I am not too sure yet.  </li>
            <li>Many of them fell even before the first wash!!&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>not so good too small had to use more than one piece to retape the hair</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>The product was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s a first on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Very gummy after first hair wash.</li>
            <li>Now you can remove your extensions, clean them, condition them, take off the old tape, retape them and reapply them like new!</li>
            <li>This tape was extremely good the first 2 times I ordered it, but my recent purchases were nothing less than a disaster!!&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>but if you first pull off the tape then place the extension directly on the tape and peel off carefully, it is much easier than trying to peel the tape off and place it on the hair extensions.  </li>
            <li>they came with dust and yelowish like if they were old</li>
            <li>They lay completely flat, absolutely undetectable.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find these wefts actually work!  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other brands claiming to be waterproof only to have extensions slipping off in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I wash my hair every other day and this hair definitely gets the job done.</li>
            <li> These won&#x27;t hold up to excessive scrubbing or pulling with brushes, but with a little gentle care, they stay in for almost two weeks (some longer).  </li>
            <li> All tape is a little different.</li>
            <li> u do not get it wet for 2 to 3 days.</li>
            <li> Tape not strong enough ... lasted a day !</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THESE...unless you plan on using them to tape your shirt closed!</li>
            <li> Would  tell other about it, look like it might do the job.</li>
            <li> its not because of anything wrong I do because I have been using the same hair from the same seller for months</li>
            <li> They can be a little tricky to use</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste money</li>
            <li> Not satisfied.</li>
            <li> Not as thin as other adhesives I have purchased.</li>
            <li> Can become gummy and hard to remove from hair with just alcohol so not sure what is recommended to remove the residue from hair.</li>
            <li> The tapes leave behind residue that&#x27;s like chewing gum...gets stuck in your hair, breaking/ripping hair out when trying to remove.</li>
            <li> This product reminds me of skin tape (you know that tape you use to tape your clothes to your skin) and its way too thin.</li>
            <li> I had to head the tape in order for it to bond at all to my hair which of course left me with a disgusting sticky residue.</li>
            <li> There is no way that I could separate therefore, totally useless.</li>
            <li> This tape is not user friendly.its impossible to remove the paper off of the adhesive.</li>
            <li> Truly dissapointed :(</li>
            <li> This product is terrible!</li>
            <li> This type was horrible and did not hold my hair in at all.</li>
            <li> Worst off the shipping was like 5 bucks and the package was the size of my hand.</li>

            <li> Easy to replace and hold well.  You need the right product to remove of which I am not too sure yet.  Can become gummy and hard to remove from hair with just alcohol so not sure what is recommended to remove the residue from hair.</li>
            <li> This tape was extremely good the first 2 times I ordered it, but my recent purchases were nothing less than a disaster!!&lt;br /&gt;It doesnt stick for a couple of days! Many of them fell even before the first wash!!&lt;br /&gt;and its not because of anything wrong I do because I have been using the same hair from the same seller for months now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their quality is not constant! All depends on your luck</li>
            <li> This product is terrible! The tapes leave behind residue that&#x27;s like chewing gum...gets stuck in your hair, breaking/ripping hair out when trying to remove. Never had this problem with Hotheads tapes. Will never purchase this again.</li>
            <li> this things don&#x27;t work at all they don&#x27;t stick not even for an hour don&#x27;t waste money they came with dust and yelowish like if they were old</li>
            <li> I used this tape for replacement tape on my extensions. I think it worked way better than the tape that was already on them. It was easy to apply and held well in my hair.</li>
            <li> This adheres great to the hair extensions and to your own hair. It lasts for about 10 weeks. I wash my hair every other day and this hair definitely gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Tape not strong enough ... lasted a day ! Came off in the shower and while brushing hair. Not satisfied. Truly dissapointed :(</li>
            <li> These worked well for the application.  I would recommend them to anyone wanting to put in their own hair extensions.</li>
            <li> I have been doing my own extensions for two years now. I have done u tipped bonds, tape in, glue, micro loop...basically any type of extension out there I have tried. This type was horrible and did not hold my hair in at all. I had to head the tape in order for it to bond at all to my hair which of course left me with a disgusting sticky residue. This product reminds me of skin tape (you know that tape you use to tape your clothes to your skin) and its way too thin. Worst off the shipping was like 5 bucks and the package was the size of my hand. DO NOT BUY THESE...unless you plan on using them to tape your shirt closed!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> This tape was very easy to work with and held well. They don&#x27;t come with directions. All tape is a little different. This tape works the best is u do not get it wet for 2 to 3 days.</li>
            <li> If you use seamless extensions, this tape is great!! Now you can remove your extensions, clean them, condition them, take off the old tape, retape them and reapply them like new! This tape is very good quality, I have used it to retape two different types of seamless extensions and worked great on both!</li>
            <li> The product was exactly what I needed. I have ordered these twice and will order again when needed.  Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it yet. Would  tell other about it, look like it might do the job. Wish it had direction with it.</li>

            <li> Not as thin as other adhesives I have purchased. Did the job, but will probably not purchase again. Very gummy after first hair wash.</li>
            <li> This tape is not user friendly.its impossible to remove the paper off of the adhesive. There is no way that I could separate therefore, totally useless. The seller charge $4.+ dollars in non refundable shipping so this is a total rip off!  It&#x27;s only 4 bucks but I just feel I got scammed and that&#x27;s a first on Amazon. Total bummer!</li>
            <li> not so good too small had to use more than one piece to retape the hair I  did not have enough to do all 40</li>
