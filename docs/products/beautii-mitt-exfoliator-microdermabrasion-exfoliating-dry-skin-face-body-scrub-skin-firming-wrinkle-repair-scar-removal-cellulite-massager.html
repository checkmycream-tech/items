            <li>My skin comes out silk and nice.</li>
            <li>I have nice skin.</li>
            <li>When I saw this Beautii Mitt I figured it might be a nice addition to my skin regiment.</li>
            <li>My best friend uses the Beautii Mitt and she insisted I get one too – and it has absolutely lived up to the hype I’ve read online and my friend’s rave reviews.</li>
            <li>hello Beautii Mitt you’re my new best friend!  </li>
            <li>It is, by far, the best skin product I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>The Beautii Mitt is the most amazing exfoliation product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Be sure to follow the instructions and instructional video</li>
            <li>so you can get the most out of your Beautii Mitt.  </li>
            <li>but I’ve found it gets even better over time.  </li>
            <li>additional info, read my lengthy 2-star review of the Baiden Mitten, titled \\&quot;Better, Cheaper Alternatives Elsewhere!!\\&quot;, here:</li>
            <li>And i make sure my face is damp.</li>
            <li>but i use it on my stretchmarks and face more often so it might wear out quicker.</li>
            <li>I&amp;#34;m so pleased with the results I&amp;#34;m having.  </li>
            <li>The Beautii Mitt has helped reduce my pores and blackheads and my legs have never looked better.  </li>
            <li>My skin now has a healthy, radiant glow to it…</li>
            <li>Lotions and creams penetrate better too.</li>
            <li>I used the mitt on my whole body and I am happy to say that I am in love with this product.</li>
            <li>top of how well this works, it shipped super quick!!</li>
            <li>I have not used the Beautii mitt, but I did handle a comparable competitor mitt, and while I do not dispute its fantastic exfoliating abilities, I would propose that there is a better alternative out there.  </li>
            <li>This Mitt is great for you no matter how old you are.  </li>
            <li>After my first use I noticed my skin was softer and clearing up nicely  too since I&#x27;ve been exfoliating with it.  </li>
            <li>The mitt was safe and super easy to use on all areas that need smoothing.</li>
            <li>For about $1-2 + free shipping, you can buy what&#x27;s called a Korean Italy cloth.  </li>
            <li>The cloth, in fact, is available in varying grades of courseness (the color denotes the courseness).  </li>
            <li>The Mitt comes with fantastic instructions, and there is an online video to watch for additional tips on how to use the Mitt.  </li>
            <li>This mitt is the real deal and has already made a noticeable difference on my skin for an amazing DEAL.</li>
            <li>and when I saw the skin rolling up when I used the Beautii Mitt on my skin, I was so excited.  </li>
            <li>but now I can scrub my feet clean in just seconds.</li>
            <li>removal of dead skin cells was quite astounding, especially in light of the fact that all of the prior products that claimed to be able to do this, did nothing.</li>
            <li>I definitely feel like I exposed a new, fresh, healthy, bright layer of skin.  </li>
            <li>I called my mom while she was at work when I first used it because I was THAT excited.</li>
            <li>After purchasing a variety of cheap exfoliating gloves, none of which worked very well, I decided to purchase the Beautii Mitt.</li>
            <li>Believe the reviews – the Beautii Mitt is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>All I can say, is worth every penny and more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-SB-</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t experience much redness after &amp; 0 irritation (like I experienced with other products).</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous when I first used it, but it is a really great product.  </li>
            <li>When I emailed them they replied right away.</li>
            <li>I saw my skin start to exfoliate off right away.</li>
            <li>I used it on my face too (very gently) and my face has never looked better…</li>
            <li>You’ll see results with even just the first use</li>
            <li>My skin feels softer, cleaner and healthier than ever before – even after just the first use.</li>
            <li>First of all i use this to exfoliate every part of my body.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different scrubs and exfoliating mitts that I was going to give up.</li>
            <li>but now they are soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I will certainly be buying another one when the time comes to replace this one.</li>
            <li>Scrub Face &amp; Body, Remove Blackheads, Minimize Pores, Firm Skin &amp; Remove Scars, Massage Cellulite &amp; More!</li>
            <li>I thought the video was very helpful, too.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li>I will definetely by another one very soon.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>Okay so I&#x27;ve suffered from what friends, piers, &amp; even my family call &amp;#34;alligator skin&amp;#34; on mostly the lower part of my legs  (&amp; it&#x27;s minor on other places like arms &amp; thighs) for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li>but I was SO happily surprised that this beauty product really works as promised.  </li>
            <li>Dry Skin Treatment - Repair Wrinkles - Love It Or Your Money Back!</li>
            <li>This product also has fantastic sloughing ability, but for a fraction of the price, and the cloth can be laundered endlessly.  </li>
            <li>I just got my new Beautii Mitt and have used it twice.</li>
            <li>Funny enough, it&#x27;s not just for women: My boyfriend stole mine!!</li>
            <li>The dead skin rolled right off!!</li>
            <li>Using the Mitt is really quite simple.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>My skin was so soft, I literally walked around telling people to touch my skin.</li>
            <li>First i scrub my skin with medical crystals with a wooden messager, then i used my baiden mitten.</li>
            <li>I took a hot shower, wet my mitt, rung it out completely and started exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>I had a facial last week and my esthetician could not stop raving about my skin and for the first time ever I left without her recommending new skin care products.  </li>
            <li>lastly, for anyone who uses tanning products, either professional spray tanning or from the bottle, you need the beautii mitt!</li>
            <li>The $1-2 pricetag is for Korean Italy cloths found on eBay and shipped from South Korea (so shipping time is long), but for a few more bucks, you can buy one that&#x27;s shipped locally</li>
            <li>The dead, dry skin rolled off as promised and my skin feels baby smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I ended up spending more on the other products combined, and all of them have seen their way to the waste basket.</li>
            <li>If your facial skin is too sensitive, then don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>and then when that faux tan starts fading and making your skin look a bit uneven - the mitt literally gets rid of it all right away</li>
            <li>I used to find it so hard to get my feet clean with just a washcloth</li>
            <li>While all of the other products that I tried prior to purchasing this did absolutely nothing, I noticed immediate improvement of my skin after using this just one time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anyways, i like taking long showers so this is no trouble for me to use.</li>
            <li>Take a hot shower for bit, wet the mitt, wring it out completely and scrub in an up and down, side to side motion.  </li>

            <li> instructions for use are very simple and the mitt is designed to last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I have actually been able to stop using other expensive skin care products by simply using this Mitt weekly.</li>
            <li> I will be a life long customer.</li>
            <li> I have used other microdermabrasion cloths over the years but this Mitt works above and beyond the rest.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying this product for a long time!</li>
            <li> My legs are really dry, flaky, scaly, cracked and all around damaged.</li>
            <li> My arm and legs are usually so dry</li>
            <li> At $40, this is not a cheap piece of cloth (the competing cloth, the Baiden, was even MORE expensive!).  </li>
            <li> Clearly I&#x27;m a lifelong customer (we  both are!).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Beautii Mitt every other day for about two weeks</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions very carefully</li>
            <li> In the end, while this may seem expensive, it really isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Instead of using it like it is recomended in an up down motion, i instead make the motion you use while using make up wipes.</li>
            <li> no more dry skin!</li>
            <li> and it doesnt work.. not cheap either...</li>
            <li> (there are a few on Amazon that even qualify for Amazon Prime), and still come out WAY WAY ahead of where you&#x27;d be, had you bought the Beautii</li>
            <li> I just use it and it took all dead skin out.</li>
            <li> all of this after just a few uses.  </li>
            <li> I used it today and was blown away by how much dead skin rolled off.  </li>
            <li> It was a little hard to handle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now addicted to this product.</li>
            <li> and this is the fake weak virgin of it.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed in the size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found a loofah or anything else that works the way this does when it comes to removing a fake tan when it&#x27;s on its way out.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed – I promise.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have to say -- the beautti mitt is awesome.  I stole it from my girlfriend to use after shaving and it&#x27;s great.  She caught me using hers so she made me buy my own... and I&#x27;m happy she did.  I thought the video was very helpful, too.</li>
            <li> Be sure to follow the instructions and instructional video so you can get the most out of your Beautii Mitt.  You will not be disappointed – I promise. This product has exceeded my expectations and I am over ecstatic with the results. You’ll see results with even just the first use but I’ve found it gets even better over time.  I&#x27;m now addicted to this product. I will certainly be buying another one when the time comes to replace this one. I had a facial last week and my esthetician could not stop raving about my skin and for the first time ever I left without her recommending new skin care products.  I was over the moon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And lastly, for anyone who uses tanning products, either professional spray tanning or from the bottle, you need the beautii mitt! It&#x27;s the ultimate tanning companion to use prior to spray tanning for exfoliation and then when that faux tan starts fading and making your skin look a bit uneven - the mitt literally gets rid of it all right away so you&#x27;re back to your even skin tone in minutes. I&#x27;ve never found a loofah or anything else that works the way this does when it comes to removing a fake tan when it&#x27;s on its way out. AMAZING!!</li>
            <li> I was so worried that I was wasting my $38 but I was SO happily surprised that this beauty product really works as promised.  I highly recommend it!  I tell all my friends about it. My skin feels softer, cleaner and healthier than ever before – even after just the first use.</li>
            <li> All the hype over this and it doesnt work.. not cheap either...</li>
            <li> I have not used the Beautii mitt, but I did handle a comparable competitor mitt, and while I do not dispute its fantastic exfoliating abilities, I would propose that there is a better alternative out there.  At $40, this is not a cheap piece of cloth (the competing cloth, the Baiden, was even MORE expensive!).  For about $1-2 + free shipping, you can buy what&#x27;s called a Korean Italy cloth.  This product also has fantastic sloughing ability, but for a fraction of the price, and the cloth can be laundered endlessly.  The cloth, in fact, is available in varying grades of courseness (the color denotes the courseness).  The $1-2 pricetag is for Korean Italy cloths found on eBay and shipped from South Korea (so shipping time is long), but for a few more bucks, you can buy one that&#x27;s shipped locally (there are a few on Amazon that even qualify for Amazon Prime), and still come out WAY WAY ahead of where you&#x27;d be, had you bought the Beautii mitt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For additional info, read my lengthy 2-star review of the Baiden Mitten, titled \\&quot;Better, Cheaper Alternatives Elsewhere!!\\&quot;, here: [[ASIN:B003TNQG4E Exfoliation Microdermabrasion Tool - Best Dry Skin Treatment - Repair Wrinkles - Love It Or Your Money Back!

            <li> First of all i use this to exfoliate every part of my body. It is amazing. Follow the instructions and you will see your skin slouch off. Anyways, i like taking long showers so this is no trouble for me to use. I am trying to fade my stretchmarks by exfoliation and this definitely helps. First i scrub my skin with medical crystals with a wooden messager, then i used my baiden mitten. My skin comes out silk and nice. It also removes tans especially on the chest area. I also use it daily on my face. If your facial skin is too sensitive, then don&#x27;t use it. But i find that i can use it daily. Instead of using it like it is recomended in an up down motion, i instead make the motion you use while using make up wipes. And i make sure my face is damp. Otherwise for the nonfacial areas, you follow the instructions it comes with. I will definetely by another one very soon. I have had mine for about four months and it still works great but i use it on my stretchmarks and face more often so it might wear out quicker. The best thing to ever happen to my skin.</li>
            <li> I grew up in the culture that uses this. and this is the fake weak virgin of it. it doesn&#x27;t work.the one i used t back home didn&#x27;t need any preparation  pre soak or anything. I just use it and it took all dead skin out.</li>
            <li> I&amp;#34;m so pleased with the results I&amp;#34;m having.  I was a little nervous when I first used it, but it is a really great product.  I followed the instructions very carefully and when I saw the skin rolling up when I used the Beautii Mitt on my skin, I was so excited.  After my first use I noticed my skin was softer and clearing up nicely  too since I&#x27;ve been exfoliating with it.  People are noticeing and actually complementing me on my skin.  I will definetly keep using it and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> After purchasing a variety of cheap exfoliating gloves, none of which worked very well, I decided to purchase the Beautii Mitt. I&#x27;m very pleased with the results and the ease of use. While all of the other products that I tried prior to purchasing this did absolutely nothing, I noticed immediate improvement of my skin after using this just one time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The removal of dead skin cells was quite astounding, especially in light of the fact that all of the prior products that claimed to be able to do this, did nothing. In the end, while this may seem expensive, it really isn&#x27;t. I ended up spending more on the other products combined, and all of them have seen their way to the waste basket. The product featured here is a case of getting what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions for use are very simple and the mitt is designed to last a very long time. I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> The Beautii Mitt has helped reduce my pores and blackheads and my legs have never looked better.  The Mitt comes with fantastic instructions, and there is an online video to watch for additional tips on how to use the Mitt.  Read them and watch the video. This is one of those tools you must understand and follow the directions to get maximum benefits!  I&#x27;m thrilled with it--so much better than a loofah or exfoliating shower scrubs!</li>
            <li> The Beautii Mitt IS AMAZING! Funny enough, it&#x27;s not just for women: My boyfriend stole mine!! HA! Ordering another one now.  Clearly I&#x27;m a lifelong customer (we  both are!).</li>
            <li> I just got my new Beautii Mitt and have used it twice. It is, by far, the best skin product I have ever purchased. The dead, dry skin rolled off as promised and my skin feels baby smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> The Beautii Mitt’s customer service team is great. When I emailed them they replied right away. Using the Mitt is really quite simple. Take a hot shower for bit, wet the mitt, wring it out completely and scrub in an up and down, side to side motion.  Find a pressure that works for you. Don’t rub in circles.  I saw my skin start to exfoliate off right away. It works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Beautii Mitt every other day for about two weeks and my skin is the softest it&#x27;s been in fifteen years. Believe the reviews – the Beautii Mitt is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The Beautii Mitt is so awesome! My skin is softer than its ever been before.  My skin now has a healthy, radiant glow to it… all of this after just a few uses.  I can’t wait to see how I’ll look in a month! I will be a life long customer.</li>
            <li> Wow.  You MUST try the Beautii Mitt. It is amazing. I have actually been able to stop using other expensive skin care products by simply using this Mitt weekly.</li>
            <li> I have nice skin. I’ve always thought so. I’ve done what I was supposed to and have stayed out of the sun.  When I saw this Beautii Mitt I figured it might be a nice addition to my skin regiment. I used it today and was blown away by how much dead skin rolled off.  I took a hot shower, wet my mitt, rung it out completely and started exfoliating.  This Mitt is great for you no matter how old you are.  I definitely feel like I exposed a new, fresh, healthy, bright layer of skin.  All I can say, is worth every penny and more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-SB-</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I wish I could give 10 stars! This mitt is the real deal and has already made a noticeable difference on my skin for an amazing DEAL. The mitt was safe and super easy to use on all areas that need smoothing. I feel as if i just went on vacation and will no longer have to visit a day spa for exfoliation services- this is truly the BEST and I will be ordering again soon.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Okay so I&#x27;ve suffered from what friends, piers, &amp; even my family call &amp;#34;alligator skin&amp;#34; on mostly the lower part of my legs  (&amp; it&#x27;s minor on other places like arms &amp; thighs) for as long as I can remember. My legs are really dry, flaky, scaly, cracked and all around damaged. I&#x27;ve tried so many different scrubs and exfoliating mitts that I was going to give up. But somehow I stumb upon this product....&lt;br /&gt;&amp; Oh my lord. The dead skin rolled right off!! I called my mom while she was at work when I first used it because I was THAT excited. The cracked scaly skin on my arms is gone! On my thighs, practically gone!! &amp; I&#x27;m still working on my lower legs but hey, it took years to get like this. It&#x27;s going to take time to get to my liking. I didn&#x27;t experience much redness after &amp; 0 irritation (like I experienced with other products). My skin was so soft, I literally walked around telling people to touch my skin. Coworkers, classmates, literally everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of how well this works, it shipped super quick!!</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed in the size. It was a little hard to handle.</li>
            <li> The Beautii Mitt is the most amazing exfoliation product I have ever used. I have used other microdermabrasion cloths over the years but this Mitt works above and beyond the rest.  I can&#x27;t believe the amount of skin that comes off when I use this.  Lotions and creams penetrate better too. I will never be without a Beautii Mitt.</li>
            <li> It’s not often that a beauty product lives up to its promises.  My best friend uses the Beautii Mitt and she insisted I get one too – and it has absolutely lived up to the hype I’ve read online and my friend’s rave reviews. My arm and legs are usually so dry but now they are soft and smooth. I love this product!</li>
            <li> I received my Beautii Mitt and I am overwhelmed by the results!  I used the mitt on my whole body and I am happy to say that I am in love with this product. I used to find it so hard to get my feet clean with just a washcloth but now I can scrub my feet clean in just seconds. I used it on my face too (very gently) and my face has never looked better… no more dry skin! Good-bye diamonds hello Beautii Mitt you’re my new best friend!  I will be buying this product for a long time! Thank you!!!</li>
