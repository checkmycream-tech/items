            <li>Arrived in excellent condition.</li>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>later&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;Excellent Excellent Excellent Excellent</li>

            <li>The product is great</li>
            <li>It worked great.</li>
            <li>Also, know that you&#x27;re buying your cartridge from a great company with the highest integrity.</li>
            <li>It is great, even in comparison to getting laser treatments at a spa.</li>
            <li>This product is great for hair removal.</li>
            <li>Product at very nice price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled!  </li>
            <li>Now I know I was in too bright of a room and the sensor was picking up my shadow thinking</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m here to tell anyone having problems with their cartridge, try doing your treatments in a not so bright room.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the machine is amazing, and the lamps work great.</li>
            <li>and so I knew that this should be a good treatment option.  </li>
            <li>Good buying experience.</li>
            <li>Works great, definitely so happy I bought it, worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I have recommended it to many of my friends!</li>
            <li>I originally came across a good review for silk&#x27;n sensepil while researching another hair removal product.</li>
            <li>I wonder if the issue is more of a concern of eye damage from the bright light.  </li>
            <li>Have discovered something very important about the bulb.</li>
            <li>However, the second time that I ordered this product I was very happy with the cartridges I received.</li>
            <li>Ive never ever had a problem with anything i have ever ordered since i have been an Amazon customer.i love Amazon.</li>
            <li>I ordered many of these from amazon.  </li>
            <li>I turned off the machine every time it indicated the cartridge was gone and got about 10 hits more for about 4 more times of turning on and off and waiting in-between stopping the machine.i no longer have under arm hair after two uses.</li>
            <li>Great price, came in fast</li>
            <li>I have been going to a dermatolist for laser and that is still the better way for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I purchased my cartridge from them.</li>
            <li>I received the nicest and most generous reply.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Sensepil for over a year and still love it.</li>
            <li>My underarms are noticeably better.</li>
            <li>The hair growth used to resemble an oval, now there is no hair at the top &amp; bottom (more square shaped now).</li>
            <li>sincerely regret this...</li>
            <li>I love the Silk&#x27;n SensEpil.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>If you combine the cost of the machine and the replacement lamp it will cost you more than doing it at the salon.</li>
            <li>Love these, haven&#x27;t gotten this order but have gotten them before at the store.</li>
            <li>I have no choice but to like it because I need it to use my machine :)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>I love using it.</li>
            <li>Price is great, arrives fast</li>
            <li>Have been using Silk&#x27;n SensEpil for several months &amp; am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I just did that &amp; got about 20 more flashes before it stopped working.</li>
            <li>I needed a replacement, and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
            <li>Definitely pleased and will buy again when needed.</li>
            <li>so much more $.</li>
            <li>So slower results are OK</li>
            <li>I love my Sensepil</li>
            <li>Bulb arrived right on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li>The good news is that it really does work!</li>
            <li>But it takes many treatments if you have strong hair.</li>
            <li>Easy to put in place.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny when you&#x27;re used to not having a problem you forget to be appreciative that you don&#x27;t have it.</li>
            <li>I first want to say that this is such a wonderful company.</li>
            <li>Worked fine with my IPL device.</li>
            <li>I just ordered two more cartridges and I&#x27;ll be interested to see if these do any better than the ones that came with the machine.</li>
            <li>Cartridge worked fine when replaced.  </li>
            <li>Excellent, very high quality for the second time</li>
            <li>These are well worth the cost because hair removal in a salon would cost so much more, and has the added inconvenience of having to go into a salon when appointments are available.</li>
            <li>you than can make a sound buying or in this case non buying decision).</li>
            <li>Cartridge fit</li>
            <li>Fit the SensEpil I have and works like a charm.  </li>
            <li>The cartridges that originally came with the machine was fine.  </li>
            <li>Super, super, super!!  </li>
            <li>They are incredibly easy to install; a quick and painless process.</li>
            <li>I have been waiting to review this product, basically because I wanted to make sure that it would work, but I needed to wait until the cartridge needed to be changed first.  </li>
            <li>Wish they lasted longer though, kinda pricey but worth it!</li>
            <li>it fits like the original cartridge.</li>
            <li>The price seemed very high (here &amp; on the manufacture&#x27;s site), but I was able to find someone selling a unit that worked, but was no longer needed on an auction site for $200 without a lamp cartridge.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They went through several responses, it&#x27;s a shadow, it&#x27;s too bright, have you been in the sun?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They were fully charged and have lasted the full time I would expect.</li>
            <li>If they were so confident in their garbage, they would allow you too return it, but they know it doesn&#x27;t really wor.    </li>
            <li>Room for improvement, but overall good for what it can do.</li>
            <li>I really wont know for a couple more months,</li>
            <li>I received a shipping lable and returned them and received a full refund.</li>
            <li>I am a white woman who wears fair skin toned makeup (not medium or beige)</li>
            <li>When I got my first cartridge that came with the devise it was fine and had good use form it for several month to a year.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still a fan and will still be a loyal customer.</li>
            <li>This cartridge is the one with the super capacity number of laser pulses.  </li>
            <li>The reviews I read before buying this product made the results sound very promising.</li>
            <li>Although I had tried this the other day, the light was still too bright.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this product and would recommend to anyone with dark hair they want to get rid of on their body.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty light skinned</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li>and I actually saw a better result!</li>
            <li>the light stopped working saying the cartridge needed refilling only 1/4 way through my 6th use which happened more quickly than I thought</li>
            <li>I changed out the cartridge, which is super easy, and the new cartridge worked.  </li>
            <li>I have found online coupons for replacement cartridges and saved as much as 30% and free shipping.</li>
            <li>I feel its worth the money and it works.</li>
            <li>it was absolutely worth the money.</li>
            <li>And I am not mentioning your time, because that&#x27;s worth a lot too.</li>
            <li>Def worth the money and investment.  </li>
            <li>, I still get the same results in the privacy of my own home.  </li>
            <li>Just 4 starts because they die pretty quickly</li>
            <li>According to instructions, I should see best results on my dark hairs, but may see some on even the lighter hairs with extra sessions.     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad the price came down on these because I didn&#x27;t realize when I first bought the product that I&#x27;d have to go through so many cartridges/</li>
            <li>The rest of the hair (pubic area) was more dense &amp; seems a little more stubborn.</li>
            <li>It looks pretty funny right now, but I&#x27;m willing to give it sometime to find out.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re doing large areas like your legs, be prepared to go through a lot of cartridges, but it&#x27;s definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Wanted to return garbage within 30 days, but company stated (must be used properly within guidelines of the instruction booklet), which of course you than need, more than 30 days.</li>
            <li>oh, these are exactly what I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li>I asked them to first, please forgive me and that it was my mistake, and to please charge me for the replacement.</li>
            <li>Product is exactly as stated in description.</li>
            <li>More than likely once I am done with my treatments, I will either give to a friend or resell the unit without a cartridge.     </li>
            <li>I ordered the refill to see if I simply need more sessions, but if I do not see changes after this refill I will update my review reducing the star level if it works I will update and increase the star level.</li>
            <li>Just as described only wish I had ordered more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for face and arms to use and you can see the result after a few time using.</li>
            <li>I contacted amazon and they quickly issued a refund and I am awaiting a new product.</li>
            <li>So that is pretty much it,  </li>
            <li>The first bulb lasted a long while and I have had very good results with facial hair not growing back.</li>
            <li>The directions say that best results come from having multiple zaps next to each other.</li>
            <li>I live in Saudi Arabia, and there is no way for me to send them back since the cost will be more than the price for the lamp them selves.  </li>
            <li>It is pricy - but a whole lot cheaper than going to a laser treatment facility over and over.</li>
            <li>They were very understanding and said to please keep the replacement as a gift.</li>
            <li>kept calling and the second time she listened to the sound of the machine on the phone!&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;FDA approved&amp;#34; burned my whole legs, the machine is suppose to detect skin color to prevent burns and it did not work...</li>
            <li>Much cheaper this way</li>
            <li>At the salon they will do everything fast.</li>
            <li>I am still using the product and have really diminished hair growth over my legs and bikini area.  </li>
            <li>Received this product fast and it was as described.</li>
            <li>Also, keep a record of how many times &amp; areas done so you have an idea when bulb should be spent.</li>
            <li>I use the unit once a month for 10 to 15 minutes at a time, so really, it should have lasted a lot longer.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really hoping that the patches will go away.</li>
            <li>I had the same kind of technology used about 20 years ago on my upper lip and it got rid of the hair.  </li>
            <li>I have fair skin, medium brown hair on my underarms &amp; bikini area (blonde hair in other areas).</li>
            <li>Because I shaved my legs every day, my skin was becoming very dry.  </li>
            <li>After the first use I saw some reduction and after 3 sessions almost all the hair is gone, It took almost an hour to do my back the first time</li>
            <li>Still not cheap, but more reasonable.     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad to finally see a price drop - Amazon is currently selling them for $33.32.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this particular item.  </li>
            <li>The results are not as Fast at a professional salon, but much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Although I feel these are too highly priced, I do believe the product does the job.</li>
            <li>After paying too much for hair removal at a professional Salon for my underarm hair, I invested in this and wish I would have in the beginning.  </li>
            <li>I was highly skeptical about this product at first, but after researching clinical trials (and finding a good deal on the machine)</li>
            <li>but I would definitely say its worth it.</li>
            <li>I do have to say now that I could put on my Brazilian string bikini in the dead of winter at a moment&#x27;s notice having not shaved and feel confident knowing the hair I do have would not be noticeable.</li>
            <li>For those of you that get yours new &amp; are complaining about the limit...</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re careful to clean it between uses.  </li>
            <li>The award winning reviews must be by family, friends or employees or someone with very little hair problem,LOL.</li>
            <li>I would love for them to be hair free, but at least I am getting results from the areas that I expected.</li>
            <li>My first cartridge that came with the unit lasted through 3 sessions of doing forearms, underarms and lower legs and part of a fourth session.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Needless to say, I was thrilled to have found this item!  </li>
            <li>I have dark hair and very light, very sensitive skin, so I&#x27;ve always had to shave frequently and battle constant razor burn.</li>
            <li>In fact, many last less than 240 strokes.    </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to use and the window is big enough to cover bigger areas.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so very hard to find good customer service let alone such kindness and generosity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I gave this products numerous tries in different areas and many took out about 1/8 of hair if that.  </li>
            <li>I raised up to 4 &amp; 5 on later uses, but 5 was too much</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I ended up having to rush to the dermatologist and encounter unexpected expenses in creams, ointments, visit...</li>
            <li>/&gt;don&#x27;t be a fool trying to save some money and screwing yourself over... pay a professional...</li>
            <li>This product felt tolerable as far as pain level was concerned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned with dark black, coarse hair on my lower legs.</li>
            <li>This one I just used and the light was not nearly as powerful, it also wouldn&#x27;t work on many areas, showing as if the skin was too dark (never had a problem with the other ones, and have not been tanning).  </li>
            <li>In addition, it is written on the lamp that the average use is about 270 beam strokes, but that is misleading, since most of them do not live upto the claim.  </li>
            <li>My unit did not have any limit on how high I could set it for my initial uses.</li>
            <li>I have very dark, coarse hair that grows very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Here, with this \\&quot;magic\\&quot; little  SensEpil you would have to spend three time as much time as at the salon, plus you have to do it yourself, it cost more money and you get less result!</li>
            <li>but even in those spots the hair grows very slowly and is very fine.  </li>
            <li>Turn off the machine, let it cool a few minutes, then try again.</li>
            <li>This cartridge was a little more costly than others by a few dollars,  but it worked at least 900 pluses or more.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I had was the first cartridge did not last for the full 750 pulses, it lasted for about 500.</li>
            <li>and I was definitely pleased to not have that spiky leg hair anymore like a few of the other girls</li>
            <li>Usually a light cartridge will do at least 2 legs and 2 arms.  </li>
            <li>Product is same as direct from manufacture.  </li>
            <li>Some areas are certainly responding faster than other areas - but the literature said that would be the case.  </li>
            <li>The first order I received was not satisfactory; the cartridges seemed to be less than fully charged.</li>
            <li>There is a small spot on my chin with light blonde hairs that I will occasionally tweeze.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve completed five sessions so far (every two weeks) and am just starting my second cartridge.  </li>
            <li>SensEpil has completely made a different in the amount of hair coming back use after use.</li>
            <li>Anyone with heavy hair follicles and would like to shave less, I&#x27;d strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The second bulb that I ordered didn&#x27;t even last half the time as the first one.</li>
            <li>several times,(after finally finding a phone number) starting as soon as I first used it, as it kept shutting down after about a minute.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I heard reviews on other refill cartridges that they didn&#x27;t last as long if bought from certain suppliers...</li>
            <li>They did not last long and the settings on the machine did not pack as much juice as they have with other cartridges.</li>
            <li>Hopefully it&#x27;s not a crapshoot of getting good ones and then getting bad ones.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I purchased my cartridge from them.</li>
            <li> I received the nicest and most generous reply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Sensepil for over a year and still love it.</li>
            <li> My underarms are noticeably better.</li>
            <li> The hair growth used to resemble an oval, now there is no hair at the top &amp; bottom (more square shaped now).</li>
            <li> sincerely regret this...</li>
            <li> I love the Silk&#x27;n SensEpil.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> If you combine the cost of the machine and the replacement lamp it will cost you more than doing it at the salon.</li>
            <li> Love these, haven&#x27;t gotten this order but have gotten them before at the store.</li>
            <li> I have no choice but to like it because I need it to use my machine :)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> I love using it.</li>
            <li> Price is great, arrives fast</li>
            <li> Have been using Silk&#x27;n SensEpil for several months &amp; am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I just did that &amp; got about 20 more flashes before it stopped working.</li>
            <li> I needed a replacement, and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
            <li> Definitely pleased and will buy again when needed.</li>
            <li> so much more $.</li>
            <li> So slower results are OK</li>
            <li> I love my Sensepil</li>
            <li> Bulb arrived right on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li> The good news is that it really does work!</li>
            <li> But it takes many treatments if you have strong hair.</li>
            <li> Easy to put in place.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny when you&#x27;re used to not having a problem you forget to be appreciative that you don&#x27;t have it.</li>
            <li> I first want to say that this is such a wonderful company.</li>
            <li> Worked fine with my IPL device.</li>
            <li> I just ordered two more cartridges and I&#x27;ll be interested to see if these do any better than the ones that came with the machine.</li>
            <li> Cartridge worked fine when replaced.  </li>
            <li> Excellent, very high quality for the second time</li>
            <li> These are well worth the cost because hair removal in a salon would cost so much more, and has the added inconvenience of having to go into a salon when appointments are available.</li>
            <li> you than can make a sound buying or in this case non buying decision).</li>
            <li> Cartridge fit</li>
            <li> Fit the SensEpil I have and works like a charm.  </li>
            <li> The cartridges that originally came with the machine was fine.  </li>
            <li> Super, super, super!!  </li>
            <li> They are incredibly easy to install; a quick and painless process.</li>
            <li> I have been waiting to review this product, basically because I wanted to make sure that it would work, but I needed to wait until the cartridge needed to be changed first.  </li>
            <li> Wish they lasted longer though, kinda pricey but worth it!</li>
            <li> it fits like the original cartridge.</li>
            <li> The price seemed very high (here &amp; on the manufacture&#x27;s site), but I was able to find someone selling a unit that worked, but was no longer needed on an auction site for $200 without a lamp cartridge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They went through several responses, it&#x27;s a shadow, it&#x27;s too bright, have you been in the sun?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They were fully charged and have lasted the full time I would expect.</li>
            <li> If they were so confident in their garbage, they would allow you too return it, but they know it doesn&#x27;t really wor.    </li>
            <li> Room for improvement, but overall good for what it can do.</li>
            <li> I really wont know for a couple more months,</li>
            <li> I received a shipping lable and returned them and received a full refund.</li>
            <li> I am a white woman who wears fair skin toned makeup (not medium or beige)</li>
            <li> When I got my first cartridge that came with the devise it was fine and had good use form it for several month to a year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still a fan and will still be a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> This cartridge is the one with the super capacity number of laser pulses.  </li>
            <li> The reviews I read before buying this product made the results sound very promising.</li>
            <li> Although I had tried this the other day, the light was still too bright.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product and would recommend to anyone with dark hair they want to get rid of on their body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty light skinned</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li> and I actually saw a better result!</li>
            <li> the light stopped working saying the cartridge needed refilling only 1/4 way through my 6th use which happened more quickly than I thought</li>
            <li> I changed out the cartridge, which is super easy, and the new cartridge worked.  </li>
            <li> I have found online coupons for replacement cartridges and saved as much as 30% and free shipping.</li>
            <li> I feel its worth the money and it works.</li>
            <li> it was absolutely worth the money.</li>
            <li> And I am not mentioning your time, because that&#x27;s worth a lot too.</li>
            <li> Def worth the money and investment.  </li>
            <li> , I still get the same results in the privacy of my own home.  </li>
            <li> Just 4 starts because they die pretty quickly</li>
            <li> According to instructions, I should see best results on my dark hairs, but may see some on even the lighter hairs with extra sessions.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad the price came down on these because I didn&#x27;t realize when I first bought the product that I&#x27;d have to go through so many cartridges/</li>
            <li> The rest of the hair (pubic area) was more dense &amp; seems a little more stubborn.</li>
            <li> It looks pretty funny right now, but I&#x27;m willing to give it sometime to find out.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re doing large areas like your legs, be prepared to go through a lot of cartridges, but it&#x27;s definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Wanted to return garbage within 30 days, but company stated (must be used properly within guidelines of the instruction booklet), which of course you than need, more than 30 days.</li>
            <li> oh, these are exactly what I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li> I asked them to first, please forgive me and that it was my mistake, and to please charge me for the replacement.</li>
            <li> Product is exactly as stated in description.</li>
            <li> More than likely once I am done with my treatments, I will either give to a friend or resell the unit without a cartridge.     </li>
            <li> I ordered the refill to see if I simply need more sessions, but if I do not see changes after this refill I will update my review reducing the star level if it works I will update and increase the star level.</li>
            <li> Just as described only wish I had ordered more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for face and arms to use and you can see the result after a few time using.</li>
            <li> I contacted amazon and they quickly issued a refund and I am awaiting a new product.</li>
            <li> So that is pretty much it,  </li>
            <li> The first bulb lasted a long while and I have had very good results with facial hair not growing back.</li>
            <li> The directions say that best results come from having multiple zaps next to each other.</li>
            <li> I live in Saudi Arabia, and there is no way for me to send them back since the cost will be more than the price for the lamp them selves.  </li>
            <li> It is pricy - but a whole lot cheaper than going to a laser treatment facility over and over.</li>
            <li> They were very understanding and said to please keep the replacement as a gift.</li>
            <li> kept calling and the second time she listened to the sound of the machine on the phone!&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;FDA approved&amp;#34; burned my whole legs, the machine is suppose to detect skin color to prevent burns and it did not work...</li>
            <li> Much cheaper this way</li>
            <li> At the salon they will do everything fast.</li>
            <li> I am still using the product and have really diminished hair growth over my legs and bikini area.  </li>
            <li> Received this product fast and it was as described.</li>
            <li> Also, keep a record of how many times &amp; areas done so you have an idea when bulb should be spent.</li>
            <li> I use the unit once a month for 10 to 15 minutes at a time, so really, it should have lasted a lot longer.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really hoping that the patches will go away.</li>
            <li> I had the same kind of technology used about 20 years ago on my upper lip and it got rid of the hair.  </li>
            <li> I have fair skin, medium brown hair on my underarms &amp; bikini area (blonde hair in other areas).</li>
            <li> Because I shaved my legs every day, my skin was becoming very dry.  </li>
            <li> After the first use I saw some reduction and after 3 sessions almost all the hair is gone, It took almost an hour to do my back the first time</li>
            <li> Still not cheap, but more reasonable.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad to finally see a price drop - Amazon is currently selling them for $33.32.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this particular item.  </li>
            <li> The results are not as Fast at a professional salon, but much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Although I feel these are too highly priced, I do believe the product does the job.</li>
            <li> After paying too much for hair removal at a professional Salon for my underarm hair, I invested in this and wish I would have in the beginning.  </li>
            <li> I was highly skeptical about this product at first, but after researching clinical trials (and finding a good deal on the machine)</li>
            <li> but I would definitely say its worth it.</li>
            <li> I do have to say now that I could put on my Brazilian string bikini in the dead of winter at a moment&#x27;s notice having not shaved and feel confident knowing the hair I do have would not be noticeable.</li>
            <li> For those of you that get yours new &amp; are complaining about the limit...</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re careful to clean it between uses.  </li>
            <li> The award winning reviews must be by family, friends or employees or someone with very little hair problem,LOL.</li>
            <li> I would love for them to be hair free, but at least I am getting results from the areas that I expected.</li>
            <li> My first cartridge that came with the unit lasted through 3 sessions of doing forearms, underarms and lower legs and part of a fourth session.  </li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was thrilled to have found this item!  </li>
            <li> I have dark hair and very light, very sensitive skin, so I&#x27;ve always had to shave frequently and battle constant razor burn.</li>
            <li> In fact, many last less than 240 strokes.    </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to use and the window is big enough to cover bigger areas.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so very hard to find good customer service let alone such kindness and generosity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gave this products numerous tries in different areas and many took out about 1/8 of hair if that.  </li>
            <li> I raised up to 4 &amp; 5 on later uses, but 5 was too much</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I ended up having to rush to the dermatologist and encounter unexpected expenses in creams, ointments, visit...</li>
            <li> /&gt;don&#x27;t be a fool trying to save some money and screwing yourself over... pay a professional...</li>
            <li> This product felt tolerable as far as pain level was concerned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned with dark black, coarse hair on my lower legs.</li>
            <li> This one I just used and the light was not nearly as powerful, it also wouldn&#x27;t work on many areas, showing as if the skin was too dark (never had a problem with the other ones, and have not been tanning).  </li>
            <li> In addition, it is written on the lamp that the average use is about 270 beam strokes, but that is misleading, since most of them do not live upto the claim.  </li>
            <li> My unit did not have any limit on how high I could set it for my initial uses.</li>
            <li> I have very dark, coarse hair that grows very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Here, with this \\&quot;magic\\&quot; little  SensEpil you would have to spend three time as much time as at the salon, plus you have to do it yourself, it cost more money and you get less result!</li>
            <li> but even in those spots the hair grows very slowly and is very fine.  </li>
            <li> Turn off the machine, let it cool a few minutes, then try again.</li>
            <li> This cartridge was a little more costly than others by a few dollars,  but it worked at least 900 pluses or more.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I had was the first cartridge did not last for the full 750 pulses, it lasted for about 500.</li>
            <li> and I was definitely pleased to not have that spiky leg hair anymore like a few of the other girls</li>
            <li> Usually a light cartridge will do at least 2 legs and 2 arms.  </li>
            <li> Product is same as direct from manufacture.  </li>
            <li> Some areas are certainly responding faster than other areas - but the literature said that would be the case.  </li>
            <li> The first order I received was not satisfactory; the cartridges seemed to be less than fully charged.</li>
            <li> There is a small spot on my chin with light blonde hairs that I will occasionally tweeze.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve completed five sessions so far (every two weeks) and am just starting my second cartridge.  </li>
            <li> SensEpil has completely made a different in the amount of hair coming back use after use.</li>
            <li> Anyone with heavy hair follicles and would like to shave less, I&#x27;d strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The second bulb that I ordered didn&#x27;t even last half the time as the first one.</li>
            <li> several times,(after finally finding a phone number) starting as soon as I first used it, as it kept shutting down after about a minute.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I heard reviews on other refill cartridges that they didn&#x27;t last as long if bought from certain suppliers...</li>
            <li> They did not last long and the settings on the machine did not pack as much juice as they have with other cartridges.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it&#x27;s not a crapshoot of getting good ones and then getting bad ones.</li>
            <li> In addition I&#x27;m using this while using oral medication that should be shutting down androgens that cause me to have any new facial hair growth.</li>
            <li> Would love it if they weren&#x27;t so expensive, but as long as they work</li>
            <li> To make a long story short it worked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone the professional route but don&#x27;t have time or $ to continue down that road.  </li>
            <li> After three treatments two weeks apart my very coarse dark hair on my legs was softer, slower growing with some bare spots.  </li>
            <li> The bulbs are expensive so be sure it is spent before discarding.</li>
            <li> It is unlikely to work on light hairs, but they are up front about this.</li>
            <li> It took a long time to get to me in shipping though.</li>
            <li> It still worked like it was suppose to, but wish it had lasted as long as they were suppose to.</li>
            <li> However, I have my doubts of long term results.  </li>
            <li> In the inner thighs where there was not much hair has almost none now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a bulb before and it lasted as long as discribed.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take long to treat the areas you want.</li>
            <li> I expected it to last through 7 uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them for a year and it has slowed down the hair growth speed, but I ordered this product to kill that hairs grown prior to starting this medicaiton.</li>
            <li> this one only lasted long enough for half a leg.  </li>
            <li> I also know people who bought other products from Silk&#x27;n and same results.  </li>
            <li> Other than that the product does stop the hair from growing back.</li>
            <li> And the uses were very minimal not a late area but small.</li>
            <li> Not sure how i feel knowing that it could actually cause facial hair to start growing on females  </li>
            <li> I had previously gone to a dermatologist and had my upper lip treated</li>
            <li> These cartridges are super expensive though.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately they burn out really quick.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m using this on dark brown/blackish course facial hair in the side burn area, upper and side lip area and on a few stray chin hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had to shave my legs every day and now I can go a week with minimal growth.</li>
            <li> Not a whole body.</li>
            <li> A few days later I got myself all geared up to do my treatments on some other areas</li>
            <li> It seems like every time I use it less and less hair comes back.</li>
            <li> One the machine read as already spent and would not work and the other one was defective and would not work.</li>
            <li> , I order about one every other month.</li>
            <li> Pregnancies and other hormonal changes have kept me working on an unwanted hair issue but this machine has helped curb the effort in my favor.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I received my cartridge the other day, opened it and had to try it out immediately.</li>
            <li> I received my auctioned unit &amp; cartridges within one day of each other.</li>
            <li> it is blonde, I am not sure I will get any results here.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and replacement lamps and although you can see small result, you would have to shed $40 every second time you use that machine.</li>
            <li> I was not pleased with this product it did not last</li>
            <li> Anyways, I would personally save the 500.00 and go to a specialist and get laser removal, at least they don&#x27;t lie, and you will not now have a pink paperweight in your closet.</li>
            <li> I would invariably have at least one cartridge be a dud and would only give me a minimal amount of pulses rather than the 750 promised.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m female with course dark hair everywhere, and professional laser hair removal is just too expensive.</li>
            <li> As the unit heats up from multiple snaps one right after each other, it gets a little painful here.</li>
            <li> it was dark skin.</li>
            <li> So far it has decreased the amount of hair I&#x27;m working to eliminate substantially.  </li>
            <li> I now require less shaving than before and the hair does not come back as thick.</li>
            <li> , now it down to about 15 minutes to hit spots where hair is still growing.</li>
            <li> After two treatments, the hair count was noticeably reduced, and razor burn went away (I&#x27;m assuming less volume of hair &#x3D; less resistance and therefore reduced irritation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been doing this every week to a week &amp; a half, for about 5 times in just under 2 months).</li>
            <li> Inside the square that still has some hair, there is probably 60% less than before.     </li>
            <li> In my bikini area there is about 40% less hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product through GMA&#x27;s discounted program about a year and a half ago after reviewing it on this website.  </li>
            <li> You can notice a slight difference a day after use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year and a half every two weeks as directed and it has removed about 90% of the hair on each area.</li>
            <li> It has now reduced the amount of hair and made it less dense.</li>
            <li> The other nice thing is that you stop having that awful spiky leg hair when you have goosebumps.</li>
            <li> After the machine indicated the cartridge was dead</li>
            <li> It does not work, I used it for few months</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my hair removal device for a few years now and these cartridges were always around $50 (not including s&amp;h on some websites).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll wait &amp; try again in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> There are patches of hair missing as of 3 months.</li>
            <li> The results are similar to expensive doctor office laser treatments, but for less money &amp; can be done at home.</li>
            <li> The area where I get those few hairs on my chin is small.</li>
            <li> I was bummed as i needed to keep up my treatments of weekly use of my silk n sensepil.i&#x27;m not sure what happened.</li>
            <li> but usually I can do my arms, legs, bikini line and underarms, but this one pooped out after I did my legs.  </li>
            <li> I am still not sure if this product works.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I will continue trying to zap this area now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why the directions state that using the product on the face can stimulate growth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the hair removal lasts forever or not</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> Not very good value for $27.95 plus the cost of the unit.</li>
            <li> It does take time, but at least you can do it in the privacy of your home and its cheaper than a dermotolgist who quoted me $1500.00.</li>
            <li> When I asked pricing for treatments at an aesthetician&#x27;s office, I found that I would need at least 6 treatments (laser) at $300 per leg.  </li>
            <li> but I am afraid to order from the same supplier.</li>
            <li> I noticed difference is some areas - hair grows slowly and some areas got almost no hair, but it does take some time</li>

            <li> Easy to put in place. Just 4 starts because they die pretty quickly, I order about one every other month. Will keep ordering!</li>
            <li> it works just like it says it does and it&#x27;s easy to use and the window is big enough to cover bigger areas.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product twice. The first order I received was not satisfactory; the cartridges seemed to be less than fully charged. They did not last long and the settings on the machine did not pack as much juice as they have with other cartridges. However, the second time that I ordered this product I was very happy with the cartridges I received. They were fully charged and have lasted the full time I would expect.</li>
            <li> NOW STUCK WITH IT, BUYER BEWARE. The award winning reviews must be by family, friends or employees or someone with very little hair problem,LOL. Wanted to return garbage within 30 days, but company stated (must be used properly within guidelines of the instruction booklet), which of course you than need, more than 30 days. I should of just sent it back. An d really hate that the intervals and time needed to use product is not listed in advertisement anywhere(where you than can make a sound buying or in this case non buying decision). If they were so confident in their garbage, they would allow you too return it, but they know it doesn&#x27;t really wor.    Anyways, I would personally save the 500.00 and go to a specialist and get laser removal, at least they don&#x27;t lie, and you will not now have a pink paperweight in your closet.I also know people who bought other products from Silk&#x27;n and same results.

            <li> I bought this product a couple of months ago and I am very impressed.  I&#x27;ve gone the professional route but don&#x27;t have time or $ to continue down that road.  Pregnancies and other hormonal changes have kept me working on an unwanted hair issue but this machine has helped curb the effort in my favor.  So far it has decreased the amount of hair I&#x27;m working to eliminate substantially.  Some areas are certainly responding faster than other areas - but the literature said that would be the case.  In addition to legs, bikini line and armpits, I&#x27;m also using it on my husband&#x27;s ear lobes and we&#x27;re seeing improvement there.  We&#x27;re careful to clean it between uses.  The product is great and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.  I don&#x27;t work for this company and I don&#x27;t know anyone that does, either.  It is pricy - but a whole lot cheaper than going to a laser treatment facility over and over.</li>
            <li> This is my second cartridge and it&#x27;s been around 2 months since I started using Silk&#x27;n SensEpil. I noticed difference is some areas - hair grows slowly and some areas got almost no hair, but it does take some time so you need to be patient.</li>
            <li> Ive never ever had a problem with anything i have ever ordered since i have been an Amazon customer.i love Amazon.I never received my Silk&#x27;n SensEpil Refil Cartridge.I was bummed as i needed to keep up my treatments of weekly use of my silk n sensepil.i&#x27;m not sure what happened.I&#x27;m still a fan and will still be a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> Arrived broken! Not happy.</li>
            <li> I bought the unit to get rid of unwanted hir on my back and shoulders. After the first use I saw some reduction and after 3 sessions almost all the hair is gone, It took almost an hour to do my back the first time, now it down to about 15 minutes to hit spots where hair is still growing. I used it on my neck because my beard was messing up my shirt collars, it worked well. The only complaint I had was the first cartridge did not last for the full 750 pulses, it lasted for about 500. I called the customer support and they are mailing me a replacement. I have found online coupons for replacement cartridges and saved as much as 30% and free shipping. I feel its worth the money and it works. It does take time, but at least you can do it in the privacy of your home and its cheaper than a dermotolgist who quoted me $1500.00.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li> oh, these are exactly what I was hoping for.  they were bundled up so no breakage.  I ordered many of these from amazon.  Didn&#x27;t have any issues at all.</li>
            <li> This cartridge was a little more costly than others by a few dollars,  but it worked at least 900 pluses or more. It took a long time to get to me in shipping though. I use it about every 3 weeks. After the machine indicated the cartridge was dead I turned off the machine every time it indicated the cartridge was gone and got about 10 hits more for about 4 more times of turning on and off and waiting in-between stopping the machine.i no longer have under arm hair after two uses. I have practically no leg hair and will keep using until I never have to shave again!</li>
            <li> Great price, came in fast but usually I can do my arms, legs, bikini line and underarms, but this one pooped out after I did my legs.  It still worked like it was suppose to, but wish it had lasted as long as they were suppose to.</li>
            <li> It does not work, I used it for few months and I did not have any results. I am back waxing my legs;(</li>
            <li> I was highly skeptical about this product at first, but after researching clinical trials (and finding a good deal on the machine) it was absolutely worth the money. I have dark hair and very light, very sensitive skin, so I&#x27;ve always had to shave frequently and battle constant razor burn. After two treatments, the hair count was noticeably reduced, and razor burn went away (I&#x27;m assuming less volume of hair &#x3D; less resistance and therefore reduced irritation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re doing large areas like your legs, be prepared to go through a lot of cartridges, but it&#x27;s definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and didn&#x27;t it didn&#x27;t work for me.  I have been going to a dermatolist for laser and that is still the better way for me.  I gave this products numerous tries in different areas and many took out about 1/8 of hair if that.  I returned Item</li>
            <li> I first want to say that this is such a wonderful company. I&#x27;m so glad I purchased my cartridge from them. So here&#x27;s what happened...&lt;br /&gt;I received my cartridge the other day, opened it and had to try it out immediately. It worked great. A few days later I got myself all geared up to do my treatments on some other areas but I kept getting an error message regarding the color of my skin (which is pasty white). I was frustrated and called the Silk N&#x27; company to find out what I could do to fix the issue. I had already tried everything the representative said to do, but still it didn&#x27;t work. I got on Amazon and contacted the seller of the cartridge Beauty By Choice and set in place a replacement. They immediately put the replacement in the mail and had it delivered in a day or two and I was to return the defective one. So, here&#x27;s the kicker. While waiting for the replacement, I decided to give the supposed defective one another try, but in the same room I was in when it worked. To make a long story short it worked. I was the one doing something wrong. Now I know I was in too bright of a room and the sensor was picking up my shadow thinking it was dark skin. Although I had tried this the other day, the light was still too bright. I felt like an idiot and immediately contacted Beauty By Choice to let them know what had happened and that I was going to keep the cartridge I thought was defective as well as the replacement. I asked them to first, please forgive me and that it was my mistake, and to please charge me for the replacement. I received the nicest and most generous reply. They were very understanding and said to please keep the replacement as a gift. Who does that anymore? It&#x27;s so very hard to find good customer service let alone such kindness and generosity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;m here to tell anyone having problems with their cartridge, try doing your treatments in a not so bright room. Don&#x27;t give up as I did. Also, know that you&#x27;re buying your cartridge from a great company with the highest integrity. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.the highest integrity. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I am still not sure if this product works.  I have been using it for several months now and have seen a lessening of hair growth.  However, I have my doubts of long term results.  Some areas have been done over 10 times and if I miss a spot, hair returns.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Sensepil for over a year and still love it. I&#x27;m female with course dark hair everywhere, and professional laser hair removal is just too expensive. The Sensepil works slower but it definitely reduces hair growth. And I can order refill cartridges as my budget allows for maintenance treatments.</li>
            <li> Cartridge fit Silk&#x27;n SensEpil machine and worked perfectly; could not be happier with product and price.  Product is exactly as stated in description.</li>
            <li> Usually a light cartridge will do at least 2 legs and 2 arms.  this one only lasted long enough for half a leg.  Sometimes you get a short lived one; you take your chances</li>
            <li> I have bought the refills over and over again and they cost $50.00!&lt;br /&gt;I called sensepil several times,(after finally finding a phone number) starting as soon as I first used it, as it kept shutting down after about a minute.&lt;br /&gt;They went through several responses, it&#x27;s a shadow, it&#x27;s too bright, have you been in the sun?&lt;br /&gt;I kept calling and the second time she listened to the sound of the machine on the phone!&lt;br /&gt;She sent me another refill, after I sent in proof that I bought it from an authorized retailer that met with their approval.(I had to send in a copy of my last order)&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I STILL HAVE HAIR</li>
            <li> Worked fine with my IPL device. Does what it says.</li>
            <li> When I got my first cartridge that came with the devise it was fine and had good use form it for several month to a year. The replacement cartridge was faulty and when out in 3 uses. And the uses were very minimal not a late area but small. Very unhappy about the product.</li>
            <li> I originally came across a good review for silk&#x27;n sensepil while researching another hair removal product. I started researching the sensepil &amp; decided to try it. I have fair skin, medium brown hair on my underarms &amp; bikini area (blonde hair in other areas). According to instructions, I should see best results on my dark hairs, but may see some on even the lighter hairs with extra sessions.     The price seemed very high (here &amp; on the manufacture&#x27;s site), but I was able to find someone selling a unit that worked, but was no longer needed on an auction site for $200 without a lamp cartridge. I purchased 2 cartridges here. I received my auctioned unit &amp; cartridges within one day of each other. Still not cheap, but more reasonable.     My unit did not have any limit on how high I could set it for my initial uses. For those of you that get yours new &amp; are complaining about the limit... Press &amp; hold the + and - buttons simultaneously until you here 2 consecutive beeps to remove or reset this feature. The instructions to do this can be found in your instruction manual &amp; on the manufacture&#x27;s website.    I started under my arms on the setting 3. I could feel it snap, but it wasn&#x27;t bad (I raised the setting to 4 &amp; 5 on future uses. I now use 5 under my arms with no problems).    I then did my bikini area. As the unit heats up from multiple snaps one right after each other, it gets a little painful here. I raised up to 4 &amp; 5 on later uses, but 5 was too much so I went back &amp; stayed at a 4.     I have been doing this every week to a week &amp; a half, for about 5 times in just under 2 months). There is a small spot on my chin with light blonde hairs that I will occasionally tweeze. I zapped it too.     My underarms are noticeably better. The hair growth used to resemble an oval, now there is no hair at the top &amp; bottom (more square shaped now). Inside the square that still has some hair, there is probably 60% less than before.     In my bikini area there is about 40% less hair. In the inner thighs where there was not much hair has almost none now. The rest of the hair (pubic area) was more dense &amp; seems a little more stubborn. Hopefully this will improve greatly on future zaps.     On my chin, no difference. The area where I get those few hairs on my chin is small. The directions say that best results come from having multiple zaps next to each other. Since I can cover the hair there with one zap &amp; it is blonde, I am not sure I will get any results here. I have also found reviews saying that use on the facial area of a female may stimulate hair growth (females have dormant facial hair?).  Not sure if I will continue trying to zap this area now. It is one thing to use up some of the zaps without reducing the hair... it is another thing to increase the thing you are trying to eliminate. Back to tweezing when needed.     I may try to do my legs in the future, but as they are mostly blonde... I have not bothered yet. I would love for them to be hair free, but at least I am getting results from the areas that I expected. More than likely once I am done with my treatments, I will either give to a friend or resell the unit without a cartridge.     I gave 4 stars as my rating. It is unlikely to work on light hairs, but they are up front about this. Not sure how i feel knowing that it could actually cause facial hair to start growing on females  The hair &amp; skin that fits the recommended profile seems to work well. The results are similar to expensive doctor office laser treatments, but for less money &amp; can be done at home. Room for improvement, but overall good for what it can do.</li>
            <li> Package came on time...&lt;br /&gt;This &amp;#34;FDA approved&amp;#34; burned my whole legs, the machine is suppose to detect skin color to prevent burns and it did not work...&lt;br /&gt;I ended up having to rush to the dermatologist and encounter unexpected expenses in creams, ointments, visit...&lt;br /&gt;I still have scars from when I did this procedure 5 weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t be a fool trying to save some money and screwing yourself over... pay a professional...&lt;br /&gt;I sincerely regret this...</li>
            <li> This product has worked miracles! I love the Silk&#x27;n SensEpil. It is great, even in comparison to getting laser treatments at a spa. Much cheaper this way and I actually saw a better result! I have recommended it to many of my friends!</li>
            <li> I am giving this product 4/5 stars because of the price. I&#x27;ve had my hair removal device for a few years now and these cartridges were always around $50 (not including s&amp;h on some websites). I&#x27;m so glad to finally see a price drop - Amazon is currently selling them for $33.32.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To view my review for the hair removal device itself, look up \\&quot;Silk&#x27;n SensEpil Hair Removal\\&quot; or click: [[ASIN:B0039C6AS2 Silk&#x27;n SensEpil Hair Removal Unit COMBO PACK]]</li>
            <li> I have been waiting to review this product, basically because I wanted to make sure that it would work, but I needed to wait until the cartridge needed to be changed first.  My first cartridge that came with the unit lasted through 3 sessions of doing forearms, underarms and lower legs and part of a fourth session.  I changed out the cartridge, which is super easy, and the new cartridge worked.  I had read some reviews on these cartridges that said that the cartridge didn&#x27;t work, but I think that was when people bought a bunch together (like 3 or 4 cartrigdes at a time) and not from this seller.  So that is pretty much it,  if it works then it gets 5 stars.  :)</li>
            <li> The pulses provided in the cartridges averaged about 12 compared to the advertised over 750 pulses that in the advertising. Not very good value for $27.95 plus the cost of the unit. I just ordered two more cartridges and I&#x27;ll be interested to see if these do any better than the ones that came with the machine.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a almost a year. It has slowed the hair growth and in some places it seems to have stopped it but still I await the day I no longer need to shave. Fingers crossed.</li>
            <li> I did not realize you have to stock up on these things to get results.It was no problem to order.</li>
            <li> Although i haved only used this once, seemed to work well.  I really wont know for a couple more months,</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this particular item.  The cartridges that originally came with the machine was fine.  This one I just used and the light was not nearly as powerful, it also wouldn&#x27;t work on many areas, showing as if the skin was too dark (never had a problem with the other ones, and have not been tanning).  This also was manufactured in Israel, I don&#x27;t know where the others are made but perhaps that is what the difference is.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and replacement lamps and although you can see small result, you would have to shed $40 every second time you use that machine. The description says lamp lasts 750 impulses - that&#x27;s outright lie! If you combine the cost of the machine and the replacement lamp it will cost you more than doing it at the salon. And I am not mentioning your time, because that&#x27;s worth a lot too. At the salon they will do everything fast. Here, with this \\&quot;magic\\&quot; little  SensEpil you would have to spend three time as much time as at the salon, plus you have to do it yourself, it cost more money and you get less result! Final point: Do not buy!!!!!!</li>
            <li> After three treatments two weeks apart my very coarse dark hair on my legs was softer, slower growing with some bare spots.  I&#x27;m thrilled!  Where has this been all my life.</li>
            <li> In the description says that this item do 750 pulses. Not truth. Tree days after I got it wasn&#x27;t working. Maybe 500 if so. Not happy with this item at all.😡😡😡</li>
            <li> I have bought the lamps (I have the Silk&#x27;n SensEpit) and my wife told me that the 2 lamps did not work, from the start with no reason.  I have  not reached the supplier thought to check if I can get a refund for it or to get replacement for those 2 lamps.  I live in Saudi Arabia, and there is no way for me to send them back since the cost will be more than the price for the lamp them selves.  In addition, it is written on the lamp that the average use is about 270 beam strokes, but that is misleading, since most of them do not live upto the claim.  In fact, many last less than 240 strokes.    Otherwise, the machine is amazing, and the lamps work great.</li>
            <li> Love these, haven&#x27;t gotten this order but have gotten them before at the store. Wish they lasted longer though, kinda pricey but worth it!</li>
            <li> I have no choice but to like it because I need it to use my machine :)  However, the product works well enough to my liking.  These cartridges are super expensive though.  Oh well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product through GMA&#x27;s discounted program about a year and a half ago after reviewing it on this website.  I have very dark, coarse hair that grows very quickly.  Because I shaved my legs every day, my skin was becoming very dry.  I had previously gone to a dermatologist and had my upper lip treated and so I knew that this should be a good treatment option.  When I asked pricing for treatments at an aesthetician&#x27;s office, I found that I would need at least 6 treatments (laser) at $300 per leg.  Wow!  Needless to say, I was thrilled to have found this item!  I am still using the product and have really diminished hair growth over my legs and bikini area.  I only have to spot treat but even in those spots the hair grows very slowly and is very fine.  I&#x27;m not very regular in my treatments any longer as the hair is not bothersome.  My only issue is that when I purchased the cartridges in bulk (3 at a time) I would invariably have at least one cartridge be a dud and would only give me a minimal amount of pulses rather than the 750 promised.  I have since started purchasing only one cartridge at a time and have not had any problems.  I&#x27;m not sure why the directions state that using the product on the face can stimulate growth.  I had the same kind of technology used about 20 years ago on my upper lip and it got rid of the hair.  The treatments lasted about 15 years.  I wonder if the issue is more of a concern of eye damage from the bright light.  I know I had to wear eye covering to protect my eyes whenever I had treatments on my face years ago.  I&#x27;m happy with this product and would recommend to anyone with dark hair they want to get rid of on their body.</li>
            <li> Received this product fast and it was as described.</li>
            <li> Came broken disappointed</li>
            <li> Fit the SensEpil I have and works like a charm.  Would love it if they weren&#x27;t so expensive, but as long as they work I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> it fits like the original cartridge. The one came with the lamp lasted years for me that I expect this one too.</li>
            <li> This was one of the best purchases I have made ever.  I was so sick of shaving every day, so these cartridges are helping me eliminate unwanted hair growth and the need for razors.  I&#x27;ve completed five sessions so far (every two weeks) and am just starting my second cartridge.  These are well worth the cost because hair removal in a salon would cost so much more, and has the added inconvenience of having to go into a salon when appointments are available.</li>
            <li> This product is great for hair removal. I&#x27;m not sure if the hair removal lasts forever or not but it has definately thinned out the areas that I have used it on. I now require less shaving than before and the hair does not come back as thick. It seems like every time I use it less and less hair comes back.</li>
            <li> Bulb arrived right on time and in good condition. I have been very happy with the unit itself. The first bulb lasted a long while and I have had very good results with facial hair not growing back.</li>
            <li> You can notice a slight difference a day after use. You just have to be patient with it. I&#x27;ve used it about four times in a year span, again, it is a hassle but I would definitely say its worth it.</li>
            <li> I love using it. I have gone from shaving every 3 days to shaving once every 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Product is same as direct from manufacture.  Price is great, arrives fast and I am in Alaska, and just reorder when I need another one.</li>
            <li> I heard reviews on other refill cartridges that they didn&#x27;t last as long if bought from certain suppliers...these defiantly work like a charm.</li>
            <li> Have been using Silk&#x27;n SensEpil for several months &amp; am very happy with the results. The hair on my bikini line is gone. Hair on my legs continues to decrease. It takes awhile for all the hairs to go through the growth cycle &amp; come to the surface so you can treat it. Have discovered something very important about the bulb. It will eventually quit flashing. Don&#x27;t just throw it away. Turn off the machine, let it cool a few minutes, then try again. If it still won&#x27;t work, wait about 30 minutes. I just did that &amp; got about 20 more flashes before it stopped working. I&#x27;ll wait &amp; try again in a few minutes. The bulbs are expensive so be sure it is spent before discarding. Also, keep a record of how many times &amp; areas done so you have an idea when bulb should be spent. I may have thrown away some bulbs with remaining flashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year and a half every two weeks as directed and it has removed about 90% of the hair on each area. Works great, definitely so happy I bought it, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I ordered two cartridges for my sensepil unit. One the machine read as already spent and would not work and the other one was defective and would not work. I received a shipping lable and returned them and received a full refund. The merchant is honorable and I will consider purchasing again. I just wish they could have replaced the items with working cartridges.</li>
            <li> I purchased this refill cartridge for my Silk&#x27;n SenseEpil unit and used the cartridge only 3 times when the unit beeped and said I needed to replace it.  I&#x27;m wondering if it was a defective cartridge?  The one that came with the unit when I bought it lasted for several months before needing to be replaced.  I use the unit once a month for 10 to 15 minutes at a time, so really, it should have lasted a lot longer.  I need another but I am afraid to order from the same supplier.</li>
            <li> Products are as listed. Arrived in excellent condition. Product at very nice price. Good buying experience. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I was not pleased with this product it did not last but about 252 pulses of the 750 by the manufacture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a bulb before and it lasted as long as discribed. The second bulb that I ordered didn&#x27;t even last half the time as the first one. Going to order another bulb. Hopefully it&#x27;s not a crapshoot of getting good ones and then getting bad ones. Other than that the product does stop the hair from growing back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 months now. The good news is that it really does work! It doesn&#x27;t take long to treat the areas you want. I&#x27;ve used this for bikini line, under arms, and legs. There are patches of hair missing as of 3 months. I&#x27;m hoping this is just human error or some areas may take longer to treat. I&#x27;m not sure. I&#x27;m really hoping that the patches will go away. It looks pretty funny right now, but I&#x27;m willing to give it sometime to find out. The reviews I read before buying this product made the results sound very promising. So I guess the jury is still out. We will see what the next three months brings.</li>
            <li> great product and i am very happy with the results.  Def worth the money and investment.  I have been using product for some time and have seen the results.</li>
            <li> Super, super, super!!  I needed a replacement, and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  This cartridge is the one with the super capacity number of laser pulses.  Definitely pleased and will buy again when needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad the price came down on these because I didn&#x27;t realize when I first bought the product that I&#x27;d have to go through so many cartridges/so much more $. I do have to say now that I could put on my Brazilian string bikini in the dead of winter at a moment&#x27;s notice having not shaved and feel confident knowing the hair I do have would not be noticeable. Actually it probably wouldn&#x27;t come to my mind at all now. It&#x27;s funny when you&#x27;re used to not having a problem you forget to be appreciative that you don&#x27;t have it. The other nice thing is that you stop having that awful spiky leg hair when you have goosebumps. We snuck into my friend&#x27;s apartment building pool at 2 am and played a game of coed water polo and I was definitely pleased to not have that spiky leg hair anymore like a few of the other girls did in the cold.</li>
            <li> After paying too much for hair removal at a professional Salon for my underarm hair, I invested in this and wish I would have in the beginning.  The results are not as Fast at a professional salon, but much cheaper. So slower results are OK, I still get the same results in the privacy of my own home.  Strongly recommend it. but the cartridges go fast, so buy a few extra at time of purchase.</li>
            <li> Works great! Silk&#x27;n SensEpil has completely made a different in the amount of hair coming back use after use. Anyone with heavy hair follicles and would like to shave less, I&#x27;d strongly recommend this product. I&#x27;ve always had to shave my legs every day and now I can go a week with minimal growth. I&#x27;m fair skinned with dark black, coarse hair on my lower legs. It has now reduced the amount of hair and made it less dense.</li>
            <li> The system works.  It gets rid of unwanted hair.  But it takes many treatments if you have strong hair. Working on my 7th cartridge now. Unfortunately they burn out really quick.  You get 2 legs out of the cartridge.  Not a whole body.</li>
            <li> Not seeing the results I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Cartridge worked fine when replaced.  This is the start of hair removal with second cartridge.  Still weighing in on whether this device actually gets rid of hair permanently.  The growth seems slower, but the jury is still out.</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time. This product felt tolerable as far as pain level was concerned. I am a white woman who wears fair skin toned makeup (not medium or beige) I&#x27;m pretty light skinned and I&#x27;m using this on dark brown/blackish course facial hair in the side burn area, upper and side lip area and on a few stray chin hairs. In addition I&#x27;m using this while using oral medication that should be shutting down androgens that cause me to have any new facial hair growth. I&#x27;ve used them for a year and it has slowed down the hair growth speed, but I ordered this product to kill that hairs grown prior to starting this medicaiton.I have done 6 treatments 1 weeks apart and at this time I have seen zero difference in the hair growth speed or reduction in hair. the light stopped working saying the cartridge needed refilling only 1/4 way through my 6th use which happened more quickly than I thought given that I&#x27;m only using it on my face not my entire body. I expected it to last through 7 uses. I ordered the refill to see if I simply need more sessions, but if I do not see changes after this refill I will update my review reducing the star level if it works I will update and increase the star level. As my skin tone and hair color make me a prime candidate for this product if it does not work for me I doubt it will work for you!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my sensepil and when I recieved in the box was mangeled and the product was broken. There was not enough packaging to protect the item. I contacted amazon and they quickly issued a refund and I am awaiting a new product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for face and arms to use and you can see the result after a few time using.</li>
            <li> Although I feel these are too highly priced, I do believe the product does the job. They are incredibly easy to install; a quick and painless process.</li>
            <li> Excellent, very high quality for the second time I bought this product and I&#x27;ll come back later&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;Excellent Excellent Excellent Excellent</li>
            <li> I love my Sensepil so this was perfect and affordable. Just as described only wish I had ordered more. Will definitely buy again.</li>
