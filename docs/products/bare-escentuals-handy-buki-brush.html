    <ol>
            <li>Great brush!  </li>
            <li>This is great for applying any face powder :)  </li>
            <li>This brush gives better, even coverage!</li>
            <li>Love this brush  for blush and bronzer!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>More of it ends up everywhere else than on your face.</li>
            <li>They have better brushes at the dollar store.</li>
            <li>I buy a new one every couple of years and this is a great price.</li>
            <li>I ordered this brush because many years ago (maybe more than 10 years ago), I started using the Bare Escentuals Handy Buki brush that came with a collection that I received as a gift.</li>
            <li>Nice brush... works very well.</li>
            <li>This one, however, was not just like the original.</li>
            <li>not even full star, the brush I recieved was cheap plastic, I returned it for refund.</li>
            <li>I love the BUKI brushes but generally they only have short handles so this was perfect with the easier to use fit handle.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>I really love the even coverage it provides with my bare minerals.  </li>
            <li>This is the exact Bare Escentuals brush that I&#x27;ve paid much more for at Sephora.</li>
            <li>I like it better than the bigger kabuki brush because it gives alot more coverage if you&#x27;re using it for bare minerals foundation.</li>
            <li>The item came packaged in sealed plastic wrap pretty much exactly how it would from Sephora.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush and handle separated first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Applies make-up better than cheap brushes and there for saves you money because you end up using less.</li>
            <li>Like the way it applies blush, don&#x27;t have to sweep the brush over the compact several times to get a good amount for application, once is enough.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t apply make up very well either.</li>
            <li>Keep it clean and it will last.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this brush because the bristles are soft yet compact enough to quickly buff my bare minerals compact foundation and mineral veil around my entire face!</li>
            <li>Should have replaced my old one sooner...</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used this brush for years to apply my Bare Escentuals powder foundation</li>
            <li>I will just have to hope that with proper care, my old one holds up until I can find one that is its equal!</li>
            <li>After reading reviews, i thought this was similar to the bare mineral foundation brush.</li>

The item came packaged in sealed plastic wrap pretty much exactly how it would from Sephora.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this brush for years to apply my Bare Escentuals powder foundation and it&#x27;s still my go-to brush. I have tried other brushes here and there, but always come back to this one. Sturdy, long-lasting, and holds up well to weekly cleanings.</li>
            <li> Great brush!  Should have replaced my old one sooner... This brush gives better, even coverage!</li>
            <li> Nice brush... works very well.</li>
            <li> This pulled apart when I was taking it out of the wrapper. My husband glued it together with Gorilla glue. Disappointing!!</li>
            <li> I enjoy this brush because the bristles are soft yet compact enough to quickly buff my bare minerals compact foundation and mineral veil around my entire face!</li>
            <li> Upon opening Handel is loose almost broken. After reading reviews, i thought this was similar to the bare mineral foundation brush. It is not. It is actually small and firm. Its not great quality. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> The bristles poke my face. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This is the same name brand brush that one would buy at the store.</li>
            <li> This is great for applying any face powder :)  I like it better than the bigger kabuki brush because it gives alot more coverage if you&#x27;re using it for bare minerals foundation.</li>
            <li> Terrible quality. As soon as I used the brush, it started shedding everywhere. It doesn&#x27;t apply make up very well either. More of it ends up everywhere else than on your face.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush because many years ago (maybe more than 10 years ago), I started using the Bare Escentuals Handy Buki brush that came with a collection that I received as a gift. This one, however, was not just like the original. The brush fibers are longer, and possibly a bit softer. It isn&#x27;t bad, but it isn&#x27;t exactly what I wanted.  I will use it, but not for the purpose I intended.  I wanted it as a cream blush brush, but instead I will be using it for my cream illuminator.  I will just have to hope that with proper care, my old one holds up until I can find one that is its equal!</li>
            <li> the bristles are so tight together they don&#x27;t blend or pick up the powder at all.</li>
            <li> not even full star, the brush I recieved was cheap plastic, I returned it for refund. They have better brushes at the dollar store.</li>
            <li> Love this brush  for blush and bronzer!</li>
            <li> This is my second brush and I love it! Keep it clean and it will last.</li>
            <li> The brush and handle separated first time I used it. It appears the glue didn&#x27;t work.  I don&#x27;t want to hassle with returning it so I guess I will re glue it myself. Sorta a bummer.</li>
