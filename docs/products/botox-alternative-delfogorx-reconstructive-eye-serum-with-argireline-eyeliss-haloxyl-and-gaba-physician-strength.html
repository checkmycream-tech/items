    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Really impressed with this serum.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my fifties and those years show even under my best makeup job.</li>
            <li>but the results are awesome.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s a win win with this miracle eye serum.</li>
            <li>I tried this because of the great reviews,  however after three months of use I have to say it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>Even better is that my boyfriend is seeing improvement too.</li>
            <li>Some of it had leaked out of the bottle when I received it and it will not pump out of the bottle, I have to take the top off to use.</li>
            <li>and so does my concealer on top.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased.  </li>
            <li>I just brought 4 more bottles.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad cuz my husband was going to divorce me over this.</li>
            <li>I just love it, love it, already posted on my Facebook.</li>
            <li>Those crows feet that I used to cake with concealer are so much more smooth and those puffy eyes</li>
            <li>but this one is just as good and much cheaper</li>
            <li>I have been using the elite serum brand for the eyes which I liked very much, but I needed to get another tube, so</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t see the moisture retention to help fine lines.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s peptide rich, just like the Peter Thomas Roth, but it has a therapeutic effect and not just a temporary.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, most of the products I&#x27;ve purchased don&#x27;t live up to the hype.  </li>
            <li>This serum makes my under eye area look and feel fresh and awake and never irritated.</li>
            <li>They started right underneath my eye and have since spread so that when I smile, they extend about 1/2 an inch out from the corner of my eye.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t help with puffiness and I am just not seeing a bright eyed look like I did from my other product.  </li>
            <li>Not any more, my skin looks refreshed and when I applied this stuff it felt kind of refreshing, maybe a little stingy (I have dry skin)</li>
            <li>The thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the fact that the results are only temporary, which is great, but I still wake up every morning with the same lines.  </li>
            <li>Let me tell you, when I first heard about DelfogoRx I was like, &amp;#34;Who?&amp;#34; I had never heard of this product or the company.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve got wrinkles, really?!  </li>
            <li>the difference in my skin is pretty noticeable.</li>
            <li>I am a sucker for new products, Every month I&#x27;m able to cash in on free goods from Ulta because I&#x27;ve accumulated so many points.  </li>
            <li>It was more smooth, less dry and appeared to be more rejuvenated.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for all my friends!</li>
            <li>I used to have every morning, not so much</li>
            <li>This stuff really, really works.</li>
            <li>He wants me to age gracefully</li>
            <li>Very drying on my skin - would not recommend</li>
            <li>It is keeping my upper lashes tighter, and reduces the look of my fine lines, which is saying a lot because I am much older.</li>
            <li>so I am going back to my beloved Intaglio eye cream with glycolic acid, thick, rich &amp; creamy.</li>
            <li>The new elite serum works wonders!</li>
            <li>look older</li>
            <li>Glad I can look like a normal aged 27 year old again.</li>
            <li>It also feels good to have one less thing to worry about in my busy daily schedule.</li>
            <li>Well worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li>I must say, as a 27 year old man who works as hard as I do, it really felt good to finally find a product that not only worked but was affordable.</li>
            <li>but that was as far as it went.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found this serum, however, offers all the benefits I&#x27;m looking for.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 53 with dry skin, dark circles,  so perhaps I need something far more moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I barely have any darkness below my eyes.</li>
            <li>This is the first product I have spent my money on and actually saw CONTINUED results from.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try the DelfogoRX Reconstructive Eye Serum after reading the ingredients and recommendations, also the price was half of my other eye cream from Intaglio.</li>
            <li>It is smoother, the discoloration is less and the fine lines are less noticeable.</li>
            <li>but now I don&#x27;t have to consume so much, and worry about my eyes getting all dark and puffy looking.</li>
            <li>First off the container leaks and comes out underneath the silver housing that holds the pump so it gets wasted.  </li>
            <li>After the first few applications I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re plumped out so that they look less deep or what, but it really doesn&#x27;t matter.  </li>

            <li> After testing it out, it doesn&#x27;t aggravate my skin condition, and I&#x27;m seeing that I have less dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have tried both the HYLEXIN® CLINICAL STRENGTH DARK CIRCLE ERASER by Bremenn as well as the OLAY DARK CIRCLES CREAM, both to little or no avail.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Really impressed with this serum. It is keeping my upper lashes tighter, and reduces the look of my fine lines, which is saying a lot because I am much older. I have been using the elite serum brand for the eyes which I liked very much, but I needed to get another tube, so I thought that this was my chance to give this product a try. I still like the elite serum product but this one is just as good and much cheaper</li>
            <li> I was excited to try the DelfogoRX Reconstructive Eye Serum after reading the ingredients and recommendations, also the price was half of my other eye cream from Intaglio. First off the container leaks and comes out underneath the silver housing that holds the pump so it gets wasted.  Also the serum consistency in my bottle is like runny liquid and thin like water.  It doesn&#x27;t help with puffiness and I am just not seeing a bright eyed look like I did from my other product.  I also don&#x27;t see the moisture retention to help fine lines.  It actually makes me feel/look older so I am not sure of the benefits at this point. I am frustrated with the messy bottle and runny product so I am going back to my beloved Intaglio eye cream with glycolic acid, thick, rich &amp; creamy. Well worth the extra money.  Sorry I do not favor this product.</li>
            <li> did nothing at all for me!</li>
            <li> I must say, as a 27 year old man who works as hard as I do, it really felt good to finally find a product that not only worked but was affordable. It also feels good to have one less thing to worry about in my busy daily schedule. I have always been one to shun vanity but the circles under my eyes were getting so dark my co-workers and clients began making raccoon jokes. I have tried both the HYLEXIN® CLINICAL STRENGTH DARK CIRCLE ERASER by Bremenn as well as the OLAY DARK CIRCLES CREAM, both to little or no avail. There was a slight lightening after about a week but that was as far as it went. This is the first product I have spent my money on and actually saw CONTINUED results from. I barely have any darkness below my eyes. Glad I can look like a normal aged 27 year old again. Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a little hesitant about trying this out, because I have very sensitive skin and psoriasis. After testing it out, it doesn&#x27;t aggravate my skin condition, and I&#x27;m seeing that I have less dark circles under my eyes. Even better is that my boyfriend is seeing improvement too. He didn&#x27;t want to use a &amp;#34;woman&#x27;s&amp;#34; beauty product, but I convinced him otherwise. His circles were worse than mine, and his skin is already dark, so they just looked awful.</li>
            <li> Only used this for 2 weeks so I don&#x27;t know yet if it&#x27;s going to work.  Some of it had leaked out of the bottle when I received it and it will not pump out of the bottle, I have to take the top off to use. It is gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li> This reconstructive eye serum works! I&#x27;m anemic, so I&#x27;m always low in iron which in turn creates dark circles under my eyes if I haven&#x27;t consumed enough iron for the day. Don&#x27;t get me wrong I do intake iron everyday, but now I don&#x27;t have to consume so much, and worry about my eyes getting all dark and puffy looking. This toned down my dark eyes after two days no joke, worked for me.</li>
            <li> Review is for Delfogo Reconstructive Eye Serum. On the bottle it states the size as 0.5 Oz.  I tried this because of the great reviews,  however after three months of use I have to say it&#x27;s just ok. Product is very thin, like putting water on your eyes, it does dry fast and no irritation for my sensitive eyes.  I&#x27;m 53 with dry skin, dark circles,  so perhaps I need something far more moisturizing.  I like the pump bottle for sanitation, but will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> Hey guys! You&#x27;ve got to check out this serum! Within one week(yes,one week!!),I saw a noticeable improvement with my face composition,moisture,and wrinkles! The new elite serum works wonders! I highly recommend this for all my friends!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my fifties and those years show even under my best makeup job. Let me tell you, when I first heard about DelfogoRx I was like, &amp;#34;Who?&amp;#34; I had never heard of this product or the company.  But my girlfriend was getting rid of her wrinkles in no time at all so I decided to take a leap of faith. Those crows feet that I used to cake with concealer are so much more smooth and those puffy eyes I used to have every morning, not so much anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why it works, just that it does. Some of the other reviewers say that Dr. Oz recommends the ingredients.  Maybe it&#x27;s the combination of ingredients that are used.  Either way, it&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> Goes on well and so does my concealer on top. I have not had this product long enough to see any visible changes. My no.1 concern are dark under eye circles. I am trying to find something that might help other than the $5,000 surgical repair.quote. I had facial laser treatment and my eyes became so swollen after the puffiness subsided I was left with loose skin under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I am a devoted user of the DelfogoRx Reconstructive Eye Serum. Since I started using my DelfogoRx eye serum, I’ve noticed an overall change in appearance to my face. This serum makes my under eye area look and feel fresh and awake and never irritated. It only took a few weeks for me to look and feel a reduction in the dark puffy circle under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Leaked out, didn&#x27;t get to use it :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie, I&#x27;m a little vain.  I am specifically vain about these little wrinkles that keep getting deeper in the corners of my eyes.  They started right underneath my eye and have since spread so that when I smile, they extend about 1/2 an inch out from the corner of my eye.  Anyway, I got some Amazon credit and decided to buy this cream.  I chose on this one because of the Argireline that it contains.  I&#x27;ve noticed big improvements over the last few weeks.  They&#x27;re not gone, but they&#x27;re not as deep as they were.  I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re plumped out so that they look less deep or what, but it really doesn&#x27;t matter.  I&#x27;m pleased.  Those wrinkles drove me crazy, I&#x27;m 29 and I&#x27;ve got wrinkles, really?!  Not any more, my skin looks refreshed and when I applied this stuff it felt kind of refreshing, maybe a little stingy (I have dry skin) but the results are awesome.</li>
            <li> I am a sucker for new products, Every month I&#x27;m able to cash in on free goods from Ulta because I&#x27;ve accumulated so many points.  Unfortunately, most of the products I&#x27;ve purchased don&#x27;t live up to the hype.  The closest I&#x27;ve come is Peter Thomas Roth Instant Firm Eye.  The thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the fact that the results are only temporary, which is great, but I still wake up every morning with the same lines.  I&#x27;ve found this serum, however, offers all the benefits I&#x27;m looking for.  It&#x27;s peptide rich, just like the Peter Thomas Roth, but it has a therapeutic effect and not just a temporary.  I have been using it according to the instructions for three weeks and the difference in my skin is pretty noticeable. It is smoother, the discoloration is less and the fine lines are less noticeable. I like to use the Peter Thomas Roth in the am for the instant effects before I head off to work and the Delfogo Recon Eye Serum in the evening for the long term benefits.</li>
            <li> This stuff really, really works. I saw the difference in my eyes in 3 days. I just brought 4 more bottles. I&#x27;m hoping the price stays the same or I will just freak out. Don&#x27;t listen to the negative remarks ... They are not true. I tried everything my next step was eye surgery for about $3000. I don&#x27;t have to do it now and I&#x27;m glad cuz my husband was going to divorce me over this. He wants me to age gracefully and I said not with with the bags under my eyes. So it&#x27;s a win win with this miracle eye serum. I just love it, love it, already posted on my Facebook.</li>
            <li> Very drying on my skin - would not recommend</li>
            <li> Just got so only used for a few days now but seems to be helping my dark cicles.</li>
            <li> no change at all after 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I gave DelfogoRx Eye Serum a go after becoming frustrated with other serums on the market that failed to deliver guarantees. The Reconstructive Eye Serum contains Argireline, Resveratrol and Acai Berry, ingredients all recommended by Dr. Oz.  After the first few applications I noticed a difference. not with my wrinkles, but in the texture in my skin.  It was more smooth, less dry and appeared to be more rejuvenated.  My eyes looked visibly lighter and were less puffy after waking up. I have now been using DelfogoRx for over a month and the wrinkles and crow’s feet around my eyes are less noticeable. They have not disappeared but there is a noticeable difference from before I started using the product to now.</li>
