            <li>Meanwhile, may all your searches for items with Amazon be pleasant.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that if use the lotion or this body wash by itself, my results aren&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li>Yea I&#x27;m sure it cleans, yadda yadda, but damn this thing smells incredible.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin feeling moist and my skin feels good every time that I use it.  </li>
            <li>Loved Aveeno products forever.</li>
            <li>it worked really good.</li>
            <li>because it worked so good</li>
            <li>Good value for money.</li>
            <li>I have always liked their products and this was a great deal to boot.  </li>
            <li>The body wash is creamy and your body feels good afterward.</li>
            <li>but it looks quite good for me.</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon is almost as good for the 2 pack as I can find in my area for one.</li>
            <li>Makes our skin feel so good.  </li>

            <li>smell really good.</li>
            <li>This  body wash is good and helps moisturize your skin....</li>
            <li>Aveeno seems great, but it does more harm than good.</li>
            <li>It also foams up nicely for a pleasant bathing experience.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more of these for sure as the price is the best through Amazon.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended Aveeno and I have been very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>Smells great, cleans me up, nothing more to say.</li>

            <li>It smells incredibly good and feels so nice on my skin.</li>
            <li>Great for people with sensitive skin! :D</li>
            <li>It also has a very pleasant aroma and keeps you feeling fresh and rejuvenated.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan!!</li>
            <li>I started using Aveeno a month ago and simply love it!</li>
            <li>I really love this body wash!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I did!  </li>
            <li>Nice neutral scent that even my husband doesn&#x27;t mind, and he hates most fragrances!  </li>
            <li>Feel really, really great on your skin and does not dry it out, combined with the lotion perfect match...</li>
            <li>It leaves your sking very smooth, I like the smell  and the price was really good</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE - I&#x27;ve been using all these products for awhile now, and these three products have been amazing on my skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels AMAZING after using this product.</li>
            <li>I looked for it after I saw amazing results in my daughter&#x27;s eczema using [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It is an excellent exfoliant and is gentle on your skin.  </li>
            <li>I make my own bath goods now.</li>
            <li>nice  works well for my skin</li>
            <li>I liked the Aveeno body moisturizing wash..</li>
            <li>I liked the fact that it came in a package of 2</li>
            <li>the two chemicals and the Tetrasodium EDTA is toxic when ingested but has been shown that when inhaled in an aerosol form it can&#x27;t reach a level of toxicity that causes any kind ofadverse reactions.  </li>
            <li>I catch myself using more than I need to because it feels so good on my skin</li>
            <li>Even my husband uses it-wish he&#x27;d buy his own.</li>
            <li>Makes nice suds while it moisturizes.</li>
            <li>Creats a nice soapy froth that I can shave my legs with, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin itchy.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin feel smooth, very nice.  </li>
            <li>Great product, just a significant more pricey on Amazon for some reason.  </li>
            <li>The scent is really mild and very nice....</li>
            <li>Fragrance is nice, skin feels good and clean.</li>
            <li>I know there are a lot of natural skin care products out there, but this one works the best and gives you not just the maximum results, but maximum permanent results.</li>
            <li>Love that this is nourishing for my skin and smells nice.  </li>
            <li>Amazing :)</li>
            <li>the one that isn&#x27;t fragrance-free is a bit strong to me); and this product leaves your skin feeling very clean and fairly moisturized.</li>
            <li>Aveeno does prove the skin is clean and the smell of this soap smell really good.</li>
            <li>This is the best gentle soap that works great on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>After washing, my skin feels very comfortable, and there is none of that sticky feeling that comes afterwards with most soaps.</li>
            <li>I recommend the combination of all these products as a great routine, and reasonable expense for skin</li>
            <li>Still one of my top two body washes I prefer.</li>
            <li>I love Aveeno products and this is no exception.  </li>
            <li>honestly, my skin feels smooth all day.  </li>
            <li>I always love the feel of my skin after using this product.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, and for a guy that is saying a lot.</li>
            <li>My wife and I both love this wash.  </li>
            <li>We love the product and the price</li>
            <li>so not at all sure what its \\&quot;nourishing colloidal oatmeal\\&quot; is supposed to do for my skin, but maybe time will tell.  </li>
            <li>My bottle is out and need to get more.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Great, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance, the texture, and the texture of my skin after using it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in chemotherapy and it is one of the better moisturizing washes I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>and I love Aveeno.</li>
            <li>love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>but this is OK.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many bodywashes.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s refreshing (</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I really love it...</li>
            <li>;, i think it&#x27;s better to use during the winter time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve suffered from a skin condition for over 30 years - most any bar soap or body wash</li>
            <li>If I stay on top of them...</li>
            <li>Much better than others</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>so when we have more longer term observations, we will try to add those commentaries as well.</li>
            <li>In just a couple of days his skin looks better.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love aveeno products and this body wash.</li>
            <li>I just love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent, and how it feels on the skin after each use.  </li>
            <li>and the cure was more lotion.  </li>
            <li>most of my skin irritation vanished.  </li>
            <li>The Aveeno is great because unlike other cleansers, it doesn&#x27;t undo all the great work the roc and Bel Essence are doing.  </li>
            <li>Better than a bar of soap, smells nice, and you feel totally clean.</li>
            <li>exactly as described!!!</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry skin during the winter and have tried most moisturizing body washes and this one is the best.  </li>
            <li>However, this product helps my skin retain moisture, and leaves me feeling very clean.</li>
            <li>So worth it!!</li>
            <li>Got this for my son who has dry skin and its the best product that works for</li>
            <li>This body wash is excellent for preserving moisture during those dry winter months.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin nice and soft, feels good on my skin during and after my shower or bath.  </li>
            <li>and this does such an excellent job of keeping my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin, excellent for sensitive skin too.  </li>
            <li>I use the body wash in conjunction with Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion and the results are very good.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a body wash that would be great for my sensitive skin and not smell girly, so my husband could use it too.</li>
            <li>A nice mild scent, easy on the skin, and a great price when you sign up for regular deliveries.</li>
            <li>now that is REALLY easy to do!)and</li>
            <li>easy to use,&lt;br /&gt;last</li>
            <li>Bottle is easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>It was shipped in a envelope type box and that is easy to damage.</li>
            <li>It helps make you more clean.  </li>
            <li>A must have for people who has strong body odor.</li>
            <li>There were many to choose from and a large selection of similar items but figured this would be the best to purchase.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it has a very clean and fresh smell.  </li>
            <li>Hands down the best for me.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant, mild scent and has really helped relieve some of the itch.  </li>
            <li>This worked perfectly fine for me.</li>
            <li>The shipping and price was fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Olay and Dove body washes before, and they have worked fine, but this wash seems to make my skin feel the softest.  </li>
            <li>This has been the best so far, by far.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Since it&#x27;s never too early to start an anti-aging routine, and great skin only begins with a good cleanser like Aveeno, in addition to this</li>
            <li>I also recommend the scent free lotion also by Aveeno [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This is a great product to keep from overly drying your skin when you bathe multiple times a day.</li>
            <li>Odorless, smooth after effect,and cheap.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li>My bathing Aide was ready to run off with the bottle for her own use.  </li>
            <li>It lathers easily and rinses cleanly.  </li>
            <li>Their customer service is fantastic too.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightly scented but does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>If I dont moisturize or keep them dirt free</li>
            <li>I use this daily and it helps a great deal.</li>
            <li>Why is it that whenever I find something GREAT it suddenly goes away.</li>
            <li>It a great product, but I have found betters ones recently.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been really happy with how it moisturizers, but I now have a whole new appreciation for the product!  </li>
            <li>Love the Aveeno line, this one fresh clean way to start the day.</li>
            <li>Love this body wash, very soothing smell and not at all strong</li>
            <li>Rich feel and texture.</li>
            <li>I think it improves the health of my skin in 1 day with significant improvement in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I have this on subscribe and save because I love it so much!</li>
            <li>I loved how this body wash feels, will buy more when I run out, cheaper than getting other brands in store if you get free shipping.</li>
            <li>It gets me clean</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried that did&#x27;nt leave a clean feeling as this</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling clean and moisturized and has helped ease the discomfort of my neurodermatitis as well.  </li>
            <li>He finally went to the doctors who said this was the best body wash for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels super smooth and hydrated after using this product.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin clean and moisturized, no dryness.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a  nourishing lotion which contains Colloidal Oatmeal blended with rich emollients to moisturize skin for a full 24 hours.</li>
            <li>A great product for very dry skin.</li>
            <li>It is outstanding for people that have dry skin and it smells refreshing as well!</li>
            <li>what \\&quot;colloidal oatmeal\\&quot; is, but is seems to work, and that&#x27;s good enough for me!</li>
            <li>Such a good purchase will continue to use</li>
            <li>Overall, I would say that this is a good body wash.</li>
            <li>I can see it being an awesome choice for someone that loves thick, creamy soaps.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had no bad reactions to it.  </li>
            <li>My skin isnt dry after I dry off and best of all its scent free!.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a nice gentle body wash that&#x27;s gentle on the skin and has a nice natural scent.</li>
            <li>Great, simple product for a gentle anti-aging routine.  </li>
            <li>Mild smell and good&lt;</li>
            <li>Fragnance is mild and soothing.</li>
            <li>Soap is mild, not overly scented.  </li>
            <li>It suds us nicely with the net scrubbers and leaves my skin silky smooth</li>
            <li>It also works well as a mild baby shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband has mild excema</li>
            <li>Before, I was a loyal fan of Aveeno.  </li>
            <li>I like this body wash very much!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m in a dry husk after showering, and that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li>That stuff smells good, but makes my skin feel dry, so I decided to try this Aveeno</li>
            <li>This Body Wash makes my skin soft and lovely</li>
            <li>Success rates are marginal.</li>
            <li>far, I really enjoy using this!</li>
            <li>I have fallen in love with a different brand of body soaps that are paraben free.  </li>
            <li>A little bit lathers very nicely in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Although this works well and smells pretty good, I still battle with dry skin.</li>
            <li>Really makes your skin feel much smoother after you shower, and definitely gives you a good clean.</li>
            <li>It does have a very feint smell, but its a clean fresh smell.</li>
            <li>This Aveeno product moisturizes my skin quite well, greatly reducing the need for lotion (for example, my elbows, which are usually pretty rough, are much softer since using these product).  </li>
            <li>Moisturizing, smell&#x27;s good, and - way cheaper than other brands (here in Amazon.).</li>
            <li>and  squeezes just the right amount of soap onto a pouf.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s right on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells very neutral and clean,</li>
            <li>You just really feel clean.</li>
            <li>I am delighted with this body wash; it foams well, provides a clean feeling, has a subtle delicate scent and, best of all, really moisturizes!</li>
            <li>Love this product and aveeno in general.</li>
            <li>Will certainly buy again!</li>
            <li>This is a good product to use in your routine, but it&#x27;s not the only thing I use to keep my skin moisturized and young looking.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and get rashes quite easily</li>
            <li>Seems to be easy on my slightly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The natural oatmeal that is used in this body wash is also great for people whom have allergies, helps calm down the allergies.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s black, soft, natural, and beautiful look!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s for the first time in</li>
            <li>Absolutely value for money!</li>
            <li>Deliciously sudsy with only a small amount applied to bath sponge, and leaves skin feeling well-hydrated.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t offensively ladylike, and it lathers pretty well.</li>
            <li>However, it is still reasonably priced and I think it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>I need a moisturizing body wash and have tried many different brands.  </li>
            <li>For the first time in years my skin is soft and my hair smooth.</li>
            <li>This is a good body wash for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Have used this know several times and i love how soft and clean it leaves my skin.</li>
            <li>I feel clean every time I use it, but not dried out.</li>
            <li>This works great for my extra dry skin and it doesn&#x27;t gum up your shower, at a reasonable price, too</li>
            <li>It is the best body wash simply because it actually does get rid of dry skin.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin soft, clean, and well nourished.</li>
            <li>But most of all I want a shower soap with only the very lightest of scents  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve entered day four of using this body wash, which I scrub in well all over with a bath sponge, and my skin is definitely visibly better all ready.  </li>
            <li>Aveeno has a positive reputation where ever you go.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty much 95% gone.</li>
            <li>Usually during winter, my skin gets really dry and itchy and that has not happen thanks to this product; and the fragrance is wonderful.</li>
            <li>The PH is better than most other similar products.  </li>
            <li>Also, there are women who can not use certain products on certain areas of the body.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty nice skin overall except for the same recurring &#x27;patches&#x27; as I call them on my car.</li>
            <li>My Aide used three separate tubs for a single bath because she enjoyed it so much.  </li>
            <li>Florida can be very dry at times and its then when this body wash does the most for me.</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>This body wash really does the trick.</li>
            <li>Plus it really moisturizes.</li>
            <li>very long,&lt;br /&gt;easy</li>
            <li>Truly a high quality product that makes your skin feel like BUTTA&#x27;!</li>
            <li>Very creamy and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>but it really helps.</li>
            <li>Now I go to Walmart and get it so much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I also really like the smell.</li>
            <li>I would use this for whole winter time.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really a fan of the smell but</li>
            <li>I only wish that they would make it fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It is very moisterizing.  </li>
            <li>I use this product after I use a gentle soap,</li>
            <li>My eczema is an issue and this really helps.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m a person that has always had very sensitive/dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.!</li>
            <li>They need to ship this product in better boxes that can not be crushed or stepped on.</li>
            <li>The scent is so relaxing as it fills the room with fresh aromas and your skin is just as soft as can be.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t always enjoy using a washcloth or pouf, but I find it&#x27;s not necessary with this product.  </li>
            <li>This works so wonderfully; it is so gentle and soothing.  </li>
            <li>I have egzema and this is really helping my skin by moisturizing it during showers, and not irritating.</li>
            <li>and it helps so much.</li>
            <li>they aren&#x27;t really there.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product, my teenage son loves it to.</li>
            <li>The scent is subtle, unisex, and pleasant as well.</li>
            <li>and I love the big soft foamy lather it yields.</li>
            <li>But he is far to big to safely handle in a shower.</li>
            <li>Right near my nose but before my cheek.</li>
            <li>Our families enjoy having a variety of Body Washes, because many of us feel it is better to alternate and not only have the same formula or the same item in any category day in and day out, so we went in  search of another Body Wash on Amazon&#x27;s website, and we decided to give this one a try, so that is what we are doing, we are giving it a try, and so far, we are hanging on to it,</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s thick and creamy with a fresh, pleasant fragrance (it&#x27;s not fragrance-free, but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger and is definitely unisex).  </li>
            <li>I have always had dry and sensitive skin and now that I am older, my skin is even drier which makes lines more noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I am in my early 70&#x27;s, and as I get older, my skin seems to get thinner and more dry.  </li>
            <li>My hair is completely damage because of I straightened way too much!</li>
            <li>The non-fragrance style is much better since less dyes and perfumes.</li>
            <li>I love this and use it not just as a facial cleanser (a lot of my friends only use it on their face), but all over.  </li>
            <li>Lathers up very nice, and unlike some other washes half of what you put in your hand doesn&#x27;t fall off onto the shower floor.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>him - highly recommended</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>i cannot tell exactly which part of this body wash is great, but overall i love it.&lt;br /&gt;Gentle touch, smooth feeling, without awful scent...</li>
            <li>Leaves our skin far more moisturized than other washes, and moisturizing bars, that we&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Has a lovely, luxurious lather, and a subtle, fresh fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Most body washes leave my skin feeling dried out and feeling like I&#x27;m coated w/ invisible residue.</li>
            <li>Normally I tried to slide on my belly from my shower to my bedroom after using it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to this product,</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new body wash and started reading reviews.  </li>
            <li>now live in Utah and</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect the squeeky clean feel if you&#x27;ve used other body washes before, but it does a decent job of getting dirt and oil off.</li>
            <li>a long, long while that I feel my skin softer and more hydrated.</li>
            <li>The smell is subtle and nice too.</li>
            <li>It helps prevent and protect dry skin, it leaves skin feeling soft, smooth and naturally healthy-looking.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, so I had to look for something that did not make me break out.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin &amp; this doesn&#x27;t irritate me either ^_^</li>
            <li>But it has been very gentle and has helped the overall feel of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>when I first started using this, my lines weren&#x27;t as obvious.  </li>
            <li>The cleanser leaves a protective layer on your skin, leaving the skin soft and moisturised!</li>
            <li>Wash a try and was I surprised - and relieved!  </li>
            <li>Aveeno&#x27;s formula contains oatmeal which really helps calm my skin down.  </li>
            <li>For the past several winters I just mostly ignored my chaffing skin which was really itchy all over</li>
            <li>Aveeno body wash is fantastic for dry and fragile skin.  </li>
            <li>My daughter-in-law says this helped with the itching and eventually clear skin.</li>
            <li>Skin feeld soft and supple  after bath.</li>
            <li>Majority of soap products made use an ingredient called Sodium Lauryl Sulfate which does damage to skins natural moisture.</li>
            <li>that its for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin noticeably soft.  </li>
            <li>I really like the smell and the moisture that left in my skin after I use this product.</li>
            <li>So, it works well for folks sensitive to perfumes.</li>
            <li>It both moisturizes, makes the skin soft, and does not irritate at all.</li>
            <li>This is by far the greates body wash on the market.</li>
            <li>I really like it and would totally recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of problems with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have issues with eczema on various spots on my body and this is really improving my skin.  </li>
            <li>leave your skin so soft.</li>
            <li>It is gentle enough for everyday use, fragrance free, nongreasy, and noncomedogenic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also been using the lotion moisturizer version of this, the one with SPF 15, and the cracks on the crevices between my knuckles are almost completely cleared up already.  </li>
            <li>but it hasn&#x27;t caused any problems for me thus far.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m liking it so far.</li>
            <li>With the Aveeno cream wash, her skin cleared up almost completely.</li>
            <li>It just provides simple, gentle cleansing.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended I switch to this body wash to help with my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I developed a rash apparently from the pool chemicals and am doing whatever I can to help alleviate the allergic reaction.</li>
            <li>I especially like the natural cream - the roc isgreat for getting rid of old skin, and</li>
            <li>As a bed confined person, caring for my hair and skin are major challenges.  </li>
            <li>It is a little pricier than Olay, but well worth it</li>
            <li>Natural Anti-Wrinkle, Facial Lift Skin Care Formula - 1.5oz]])</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used Dove Body Wash for sensitive skin and the extra moisturizer versions and this works just as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big fan of old spice or men body washes, they smell funky.</li>
            <li>Having a sensitive skin this product is a blessing especially with the price we get.</li>
            <li>When using the product, it left me skin soft and moisturized just like it said it would.</li>
            <li>It smells decent - not too fragranced and not feminine - and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>had thought my dry skin and flyaway hair were just the result of pregnancies and getting older.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend to anyone with sensitive or irritated skin.</li>
            <li>(in fact, most have made it worse).  </li>
            <li>This is a high lather, good-smelling body wash that doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin, or skin sensitivity issues I highly recommend this soap and from buying it via amazon.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for those with dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I believe this used to be sold direct from Amazon, but only 3rd party retailers now.</li>
            <li>It does not dry out the skin and keeps moisture locked in.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey when compared to other drugstore body washes, but I&#x27;d pay the extra money for Aveeno (I&#x27;m kind of addicted to their body lotion right now).</li>
            <li>I was looking for a body wash that wouldn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, and would also act as a sort of pH balancer for other sensitive feminine areas.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t dry off completely with a towel after showering.</li>
            <li>Oh, and I only need to use a small quantity, so it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>It has a nice subtle scent - not perfumy and a little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s gentle, you only need a little</li>
            <li>I have a lot of experience with hair/body products both good and bad.  </li>

            <li> This  body wash is good and helps moisturize your skin....</li>
            <li> Aveeno seems great, but it does more harm than good.</li>
            <li> It also foams up nicely for a pleasant bathing experience.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying more of these for sure as the price is the best through Amazon.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended Aveeno and I have been very pleased with it.  </li>

            <li> Feel really, really great on your skin and does not dry it out, combined with the lotion perfect match...</li>
            <li> It leaves your sking very smooth, I like the smell  and the price was really good</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE - I&#x27;ve been using all these products for awhile now, and these three products have been amazing on my skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels AMAZING after using this product.</li>
            <li> I looked for it after I saw amazing results in my daughter&#x27;s eczema using [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It is an excellent exfoliant and is gentle on your skin.  </li>
            <li> I make my own bath goods now.</li>
            <li> nice  works well for my skin</li>
            <li> I liked the Aveeno body moisturizing wash..</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that it came in a package of 2</li>
            <li> the two chemicals and the Tetrasodium EDTA is toxic when ingested but has been shown that when inhaled in an aerosol form it can&#x27;t reach a level of toxicity that causes any kind ofadverse reactions.  </li>
            <li> I catch myself using more than I need to because it feels so good on my skin</li>
            <li> Even my husband uses it-wish he&#x27;d buy his own.</li>
            <li> Makes nice suds while it moisturizes.</li>
            <li> Creats a nice soapy froth that I can shave my legs with, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin itchy.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin feel smooth, very nice.  </li>
            <li> Great product, just a significant more pricey on Amazon for some reason.  </li>
            <li> The scent is really mild and very nice....</li>
            <li> Fragrance is nice, skin feels good and clean.</li>
            <li> I know there are a lot of natural skin care products out there, but this one works the best and gives you not just the maximum results, but maximum permanent results.</li>
            <li> Love that this is nourishing for my skin and smells nice.  </li>
            <li> Amazing :)</li>
            <li> the one that isn&#x27;t fragrance-free is a bit strong to me); and this product leaves your skin feeling very clean and fairly moisturized.</li>
            <li> Aveeno does prove the skin is clean and the smell of this soap smell really good.</li>
            <li> This is the best gentle soap that works great on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> After washing, my skin feels very comfortable, and there is none of that sticky feeling that comes afterwards with most soaps.</li>
            <li> I recommend the combination of all these products as a great routine, and reasonable expense for skin</li>
            <li> Still one of my top two body washes I prefer.</li>
            <li> I love Aveeno products and this is no exception.  </li>
            <li> honestly, my skin feels smooth all day.  </li>
            <li> I always love the feel of my skin after using this product.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, and for a guy that is saying a lot.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both love this wash.  </li>
            <li> We love the product and the price</li>
            <li> so not at all sure what its \\&quot;nourishing colloidal oatmeal\\&quot; is supposed to do for my skin, but maybe time will tell.  </li>
            <li> My bottle is out and need to get more.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Great, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance, the texture, and the texture of my skin after using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in chemotherapy and it is one of the better moisturizing washes I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> and I love Aveeno.</li>
            <li> love the fragrance.</li>
            <li> but this is OK.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many bodywashes.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s refreshing (</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I really love it...</li>
            <li> ;, i think it&#x27;s better to use during the winter time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from a skin condition for over 30 years - most any bar soap or body wash</li>
            <li> If I stay on top of them...</li>
            <li> Much better than others</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> so when we have more longer term observations, we will try to add those commentaries as well.</li>
            <li> In just a couple of days his skin looks better.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love aveeno products and this body wash.</li>
            <li> I just love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I love the scent, and how it feels on the skin after each use.  </li>
            <li> and the cure was more lotion.  </li>
            <li> most of my skin irritation vanished.  </li>
            <li> The Aveeno is great because unlike other cleansers, it doesn&#x27;t undo all the great work the roc and Bel Essence are doing.  </li>
            <li> Better than a bar of soap, smells nice, and you feel totally clean.</li>
            <li> exactly as described!!!</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin during the winter and have tried most moisturizing body washes and this one is the best.  </li>
            <li> However, this product helps my skin retain moisture, and leaves me feeling very clean.</li>
            <li> So worth it!!</li>
            <li> Got this for my son who has dry skin and its the best product that works for</li>
            <li> This body wash is excellent for preserving moisture during those dry winter months.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin nice and soft, feels good on my skin during and after my shower or bath.  </li>
            <li> and this does such an excellent job of keeping my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin, excellent for sensitive skin too.  </li>
            <li> I use the body wash in conjunction with Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion and the results are very good.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a body wash that would be great for my sensitive skin and not smell girly, so my husband could use it too.</li>
            <li> A nice mild scent, easy on the skin, and a great price when you sign up for regular deliveries.</li>
            <li> now that is REALLY easy to do!)and</li>
            <li> easy to use,&lt;br /&gt;last</li>
            <li> Bottle is easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> It was shipped in a envelope type box and that is easy to damage.</li>
            <li> It helps make you more clean.  </li>
            <li> A must have for people who has strong body odor.</li>
            <li> There were many to choose from and a large selection of similar items but figured this would be the best to purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it has a very clean and fresh smell.  </li>
            <li> Hands down the best for me.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant, mild scent and has really helped relieve some of the itch.  </li>
            <li> This worked perfectly fine for me.</li>
            <li> The shipping and price was fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Olay and Dove body washes before, and they have worked fine, but this wash seems to make my skin feel the softest.  </li>
            <li> This has been the best so far, by far.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since it&#x27;s never too early to start an anti-aging routine, and great skin only begins with a good cleanser like Aveeno, in addition to this</li>
            <li> I also recommend the scent free lotion also by Aveeno [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This is a great product to keep from overly drying your skin when you bathe multiple times a day.</li>
            <li> Odorless, smooth after effect,and cheap.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li> My bathing Aide was ready to run off with the bottle for her own use.  </li>
            <li> It lathers easily and rinses cleanly.  </li>
            <li> Their customer service is fantastic too.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightly scented but does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> If I dont moisturize or keep them dirt free</li>
            <li> I use this daily and it helps a great deal.</li>
            <li> Why is it that whenever I find something GREAT it suddenly goes away.</li>
            <li> It a great product, but I have found betters ones recently.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really happy with how it moisturizers, but I now have a whole new appreciation for the product!  </li>
            <li> Love the Aveeno line, this one fresh clean way to start the day.</li>
            <li> Love this body wash, very soothing smell and not at all strong</li>
            <li> Rich feel and texture.</li>
            <li> I think it improves the health of my skin in 1 day with significant improvement in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have this on subscribe and save because I love it so much!</li>
            <li> I loved how this body wash feels, will buy more when I run out, cheaper than getting other brands in store if you get free shipping.</li>
            <li> It gets me clean</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried that did&#x27;nt leave a clean feeling as this</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling clean and moisturized and has helped ease the discomfort of my neurodermatitis as well.  </li>
            <li> He finally went to the doctors who said this was the best body wash for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels super smooth and hydrated after using this product.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin clean and moisturized, no dryness.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a  nourishing lotion which contains Colloidal Oatmeal blended with rich emollients to moisturize skin for a full 24 hours.</li>
            <li> A great product for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> It is outstanding for people that have dry skin and it smells refreshing as well!</li>
            <li> what \\&quot;colloidal oatmeal\\&quot; is, but is seems to work, and that&#x27;s good enough for me!</li>
            <li> Such a good purchase will continue to use</li>
            <li> Overall, I would say that this is a good body wash.</li>
            <li> I can see it being an awesome choice for someone that loves thick, creamy soaps.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had no bad reactions to it.  </li>
            <li> My skin isnt dry after I dry off and best of all its scent free!.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a nice gentle body wash that&#x27;s gentle on the skin and has a nice natural scent.</li>
            <li> Great, simple product for a gentle anti-aging routine.  </li>
            <li> Mild smell and good&lt;</li>
            <li> Fragnance is mild and soothing.</li>
            <li> Soap is mild, not overly scented.  </li>
            <li> It suds us nicely with the net scrubbers and leaves my skin silky smooth</li>
            <li> It also works well as a mild baby shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband has mild excema</li>
            <li> Before, I was a loyal fan of Aveeno.  </li>
            <li> I like this body wash very much!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m in a dry husk after showering, and that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li> That stuff smells good, but makes my skin feel dry, so I decided to try this Aveeno</li>
            <li> This Body Wash makes my skin soft and lovely</li>
            <li> Success rates are marginal.</li>
            <li> far, I really enjoy using this!</li>
            <li> I have fallen in love with a different brand of body soaps that are paraben free.  </li>
            <li> A little bit lathers very nicely in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Although this works well and smells pretty good, I still battle with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Really makes your skin feel much smoother after you shower, and definitely gives you a good clean.</li>
            <li> It does have a very feint smell, but its a clean fresh smell.</li>
            <li> This Aveeno product moisturizes my skin quite well, greatly reducing the need for lotion (for example, my elbows, which are usually pretty rough, are much softer since using these product).  </li>
            <li> Moisturizing, smell&#x27;s good, and - way cheaper than other brands (here in Amazon.).</li>
            <li> and  squeezes just the right amount of soap onto a pouf.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s right on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells very neutral and clean,</li>
            <li> You just really feel clean.</li>
            <li> I am delighted with this body wash; it foams well, provides a clean feeling, has a subtle delicate scent and, best of all, really moisturizes!</li>
            <li> Love this product and aveeno in general.</li>
            <li> Will certainly buy again!</li>
            <li> This is a good product to use in your routine, but it&#x27;s not the only thing I use to keep my skin moisturized and young looking.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and get rashes quite easily</li>
            <li> Seems to be easy on my slightly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The natural oatmeal that is used in this body wash is also great for people whom have allergies, helps calm down the allergies.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s black, soft, natural, and beautiful look!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s for the first time in</li>
            <li> Absolutely value for money!</li>
            <li> Deliciously sudsy with only a small amount applied to bath sponge, and leaves skin feeling well-hydrated.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t offensively ladylike, and it lathers pretty well.</li>
            <li> However, it is still reasonably priced and I think it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> I need a moisturizing body wash and have tried many different brands.  </li>
            <li> For the first time in years my skin is soft and my hair smooth.</li>
            <li> This is a good body wash for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Have used this know several times and i love how soft and clean it leaves my skin.</li>
            <li> I feel clean every time I use it, but not dried out.</li>
            <li> This works great for my extra dry skin and it doesn&#x27;t gum up your shower, at a reasonable price, too</li>
            <li> It is the best body wash simply because it actually does get rid of dry skin.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin soft, clean, and well nourished.</li>
            <li> But most of all I want a shower soap with only the very lightest of scents  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve entered day four of using this body wash, which I scrub in well all over with a bath sponge, and my skin is definitely visibly better all ready.  </li>
            <li> Aveeno has a positive reputation where ever you go.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty much 95% gone.</li>
            <li> Usually during winter, my skin gets really dry and itchy and that has not happen thanks to this product; and the fragrance is wonderful.</li>
            <li> The PH is better than most other similar products.  </li>
            <li> Also, there are women who can not use certain products on certain areas of the body.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty nice skin overall except for the same recurring &#x27;patches&#x27; as I call them on my car.</li>
            <li> My Aide used three separate tubs for a single bath because she enjoyed it so much.  </li>
            <li> Florida can be very dry at times and its then when this body wash does the most for me.</li>
            <li> I really like this</li>
            <li> This body wash really does the trick.</li>
            <li> Plus it really moisturizes.</li>
            <li> very long,&lt;br /&gt;easy</li>
            <li> Truly a high quality product that makes your skin feel like BUTTA&#x27;!</li>
            <li> Very creamy and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> but it really helps.</li>
            <li> Now I go to Walmart and get it so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I also really like the smell.</li>
            <li> I would use this for whole winter time.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really a fan of the smell but</li>
            <li> I only wish that they would make it fragrance free.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It is very moisterizing.  </li>
            <li> I use this product after I use a gentle soap,</li>
            <li> My eczema is an issue and this really helps.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m a person that has always had very sensitive/dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.!</li>
            <li> They need to ship this product in better boxes that can not be crushed or stepped on.</li>
            <li> The scent is so relaxing as it fills the room with fresh aromas and your skin is just as soft as can be.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always enjoy using a washcloth or pouf, but I find it&#x27;s not necessary with this product.  </li>
            <li> This works so wonderfully; it is so gentle and soothing.  </li>
            <li> I have egzema and this is really helping my skin by moisturizing it during showers, and not irritating.</li>
            <li> and it helps so much.</li>
            <li> they aren&#x27;t really there.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, my teenage son loves it to.</li>
            <li> The scent is subtle, unisex, and pleasant as well.</li>
            <li> and I love the big soft foamy lather it yields.</li>
            <li> But he is far to big to safely handle in a shower.</li>
            <li> Right near my nose but before my cheek.</li>
            <li> Our families enjoy having a variety of Body Washes, because many of us feel it is better to alternate and not only have the same formula or the same item in any category day in and day out, so we went in  search of another Body Wash on Amazon&#x27;s website, and we decided to give this one a try, so that is what we are doing, we are giving it a try, and so far, we are hanging on to it,</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s thick and creamy with a fresh, pleasant fragrance (it&#x27;s not fragrance-free, but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger and is definitely unisex).  </li>
            <li> I have always had dry and sensitive skin and now that I am older, my skin is even drier which makes lines more noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I am in my early 70&#x27;s, and as I get older, my skin seems to get thinner and more dry.  </li>
            <li> My hair is completely damage because of I straightened way too much!</li>
            <li> The non-fragrance style is much better since less dyes and perfumes.</li>
            <li> I love this and use it not just as a facial cleanser (a lot of my friends only use it on their face), but all over.  </li>
            <li> Lathers up very nice, and unlike some other washes half of what you put in your hand doesn&#x27;t fall off onto the shower floor.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> him - highly recommended</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> i cannot tell exactly which part of this body wash is great, but overall i love it.&lt;br /&gt;Gentle touch, smooth feeling, without awful scent...</li>
            <li> Leaves our skin far more moisturized than other washes, and moisturizing bars, that we&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Has a lovely, luxurious lather, and a subtle, fresh fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Most body washes leave my skin feeling dried out and feeling like I&#x27;m coated w/ invisible residue.</li>
            <li> Normally I tried to slide on my belly from my shower to my bedroom after using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to this product,</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new body wash and started reading reviews.  </li>
            <li> now live in Utah and</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect the squeeky clean feel if you&#x27;ve used other body washes before, but it does a decent job of getting dirt and oil off.</li>
            <li> a long, long while that I feel my skin softer and more hydrated.</li>
            <li> The smell is subtle and nice too.</li>
            <li> It helps prevent and protect dry skin, it leaves skin feeling soft, smooth and naturally healthy-looking.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so I had to look for something that did not make me break out.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin &amp; this doesn&#x27;t irritate me either ^_^</li>
            <li> But it has been very gentle and has helped the overall feel of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> when I first started using this, my lines weren&#x27;t as obvious.  </li>
            <li> The cleanser leaves a protective layer on your skin, leaving the skin soft and moisturised!</li>
            <li> Wash a try and was I surprised - and relieved!  </li>
            <li> Aveeno&#x27;s formula contains oatmeal which really helps calm my skin down.  </li>
            <li> For the past several winters I just mostly ignored my chaffing skin which was really itchy all over</li>
            <li> Aveeno body wash is fantastic for dry and fragile skin.  </li>
            <li> My daughter-in-law says this helped with the itching and eventually clear skin.</li>
            <li> Skin feeld soft and supple  after bath.</li>
            <li> Majority of soap products made use an ingredient called Sodium Lauryl Sulfate which does damage to skins natural moisture.</li>
            <li> that its for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin noticeably soft.  </li>
            <li> I really like the smell and the moisture that left in my skin after I use this product.</li>
            <li> So, it works well for folks sensitive to perfumes.</li>
            <li> It both moisturizes, makes the skin soft, and does not irritate at all.</li>
            <li> This is by far the greates body wash on the market.</li>
            <li> I really like it and would totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of problems with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have issues with eczema on various spots on my body and this is really improving my skin.  </li>
            <li> leave your skin so soft.</li>
            <li> It is gentle enough for everyday use, fragrance free, nongreasy, and noncomedogenic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been using the lotion moisturizer version of this, the one with SPF 15, and the cracks on the crevices between my knuckles are almost completely cleared up already.  </li>
            <li> but it hasn&#x27;t caused any problems for me thus far.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m liking it so far.</li>
            <li> With the Aveeno cream wash, her skin cleared up almost completely.</li>
            <li> It just provides simple, gentle cleansing.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended I switch to this body wash to help with my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I developed a rash apparently from the pool chemicals and am doing whatever I can to help alleviate the allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> I especially like the natural cream - the roc isgreat for getting rid of old skin, and</li>
            <li> As a bed confined person, caring for my hair and skin are major challenges.  </li>
            <li> It is a little pricier than Olay, but well worth it</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve also used Dove Body Wash for sensitive skin and the extra moisturizer versions and this works just as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of old spice or men body washes, they smell funky.</li>
            <li> Having a sensitive skin this product is a blessing especially with the price we get.</li>
            <li> When using the product, it left me skin soft and moisturized just like it said it would.</li>
            <li> It smells decent - not too fragranced and not feminine - and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> had thought my dry skin and flyaway hair were just the result of pregnancies and getting older.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend to anyone with sensitive or irritated skin.</li>
            <li> (in fact, most have made it worse).  </li>
            <li> This is a high lather, good-smelling body wash that doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, or skin sensitivity issues I highly recommend this soap and from buying it via amazon.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for those with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I believe this used to be sold direct from Amazon, but only 3rd party retailers now.</li>
            <li> It does not dry out the skin and keeps moisture locked in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey when compared to other drugstore body washes, but I&#x27;d pay the extra money for Aveeno (I&#x27;m kind of addicted to their body lotion right now).</li>
            <li> I was looking for a body wash that wouldn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, and would also act as a sort of pH balancer for other sensitive feminine areas.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t dry off completely with a towel after showering.</li>
            <li> Oh, and I only need to use a small quantity, so it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> It has a nice subtle scent - not perfumy and a little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s gentle, you only need a little</li>
            <li> I have a lot of experience with hair/body products both good and bad.  </li>
            <li> *a lot* of soap scum behind in the tub--something I haven&#x27;t experienced with other products.  </li>
            <li> Wife is super skeptical about trying new products for fear of being allergic to them, but loves this wash.  </li>
            <li> The other is mineral fusion natural brands mineral body wash, the earth stone.</li>
            <li> The other chemical he mentioned, Quaternium 15, is a well known allergen that can cause contact dermatitis in people with sensitive skin which is a symptom of an allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is brighter, dark spots have faded, and fine lines are gone, and the deeper lines are less and less noticeable every month.  </li>
            <li> Especially when it  comes in a container that&#x27;s unlikely to slip out of the hand, has a cap that flips open and closes easily</li>
            <li> Not sure how much there is to say about this.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin and decided to try something other than the &amp;#34;masculine,&amp;#34; fragrance-packed Old Spice stuff.  </li>
            <li> I have eczema and generally dry skin and need to moisturize almost daily.</li>
            <li> I also work with cement and related products which also dry the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this for my extra dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have terribly dry skin, to the point where my entire body would start itching just from walking.  </li>
            <li> my skin became so dry and chapped that it had fissure like cracks and was bleeding, had to wear sandwich bags filled with bag balm on my hands for several days for them to get better as they had it the worst.  </li>
            <li> Daily use cures dry skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin which will break out in a rash if not properly cared for.</li>
            <li> The smell of this is very soft and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Also, it is a bit more expensive than other brands of body washes.  </li>
            <li> the downside, it does take a little bit longer to rinse completely off.  </li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> and I used a long time ago</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had rosacea for as long as I can remember on my face</li>
            <li> I do hope anyone who is wondering if this product works just tries it - it only takes once and you will feel the difference immediately.  </li>
            <li> As a long time Oil of Olay Body Wash user, I was reluctant to switch, but after my skin condition flared up, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> I will be using this product often and for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> The product is natural, without any harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I was recently diagnosed with leukemia...and chemotherapy can dry your skin out horribly...but not using this product!!  </li>
            <li> I have used other body washes that leave my skin feeling insanely moisturized (which I love), but this one does the job just fine</li>
            <li> Turns out that my skin was only a little dry, but I&#x27;m sensitive to perfumes and ingredients in other body washes.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting, only a little needed.</li>
            <li> It noted though that while it doesn&#x27;t soak through the skin it does \\&quot;chelate calcium\\&quot; which means it can possibly increase penetration of other chemicals that enter the skin.  </li>
            <li> Other baby washes, such as [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Smells mildly similar to the other oaty Aveeno products, which I like but might not be for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry, itchy skin.  </li>
            <li> It does what it supposed to do without any issues and skin looks so smooth irrespective of how cold it is outside</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered for years from hand eczema and dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> I used to have quite dry skin that was itchy all the time.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out of all.</li>
            <li> I used to think my skin was just excessively dry</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a single problem.  </li>
            <li> No heavy scent, the smell doesn&#x27;t linger past toweling off.</li>
            <li> Roc Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Night Cream, is a little harsh, but it works to turnover your skin faster, and I definitely saw a change in the lines around my eyes and even a change in the deep lines in my forehead.  </li>
            <li> If you suffer dry skin as I do, this product is a Godsend!</li>
            <li> I have found that by buying it through amazon I get 2 bottles for less than 1 bottle in the local stores.</li>
            <li> Just going to mention that my only allergy shown to come up in an allergy test is a slight reaction to dust.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>

            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m partial to liquid shower soap.  </li>
            <li> My skin is still dry but Aveeno just makes it less dry!</li>
            <li> Obviously, I would prefer if it was a little less pricey, but sometimes I can splurge on this product.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>

            <li> and a little goes a long way.</li>

            <li> A little amount also goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Having to wash the tub after each use is only a minor inconvenience at this point, but I might grow tired of it and decide that it&#x27;s not really worth the extra</li>
            <li> Other products strip away moisture in your skin, this doesn&#x27;t do that as much as other products, so</li>
            <li> , I recommend a couple of other products to keep those lines and wrinkles away.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t create any dryness like other body washes.</li>
            <li> I shower daily with this body wash and have for about five years now and the winter flakey skin is in the past.  </li>
            <li> A bit pricey compared to other stores.  </li>
            <li> since tried other Aveeno products, including [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Tried it and lathers up extremely well.</li>

            <li> I went all crazy with covering my whole body with cocoa butter every morning until about 7 years ago when I started to only put it on my hands and face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally use body washes that contain the word &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; in the product name; they typically leave behind a grimy residue on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a scent (at least, not one that is apparent, if anything, it smells little like oatmeal).  </li>
            <li> While it doesn&#x27;t create a lot of bubbles or a thick foam, the body wash lathers enough to make me feel like it&#x27;s doing its job.  </li>
            <li> only problem is when you get out of the shower you still feel very soapy because its like impossible to get the wash off your skin using water.</li>
            <li> After my bath my skin is silky and the psoriasis on my hands and elbows is slowed down to almost no flakes.</li>
            <li> No more dry feeling after the</li>
            <li> and when I apply it with the Aveeno lotion after showering I have no more itching or dry skin!  </li>
            <li> The fragrance-free body wash still has a slight smell</li>
            <li> My upper arms used to look very dried out and flaky, and they were like that even during warmer months, but I&#x27;ve noticed since yesterday that they don&#x27;t look near as terrible as they usually do and feel smooth when I run my hands over them.  </li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the product, just that it has parabens (nothing toxic), but not as natural as some of the other soaps that I have discovered.  </li>
            <li> it is a little cheaper though...</li>
            <li> but it is not available for subscribe and save anymore.</li>
            <li> I bought the body wash a few months ago for my grandsons who have eczema.  </li>

            <li> Winter dried out my skin and the spring sun</li>
            <li> I lead a pretty active lifestyle so this was a very unpleasant, and at times unbearable, issue for me.  </li>

            <li> in the past, but this is something of a revelation.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve just started using it, so am not sure how well i like it yet</li>

            <li> This is the least drying and least irritating shower soap I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li> and it helps (a bit) reduce itchiness in this dry and cold winter.</li>
            <li> and I also have a bad case of keratosis pilaris all over my chest, stomach, and upper arms.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to go wrong with Aveeno.</li>
            <li> However it could be worse.</li>
            <li> There are no extra annoying fragrances or scents.</li>
            <li> The smell is very subtle, I don&#x27;t know for others</li>

            <li> Cant go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> For some reason it&#x27;s difficult to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Just a heads up though, someone pointed out either on these comments or on the moisturizer, that there are two chemicals that seem really scary.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like this (I buy it in bulk here!) - it&#x27;s gentle, you only need a little so it lasts a long time.  I love this and use it not just as a facial cleanser (a lot of my friends only use it on their face), but all over.  I have always had dry and sensitive skin and now that I am older, my skin is even drier which makes lines more noticeable.  Other products strip away moisture in your skin, this doesn&#x27;t do that as much as other products, so when I first started using this, my lines weren&#x27;t as obvious.  Great, simple product for a gentle anti-aging routine.  This is a good product to use in your routine, but it&#x27;s not the only thing I use to keep my skin moisturized and young looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it&#x27;s never too early to start an anti-aging routine, and great skin only begins with a good cleanser like Aveeno, in addition to this, I recommend a couple of other products to keep those lines and wrinkles away. Roc Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Night Cream, is a little harsh, but it works to turnover your skin faster, and I definitely saw a change in the lines around my eyes and even a change in the deep lines in my forehead.  I added Bel Essence (oil and cream) ([[ASIN:B00BD822BI Bel Essence Anti Aging Treatment - Intensive All Natural Anti-Wrinkle, Facial Lift Skin Care Formula - 1.5oz]]) to my routine and that has been the missing piece of anti-aging and keeping your skin young and soft.  My skin is brighter, dark spots have faded, and fine lines are gone, and the deeper lines are less and less noticeable every month.  I know there are a lot of natural skin care products out there, but this one works the best and gives you not just the maximum results, but maximum permanent results. I recommend the combination of all these products as a great routine, and reasonable expense for skin care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - I&#x27;ve been using all these products for awhile now, and these three products have been amazing on my skin.  I especially like the natural cream - the roc isgreat for getting rid of old skin, and the Bel Essence has made my skin softer, brighter, and lineless (is that a word?).  The Aveeno is great because unlike other cleansers, it doesn&#x27;t undo all the great work the roc and Bel Essence are doing.  I have never been happier with the way my skin looks!</li>
            <li> Still one of my top two body washes I prefer. The other is mineral fusion natural brands mineral body wash, the earth stone.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this body wash. I have been using it for over a year now and I don&#x27;t see myself ever using anything else. It really is great. My husband bought the wal-mart brand knock-off and it doesn&#x27;t even compare.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally found a body wash that everyone in the family likes. A nice mild scent, easy on the skin, and a great price when you sign up for regular deliveries.</li>
            <li> Best price for a great body wash.</li>
            <li> Not too soapy, not too smelly--cleanses while hydrating your skin. Rich feel and texture. Long lasting, only a little needed.</li>
            <li> This body wash really does the trick. I have eczema and generally dry skin and need to moisturize almost daily. I also work with cement and related products which also dry the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply put, it helps with the itching and dryness. I&#x27;ve also used Dove Body Wash for sensitive skin and the extra moisturizer versions and this works just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My family loves this aveeno daily moisturizing body wash. Skin feeld soft and supple  after bath. Made my skin visibly healthier.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Trusted brand!</li>
            <li> I love Aveeno products and this is no exception.  It is an excellent exfoliant and is gentle on your skin.  It also has a very pleasant aroma and keeps you feeling fresh and rejuvenated.  It&#x27;s ideal for when you get out of the bath.</li>
            <li> I stopped buying this for one reason ... I make my own bath goods now. Aveeno seems great, but it does more harm than good. Majority of soap products made use an ingredient called Sodium Lauryl Sulfate which does damage to skins natural moisture. Aveeno is one of those brands that uses this. Save your skin and read the labels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Aveeno for babies...and when they came out with the body wash for adults, I knew I had to try that as well.  I&#x27;ve been really happy with how it moisturizers, but I now have a whole new appreciation for the product!  I was recently diagnosed with leukemia...and chemotherapy can dry your skin out horribly...but not using this product!!  I scrub from head to toe (and with no hair now that is REALLY easy to do!)and honestly, my skin feels smooth all day.  Wouldn&#x27;t trade this product for anything and have it on auto-delivery to make sure I never run out!!</li>
            <li> Makes for a a great stocking stuffer. This is one of the gifts I am using for a give away at my Christmas Party.</li>
            <li> I am delighted with this body wash; it foams well, provides a clean feeling, has a subtle delicate scent and, best of all, really moisturizes! I have very dry skin and it&#x27;s for the first time in a long, long while that I feel my skin softer and more hydrated. I use the body wash in conjunction with Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion and the results are very good. I have no idea what \\&quot;colloidal oatmeal\\&quot; is, but is seems to work, and that&#x27;s good enough for me! Oh, and I only need to use a small quantity, so it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Well, it doesn&#x27;t lie. Really makes your skin feel much smoother after you shower, and definitely gives you a good clean. No complains. Use a loofah though.</li>
            <li> The cleanser leaves a protective layer on your skin, leaving the skin soft and moisturised! The smell is subtle and nice too. Absolutely value for money! Great for people with sensitive skin! :D</li>
            <li> Love the Aveeno line, this one fresh clean way to start the day.</li>
            <li> I always love the feel of my skin after using this product. Doesn&#x27;t create any dryness like other body washes. I love the smell, and for a guy that is saying a lot. I&#x27;m not a big fan of old spice or men body washes, they smell funky. My girlfriend appreciates it as well.</li>
            <li> I lived in Omaha, NE during winter and this product helped me from avoiding snake skins. Got rid of scales due to cold on my legs and other places.</li>
            <li> I started using Aveeno a month ago and simply love it! My skin isnt dry after I dry off and best of all its scent free!. It does have a very feint smell, but its a clean fresh smell. I also recommend the scent free lotion also by Aveeno [[ASIN:B0013OJUY4 Aveeno Active Naturals Skin Relief Moisturizing Lotion with Soothing Oatmeal Essence, 18-Ounce Bottle]]</li>
            <li> My wife loves this. Unfortunately one of the bottles was cracked in shipment.</li>
            <li> I loved how this body wash feels, will buy more when I run out, cheaper than getting other brands in store if you get free shipping.</li>
            <li> Love this body wash, very soothing smell and not at all strong which is what I needed. Plus it really moisturizes. Having a sensitive skin this product is a blessing especially with the price we get.</li>
            <li> easy to use,&lt;br /&gt;last very long,&lt;br /&gt;easy to clean,&lt;br /&gt;does not leave slippery feel on the skin,&lt;br /&gt;ok if using with kids,&lt;br /&gt;will buy again,</li>
            <li> My wife and I both love this wash.  Wife is super skeptical about trying new products for fear of being allergic to them, but loves this wash.  Lathers up very nice, and unlike some other washes half of what you put in your hand doesn&#x27;t fall off onto the shower floor.  Leaves our skin far more moisturized than other washes, and moisturizing bars, that we&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> We love the product and the price but it is not available for subscribe and save anymore. Hope they put it back again...</li>
            <li> This Body Wash makes my skin soft and lovely - Aveeno is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Love this product and aveeno in general. Keeps my eczema at bay. Such a good purchase will continue to use</li>
            <li> This is the least drying and least irritating shower soap I&#x27;ve ever tried.  While it&#x27;s technically not fragrance-free, it might as well be since there&#x27;s practically no scent.</li>
            <li> I use this for my extra dry skin. Coupled with lotion, it keeps my skin moisturized and itch-free throughout the day.  I have noticed that if use the lotion or this body wash by itself, my results aren&#x27;t as good. So far so good.</li>
            <li> This is a high lather, good-smelling body wash that doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I feel clean every time I use it, but not dried out. I  that  still use moisturizer, but not such a big amount.</li>
            <li> Yea I&#x27;m sure it cleans, yadda yadda, but damn this thing smells incredible. Truly a high quality product that makes your skin feel like BUTTA&#x27;!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so I had to look for something that did not make me break out.  Aveeno body wash is great.  I will not use anything else. It keeps my skin nice and soft, feels good on my skin during and after my shower or bath.  So very happy that they deliver on their promise that its for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Liked:&lt;br /&gt;- Cleans well; moisturizes well&lt;br /&gt;- Lathers well&lt;br /&gt;- Mild smell and good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;- Pricey&lt;br /&gt;- If you have very dry skin; might have to look elsewhere</li>
            <li> exactly as described!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m partial to liquid shower soap.  Especially when it  comes in a container that&#x27;s unlikely to slip out of the hand, has a cap that flips open and closes easily and  squeezes just the right amount of soap onto a pouf. But most of all I want a shower soap with only the very lightest of scents  that won&#x27;t aggravate my perfume allergy. Aveeno does all that. I&#x27;m new to this product, so not at all sure what its \\&quot;nourishing colloidal oatmeal\\&quot; is supposed to do for my skin, but maybe time will tell.  Meanwhile, very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin feeling moist and my skin feels good every time that I use it.  Cannot go wrong with Aveeno products.</li>
            <li> Very creamy and moisturizing. Do not replace your lotion with this though. My skin is still dry but Aveeno just makes it less dry! Lathers well but is definitely pricey!</li>
            <li> I bought the body wash a few months ago for my grandsons who have eczema.  My daughter-in-law says this helped with the itching and eventually clear skin.</li>
            <li> I have always used Aveeno Hand Lotion for the problems I have with my hands and elbows. When I saw this body wash offered for sale from Amazon, I decided to give it a try. I bought 2 bottles and will keep buying it! After my bath my skin is silky and the psoriasis on my hands and elbows is slowed down to almost no flakes. I can&#x27;t say that it cures my psoriasis but it really helps.</li>
            <li> This worked perfectly fine for me. I have no complaints. The shipping and price was fine. When using the product, it left me skin soft and moisturized just like it said it would. Thus, I am perfectly happy.</li>
            <li> I shower daily with this body wash and have for about five years now and the winter flakey skin is in the past.  Arrives on time so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> Deliciously sudsy with only a small amount applied to bath sponge, and leaves skin feeling well-hydrated. Will certainly buy again!</li>
            <li> Perfect moisturizing body wash, been using for more than 2 months or so now. My bottle is out and need to get more. Will definitely recommend</li>
            <li> It makes your skin noticeably soft.  My wife hates it when I use it because it runs out faster.  It does tend to leave a film in our fiberglass shower, so I deducted one start for that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m packing this body wash to the gym with me to wash off with after swimming laps.  I developed a rash apparently from the pool chemicals and am doing whatever I can to help alleviate the allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell and the moisture that left in my skin after I use this product. Perfectly well for this winter and it helps (a bit) reduce itchiness in this dry and cold winter.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It&#x27;s too bad they took it off the subscribe and shop portion of Amazon.  That was a great deal.  Now I go to Walmart and get it so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Aveeno body wash is excellent for my kids because they have a delicates and allergy skin and for me is the best I love it and I used a long time ago</li>
            <li> My skin feels AMAZING after using this product. I also really like the smell. Obviously, I would prefer if it was a little less pricey, but sometimes I can splurge on this product.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new body wash and started reading reviews.  Wound up buying the Aveeno brand and the reviews I read were spot on.  Great and mositurizing body wash!</li>
            <li> So moisturizing ! Loved Aveeno products forever. They don&#x27;t break me out. It smells incredibly good and feels so nice on my skin. So worth it!!</li>
            <li> This body wash lathers wonderfully when used with a loofah. It does not dry out the skin and keeps moisture locked in. It has almost no fragrance, I would order this again.</li>
            <li> This works great for my extra dry skin and it doesn&#x27;t gum up your shower, at a reasonable price, too</li>
            <li> my skin is not itching at all since i started using this body wash. Usually during winter, my skin gets really dry and itchy and that has not happen thanks to this product; and the fragrance is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Good product! Moisturizing, smell&#x27;s good, and - way cheaper than other brands (here in Amazon.). I would use this for whole winter time.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to keep from overly drying your skin when you bathe multiple times a day. Plus, it isn&#x27;t scented. So, it works well for folks sensitive to perfumes.</li>
            <li> nice  works well for my skin</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually moisturize and have always just used men&#x27;s body washes (Axe, etc.) in the past, but this is something of a revelation. I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m in a dry husk after showering, and that&#x27;s a good thing. The smell isn&#x27;t offensively ladylike, and it lathers pretty well. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a body wash that wouldn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, and would also act as a sort of pH balancer for other sensitive feminine areas. I do not like any of the pH balancer products such as Summer&#x27;s Eve or Yves, because those also irritate my skin. This is the best product I have ever used in terms of skin irritation. It both moisturizes, makes the skin soft, and does not irritate at all.</li>
            <li> Not sure how much there is to say about this.  It smells decent - not too fragranced and not feminine - and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Great, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I like this product  it worked really good. I wasn&#x27;t really a fan of the smell but because it worked so good I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin, excellent for sensitive skin too.  Wish they would put back on Subscribe &amp; Save again, we would sign up for it monthly!</li>
            <li> Very good moisturizing body wash. Fragnance is mild and soothing. Skins feels softer over a period of time. Good value for money.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance, the texture, and the texture of my skin after using it. I have been using it continuously for over a year.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry, itchy skin.  I am in my early 70&#x27;s, and as I get older, my skin seems to get thinner and more dry.  This product did an excellent job of moisturizing my skin and relieving the itching for 24 hours.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Although this works well and smells pretty good, I still battle with dry skin. However it could be worse. I&#x27;m in chemotherapy and it is one of the better moisturizing washes I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Soap is mild, not overly scented.  Bottle is easy to handle.  Great product.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended Aveeno and I have been very pleased with it.  It suds us nicely with the net scrubbers and leaves my skin silky smooth</li>
            <li> I have bad Psoriasis and this body wash doesn&#x27;t aggravate my condition. I only use Aveeno.  The non-fragrance style is much better since less dyes and perfumes.</li>
            <li> I have always liked their products and this was a great deal to boot.  The body wash is creamy and your body feels good afterward.</li>
            <li> I bought this 2-pack of Aveeno Body Wash because I thought it was a great deal and I love Aveeno.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this body wash for a couple of months now.  I&#x27;ve used Olay and Dove body washes before, and they have worked fine, but this wash seems to make my skin feel the softest.  I only wish that they would make it fragrance free.  Also, it is a bit more expensive than other brands of body washes.  However, it is still reasonably priced and I think it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> Better than a bar of soap, smells nice, and you feel totally clean. Perfect thickness.</li>
            <li> I have been using this body wash for a few years now. I have found that by buying it through amazon I get 2 bottles for less than 1 bottle in the local stores. If you have dry skin, or skin sensitivity issues I highly recommend this soap and from buying it via amazon.</li>
            <li> I really love this body wash!  The scent is really mild and very nice....just a \\&quot;clean\\&quot; fragrance.  A little bit lathers very nicely in the shower.  I have sensitive skin and get rashes quite easily but this body wash is wonderful on my skin and I&#x27;ve had no bad reactions to it.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Most body washes leave my skin feeling dried out and feeling like I&#x27;m coated w/ invisible residue. However, this product helps my skin retain moisture, and leaves me feeling very clean. The scent is subtle, unisex, and pleasant as well. I have very sensitive skin &amp; this doesn&#x27;t irritate me either ^_^</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It is outstanding for people that have dry skin and it smells refreshing as well! Get it!</li>
            <li> This is by far the greates body wash on the market. I like to tan and this does such an excellent job of keeping my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve just started using it, so am not sure how well i like it yet</li>
            <li> I have terribly dry skin, to the point where my entire body would start itching just from walking.  I lead a pretty active lifestyle so this was a very unpleasant, and at times unbearable, issue for me.  After switching to this body wash I haven&#x27;t had a single problem.  This is the only body wash that I use.  It&#x27;s good stuff!</li>
            <li> The ingredients list not listed here. I would not have bought it if I have read the ingredients. Google it and you&#x27;ll see it is laced with chemicals. Two chemicals in the ingredient list you should google them yourself are Tetrasodium EDTA and quaternium-15, yikes! Aveeno is on my no no list now. FYI, Aveeno is a subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson.</li>
            <li> It does what it supposed to do without any issues and skin looks so smooth irrespective of how cold it is outside</li>
            <li> Got this for my son who has dry skin and its the best product that works for him - highly recommended</li>
            <li> So I have never been a big body wash guy, but I thought I would give this a try. I really like it and would totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> Have used this know several times and i love how soft and clean it leaves my skin.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin during the winter and have tried most moisturizing body washes and this one is the best.  I&#x27;ve been using it for close to two weeks now and when I apply it with the Aveeno lotion after showering I have no more itching or dry skin!  GREAT PRODUCT!  I only wish I would have found it sooner.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey compared to other stores.  Great product, just a significant more pricey on Amazon for some reason.  Fragrance is nice, skin feels good and clean.</li>
            <li> i cannot tell exactly which part of this body wash is great, but overall i love it.&lt;br /&gt;Gentle touch, smooth feeling, without awful scent... i will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of problems with sensitive skin.  I need a moisturizing body wash and have tried many different brands.  This has been the best so far, by far.  It doesn&#x27;t have a scent (at least, not one that is apparent, if anything, it smells little like oatmeal).  But it has been very gentle and has helped the overall feel of my skin.  I have issues with eczema on various spots on my body and this is really improving my skin.  Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I liked the Aveeno body moisturizing wash.. .meets expectation for price offered. Hope to continue this brand for long&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nisha</li>
            <li> This body wash hydrates my skin and smells great. A must have for people who has strong body odor. This body wash will help lessen the odor that your body produces.</li>
            <li> Great price for the 2 pack and I have been using Aveeno for the past 10 years leave your skin so soft.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it now, so I cannot say anything very specific about it. but it looks quite good for me.</li>
            <li> It does great moisturizing, I feel like a seal after using it.  Normally I tried to slide on my belly from my shower to my bedroom after using it. Success rates are marginal.</li>
            <li> I like this body wash very much! In fact, all of the Aveeno products I have tried are very nice.</li>
            <li> This is a go to moisturizer for people. Aveeno has a positive reputation where ever you go. It is a well known product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a  nourishing lotion which contains Colloidal Oatmeal blended with rich emollients to moisturize skin for a full 24 hours. I think it improves the health of my skin in 1 day with significant improvement in 2 weeks. It helps prevent and protect dry skin, it leaves skin feeling soft, smooth and naturally healthy-looking. It is gentle enough for everyday use, fragrance free, nongreasy, and noncomedogenic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the for several years and keep it in my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 06-05-13</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and I like this product. Smells great, cleans me up, nothing more to say. I did a lot of research (no idea why) and found this to be perfect combination of price and size.</li>
            <li> Odorless, smooth after effect,and cheap. Cant go wrong with this. Wont overly dry the skin either. This is a bodywash I always turn to.</li>
            <li> Best body wash for moisturizing in the winter. Completely cured my itchy skin from the blasted heater. No heavy scent, the smell doesn&#x27;t linger past toweling off. For some reason it&#x27;s difficult to find in stores. Maybe everyone likes it! The price on Amazon is almost as good for the 2 pack as I can find in my area for one.</li>
            <li> Have dry skin, so it works for me great.&lt;br /&gt;Also love the fragrance. Very delicate and does not have this &amp;#34;chip perfume&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> This bath lotion actually softens skin and prevents dryness.  It also foams up nicely for a pleasant bathing experience.  I liked the fact that it came in a package of 2 so I don&#x27;t have to order it often .  A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I bought this product for myself.  It is very moisterizing.  There is no scent but this is OK.  I use this product after I use a gentle soap, esp after I mow the lawn or work in the yard.  Also, there are women who can not use certain products on certain areas of the body.  I had no problem re personal areas.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin moisturized and smooth. I almost don&#x27;t have to use lotion after! The lotion works great for winter.</li>
            <li> Aveeno does prove the skin is clean and the smell of this soap smell really good. I would recommend it to people.</li>
            <li> Love that this is nourishing for my skin and smells nice.  My eczema is an issue and this really helps.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m a person that has always had very sensitive/dry skin.  I&#x27;ve had rosacea for as long as I can remember on my face and I also have a bad case of keratosis pilaris all over my chest, stomach, and upper arms.  Found out what the keratosis pilaris was from a dermatologist a few years ago, I&#x27;d just been calling it body acne, and he also commented I have the worst case he has ever seen.  Using moisturizers has been routine for me for the past 10 years. One winter while I was in middle school my skin became so dry and chapped that it had fissure like cracks and was bleeding, had to wear sandwich bags filled with bag balm on my hands for several days for them to get better as they had it the worst.  I went all crazy with covering my whole body with cocoa butter every morning until about 7 years ago when I started to only put it on my hands and face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now live in Utah and this place is very dry all year but it is terrible during winter.  For the past several winters I just mostly ignored my chaffing skin which was really itchy all over if I didn&#x27;t wear clothes to sleep.  I&#x27;ve entered day four of using this body wash, which I scrub in well all over with a bath sponge, and my skin is definitely visibly better all ready.  My upper arms used to look very dried out and flaky, and they were like that even during warmer months, but I&#x27;ve noticed since yesterday that they don&#x27;t look near as terrible as they usually do and feel smooth when I run my hands over them.  I&#x27;ve also been using the lotion moisturizer version of this, the one with SPF 15, and the cracks on the crevices between my knuckles are almost completely cleared up already.  Just a heads up though, someone pointed out either on these comments or on the moisturizer, that there are two chemicals that seem really scary.  Wiki&#x27;d the two chemicals and the Tetrasodium EDTA is toxic when ingested but has been shown that when inhaled in an aerosol form it can&#x27;t reach a level of toxicity that causes any kind ofadverse reactions.  It noted though that while it doesn&#x27;t soak through the skin it does \\&quot;chelate calcium\\&quot; which means it can possibly increase penetration of other chemicals that enter the skin.  The other chemical he mentioned, Quaternium 15, is a well known allergen that can cause contact dermatitis in people with sensitive skin which is a symptom of an allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t say the concentration they are used in but it hasn&#x27;t caused any problems for me thus far.  Just going to mention that my only allergy shown to come up in an allergy test is a slight reaction to dust.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many bodywashes. But this one takes the cake. It is the best body wash simply because it actually does get rid of dry skin. It&#x27;s a must try/have.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would say that this is a good body wash. It&#x27;s a little pricey when compared to other drugstore body washes, but I&#x27;d pay the extra money for Aveeno (I&#x27;m kind of addicted to their body lotion right now). The fragrance-free body wash still has a slight smell but it&#x27;s refreshing (the one that isn&#x27;t fragrance-free is a bit strong to me); and this product leaves your skin feeling very clean and fairly moisturized. I have used other body washes that leave my skin feeling insanely moisturized (which I love), but this one does the job just fine and it helps to soothe itchy winter skin. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I found this body wash listed on a government site which gives advice on treating eczema.  The PH is better than most other similar products.  I bought a tube and started using it regularly.  A number of annoying itchy sites cleared up in about a week.  I&#x27;m happy with it and keep using it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a body wash that would be great for my sensitive skin and not smell girly, so my husband could use it too. The smell of this is very soft and a little goes a long way. I have this on subscribe and save because I love it so much!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B004B87LP4 Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Body Wash, 12 Ounce (Pack of 2)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice gentle body wash that&#x27;s gentle on the skin and has a nice natural scent. Seems to be easy on my slightly sensitive skin. I&#x27;m liking it so far. Don&#x27;t expect the squeeky clean feel if you&#x27;ve used other body washes before, but it does a decent job of getting dirt and oil off. Amazon seems to have taken a break from selling a wider variety toiletry supplies. I believe this used to be sold direct from Amazon, but only 3rd party retailers now. Oh well. Not a big deal if I get the what I need.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I had a hard time finding it , until I went to Amazon.  It is a wonderful skin softener. I combine it with the moisturizing lotion, also.  Highly recommend this product.!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely buying this as my body wash in the future. After washing, my skin feels very comfortable, and there is none of that sticky feeling that comes afterwards with most soaps. It feels great!</li>
            <li> I received the product and when I opend up the case one of the tops on the bottles was cracked and leaking inside of the bag so I lost some. They need to ship this product in better boxes that can not be crushed or stepped on. It was shipped in a envelope type box and that is easy to damage. I will have to not order this from Amazon if this keeps happening.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and Aveeno was recommended by my dermatologist.  For years I stripped the moisture from my skin using soaps.  Should have been using Aveeno all along.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and decided to try something other than the &amp;#34;masculine,&amp;#34; fragrance-packed Old Spice stuff.  This Aveeno product moisturizes my skin quite well, greatly reducing the need for lotion (for example, my elbows, which are usually pretty rough, are much softer since using these product).  Highly recommended for those with dry skin.  A tip: don&#x27;t dry off completely with a towel after showering.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to go wrong with Aveeno. It makes my skin feel wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s all i can say about it.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.  Aveeno products don&#x27;t irritate my skin.  I&#x27;ve used their mosturizers, lotions, and body washes.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with Aveeno.</li>
            <li> If you suffer dry skin as I do, this product is a Godsend! A little goes a long way. I used to dread my winter showers knowing I would have to slather on the lotion head to toe afterwards. With this body wash, you don&#x27;t feel the need to add lotion. It makes my skin soft, clean, and well nourished. Never subscribing to regular delivery on any product, this will be the exception.</li>
            <li> Feel really, really great on your skin and does not dry it out, combined with the lotion perfect match... I really love it...</li>
            <li> What a great scent! I catch myself using more than I need to because it feels so good on my skin and I love the big soft foamy lather it yields. The scent is so relaxing as it fills the room with fresh aromas and your skin is just as soft as can be. Hands down the best for me. Florida can be very dry at times and its then when this body wash does the most for me.</li>
            <li> If you get dirty you wanna buy this.  It helps make you more clean.  It&#x27;s a great conversation starter. :-0</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally use body washes that contain the word &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; in the product name; they typically leave behind a grimy residue on my skin.  It&#x27;s the middle of winter in Chicago, and my elbows are sore and ashy from the frigid temperatures and the dry heat in my apartment.  Lotion alone isn&#x27;t helping, so I decided to try Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Body Wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s thick and creamy with a fresh, pleasant fragrance (it&#x27;s not fragrance-free, but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger and is definitely unisex).  I don&#x27;t always enjoy using a washcloth or pouf, but I find it&#x27;s not necessary with this product.  While it doesn&#x27;t create a lot of bubbles or a thick foam, the body wash lathers enough to make me feel like it&#x27;s doing its job.  It gets me clean and I don&#x27;t step out of the shower feeling like there&#x27;s an oil slick on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the downside, it does take a little bit longer to rinse completely off.  I&#x27;ve also noticed that it leaves *a lot* of soap scum behind in the tub--something I haven&#x27;t experienced with other products.  (I don&#x27;t sweat a lot, and it&#x27;s not like I only shower once a week.)  Having to wash the tub after each use is only a minor inconvenience at this point, but I might grow tired of it and decide that it&#x27;s not really worth the extra hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I really enjoy using this! I can see it being an awesome choice for someone that loves thick, creamy soaps.</li>
            <li> Bought two  packs of this Aveeno Body wash, one set for Mom and one set for myself. Makes our skin feel so good.  The natural oatmeal that is used in this body wash is also great for people whom have allergies, helps calm down the allergies.  Consider the options.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of experience with hair/body products both good and bad.  As a bed confined person, caring for my hair and skin are major challenges.  Aveeno body wash is fantastic for dry and fragile skin.  It smells fragrant, but not overpowering or too girlie.  My bathing Aide was ready to run off with the bottle for her own use.  It lathers easily and rinses cleanly.  My Aide used three separate tubs for a single bath because she enjoyed it so much.  Of course, Aveeno products are known to be premium products.  Their customer service is fantastic too.  I had a question about the differences between two shampoo formulas, and they answered my email swiftly and informatively.  Kudos to Amazon on their pricing and shipping speed.</li>
            <li> Does it&#x27;s job.&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizes well. Daily use cures dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for people with dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Hope it is a little cheaper though...</li>
            <li> After i use this body wash, i no need put on my body lotion anymore, it&#x27;s creamy but won&#x27;t let you  feel &amp;#34;too much&amp;#34;, i think it&#x27;s better to use during the winter time. and i like the scent too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from a skin condition for over 30 years - most any bar soap or body wash I have used does nothing to help relieve itching and dryness especially during the winter months (in fact, most have made it worse).  Thought I&#x27;d give Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Body Wash a try and was I surprised - and relieved!  This works so wonderfully; it is so gentle and soothing.  I do hope anyone who is wondering if this product works just tries it - it only takes once and you will feel the difference immediately.  Smells very neutral and clean, nothing perfume-like.</li>
            <li> I have egzema and this is really helping my skin by moisturizing it during showers, and not irritating. I will be buying more of these for sure as the price is the best through Amazon.</li>
            <li> This body wash is excellent for preserving moisture during those dry winter months. It&#x27;s lightly scented but does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great product as all Aveeno products are and I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it as I had always wanted to try it no I&#x27;m a huge fan!!</li>
            <li> It leaves your sking very smooth, I like the smell  and the price was really good I definetely will buy it again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered for years from hand eczema and dry winter skin. Nothing I&#x27;ve tried has worked until I used this body wash. I looked for it after I saw amazing results in my daughter&#x27;s eczema using [[ASIN:B0030UB9PW Aveeno Baby Soothing Relief Cream Wash, 12 Ounce]]. In her case, we found the new detergent base in [[ASIN:B005HO0AR2 Dove Bar Soap, Sensitive Skin Unscented, 4 Ounce, 16 Count]] was triggering rashes and horrible itching, to the point of bleeding. Other baby washes, such as [[ASIN:B0054J2HI0 Johnson&#x27;s Baby Bath Head to Toe Baby Wash, 28 Ounce (Pack of 2)]] were drying as well. With the Aveeno cream wash, her skin cleared up almost completely. It also works well as a mild baby shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since tried other Aveeno products, including [[ASIN:B001QT3GOQ Aveeno Nourish + Moisturize Shampoo, 10.5 Ounce]] and [[ASIN:B001QT8CX6 Aveeno Nourish + Moisturize Conditioner, 10.5 Ounce]], and saw a dramatic improvement in my dry flyaway hair in just three uses. Prior to that I had been using Pantene products and was resigned to having bad hair days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had thought my dry skin and flyaway hair were just the result of pregnancies and getting older. But these Aveeno products all claim to do what they advertise. For the first time in years my skin is soft and my hair smooth. Even my husband noticed. Amazing :)</li>
            <li> A great product for very dry skin. I have very dry skin and it helps so much. I would recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> My hair is completely damage because of I straightened way too much! I started using Aveeno and OH BOY! what a difference it was!, my hair has gone back to it&#x27;s black, soft, natural, and beautiful look! A MUST HAVE PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;I use the body wash and conditioner as well, and OMG!</li>
            <li> Only bath wash I use year-round.  No more itchy, flaky skin all winter. Even my husband uses it-wish he&#x27;d buy his own.</li>
            <li> Nice neutral scent that even my husband doesn&#x27;t mind, and he hates most fragrances!  Makes nice suds while it moisturizes.</li>
            <li> I have pretty nice skin overall except for the same recurring &#x27;patches&#x27; as I call them on my car. Right near my nose but before my cheek. Both sides of my face. If I stay on top of them... they aren&#x27;t really there. If I dont moisturize or keep them dirt free they get red and peely. Looks awful and it&#x27;s right on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff does the trick. Daily with this and it&#x27;s pretty much 95% gone. I try to keep this in stock always.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin which will break out in a rash if not properly cared for. I use this daily and it helps a great deal.</li>
            <li> This is a good body wash for everyday use. There are no extra annoying fragrances or scents. It just provides simple, gentle cleansing.</li>
            <li> Tried it and lathers up extremely well. Much better than others I&#x27;ve tried that did&#x27;nt leave a clean feeling as this</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this to me to relieve neurodermatitis.  As a long time Oil of Olay Body Wash user, I was reluctant to switch, but after my skin condition flared up, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I am so glad I did.  It leaves my skin feeling clean and moisturized and has helped ease the discomfort of my neurodermatitis as well.  It is a little pricier than Olay, but well worth it and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Has a lovely, luxurious lather, and a subtle, fresh fragrance.  I used to have quite dry skin that was itchy all the time.  Not since day one of using this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is the best gentle soap that works great on my sensitive skin.  It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out of all.</li>
            <li> I have been using old-spice body wash until recently. That stuff smells good, but makes my skin feel dry, so I decided to try this Aveeno product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin feel smooth, very nice.  No more dry feeling after the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also lathers very nicely, big bubblyness in my shower.  Smells mildly similar to the other oaty Aveeno products, which I like but might not be for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> Why is it that whenever I find something GREAT it suddenly goes away. This body wash in this size is simply GREAT. You just really feel clean. But alas, now it is gone and its much bigger brother is the only one available. But he is far to big to safely handle in a shower.</li>
            <li> Our families enjoy having a variety of Body Washes, because many of us feel it is better to alternate and not only have the same formula or the same item in any category day in and day out, so we went in  search of another Body Wash on Amazon&#x27;s website, and we decided to give this one a try, so that is what we are doing, we are giving it a try, and so far, we are hanging on to it, so when we have more longer term observations, we will try to add those commentaries as well. Meanwhile, may all your searches for items with Amazon be pleasant. Blessings.</li>
            <li> My husband has mild excema so I bought him Aveeno Body Wash in hopes of reducing the incessant itching.  He finally went to the doctors who said this was the best body wash for sensitive skin.  It has a pleasant, mild scent and has really helped relieve some of the itch.  In just a couple of days his skin looks better.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Found what I was looking for. Fantastic product, my teenage son loves it to. Highly recommended for sensitive skin. Can&#x27;t go wrong with Aveeno.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have used it for years and am very happy with the results. Makes my skin feel great.</li>
            <li> Winter dried out my skin and the spring sun also drained my skin of moisture. I love aveeno products and this body wash. My skin feels super smooth and hydrated after using this product. The best thing about it was that there are 2 bottles! I thought for the price I was only getting one. Such a steal.</li>
            <li> I just love this stuff.  Smells good without being overpowering.  Creats a nice soapy froth that I can shave my legs with, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin itchy. This is the second batch I&#x27;ve ordered and will probably order again and again.</li>
            <li> A little of this soap goes a long way. The smell is very subtle, I don&#x27;t know for others but this is a plus for me. Leaves my skin feeling great</li>
            <li> at the monment I purchased it, I thought I could take a try for another product.&lt;br /&gt;it smell really good.</li>
            <li> I have fallen in love with a different brand of body soaps that are paraben free.  Before, I was a loyal fan of Aveeno.  Nothing wrong with the product, just that it has parabens (nothing toxic), but not as natural as some of the other soaps that I have discovered.  I love the scent, and how it feels on the skin after each use.  It a great product, but I have found betters ones recently.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it has a very clean and fresh smell.  A little amount also goes a long way.  I will be using this product often and for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended I switch to this body wash to help with my sensitive skin and I am so glad I did!  I used to think my skin was just excessively dry and the cure was more lotion.  When I switched to this body wash most of my skin irritation vanished.  Turns out that my skin was only a little dry, but I&#x27;m sensitive to perfumes and ingredients in other body washes.  Aveeno&#x27;s formula contains oatmeal which really helps calm my skin down.  It also has very little fragrance.  I would definitely recommend to anyone with sensitive or irritated skin.</li>
            <li> This  body wash is good and helps moisturize your skin....only problem is when you get out of the shower you still feel very soapy because its like impossible to get the wash off your skin using water.</li>
            <li> It has a nice subtle scent - not perfumy and a little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> Very good product. There were many to choose from and a large selection of similar items but figured this would be the best to purchase. Along with a very nice discounted price which made purchasing this items without any hesitation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> The product is great, ordered it twice already. Leaves your skin clean and moisturized, no dryness. The product is natural, without any harsh chemicals. Best price to buy: 6-7$ for a 12 ounce bottle.</li>
            <li> I subscribe to the Aveeno Daily Moistuizring Body Wash so that I never run out!  This is the best there is!</li>
