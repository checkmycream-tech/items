            <li>I still have this from 2012, great product.</li>
            <li>It is a great product for the price</li>
            <li>but works great as a blush.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product at an amazing price.</li>
            <li>Shipping to me was great.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>SO cute!!</li>
            <li>The brush that comes with it isn&#x27;t very good, so you probably want to buy your own (a quality make-up brush</li>
            <li>I thought this would look great in my Zpalette and from the reviews it sounded like a good product.</li>
            <li>very adorable leopard pattern, the inside opens up and has a very cute brush underneath!</li>
            <li>It gives good color with a pinkish undertone.</li>
            <li>Seems to be a good product and</li>
            <li>I have fair, freckled skin</li>
            <li>I have a fair complexion, no acne at all, and oily skin</li>
            <li>I am fair complected and it gives me really good color.</li>
            <li>In the end, it was a good gamble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellent product worth the experience</li>
            <li>sure this could have been a great product, but seeing the quality of the one I ordered, 1/5.</li>
            <li>I love it and for the price you are getting a really great product.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with what I saw--</li>
            <li>This is very beautiful to look at in the package, and I am sure that it would work well for a very light or fair person much better.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love When Leopard Gets a Tan blush/bronzer!  </li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>Favorite bronzer of all time!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>the service is phenomenal!</li>
            <li>Makes my face look amazing and even my husband seen a difference.</li>
            <li>Amazing color and pigment for the price.</li>
            <li>the end look is nice.  </li>
            <li>I liked it.</li>
            <li>The shimmer makes for a very glam look, but you can adjust the amount of product and blend to get the perfect look.</li>
            <li>it was really nice.</li>
            <li>It comes with its own brush and mirror too, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li>I was really excited for this product, and it looks very nice in packaging.</li>
            <li>there is good amount of shimmer in here still, but used with a light hand you get more of a bronze/shaded look in comparison to Too Faced&#x27;s version.</li>
            <li>Love love love this bronzer..</li>
            <li>and this is more affordable.  </li>
            <li>and this looks more like a blush than bronzer on me.  </li>
            <li>i am glad i bought this.</li>
            <li>I love everything about this bronzer.</li>
            <li>It may be that this has more brown and</li>
            <li>Too Faced&#x27;s has more gold???</li>
            <li>It comes in a cute compact.</li>
            <li>and this is much cheaper and provides great color on the cheeks...</li>
            <li>This works just as well and is so cute</li>
            <li>I gave this to my mother she has a fairer complexion then mine, so it shows up on her better.</li>
            <li>Love love LOVE</li>
            <li>The product looks ok.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute if you&#x27;re auditioning for the Jersey Shore.</li>
            <li>Why you would use that when bronzing brushes are so much better is beyond me, but it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li>As for the product, its a lovely color, its more of a mauve highlighter than a bronzer.</li>
            <li>This was just OK</li>
            <li>The only reason why I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars is because the color pigmentation is GOOD and the packaging is very cute.</li>
            <li>Its light and illuminates your skin, but doesn&#x27;t have the orangy glow that most bronzers i&#x27;ve tried have.</li>
            <li>I just use a light dusting for day &amp; add a bit more for a nighttime look.</li>
            <li>brush is nice, and mirror compact is useful.</li>
            <li>The color of this bronzer is pretty nice.</li>
            <li>For sure, but I&#x27;d choose this one any day over Too Faced&#x27;s version because of the price, the (better, imo) packaging, and the higher level of pigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s lucky he&#x27;s cute.</li>
            <li>Smooth finish and can also be used as a blush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fabulous.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t fit into a compact).</li>
            <li>so I happily pay the extra shipping just to get it!!</li>
            <li>Ive never had such great service.</li>
            <li>love the color and was sealed and new.  very affordable and a good product</li>
            <li>I originally purchased a bronzer by Two Faced that is just like this.  </li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>i have unique skin color.</li>
            <li>This came in it&#x27;s original box as assured and in pristine quality.</li>
            <li>The leopard patterns was cute, but far more pigmented than I had anticipated.</li>
            <li>I was hopeful that this would be a beautiful compromise, this goes on DARK.</li>
            <li>I think that it is a good product overall and</li>
            <li>the price point is cool also.</li>
            <li>Start light or you might apply too much!</li>
            <li>I really needed a summer bronzer &amp; this has become my new favorite product!</li>
            <li>Just a very light dusting of it left my face completely bright pinkish orange, not tan, and I had barely used any.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so cute to look at and gives my cheeks a very natural flush.</li>
            <li>The actual product is darker than the picture, but I love it!</li>
            <li>Color was different when I got it, but I love it anyway!</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li>and it was perfect for me, the only this is that it is more pink that I thought, but since my favorite color is pink there was no issue, other may think it was going to be more brown.</li>
            <li>The shipper was not very helpful but AMAZON WAS FANTASTIC!!  </li>
            <li>just a natural light bronzed glow</li>
            <li>First off looks nothing like the photo.</li>
            <li>This is the first NYX product that I&#x27;ve ever bought</li>
            <li>the color is so pretty.</li>
            <li>If you, on the other hand, like some shimmer... you&#x27;ll love this!</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite different than the Too Faced powder, and I find it more flattering on me.</li>
            <li>This is the same thing but at a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I am Blonde, blue eyed and fair skinned.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty on, love it and a lot less than some of the more pricier options for this similar product.</li>
            <li>When the bronzer arrived, I was pretty excited to open the box and try it...</li>
            <li>This is still extremely suitable for fair skin, which I have, and may also work nicely as a subtle sandy pink on medium tones.</li>
            <li>Way more pink than bronzer, I use this very sparingly.</li>
            <li>I am liking this just as much as the one by Two Faced</li>
            <li>Came fast.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to this product.</li>
            <li>Soo much darker than it appears</li>
            <li>I really like this bronzing powder.</li>
            <li>I really like the coloring of this bronzer and that it has both bronzer and blush in one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gives my pale skin a nice bronze glow.</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive this product, because let&#x27;s face it, I am a sucker for cute packaging and product design.</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty tan and the color is very natural on me.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to others, just keep in mind if you like more of a pink bronzer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The colors are a pretty pink and a light bronze color.  </li>
            <li>As others have mentioned it is more pigmented and slightly less shimmery.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;NYX&#x27;s version is more of a brownish tone than pinkish and less shimmery.</li>
            <li>I prefer my bronzers to be less sparkle, more warmth.</li>
            <li>This goes on super red.</li>
            <li>This would be a decent bronzer if not for the shimmer, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>For dark skins, I believe this would work nicely as a unique highlighter (since its not so champagne it may look more natural and not so white.)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Being a stay home mommy of two baby people I just wanted a nice subtle bronzer.</li>
            <li>Faced Pink Leopard, thinking that the $9 price tag was a better choice for my wallet and that it would be similar enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Natural!</li>
            <li>It can give you a subtle glow or a more sunkissed bronze look, depending on how much you use.</li>
            <li>Much more pink than bronze, but a decent dupe for Too Faced Pink Leopard</li>
            <li>Just a bunch of soft, brown pebble-sized powder.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t sell it at a store near me</li>
            <li>and I am not a very dark person!</li>
            <li>The pinks combined with Browns in this makes for such a natural bronzed look!</li>
            <li>More expensive than the average drug store bronzer, but it is still a unique product.  </li>
            <li>it looks natural, no splotch or obvious of product application..</li>
            <li>packaging was also very secure, didn&#x27;t come broken!</li>
            <li>Gives me a gentle glow and cost much less than a similar item from a big name cosmetics brand.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s quite different than the Too Faced powder, and I find it more flattering on me.</li>
            <li> This is the same thing but at a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I am Blonde, blue eyed and fair skinned.  </li>
            <li> Very pretty on, love it and a lot less than some of the more pricier options for this similar product.</li>
            <li> When the bronzer arrived, I was pretty excited to open the box and try it...</li>
            <li> This is still extremely suitable for fair skin, which I have, and may also work nicely as a subtle sandy pink on medium tones.</li>
            <li> Way more pink than bronzer, I use this very sparingly.</li>
            <li> I am liking this just as much as the one by Two Faced</li>
            <li> Came fast.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to this product.</li>
            <li> Soo much darker than it appears</li>
            <li> I really like this bronzing powder.</li>
            <li> I really like the coloring of this bronzer and that it has both bronzer and blush in one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gives my pale skin a nice bronze glow.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this product, because let&#x27;s face it, I am a sucker for cute packaging and product design.</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty tan and the color is very natural on me.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to others, just keep in mind if you like more of a pink bronzer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The colors are a pretty pink and a light bronze color.  </li>
            <li> As others have mentioned it is more pigmented and slightly less shimmery.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;NYX&#x27;s version is more of a brownish tone than pinkish and less shimmery.</li>
            <li> I prefer my bronzers to be less sparkle, more warmth.</li>
            <li> This goes on super red.</li>
            <li> This would be a decent bronzer if not for the shimmer, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> For dark skins, I believe this would work nicely as a unique highlighter (since its not so champagne it may look more natural and not so white.)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Being a stay home mommy of two baby people I just wanted a nice subtle bronzer.</li>
            <li> Faced Pink Leopard, thinking that the $9 price tag was a better choice for my wallet and that it would be similar enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Natural!</li>
            <li> It can give you a subtle glow or a more sunkissed bronze look, depending on how much you use.</li>
            <li> Much more pink than bronze, but a decent dupe for Too Faced Pink Leopard</li>
            <li> Just a bunch of soft, brown pebble-sized powder.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t sell it at a store near me</li>
            <li> and I am not a very dark person!</li>
            <li> The pinks combined with Browns in this makes for such a natural bronzed look!</li>
            <li> More expensive than the average drug store bronzer, but it is still a unique product.  </li>
            <li> it looks natural, no splotch or obvious of product application..</li>
            <li> packaging was also very secure, didn&#x27;t come broken!</li>
            <li> Gives me a gentle glow and cost much less than a similar item from a big name cosmetics brand.</li>
            <li> I thought it would make my otherwise pale face look freshly bronzed like other bronzers I&#x27;ve used, but instead I looked like I was a pinkish oompa-loompa.</li>
            <li> It is very highly pigmented, so you only need a small amount of product.</li>
            <li> an aside, this comes with a flat brush tucked underneath the pan.</li>
            <li> so If you want to achieve a natural bronze look (without that freaky orange glow)use just a little bit starting with the cheeks and using the remainder on the rest of your face to even out the look.</li>
            <li> I know this will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I know packages get thrown around whilst being shipped, but mind you, this was in a box along with other fragile items reinforced with airbags/bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> Just what was expected and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Not too brown, not too pink.</li>
            <li> This bronzing powder works well as a blush as well as a bronzer, with its pink and brown elements.</li>
            <li> I was using it with Skin79 BB Cream (be careful with fakes) and</li>
            <li> I braced myself when I opened the compact and the powder inside was completely crushed into a million pieces.</li>
            <li> The seller shipped it before the expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like a pink blush than a bronzer...slightly disappointed.</li>
            <li> so a little goes a long way for me.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The colors are DARK and the pink is an electric dark pink.</li>
            <li> not as dark as i expected-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased and used the Too Faced brand Leopard bronzer, which is pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> This is subtle, even though the colors seem a bit strange when you open the compact.  </li>
            <li> This shipped one time, and very carefully packaged.</li>
            <li> The mix of dark pink &amp; brown basically means I have a blush &amp; bronzer in one!</li>
            <li> So if you are in the medium to dark range, it may work for you as a highlighter, but not a bronzer.</li>
            <li> I was not happy to see that the color was not lilght pinks and soft shimmer brown.</li>
            <li> The problem is I was looking for a less shimmering product.</li>
            <li> WHAT I GOT was a dark pin, magenta and avocado green.</li>
            <li> Darling little spot rosette powder.</li>
            <li> Just what you need to add a little bit of color a little goes along way</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too sparkly for me.</li>
            <li> and I ended up giving it to my little sister.</li>
            <li> i am tan with an olive pink under tone so buying bronzers and foundations is so hard for me.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday, summer or winter, day or night makeup.</li>
            <li> Which heavily leans on the highlighter end of things.</li>
            <li> I use this bronzer everyday.</li>
            <li> but no place around my small oklahoma town sales NYX</li>
            <li> so it is really hard to find a shade that works.</li>
            <li> (the brush is very hard</li>
            <li> This arrived completely broken.</li>
            <li> I think it was broken before they mailed it</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with leopard</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t catch me wrong...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to even return this because the shipping fee for this is half the price of this awful product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have wanted the too faced leopard bronzer, but its so expensive!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Absolutely AWFUL the color is YUCKY brown!</li>
            <li> It was blotchy and disgusting.</li>
            <li> Just awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love love love this bronzer.. it looks natural, no splotch or obvious of product application.. just a natural light bronzed glow</li>
            <li> I originally purchased a bronzer by Two Faced that is just like this.  I ran out and purchased this one.  I am liking this just as much as the one by Two Faced and this is more affordable.  A win win!</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this product, because let&#x27;s face it, I am a sucker for cute packaging and product design. I thought this would look great in my Zpalette and from the reviews it sounded like a good product. I was not disappointed. It gives good color with a pinkish undertone. You don&#x27;t have to worry about the Willy Wonka orange that you can get with a lot of bronzers. Very happy with the look of the product and ever more so with how it performed!</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for summer, the packaging is very cute as well!  The colors are a pretty pink and a light bronze color.  My skin is pretty tan and the color is very natural on me.  I wear MAC&#x27;s NC35 and this looks more like a blush than bronzer on me.  It has a mirror on the bottom, and comes with a brush (the brush is very hard and I didnt&#x27; use it) but loved this product!  great price as well.</li>
            <li> First off looks nothing like the photo. I opened this compact and I felt like I stepped back into my stripper heels. The colors are DARK and the pink is an electric dark pink. Being a stay home mommy of two baby people I just wanted a nice subtle bronzer. This is NOT that bronzer. The only reason why I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars is because the color pigmentation is GOOD and the packaging is very cute. But as I am no longer a pole dancer this is NOT something I will be using on a daily....</li>
            <li> not as dark as i expected- i like my bronzers darkkk!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect bronzer/blush. One swipe and you are good to go! I love it!</li>
            <li> Much more pink than bronze, but a decent dupe for Too Faced Pink Leopard</li>
            <li> love the color and was sealed and new.  very affordable and a good product</li>
            <li> This goes on super red. Bought it because my dog ate my Bronzed Leopard by Too Faced, yes, he ate it. He&#x27;s lucky he&#x27;s cute. I was hopeful that this would be a beautiful compromise, this goes on DARK.</li>
            <li> This would be a decent bronzer if not for the shimmer, in my opinion. I found that it does make a good blush though! I just feel that it&#x27;s too shimmery to do the contouring I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I still have this from 2012, great product. Smooth finish and can also be used as a blush.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a good product and the end look is nice.  Just what was expected and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> i have unique skin color. i am tan with an olive pink under tone so buying bronzers and foundations is so hard for me. i am glad i bought this. Makes my face look amazing and even my husband seen a difference.</li>
            <li> It is a great product for the price but I felt it was too pinky for a bronzing powder...but works great as a blush.</li>
            <li> I liked it. Came fast.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this bronzer. Its light and illuminates your skin, but doesn&#x27;t have the orangy glow that most bronzers i&#x27;ve tried have. Will purchase again! If i ever run out that is!</li>
            <li> Very pretty on, love it and a lot less than some of the more pricier options for this similar product.</li>
            <li> Love When Leopard Gets a Tan blush/bronzer!  Gives me a gentle glow and cost much less than a similar item from a big name cosmetics brand. Darling little spot rosette powder. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Excellent product worth the experience</li>
            <li> This is the first NYX product that I&#x27;ve ever bought and I love it! I am obsessed with leopard and it was perfect for me, the only this is that it is more pink that I thought, but since my favorite color is pink there was no issue, other may think it was going to be more brown. I would highly recommend this product to others, just keep in mind if you like more of a pink bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was also very secure, didn&#x27;t come broken! very adorable leopard pattern, the inside opens up and has a very cute brush underneath!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like a pink blush than a bronzer...slightly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Way more pink than bronzer, I use this very sparingly.</li>
            <li> Thank you I am very happy</li>
            <li> I really needed a summer bronzer &amp; this has become my new favorite product! I have fair, freckled skin so it is really hard to find a shade that works. The actual product is darker than the picture, but I love it! The mix of dark pink &amp; brown basically means I have a blush &amp; bronzer in one! It is very highly pigmented, so you only need a small amount of product. I know this will last a very long time. I just use a light dusting for day &amp; add a bit more for a nighttime look. The shimmer makes for a very glam look, but you can adjust the amount of product and blend to get the perfect look. This is an excellent product at an amazing price. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Favorite bronzer of all time! I use this everyday, summer or winter, day or night makeup. It&#x27;s fabulous. It can give you a subtle glow or a more sunkissed bronze look, depending on how much you use. The color combo is just perfect! Not too brown, not too pink. Natural! I love it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely AWFUL the color is YUCKY brown!</li>
            <li> More expensive than the average drug store bronzer, but it is still a unique product.  I&#x27;ve purchased and used the Too Faced brand Leopard bronzer, which is pretty expensive. I prefer the price point of this bronzer.  As others have mentioned it is more pigmented and slightly less shimmery.  Don&#x27;t catch me wrong... there is good amount of shimmer in here still, but used with a light hand you get more of a bronze/shaded look in comparison to Too Faced&#x27;s version. Which heavily leans on the highlighter end of things. It may be that this has more brown and Too Faced&#x27;s has more gold??? This is still extremely suitable for fair skin, which I have, and may also work nicely as a subtle sandy pink on medium tones. For dark skins, I believe this would work nicely as a unique highlighter (since its not so champagne it may look more natural and not so white.) For sure, but I&#x27;d choose this one any day over Too Faced&#x27;s version because of the price, the (better, imo) packaging, and the higher level of pigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband ordered this for me. This came in it&#x27;s original box as assured and in pristine quality. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> This bronzing powder works well as a blush as well as a bronzer, with its pink and brown elements. It comes in a cute compact. The brush that comes with it isn&#x27;t very good, so you probably want to buy your own (a quality make-up brush doesn&#x27;t fit into a compact).</li>
            <li> the color is so pretty. brush is nice, and mirror compact is useful. I do use a different brush to apply, but would use theirs in a pinch.</li>
            <li> Color was different when I got it, but I love it anyway!</li>
            <li> I received this product back in September 2012.  I was using it with Skin79 BB Cream (be careful with fakes) and it was really nice. It&#x27;s definitely a bronzer so If you want to achieve a natural bronze look (without that freaky orange glow)use just a little bit starting with the cheeks and using the remainder on the rest of your face to even out the look. I have a fair complexion, no acne at all, and oily skin so a little goes a long way for me.</li>
            <li> When the bronzer arrived, I was pretty excited to open the box and try it... I opened the box and before I could even open the compact, powder was everywhere. I braced myself when I opened the compact and the powder inside was completely crushed into a million pieces. Not usable at all. It didn&#x27;t even look like the product advertised here. Just a bunch of soft, brown pebble-sized powder. I know packages get thrown around whilst being shipped, but mind you, this was in a box along with other fragile items reinforced with airbags/bubble wrap. I&#x27;m fairly disappointed. I&#x27;m not going to even return this because the shipping fee for this is half the price of this awful product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure this could have been a great product, but seeing the quality of the one I ordered, 1/5.</li>
            <li> The pinks combined with Browns in this makes for such a natural bronzed look! I love it!</li>
            <li> Darker than the picture</li>
            <li> I use this bronzer everyday. I love it and for the price you are getting a really great product. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a shimmery bronzer/blush.</li>
            <li> This is compared to the same product that too faced has and this is much cheaper and provides great color on the cheeks...I wouldn&#x27;t bother spending the extra money to get the one through Too Faced. This is the same thing but at a more reasonable price. I absolutely love it!!! Bronzer/blush!</li>
            <li> SO cute!! I have wanted the too faced leopard bronzer, but its so expensive! This works just as well and is so cute</li>
            <li> This is very beautiful to look at in the package, and I am sure that it would work well for a very light or fair person much better. As for me, it does work well as a highlight, but the bronzer does not show up on my skin and I am not a very dark person! So if you are in the medium to dark range, it may work for you as a highlighter, but not a bronzer. I think that it is a good product overall and the price point is cool also. I do like Nyx products, which is why I decided to try it. Maybe one could swatch it at the store before buying.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my mother she has a fairer complexion then mine, so it shows up on her better. She loves it and has no complaints about this product. The seller shipped it before the expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I wanted! I am Blonde, blue eyed and fair skinned.  This looks great on me!</li>
            <li> This stuff is beautiful. My #1 makeup must have. They don&#x27;t sell it at a store near me so I happily pay the extra shipping just to get it!! Love love LOVE</li>
            <li> The color of this bronzer is pretty nice. The problem is I was looking for a less shimmering product. So, if you are looking for a mate bronzer: this is not the one!. If you, on the other hand, like some shimmer... you&#x27;ll love this!</li>
            <li> This arrived completely broken. It was all powder.  The box itself wasn&#x27;t sealed and the compact was scratched and part of the image was rubbed off.  I think it was broken before they mailed it and it just got mixed up in the mail.  I was really looking forward to this product. Thanks amazon!</li>
            <li> Soo much darker than it appears</li>
            <li> Shipping to me was great. The product looks ok. BUT The colors where not correct. I was not happy to see that the color was not lilght pinks and soft shimmer brown. WHAT I GOT was a dark pin, magenta and avocado green. The shipper was not very helpful but AMAZON WAS FANTASTIC!!  Maybe the shipper can update the picture for people who are looking for darker colors.</li>
            <li> I was really excited for this product, and it looks very nice in packaging. The leopard patterns was cute, but far more pigmented than I had anticipated. Just a very light dusting of it left my face completely bright pinkish orange, not tan, and I had barely used any. I thought it would make my otherwise pale face look freshly bronzed like other bronzers I&#x27;ve used, but instead I looked like I was a pinkish oompa-loompa.</li>
            <li> Amazing color and pigment for the price.</li>
            <li> This makeup sucked. It was blotchy and disgusting. It did not blend well. It&#x27;s cute if you&#x27;re auditioning for the Jersey Shore. Just awful.</li>
            <li> I really like this bronzing powder. I am fair complected and it gives me really good color. It comes with its own brush and mirror too, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> Just what you need to add a little bit of color a little goes along way</li>
            <li> This is subtle, even though the colors seem a bit strange when you open the compact.  I used a blush brush, watched a video on how to use a sculpting bronzer, and tried it.  I was very pleased with what I saw-- and now use this every day.</li>
            <li> I really like the coloring of this bronzer and that it has both bronzer and blush in one. However, I&#x27;m not a fan of the brush that comes with it, but I had a different brush anyways.</li>
            <li> Great product. A little goes a long way. Start light or you might apply too much!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my dying Too Faced Pink Leopard, thinking that the $9 price tag was a better choice for my wallet and that it would be similar enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NYX&#x27;s version is more of a brownish tone than pinkish and less shimmery. It&#x27;s gives my pale skin a nice bronze glow. It&#x27;s quite different than the Too Faced powder, and I find it more flattering on me. In the end, it was a good gamble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an aside, this comes with a flat brush tucked underneath the pan. Why you would use that when bronzing brushes are so much better is beyond me, but it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! It&#x27;s so cute to look at and gives my cheeks a very natural flush. I will say the mirror is under the product and you have to flip back and forth to use it and I find that inconvenut. I also think this is cheaper in stores but no place around my small oklahoma town sales NYX so it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li> the service is phenomenal! Ive never had such great service. As for the product, its a lovely color, its more of a mauve highlighter than a bronzer. This shipped one time, and very carefully packaged.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too sparkly for me. I prefer my bronzers to be less sparkle, more warmth. This was just OK and I ended up giving it to my little sister.</li>
