            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>I liked that one, but found the unit would not stay in place.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend these and buying from them as their shipping and price are just as wonderful as their product.</li>
            <li>The seller is super nice too!</li>
            <li>we got the product very quickly and so far I&#x27;m very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>just the greatest!They make my back feel great as well as my feet!</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>and we have gifted them to others in our family because they work so well.  </li>
            <li>This is the best back scrubber I have ever found.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>It really works, feels great on backside</li>
            <li>This worked better</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>I have steered many friends to this product.</li>
            <li>The pad I used for my back was wonderful.</li>
            <li>but I found that because I added more pressure on the foot pad-</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>Also seller is fantastic, received a nice note in package.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this thing.  </li>
            <li>I have limited flexability and find this is a perfect product for me.  </li>
            <li>It works great on your back, but I got more out of it for my feet.</li>
            <li>This is easy to attach to the shower wall, rub some soap in your hands and all over the shower pad and lean against it to use...</li>
            <li>NOW if they replace the pad with authentic QUALITY material that would last &amp; NOT this cheap plastic nylon do hickie, then maybe it would be a great product.</li>
            <li>They tell you to put it up in the diamond shape instead of square to get more of the scrubbing area and that is true.</li>
            <li>fairly easy to clean.... and the pad holding up well.</li>
            <li>It is cheap nylon &amp; after 3</li>
            <li>If you can get it to stick to the shower wall, you&#x27;re lucky.</li>
            <li>This unit does a much better job at staying because there are many smaller suction cups on it.  </li>
            <li>With the long handled brush you&#x27;re only able to apply so much pressure but this pad works great!</li>
            <li>I agree with another review here that says it&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny, great product and now my son can wash his back properly.</li>
            <li>I love to be barefoot especially in the summer.</li>
            <li>and the service related to ordering the bax scrubb(s) has been fantastic!</li>
            <li>and my feet are in love with the second pad.</li>
            <li>These work great and last quite a long time.</li>
            <li>I have used many back scrubbers from brushes to sponge ropes and this Bax Scrubb Shower Pad blow them all away!</li>
            <li>Think it would work better with 4 large suction cups on each corner &amp; short bristles instead of a sponge.</li>
            <li>Now I can get my back squeaky clean!</li>
            <li>The sellers wrote a note to attach the pad to the wall like a diamond and that works really well, thanks!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend if you really want to do a better job at scrubbing your back.</li>
            <li>No guy wants a  &amp;#34;loofa&amp;#34;, etc.</li>
            <li>I really like my bax scrubb.  </li>
            <li>I also enjoyed the pad I placed at the other end of my tub for my feet----</li>
            <li>with this device no more, it has been a God send and the fact that you get two in the set is amazing.</li>
            <li>you can really put your back into it (no pun intended) and do a better job exfoliating your back.</li>
            <li>Has shoulder issue &amp; hard for him to reach his back, this works great.</li>
            <li>Once my two pads are worn enough I will definately be buying more but these should last quite sometime..</li>
            <li>http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TFK65A/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_4  the &amp;#34;Compac hands free bare back scrubber.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product especially if you have a small shower where there is not enough room to use a scrub brush or swishing a towel from side to side.  </li>
            <li>Purchase this product and a new phase of your life begins.</li>
            <li>They both attached easily and stayed tight.  </li>
            <li>It is so simple to set up and really does the job!  </li>
            <li>As a business traveler who is frequently on the road, the flat Bax Scrubber fits right in my suitcase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now able to get those hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t move when you really wanna scrub your back.</li>
            <li>well nothing I&#x27;ve found so far does that.  </li>
            <li>It really helps get the dry skin off and makes them softer.</li>
            <li>the scrubber part is like a rough felt (same as the Compac) and it scrubs very well</li>
            <li>Although i would have been happier if it was just one single large pad enough for the entire back.</li>
            <li>Great product for that hard to reach back area, also extremely helpful for the feet if you have trouble bending over!</li>

            <li> It won&#x27;t last as long- obviously.</li>
            <li> I do not know why in the world I did not buy this back scrubbing sponge long time ago!</li>
            <li> These pads will ONLY stick to a plastic or other totally non-porous surface.</li>
            <li> and I do mean a tiny bit, nothing you can&#x27;t live with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I let it dry in the shower</li>
            <li> Once I&#x27;m finished I remove it, rinse off with water and set it against the shower doors to dry..</li>
            <li> That is, the phase of your life where these things fail to stick to the shower wall for more than a day; fall off in the middle of the night; and need to be put back up wet a couple hours before you need to shower, because the weak suction cups won&#x27;t hold it stable until they dry.   </li>
            <li> My feet get very dry</li>
            <li> but hey just a little bit and anything with suction cups that you are putting the pressure of the weight of your body on is bound to slip a tiny bit</li>
            <li> I am a big guy , so its hard for me to reach some areas of my back.  </li>
            <li> My son is autistic and had problems reaching his back when washing...</li>
            <li> It is really wide and the package comes with 2 of them.</li>
            <li> Hopefully the other will.</li>
            <li> I just reattach it every time I shower , I wet it down and put it up, and I put the other one on the tub bottom for my feet.  </li>
            <li> It gets rid of all the dry, dead skin on my feet.  </li>
            <li> I wish it was little softer</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to bend down and risk falling!</li>
            <li> Sticks to tub firmly and doesn&#x27;t slide around while you use it.  </li>
            <li> My back gets dry during winter and itches like crazy.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s too hard to use them.  </li>
            <li> I wanted something to scrub the bottom of my feet as I can not raise my feet as time goes on with old age and bad knees.  </li>
            <li> -4 uses it starts wadding up &amp; looks like a rats nest &amp; is no good.</li>
            <li> so it was either painful or impossible to reach my back.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my flexibility is not what it once was.</li>
            <li> buyer beware&amp;#34; response along with some lame suggestions that you put them on the floor of the shower.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have purchased a couple of the Bax Scrubb&#x27;s! I love to be barefoot especially in the summer. The Bax Scrubb is great in the shower for getting  your feet clean! You don&#x27;t have to bend down and risk falling! They are just the greatest!They make my back feel great as well as my feet! I love them. Great price too!</li>
            <li> Tried this out and absolutely loved it!  Works great and is very easy to clean!</li>
            <li> It works great on your back, but I got more out of it for my feet. It really helps get the dry skin off and makes them softer. Sticks to tub firmly and doesn&#x27;t slide around while you use it.  fairly easy to clean.... and the pad holding up well.</li>
            <li> we love the bax scrubb!  and we have gifted them to others in our family because they work so well.  what a great invention (wish I had thought of it).  and the service related to ordering the bax scrubb(s) has been fantastic!</li>
            <li> Purchase this product and a new phase of your life begins. That is, the phase of your life where these things fail to stick to the shower wall for more than a day; fall off in the middle of the night; and need to be put back up wet a couple hours before you need to shower, because the weak suction cups won&#x27;t hold it stable until they dry.   These things wouldn&#x27;t stay up if you glued them.</li>
            <li> This is the best back scrubber I have ever found.  Very easy to use and very effective.  I have given one of the pads to a friend who also loves it.  I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my flexibility is not what it once was. The Bax Scrubb allows me to get that spot between my shoulder blades I can never reach. As a business traveler who is frequently on the road, the flat Bax Scrubber fits right in my suitcase. I won&#x27;t leave home without it.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! It really works, feels great on backside and my feet are in love with the second pad.</li>
            <li> This worked better than I could ever have imagined![[ASIN:B003NXZWBS Bax Scrubb Shower Pad \\&quot;Twin-Pack\\&quot; (pronounced Back Scrub)]]</li>
            <li> incredible product - so simple I didn&#x27;t have to assemble or read the instructions.  My rash is gone! Amazing.</li>
            <li> This is a great product especially if you have a small shower where there is not enough room to use a scrub brush or swishing a towel from side to side.  Now I can get my back squeaky clean!</li>
            <li> Great product! Although i would have been happier if it was just one single large pad enough for the entire back. One of them always falls off the shower wall.</li>
            <li> If you can get it to stick to the shower wall, you&#x27;re lucky. I tried everything, but it finally did &amp; works well. Think it would work better with 4 large suction cups on each corner &amp; short bristles instead of a sponge.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband &amp; he loves it!  Has shoulder issue &amp; hard for him to reach his back, this works great.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.  It is so simple to set up and really does the job!  I have issues with flexibility on both of my arms so it was either painful or impossible to reach my back.  This eliminates that problem.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> I agree with another review here that says it&#x27;s worth every penny.  It is very effective and I use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent for your back and feet, especially for those of us with mobility issues.  My feet get very dry and I used to have to put lotion on them every night.  After using this product, I no longer need the lotion.  It gets rid of all the dry, dead skin on my feet.  I have steered many friends to this product.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny, great product and now my son can wash his back properly. My son is autistic and had problems reaching his back when washing... with this device no more, it has been a God send and the fact that you get two in the set is amazing. We use the 2nd one ourselves. They tell you to put it up in the diamond shape instead of square to get more of the scrubbing area and that is true. It has a drawback which is it does slip some but hey just a little bit and anything with suction cups that you are putting the pressure of the weight of your body on is bound to slip a tiny bit and I do mean a tiny bit, nothing you can&#x27;t live with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these and buying from them as their shipping and price are just as wonderful as their product.</li>
            <li> Beautiful! I do not know why in the world I did not buy this back scrubbing sponge long time ago! It is really wide and the package comes with 2 of them. I wish it was little softer but I think it gets softer with further uses.&lt;br /&gt;overall, great product.</li>
            <li> Great product for that hard to reach back area, also extremely helpful for the feet if you have trouble bending over!</li>
            <li> These pads will ONLY stick to a plastic or other totally non-porous surface. They will NOT work on granite, Terrazo, Quartz or any surfact with any porosity whatsoever. They are alsi non-returnable. If (when) you try to return the items you get a &amp;#34;let buyer beware&amp;#34; response along with some lame suggestions that you put them on the floor of the shower. If they won&#x27;t stick to the wall wouldn&#x27;t it be like standing on ice? Oh yeah, you can put them in the sink for your dog to stand on while bathing him/her.</li>
            <li> I opened both Scrubb Shower Pads the day after arrival.  I have a whirlpool tub- and i placed one pad where my feet would rest,and one pad for my back.  They both attached easily and stayed tight.  The pad I used for my back was wonderful. I loved it.  I also enjoyed the pad I placed at the other end of my tub for my feet---- but I found that because I added more pressure on the foot pad- it did not hold up as well. The fibers on the \\&quot;foot\\&quot;  pad frayed- quite a bit, and had to be pulled off in order to make the pad even again.  I would guess that this problem will continue with the pad I use for my feet. It won&#x27;t last as long- obviously. Hopefully the other will.</li>
            <li> I wanted something to scrub the bottom of my feet as I can not raise my feet as time goes on with old age and bad knees.  This works great.</li>
            <li> I love this thing. if you dont use it every day you have to press it back on to the wall, prior to using it again.&lt;br /&gt;suggestion, rub a bar of soap on it prior, and dont forget to rinse it afterwords.&lt;br /&gt;its like having your blond girlfriend scrub your back</li>
            <li> For a guy that lives alone this is a great product. No guy wants a  &amp;#34;loofa&amp;#34;, etc. My back gets dry during winter and itches like crazy.  Using this in the shower helped a ton.  Also seller is fantastic, received a nice note in package.  These work great and last quite a long time.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to say that I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this. I&#x27;ve used the back scrubber like everyone else...the loofah sponge, the brush one as well but this one? Is the best cause you can really put your back into it (no pun intended) and do a better job exfoliating your back. With the long handled brush you&#x27;re only able to apply so much pressure but this pad works great! and it doesn&#x27;t move when you really wanna scrub your back. I highly recommend if you really want to do a better job at scrubbing your back.</li>
            <li> I really like my bax scrubb.  I have limited flexability and find this is a perfect product for me.  Along with my bax scrubb I use a back scrub &#x27;strap&#x27; (with handles on each end) style.  I&#x27;m now able to get those hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this thing.  I let it dry in the shower and it still gets discolored so I don&#x27;t know what to do about that but it doesn&#x27;t affect the usefulness.  I have a ton of back scrubbers but I have shoulder problems and it&#x27;s too hard to use them.  I sud this thing up and its heaven!</li>
            <li> I have used many back scrubbers from brushes to sponge ropes and this Bax Scrubb Shower Pad blow them all away! This is easy to attach to the shower wall, rub some soap in your hands and all over the shower pad and lean against it to use... I haven&#x27;t had any problems with movement of the pad once it was attached to the the shower wall. Once I&#x27;m finished I remove it, rinse off with water and set it against the shower doors to dry.. The sellers wrote a note to attach the pad to the wall like a diamond and that works really well, thanks! Once my two pads are worn enough I will definately be buying more but these should last quite sometime..</li>
            <li> I am a big guy , so its hard for me to reach some areas of my back.  with that in mind I have been looking for a product like this for a while  .  I have tried another product on here http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TFK65A/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_4  the &amp;#34;Compac hands free bare back scrubber.  I liked that one, but found the unit would not stay in place.  This unit does a much better job at staying because there are many smaller suction cups on it.  some people complain that it wont stay as if it were glued on, well nothing I&#x27;ve found so far does that.  my solution? I just reattach it every time I shower , I wet it down and put it up, and I put the other one on the tub bottom for my feet.  The seller is super nice too! we got the product very quickly and so far I&#x27;m very happy with it.  the scrubber part is like a rough felt (same as the Compac) and it scrubs very well</li>
            <li> This pad  is NOT durable. It is NOT loofah for those who ARE TELLING YOU IT IS. It is cheap nylon &amp; after 3-4 uses it starts wadding up &amp; looks like a rats nest &amp; is no good. If you order this beware &amp; don&#x27;t say I didn&#x27;t warn you. The concept is good, that is why I gave it 2 stars NOW if they replace the pad with authentic QUALITY material that would last &amp; NOT this cheap plastic nylon do hickie, then maybe it would be a great product. I have now since been searching for a quality product bcuz just in the SHORT TIME I had this &amp; used within 2 wks, BOTH are no longer functional.</li>
