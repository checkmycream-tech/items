    <ol>
            <li>Looks awesome in an alabaster bowl!!  </li>
            <li>so I was a bit suprised to find out all of the products needed to burn the incense in the best way.</li>
            <li>It also looks great in a sand bottle!</li>
            <li>Beautiful Sand but a lot of the sand had come out in the box and was all over everything.</li>
            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>in all a great product</li>
            <li>Ordered this for use in my cauldron to burn resin incense and it has been a joy to handle.  </li>
            <li>Very nice looking sand.</li>
            <li>This stuff looks really nice in the burner!  </li>
            <li>seems like a good product.</li>
            <li>Good quality</li>
            <li>and she loved it.</li>
            <li>but I loved this sand.</li>
            <li>Good to use for crystals or holding charcoal tablets</li>
            <li>neway all good.....</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>it gives my Alter a nice kind of mystic quality.</li>
            <li>Nice sand :) good size package.</li>
            <li>Okay, sand is sand ...  </li>
            <li>Maybe another lb would be better included.</li>
            <li>Makes an interesting addition to an altar or just on a shelf.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This sand is a great way to maintain the incense burner from getting soiled and preventing the incense and charcoal from damaging the burner especially those brass burners which we want to maintain shinny and in good condition.</li>
            <li>This black sand looks beautiful on my altar!!  </li>
            <li>This black sand is excellent.</li>
            <li>Not only does it work great for centralizing the heat in your censer, but it looks unreal.</li>
            <li>Look up some sand bottles and see what awesome effects you find when black sand gets involved!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m perfectly satisfied using it in my new brass charcoal screen incense burner (reviewed separately).  </li>
            <li>Great bag of sand that was black and weighed one pound.</li>
            <li>You will not get your moniess worth.</li>
            <li>Ok, look around for other vendors too cheap of a product.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;s funny.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>cuz the coals get hot and dont lok it  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m positive that this product will be used &amp; cleaned as required.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>However since Amazon has everything I have not had too do much searching for supplies.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I really don&#x27;t even want to give one star because I did not receive the product I ordered.</li>
            <li>Easier to clean and substitute than white ash</li>
            <li>It is very dark and a bit more fine than beach sand of the same color.</li>
            <li>It also looks pretty in a clear glass jar with a cork.</li>
            <li>I love that it is black.</li>
            <li>price is a bit high but since its reusable and  is not consumed like incense  </li>
            <li>I have had fun experimenting with different charcoal and incense using the sand.</li>
            <li>Sand is good but the bag arrived broken</li>
            <li>But as far as the sand, I could go down to the beach a mile away, but this is so much more of what belongs in a burner.</li>
            <li>My new step kids are still trying to figure it all out, with out asking questions.</li>
            <li>Im new to resin incense</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of interesting to observe people in general when something new that they have NEVER been exposed to is presented to them with out any instruction from &amp;#34;ME&amp;#34; I would have thought that with them being 23 and 20 and going to collage, that thay would have at the least hedged a little.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and the sand is black.</li>
            <li>Very pretty black sand and holds the heat for burning resin and incense a generous amount.</li>
            <li>I got exactly what I expected</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s black sand!</li>
            <li> very little waste-</li>
            <li> I just filter the sand after every use and very little</li>
            <li> Not a grain was missing and none were broken.</li>
            <li> Black sand &amp; charcoal with frankincense caused it to stick together into hardened glop that was difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> I was annoyed</li>
            <li> A bit expensive for it though.</li>

            <li> This works well in my smudging cauldron for putting out the burning sage wand.</li>
            <li> Very nice looking sand. Easier to clean and substitute than white ash</li>
            <li> Sand is good but the bag arrived broken so I lost some sand.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this product if using for cones. When cones are used the sand beneath the cones clumps pretty badly, although it can be broken up it may be more work than some people are willing to put in.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. I love that it is black. it gives my Alter a nice kind of mystic quality. My new step kids are still trying to figure it all out, with out asking questions. It&#x27;s kind of interesting to observe people in general when something new that they have NEVER been exposed to is presented to them with out any instruction from &amp;#34;ME&amp;#34; I would have thought that with them being 23 and 20 and going to collage, that thay would have at the least hedged a little.

            <li> seems like a good product. Good quality</li>
            <li> Okay, sand is sand ...  I&#x27;m perfectly satisfied using it in my new brass charcoal screen incense burner (reviewed separately).  I would recommend this to anyone who uses that type of incense burner.</li>
            <li> and she loved it. I had no idea what it was when i bought it as I don&#x27;t practice. She was thrilled though and was shocked at the size.</li>
            <li> This black sand looks beautiful on my altar!!  Looks awesome in an alabaster bowl!!  I got exactly what I expected...happy!!</li>
            <li> A bit expensive for it though. Maybe another lb would be better included. I&#x27;m positive that this product will be used &amp; cleaned as required.</li>
            <li> An inch in the burner helps the coal burn evenly.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and the sand is black.</li>
            <li> Beautiful Sand but a lot of the sand had come out in the box and was all over everything. It took me an hour to get the sand out of everything in the box that it was placed with. I was annoyed but I loved this sand.</li>
            <li> Nice sand :) good size package. Good to use for crystals or holding charcoal tablets</li>
            <li> Great bag of sand that was black and weighed one pound. Not a grain was missing and none were broken.</li>
            <li> Ok, look around for other vendors too cheap of a product. You will not get your moniess worth.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  Thank you, Sage Cauldron!</li>
            <li> Im new to resin incense so I was a bit suprised to find out all of the products needed to burn the incense in the best way. However since Amazon has everything I have not had too do much searching for supplies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sand looks just like the picture. It is very dark and a bit more fine than beach sand of the same color. I have had fun experimenting with different charcoal and incense using the sand. I also like that theres very little waste- I just filter the sand after every use and very little is lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is a bit high but since its reusable and  is not consumed like incense  it will last a long time. It also looks pretty in a clear glass jar with a cork. Makes an interesting addition to an altar or just on a shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a great product and I plan to purchase again.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for use in my cauldron to burn resin incense and it has been a joy to handle.  It does the job of heat sinking without the color running out of the sand.  Everything I wanted.</li>
            <li> Lived up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> Very pretty black sand and holds the heat for burning resin and incense a generous amount. Sift it to reuse.</li>
            <li> So I really don&#x27;t even want to give one star because I did not receive the product I ordered. I ordered incense SAND and got incense POWDER. Whatever, I tossed itâ€¦ the hassle of returning was just not worth it. Don&#x27;t have the time. Lesson learned. I should just patronage my local Orthodox book store for such items instead.</li>
            <li> with the blk ack sand om the bttm  with the charcol tablet an  inscense  .note thou easier to have those ton pong things too  cuz the coals get hot and dont lok it  burn the sheeite outa yaself.i know this for fact  i have a  burnt thumb now lols. neway all good.....</li>
            <li> This sand is a great way to maintain the incense burner from getting soiled and preventing the incense and charcoal from damaging the burner especially those brass burners which we want to maintain shinny and in good condition. Love it!</li>
            <li> This stuff looks really nice in the burner!  If that&#x27;s something you are concerned about.</li>
            <li> This black sand is excellent. Not only does it work great for centralizing the heat in your censer, but it looks unreal. It&#x27;s black sand! It also looks great in a sand bottle! Look up some sand bottles and see what awesome effects you find when black sand gets involved!</li>
            <li> The sand is what I expected, but the packaging needs some work. The sand bag ripped and spilled all over its box and everything else in side.</li>
            <li> As described.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> 1lb Black Incense Burner Sand will need to experiment a bit. Black sand &amp; charcoal with frankincense caused it to stick together into hardened glop that was difficult to remove. But it was as described.</li>
