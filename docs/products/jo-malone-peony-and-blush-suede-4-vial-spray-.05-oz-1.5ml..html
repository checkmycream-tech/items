            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to believe this was the real product.</li>
            <li> And lasts a long time on the skin.</li>
            <li> It does seem to last a while, unlike other fragrances that disappear rapidly.</li>
            <li> My package was delivered a few days earlier than expected</li>

            <li> Perfect for my purse or any traveling. Let&#x27;s me change my fragrances because of cost and amount.</li>
            <li> I rated this three stars, not for the product, but because of the packaging, which has nothing to do with fragrance itself.  It arrived in a paper mailing bag, wrapped in a small bit of plastic and bubble wrap.  The vials are glass and one of them was completely smashed in the envelope, hence the good smelling mail box. This needed to be packaged in a little box to afford more protection for the glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance is a very personal thing. Peony is a very difficult thing to reproduce and I can&#x27;t say this smells like peony to me. Since I have no idea what blush suede smells like, I can&#x27;t really comment on whether that smell is true. It does seem to last a while, unlike other fragrances that disappear rapidly. I would recommend trying a sample somewhere rather than ordering these vials. If you like other Jo Malone fragrances, you will probably like this.</li>
            <li> This smelled like a knock off. It&#x27;s hard for me to believe this was the real product.</li>
            <li> Love the floral smell.  But fades after an hour or two. Totally recommend this for testers before you buy the bottle.  You can always give out to friends if not your liking.</li>
            <li> Thought vials where bigger, was disappointed. Can get those free at Neiman Marcus.</li>
            <li> these are fake! I&#x27;ve been using Peony &amp; Blush for over a year now. I ordered these because i thought it would be nice to carry one in my bag so i can re-apply whenever i want to while outside. I know the scent. But, when I got these, these are NOT the same perfume! they are fake!</li>
            <li> I loved these trial sizes! Plan on buying more. It&#x27;s a good way to see if you want to buy a full bottle.</li>
            <li> A nice fall fragrance</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the authentic perfume; these samples are not authentic...smells horrible. plus Jo Malone doesn&#x27;t sell samples on the internet.</li>
            <li> They smell delicious!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  You can smell the peony I&#x27;m it.</li>
            <li> Love!! My package was delivered a few days earlier than expected and I&#x27;m thrilled I get to wear it tomorrow for a first date. I opened up the package in my car and sprayed some on, I stepped into a grocery store about 5 minutes later and the produce guy about fell over himself salivating from the scent. Hope my date has the same reaction! :)</li>
            <li> Love the Blush Suede vials for travel.  Light enough for work.</li>
            <li> This product was as described.  I would have liked to buy a larger amount of this wonderful perfume for a birthday present, but these samples enabled me to include them with another gift.</li>
            <li> If you love a sweet flowery scent this is for you. Its my favorite. I wear it all the time.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! I&#x27;m so glad I was able to try it out before buying a larger bottle. Wish more perfume companies would do this.</li>

            <li> Unhappy with purchase. Very little scent, therefore no lasting fragrance at all. Don&#x27;t recommend purchase</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent. Not too sweet or heavy. It&#x27;s very clean. This is not an overpowering scent, very fresh.</li>
            <li> Soft &amp; Fresh, Love it</li>
            <li> I wish this were bigger bottles sample but I&#x27;m glad I sample it smells really good but very pricey cost to much i&#x27;&#x27; have to save the money to buy a bigger bottle. very nice smell ands it last.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to buy a big bottle of anything until I tried it first.  It&#x27;s a winner if you like Jo Malone products.As we know fragerance is very personal these sample size are a great way to try something new, keep it in your purse and share with a friend. Glade I found it hope they will offer others.   {\rtf1\ansi\ansicpg1252  {\fonttbl\f0\fnil\fcharset0 ArialMT;\f1\fnil\fcharset0 .HelveticaNeueInterface-MediumP4;}  {\colortbl;\red255\green255\blue255;\red102\green102\blue102;\red255\green255\blue255;}  \deftab720  \pard\pardeftab720\sl280\qc\partightenfactor0    \f0\fs24 \cf2 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0  \outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 \shad0 \  \pard\pardeftab720\sl700\qc\partightenfactor0    \f1\fs36 \cf3 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0  \outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec3 \shad0 \  }</li>
