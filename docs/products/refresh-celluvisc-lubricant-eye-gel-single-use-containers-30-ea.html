            <li>The single use vials are great for people on the go.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that to be true.</li>
            <li>I tried several different eye drops, but this brand/type seems to work the best for me.</li>
            <li>but it goes a way quickly.  </li>
            <li>Upon first application, your vision is blurry for a minute, but after that they are nice and clear.</li>
            <li>I put the drops in right before I get in bed.  </li>
            <li>Use before bedtime and right after waking up in the morning.</li>
            <li>This is a very thick eye lubricant that is much more effective than any other I&#x27;ve tried ~~ a great find.</li>
            <li>But because it is thicker I tend to use these drops when I&#x27;m at home more (versus when I&#x27;m outside).</li>

            <li>Highly recommend.</li>

            <li>Thick drops - good for nighttime because of my dry eye problem</li>
            <li>It also helps to use right before I sleep to prevent really dry eyes in the morning.</li>

            <li>No other lubricant is like this lubricant.  </li>
            <li>for my chronically dry eyes it did not feel nearly as soothing as another brands eye &#x27;gel&#x27; in a tube (daytime.. not gel drops, but not ointment)</li>
            <li>this is good product, a little expensive though</li>

            <li> this is good product, a little expensive though</li>
            <li> Not too thick, just right as prescribed by my physician.</li>
            <li> this was recommended by my ophthalmologist because I suffer from extreme dry eyes and it has worked wonders, recommend it highly</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had dry eyes especially around allergy season, but after my PRK surgery, the level of pain and complications (scratched corneas multiple times) when the dryness occurs left me seeking any solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For severely dry eyes this works during the day and especially at night.  </li>
            <li> thick solution, works well for my extremely dry eyes, in single sterile vials&lt;br /&gt;Con: might be too thick for some people (but for me, I love it)</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> On normal nights, I either get by with nothing or with the same drops that are less gooey and come in a multi-user container that lasts me months at a time (these are single-use, but I usually get 2-3 nights out of them -- the caps go back on if you keep them sanitary).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Upon application, I do feel some minor discomfort in my eyes (could be due to the thickness of the fluid).  </li>
            <li> Use this product at bedtime for my dry eyes.  </li>
            <li> I tried Celluvisc on recommendation from my eye doc for my dry eyes.</li>
            <li> This helped cure my dry eye.  </li>
            <li> Every morning my eyes are very dry and feel irritated.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended these drops for my eyes itching and burning due to dry eye.  </li>
            <li> Be careful when you use it; you&#x27;ll have blurred</li>
            <li> Also, if I wake up in the middle of the night in pain and forgot to put these in, then a few drops followed by closing my eyes and going back to sleep prevents worse issues the following day.</li>
            <li> The only problem is they are so thick they leave flakes in my eyelashes when they dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other drops, but they don&#x27;t do anything other than blur your vision.</li>
            <li> Checked Amazon-the price was half.</li>
            <li> It is less irritated.  </li>
            <li> The little containers are inefficient though as some of the gel remains in the container.</li>
            <li> I have very dry eyes because of years of hard contact use.</li>
            <li> You can use it during the day, but it does leave you blurry for a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> MY DRY EYE GETTING PROGRESSIVELY WORSE</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they don&#x27;t seem to really last longer and make my eyes burn immediately after application.</li>
            <li> Doctor recommended these for when my eyes start having ridiculous dryness at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> these drops are very thick.</li>
            <li> sorry for my spelling</li>
            <li> Unfortunately these are not it for me.</li>
            <li> but damn it&#x27;s expensive!)</li>
            <li> /&gt;But when my eyes start to get really bad, these are the ones that work when nothing else does.  </li>

            <li> I like this product.  Doctor told me to use indiviual packets.  sorry for my spelling</li>
            <li> My husband scratched his eye with a tree branch. The optometrist recommended this to sooth his eye. Works well. The little containers are inefficient though as some of the gel remains in the container. Wasteful.</li>
            <li> Love all of Refresh eye drops but the only draw back on this is it comes in the individual plastic containers which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using this product for my dry eyes which was recommended by my Doctor.&lt;br /&gt;Great Product to use.</li>
            <li> I have very dry eyes because of years of hard contact use. I tried several different eye drops, but this brand/type seems to work the best for me. I like Celluvisc because it is thicker than [Refresh Plus eye drops], which I use sometimes as well. But because it is thicker I tend to use these drops when I&#x27;m at home more (versus when I&#x27;m outside). It also helps to use right before I sleep to prevent really dry eyes in the morning. Also, sometimes I put some in the refrigerator before use so that it is nice and cool.&lt;br /&gt;Tip: if you want to use the vial more than once, squeeze back on the twist off cap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: thick solution, works well for my extremely dry eyes, in single sterile vials&lt;br /&gt;Con: might be too thick for some people (but for me, I love it)</li>
            <li> I recently underwent laser correction for my eyes (PRK).  Every morning my eyes are very dry and feel irritated. I also needed something that would last during my work day.  I work in an office so I stare at a computer screen all day.  That&#x27;s a lot of strain on my eyes.  I was told to try this since it&#x27;s thicker than the Bion Tears (which was what i was using before - but damn it&#x27;s expensive!) and celluvisc was also preservative free.  They come in single use dispensers which have more than enough fluid for both eyes.  Upon application, I do feel some minor discomfort in my eyes (could be due to the thickness of the fluid).  You do get blur vision for a bit but it goes a way quickly.  I do find that my eyes become a bit sticky as well and i can \\&quot;feel\\&quot; it on my lashes.  It does hydrate quite well though and also lasts quite a while but you need to use more drops.</li>
            <li> Really refreshing on my eyes. Arrived on time &amp; well packaged. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I received the product that I order, so everything was perfect.</li>
            <li> The single use vials are great for people on the go. You can stick them in your pocket and have them handy anytime.</li>
            <li> This is a very thick eye lubricant that is much more effective than any other I&#x27;ve tried ~~ a great find.</li>

            <li> Great product at a great price! I use these on my Australian cattledog who has prominent eyes that don&#x27;t close completely when she sleeps. The vet recommended these drops to 2-4 times a day. When I went to the drugstore, I was surprised at the cost. Checked Amazon-the price was half. No-brainer.</li>
            <li> For severely dry eyes this works during the day and especially at night.  I put the drops in right before I get in bed.  If I get up during the night  I put in some more and my eyes don&#x27;t have that scratchy burning feeling.  Works for me better than any of the other drops and I have tried them all.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended these drops for my eyes itching and burning due to dry eye.  They were excellent for the itching and burning.  The only problem is they are so thick they leave flakes in my eyelashes when they dry.  I use them only at night before I go to bed and that seems to do the job.  I</li>
            <li> I just purchased these at my local Walmart for around 12 dollars. Great deal.</li>
            <li> I am looking for drops that would be more durable at night than the excellent Oasis TearsPlus I use now. Unfortunately these are not it for me. They are denser and do obscure your vision when applied for about 5 minutes. Unfortunately, they don&#x27;t seem to really last longer and make my eyes burn immediately after application. I seem to find that all Refresh eye drops sting and burn my eyes.</li>
            <li> The eye drops stay wet longer that the milder same brand eye drops I was originally using.  My dry eye condition caused by dystrophy on the cornea, that has been corrected by surgery, has greatly relieved post surgery eye dryness by using this excellent eye lubricant.</li>
            <li> Not too thick, just right as prescribed by my physician. Use before bedtime and right after waking up in the morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other drops, but they don&#x27;t do anything other than blur your vision. I tried Celluvisc on recommendation from my eye doc for my dry eyes. He said they are good for up to 8 hours. I&#x27;ve found that to be true. Upon first application, your vision is blurry for a minute, but after that they are nice and clear. There is a bit of crust that forms on the eye lashes that I have to wipe off otherwise I keep thinking there is some dirt on my glasses.</li>
            <li> This product is great in every way. Be careful when you use it; you&#x27;ll have blurred&lt;br /&gt;vision because it&#x27;s a liitle goopy for like 20 seconds but that goes away and it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;great after that</li>
            <li> I stay awake 24-hours a day.  Refresh Celluvisc is the ONLY lubricant eye drop that relieves the pressure on my Optic nerves and helps my eyes relax and feel at ease.  No other lubricant is like this lubricant.  Refresh Celluvisc is well-worth the price!</li>
            <li> My dog has boxer eye.  His vet recommended the use of this product three times a day.  It really helps a lot.  HIs eye has a chance to heal over.  It is less irritated.  I save on vet bills too.</li>
            <li> fast shipping. these drops are very thick.</li>
            <li> Thick drops - good for nighttime because of my dry eye problem</li>
            <li> this is good product, a little expensive though</li>
            <li> ordered by my doctor for evening use.</li>
            <li> This Celluvisc product provides a real cushion for my eyes and enhances my vision. I heartily recommend it to anyone who has had cataracts removed.</li>
            <li> for my chronically dry eyes it did not feel nearly as soothing as another brands eye &#x27;gel&#x27; in a tube (daytime.. not gel drops, but not ointment) GenTeal&lt;br /&gt;Cant put it in mid driving unless at a long light and only do 1 eye just incase, because takes maybe 30 seconds to spread so vision is back from blurry to clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;maybe it works for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also a warm compress on my eyes - i heard can help unclog the oil ducts, that seemed to help reduce how often my eyes feel like they need relief.  tho still tend to from air conditioning in the car&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;didnt sting (like visine tears)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;easy to recap to use later in day or next morning.</li>
            <li> This is a big help.  This is the best I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried most of them!  It is thicker than most day time ones on the market.  You can use it during the day, but it does leave you blurry for a few seconds.  Use sparingly.  It lasts a long time.  This helped cure my dry eye.  I can wear contacts again and it&#x27;s still winter here in Colorado.  Remove contacts before using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AFTER USING THESE FOR MANY MONTHS AND DEALING WITH MY DRY EYE GETTING PROGRESSIVELY WORSE, I DECIDED TO DO SOME MORE RESEARCH AND HAVE DISCOVERED THAT FISH OILS CURE DRY EYES.  I WISH I HAD KNOWN THIS BEFORE SPENDING A BUNCH OF MONEY ON DROPS, HEATED EYE PADS AND EYE DOCTOR VISITS.  THEY WORK ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AND CONTINUE TO WORK IF YOU TAKE THEM DAILY.  I USE NUTRIGOLD OMEGA 3 GOLD.</li>
