            <li>my fly away hair, but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>All in all, pretty sure I wont be buying it again.  </li>

            <li>I really like this.  </li>
            <li>It does make my hair shiny if I use it VERY sparingly and sort of soft at the ends.</li>
            <li>Good product but not great.</li>
            <li>You need just a dot of it and it leaves hair smooth without weighing it down too  much.</li>
            <li>I love that this product is able to tame my thick hair and give it that straight, sleek and glossy look.</li>
            <li>He has a sort of rockabilly hairstyle (short on the sides and long, slicked back on top) which works better with straighter, less coarse hair, which he does not have.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone who has hair that often gets dry and brittle.</li>

            <li> This product works very well on my thick coarse hair. It tames my crazy frizzy hair down like no other product can. It is a very small bottle but worth the money.</li>
            <li> Doesnt seem to work as well as the sample i had!? Good product but not great. Not sure if i will buy it from this site again.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist suggested this product for my long, thick mane. Tried it out and it is Fantastic - calms the Frizz and does not leave any kind of greasy feel - my hair has a nice sheen - highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Works beautifully. I ordered coarse hair version in error, but it works great on my fine hair!!! I was on a lot of medications which sapped my hair dry. My hair is shiny and hydrated. I love this stuff! Use it everyday!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that great. It makes my hair super greasy looking if I accidentally use it too close to my scalp. And it really doesn&#x27;t eliminate frizzy hair  on me either. It does make my hair shiny if I use it VERY sparingly and sort of soft at the ends. All in all, pretty sure I wont be buying it again.  It might just not be great for my hair, some apparently love it.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. Use it everyday. Split ends and frizzy hair gone. Two drops massaged throughout my hair and the results are perfect, shiny and healthy looking hair every time. I use it with other hair products as well and it is the perfect addition to a great hair day.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know if this was going to work on  my fly away hair, but I was pleasantly surprised. I just squirted a tiny little bit on the palm of my hand, rubbed it and then gently put in on my fly aways Works great. Word of caution don&#x27;t use to much or it will make your hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> This product arrived promptly.  It is an excellent hair product thatI have been using for many years on my coarse frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product every day and she loves it. Works better than she expected it to she said.</li>
            <li> Ive bees using this product in my salon for over two years, most of my clients have wild bushy kinky curly hair. this is he ONLY product ive used on them during any hair service that truly control&#x27;s the frizz. ive tried hundreds of products and nothing, absolutly nothing compares to this!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> very light, yet works on my frizzy hair. I put it everytime after washing my hair to tame it and get rid of frizz. It also adds shine to it. You just need a tiny amount to do its job.</li>
            <li> Not sure why I can&#x27;t find this product in stores anymore... but I LOVE IT!!! no silicone does not weigh hair down</li>
            <li> My hair is fairly thick and super coarse. This product tamed it down a ton and makes my hair extremely soft. Not only does it work for me, it also works for my boyfriend. He has a sort of rockabilly hairstyle (short on the sides and long, slicked back on top) which works better with straighter, less coarse hair, which he does not have. His hair is wild, and this even helps him. So what I&#x27;m trying to say is that this product is perfect and will work for anyone.</li>
            <li> I love that this product is able to tame my thick hair and give it that straight, sleek and glossy look.</li>
            <li> I have really frizzy hair and this tames it down a lot and gives my hair the soft feeling and look it needs. And yet I didn&#x27;t have to pay a fortune like I would have had to at a salon.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it really smooths hair and doesn&#x27;t make it feel dirty. This lasts quite awhile and your hair feels fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I use this daily and I love this product! I highly recommend it to anyone who has hair that often gets dry and brittle. It also helps my hair air dry faster without having to use a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It makes my hair beautiful and luxurious, full of body and shine. Great price thank you.</li>
            <li> I have been using this products for 2 years and still love it.  It doesn&#x27;t build up...unless you use tons.  It makes my hair look great.</li>
            <li> Yes I love this product! My hair is very dry and wavy on the second day after washing. So once I put a bit of this product in the curls,  They become tame.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because now that it&#x27;s summer my hair has decided go all frizzy this year.  This stuff does what I want it to.  My hair is nice and smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it advertises by eliminating frizz and making my hair feel super silky! Plus it only takes one or two pumps to cover hair so it lasts for months.</li>
            <li> I really like this.  You need just a dot of it and it leaves hair smooth without weighing it down too  much.</li>
