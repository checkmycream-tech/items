            <li>It is holding up great and the plastic has yet to tear.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own wonderfully.</li>
            <li>This is great for work since I work at a prison.  </li>
            <li>very nice but the clip on the corner is always falling off</li>
            <li>Love the compartments and the size is perfect.</li>
            <li>I also wanted something that would hold a nice side book since I love to read and standing it upright I can do that perfectly.</li>
            <li>My wife loved it .</li>
            <li>Good quality.  </li>
            <li>but you still want a cute one!</li>
            <li>It is a nice medium size bag</li>
            <li>It is nice looking, straps seem to be perfect, vinyl is very sturdy so the bag supports itself and won&#x27;t collapse all over the floor.</li>
            <li>Good for easy access and viewing of contents that you keep inside.</li>
            <li>But this is attractive, nicely made, and just right for what I use it for.  </li>
            <li>one of the best clear bags I have seen.</li>
            <li>Have been looking for a clear bag with shoulder straps and this is the perfect size for my needs.</li>
            <li>reasonably stylish.  </li>
            <li>We weren&#x27;t able to go to any games.</li>
            <li>and I love this purse.</li>
            <li>Size is ok if I don&#x27;t need to bring rain or snow gear.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and quality is great.</li>
            <li>If you have school books though I would get the 12 inch bag which fits a lot more.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, this bag appears to be of good quality and would certainly be a far superior way of holding items than the alternative--a zip lock bag.</li>
            <li>This is great for workplaces that require clear bags</li>
            <li>It was a well made bag and would be great for a job where you have to have a clear bag.</li>
            <li>zipper to secure my belongings.</li>
            <li>My co-workers liked  it so much they also ordered.  </li>
            <li>(The Free (?)</li>
            <li>It looks nice, considering it is a clear bag, but that is what I have to use on my job.</li>
            <li>It is very neat, nice design and is not heavy  to carry.</li>
            <li>Lite weight with a shoulder strap just the right length.</li>
            <li>It is a perfect size for me, I am able to carry my wallet, small cosmetic bag, cell phone in the front pocket and other essentials.  </li>
            <li>This bag is also somewhat stylish if you have to run any quick errands after work and don&#x27;t have time to switch over to my regular handbag.  </li>
            <li>and this bag lasted a good year and a half in a warehouse.</li>
            <li>This one is just big enough, great quality and cute enough I can go somewhere after work with out being embarrassed.</li>
            <li>Another great thing is because the plastic is so thick it stands up on</li>
            <li>Took this to my first NFL stadium game and it worked great.  </li>
            <li>The quality is better than I expected, not thin or flimsy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more than I expected and very well made.</li>
            <li>It looks like a real purse.</li>
            <li>very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommended to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;will</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say much about this bag as I returned it.</li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>I really like the side and front pockets.</li>
            <li>The only downfall is if you place pens or slim cosmetics in the front pocket try to make sure they are standing upright so they don&#x27;t slip out of the bottom/side as it is not sealed completely.</li>
            <li>This clear handbag is just right for me.  </li>
            <li>I will return the bag pictured here, if the other one better meets my requirements.  </li>
            <li>but if I have to conform, as is evident, I want to carry a classy looking purse (even though it&#x27;s plastic).  </li>
            <li>Perfect size- can fit small jacket phone and other small items with no problem.</li>
            <li>Country we live in)</li>
            <li>Need a clear bag for work!</li>
            <li>Have received many complimentson my clear purses and have purchased several in the past,the only purse I use,matches everything however this smaller one is not made as well as</li>
            <li>With this purse, my restrictions are not as narrow because the contents are easily viewed.  </li>
            <li>I require a clear plastic bag to work for a department store.</li>
            <li>and it is required that I have a clear bag.</li>
            <li>bought this because where I work prefers a clear bag to check easier through security.</li>
            <li>When I received it I was so surprised.</li>
            <li>but I did take it to a game party and all the ladies liked</li>
            <li>Admittedly this new bag would have only one compartment.  </li>
            <li>Main compartment was large enough for other items.  </li>
            <li>I work in a pharmacy and must use a clear bag for any personal items.</li>
            <li>I work in a department store and must carry a clear bag for personal items being brought to the sales floor.  </li>
            <li>I have ordered another clear pocketbook that has a strap that I hope can be worn cross body.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it to anyone that needs to carry a clear bag for work.</li>
            <li>The quality is good; not cheap, thin vinyl.</li>
            <li>I would prefer that the main section had a zipper closure and that the straps were long enough to use as a cross body bag.  </li>

            <li> Didn&#x27;t last long and the plastic ripped.</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t say I love this bag, but I need it to attend sporting events where security has gone crazy.</li>
            <li> long sturdy shoulder strap.</li>
            <li> Since this bag will be used only at concerts and sporting events where it is required, I would prefer to have a hands-free option that did not require setting the bag down.  </li>
            <li> My employer requires transparent purses and they are not available in local stores.</li>
            <li> The clear material is thick and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Not too small or too big.  </li>
            <li> Not too big not too small.</li>
            <li> $25 pluse shipping is a bit much other than that I like it</li>
            <li> This is the one small enough for your locker.</li>
            <li> but eventually after a year and a half it was not holding up anymore.   </li>
            <li> The little metal pieces have all fallen off.</li>
            <li> The front pocket does have little holes on both sides at the bottom.</li>
            <li> Have used it a few times and have gotten compliments and asked where I purchased it.</li>
            <li> The plastic is rather stiff but that helps the purse to stand upright without any problem.  </li>
            <li> Was disappointed because after use 1 day corner protectors fell off on 2 corner and a week later a third one fell off exposing the threads!</li>
            <li> Stiff but keeps the structure of the bag!</li>
            <li> The small pocket on side is unusable too hard to get anything in and out.</li>
            <li> The plastic is so hard that it scratches your hands.</li>
            <li> Small too!</li>
            <li> very small, just like the way I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Quality sucks!</li>
            <li> --Duh!  </li>
            <li> We live in a generation where we have are fearful of people blowing things up.  </li>
            <li> I have not brought it to a game</li>
            <li> Its a little stiff, especially in cold weather</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like the outside pocket.  Fits just enough.  Not too small or too big.  I would definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This clear handbag is just right for me.  The quality is better than I expected, not thin or flimsy.  It is a nice medium size bag and I like the pocket on the front and on the side.  It looks nice, considering it is a clear bag, but that is what I have to use on my job.</li>
            <li> I require a clear plastic bag to work for a department store. When I received it I was so surprised. It is very neat, nice design and is not heavy  to carry.</li>
            <li> The little metal pieces have all fallen off. The plastic is so hard that it scratches your hands. The small pocket on side is unusable too hard to get anything in and out. Wish I never bought it! Only had it a mo.Quality sucks!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I work in a department store and bringing a purse onto the sales floor (to store at the register area) has restrictions.  With this purse, my restrictions are not as narrow because the contents are easily viewed.  The plastic is rather stiff but that helps the purse to stand upright without any problem.  I put my wallet, snack bars and a bottle of water in the purse plus I keep my name tag, business cards and lipstick in the outer pocket. It holds a lot, is sturdy, and allows you to carry all the necessities.  A recommended buy.</li>
            <li> I ordered this thru&#x27; my husbands account for use at work. I work in a pharmacy and must use a clear bag for any personal items. This one is just big enough, great quality and cute enough I can go somewhere after work with out being embarrassed. Great item!</li>
            <li> I was so happy when I received my purse. It looks like a real purse. I like compartments and a shoulder strap in a purse . I was carrying a cosmetic travel bag which was not big enough or convenient . My employer requires transparent purses and they are not available in local stores.</li>
            <li> just what I wanted for going into sports stadiums. reasonably stylish.  long sturdy shoulder strap. zipper to secure my belongings.</li>
            <li> very small, just like the way I was looking for. very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommended to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;will get it again.</li>
            <li> Its a little stiff, especially in cold weather--Duh!  But this is attractive, nicely made, and just right for what I use it for.  I work where our purses are inspected when we leave work each day.</li>
            <li> This is great for workplaces that require clear bags but you still want a cute one! Hold plenty! The only downfall is if you place pens or slim cosmetics in the front pocket try to make sure they are standing upright so they don&#x27;t slip out of the bottom/side as it is not sealed completely. Otherwise great bag and great price!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say much about this bag as I returned it. I just did not want my handbag items on display. It was a well made bag and would be great for a job where you have to have a clear bag.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I work in a casino. My co-workers liked  it so much they also ordered.  Love the compartments and the size is perfect.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the football season, but have not used it for any games. We weren&#x27;t able to go to any games. Have used it a few times and have gotten compliments and asked where I purchased it. Hoping this upcoming football season to use it. I&#x27;ll use it for baseball&#x27;s spring training games.</li>
            <li> Bag was great. My wife loved it . Great size for carrying to football games. Lite weight with a shoulder strap just the right length.</li>
            <li> I work at a casino and I love this purse. Fits everything I need at work plus some.</li>
            <li> Perfect size- can fit small jacket phone and other small items with no problem. Not too big not too small.</li>
            <li> We live in a generation where we have are fearful of people blowing things up.  To help with security the NFL has voted to require all women to use clear receptacles to carry into the games to cut down on the time that security has to search our bags.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like anyone telling me what I should wear or what I shouldn&#x27;t wear (The Free (?) Country we live in) but if I have to conform, as is evident, I want to carry a classy looking purse (even though it&#x27;s plastic).  This fits the bill.  There is a front pocket and a side pocket for cell phones.  I have not brought it to a game yet but I did take it to a game party and all the ladies liked it.&lt;br /&gt;I told a local store about it and gave her a website so she could carry them in her store.</li>
            <li> Have received many complimentson my clear purses and have purchased several in the past,the only purse I use,matches everything however this smaller one is not made as well as my larger one and I am returning it for that reason</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I love this bag, but I need it to attend sporting events where security has gone crazy. I hope it complies with the measurements required by whatever stadium I choose to go to....they are all different. Size is ok if I don&#x27;t need to bring rain or snow gear.  It is nice looking, straps seem to be perfect, vinyl is very sturdy so the bag supports itself and won&#x27;t collapse all over the floor. It was a little misshapen when I received it but a hair dryer fixed that.</li>
            <li> one of the best clear bags I have seen. great pocket space. Stiff but keeps the structure of the bag!</li>
            <li> I purchased this bag because I work in retail and it is required that I have a clear bag. The size is perfect, and the bag is attractive.</li>
            <li> Took this to my first NFL stadium game and it worked great.  Love the small pocket in the front for wallet (small size) and lipstick/chapstick.  Main compartment was large enough for other items.  No issues w/ security.  Shipping was fast and quality is great.</li>
            <li> Good for easy access and viewing of contents that you keep inside. The quality and workmanship will hold up well and is waterproof.</li>
            <li> I work in a department store and must carry a clear bag for personal items being brought to the sales floor.  It is a perfect size for me, I am able to carry my wallet, small cosmetic bag, cell phone in the front pocket and other essentials.  It is sturdy and I like the convenient shoulder straps.  Some of my co-workers are planning on purchasing it as well.  This bag is also somewhat stylish if you have to run any quick errands after work and don&#x27;t have time to switch over to my regular handbag.  This is a bag that serves well for what I need and the price is great as well.</li>
            <li> *update* its december 2014 and this bag lasted a good year and a half in a warehouse. the handles lasted through the entire time but the plastic began to rip and the zipper fell off within 6 months. as it it was just for my feminine hygiene and gloves for work I just taped it up and kept going. but eventually after a year and a half it was not holding up anymore.   bought this because where I work prefers a clear bag to check easier through security. It is holding up great and the plastic has yet to tear. The front pocket does have little holes on both sides at the bottom. So change like penny&#x27;s will fall out. I also wanted something that would hold a nice side book since I love to read and standing it upright I can do that perfectly. If you have school books though I would get the 12 inch bag which fits a lot more. Another great thing is because the plastic is so thick it stands up on it&#x27;s own wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that there are three pocket compartments.  I would prefer that the main section had a zipper closure and that the straps were long enough to use as a cross body bag.  As it is, they are barely long enough to use as a shoulder bag.  Since this bag will be used only at concerts and sporting events where it is required, I would prefer to have a hands-free option that did not require setting the bag down.  I have ordered another clear pocketbook that has a strap that I hope can be worn cross body.  Admittedly this new bag would have only one compartment.  I will return the bag pictured here, if the other one better meets my requirements.  Otherwise, this bag appears to be of good quality and would certainly be a far superior way of holding items than the alternative--a zip lock bag.</li>
            <li> Just wish it had a inside pocket or divider in it and it shouldn&#x27;t have been over $20.00. $25 pluse shipping is a bit much other than that I like it and I like that it looks like a purse</li>
            <li> very nice but the clip on the corner is always falling off</li>
            <li> This is great for work since I work at a prison.  I like the fact that it has straps and pockets on the outside.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed because after use 1 day corner protectors fell off on 2 corner and a week later a third one fell off exposing the threads!</li>
            <li> Good quality.  Would definitely recommend purchasing this purse.</li>
            <li> Need a clear bag for work! This is the one small enough for your locker. The clear material is thick and sturdy. Very well made.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom as a gift. She works at the airport and needed it to go through security.  It was perfect and all her coworkers are all jealous..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this same purse twice. The quality is good; not cheap, thin vinyl. I really like the side and front pockets.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last long and the plastic ripped. Small too!</li>
            <li> Have been looking for a clear bag with shoulder straps and this is the perfect size for my needs. It&#x27;s more than I expected and very well made. I would definitely recommend it to anyone that needs to carry a clear bag for work.</li>
