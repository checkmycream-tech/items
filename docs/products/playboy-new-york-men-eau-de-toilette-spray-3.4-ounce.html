            <li>i love this because it smells amazing and</li>
            <li>The London is also great but, not quite as good as New York.  </li>
            <li>this is my favorite cologne...</li>
            <li>One of the better colognes in my collection</li>
            <li>This gives it kind of a cheap smell, but I still like it.</li>

            <li>SO YOU DON&#x27;T HAVE TO SPRAY MUCH,I THINK THIS SCENT IS BETTER FOR MEN THAT ARE ABOUT 25</li>
            <li>I would consider it more of a &amp;#34;lucky you&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s inexpensive and lovely and will cause ladies turn heads :-)</li>
            <li>smells great fast shipping</li>
            <li>I my self love the VIP on him,but for the price I got this just for him. :)</li>
            <li>He love the smell</li>
            <li>He has enjoyed the Playboy line, he has had them all</li>
            <li>This is my sons favorite</li>
            <li>Its somewhat Okay type..</li>
            <li>I love perfumes by Playboy.</li>
            <li>This cologne is my favorite &amp;#34;night cologne&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>nice scent, not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>cheap, you could say very cheap, and for this price i thought the smell was going to be cheap but its pretty good smell</li>
            <li>It smells so unique and is actually refreshing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, but it is not that smell!</li>
            <li>Very mild inconspicuous fruity smell.  </li>
            <li>It lasts for a 8-10 hours easily.</li>
            <li>The smell is not that strong, strong in the sense that you have to spray a lot to know yourself that you wearing it.</li>
            <li>Really does smell great women love it, not a small bottle.</li>
            <li>and I would rather save some money to spend on things that are more fun...</li>
            <li>The scent is a good one for all times, but I think mostly for like a romantic dinner with someone special or when you hit the club and are trying to pick up ladies.</li>
            <li>this fragrance smell&#x27;s fruity,Sweet &amp; clean.</li>
            <li>It is a great value so snag up a few bottles, you won&#x27;t regret it! :)</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this one, good smell, lasts a while.</li>
            <li>it is a really good sweet smell, and it last me all day</li>
            <li>5 stars, it smells fresh, kind of sweet but also masculine.</li>
            <li>New York is by far my favorite and smells absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li>A decent aroma just with a more flowery fragrance.</li>
            <li>, i highly recommend it :)</li>
            <li>First bought this type of perfume in Washington D.C. and now I really enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunatly it doesn&#x27;t really last super long with some materials of clothes but with things like cotton or falanals its great!</li>
            <li>I recommend Playboy New York for every user who is not going to pay  $30 and more for fragrances</li>
            <li>This cologne smells good, but it is the EXACT same scent as Axe Apollo.</li>
            <li>He really loves it!!</li>
            <li>Fantastic price for a very decent amount of ounces.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Its an amazing fragrance and you wont have second thought to why you bought it.</li>
            <li>by far this is my favorite one</li>
            <li>right on .</li>
            <li>The scent has the right amount of aroma that isn&#x27;t too over-bearing.</li>
            <li>right on .</li>
            <li>Also arrived super fast, so add it to your arsenal already.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more playboy colognes in the future.</li>
            <li>Long lasting and smells great.</li>
            <li>one of my favorite smells currently in existence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bottle is pretty.</li>
            <li>I found this in highschool,  and even now, get compliments and notices just for this exact cologne</li>
            <li>its more then i expected get this its only 12 dollars or get l&#x27;homme libre its 50 dollars but amazing</li>
            <li>At first I was surprised by the smell because it didn&#x27;t strike me as exactly masculine, almost smelled more like stores in the mall.</li>
            <li>Unlike most of the &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; colognes, this scent lasts a long time!</li>
            <li>I got this for my fiance and it smells good but doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who likes blue water or light floral.</li>
            <li>I underestimated the size of this product.&lt;br /&gt;The cost, compared to how much you receive, is absolutely fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;Better</li>
            <li>It is a decent smell but, not what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Reminds me of my trip out to New York.  </li>
            <li>When its running out I tried to shop for another one and give New York a try.</li>
            <li>smell as opposed to Aqua Di Gio like the London and New York.  </li>
            <li>New York...</li>
            <li>New York...</li>
            <li>and he has his favorites and he likes New York and</li>
            <li>I think I will likely wear London to work regularly and save the New York for special occasions.  </li>
            <li>CAME ON TIME AND SMELLS GOOD,CLASSIC MATURE TYPE SCENT,IT&#x27;S A LITTLE STRONG</li>
            <li>Smell of the Colon is great(sweetish), lasts long enough for such a cheap product, package is really eye-catching.</li>
            <li>Vegas was my least favorite.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really would know if this is a fragrance i would want to purchase any time in the future, But for now...</li>
            <li>I purchased this item for my nephew who is 18 yrs old.  </li>
            <li>I ordered 3 different bottles based on reviews: PB New York, PB London, and PB Vegas.  </li>
            <li>With the Playboy New York, that is not necessary!</li>
            <li>I barely use it.</li>
            <li>The scent is not a long lasting scent, but like I said he likes it!</li>
            <li>At first I was a little wary of the buy because there was a few mixed reviews, but am very glad I did buy this.</li>

            <li> At first I was a little wary of the buy because there was a few mixed reviews, but am very glad I did buy this.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like, but what do you expect from such an affordable fragrance.</li>
            <li> Overall it last long enough to put it on the morning and still be present by late afternoon.</li>
            <li> Wish it would last a little longer in the day.</li>
            <li> but then I got used to the smell (not that it was ever bad, just not what I expected) and now I love it.</li>
            <li> ,THIS IS NOT REALLY A CLUB TYPE SCENT.</li>
            <li> It is not really the style of smell</li>
            <li> This was a gift and they crushed the box to stuff</li>
            <li> It has a stronger scent than some of the other Playboy colognes, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> complaint is that the scent doesn&#x27;t last the longest amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> Hate the name, but love the smell of this cologne.</li>
            <li> I have previously used these perfumes and always...</li>
            <li> mean it every single time I get compliments for using it.</li>
            <li> Overall, the Play Boy brands did not disappoint and for the price, you cannot go wrong.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Really good product. Nice Fragance!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last and you have to use a ton just to smell it on yourself.</li>
            <li> This is a bit of a flowery scent but my wife likes it and I would rather save some money to spend on things that are more fun...</li>
            <li> Hate the name, but love the smell of this cologne.</li>
            <li> it is a really good sweet smell, and it last me all day and i can still smell it now , i highly recommend it :)</li>
            <li> this is my favorite cologne... i have six bottles of cologne because i use cologne daily. by far this is my favorite one</li>
            <li> It smells amazing !!!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time for me to give it to my Grandson for his Birthday, He loves this brand</li>
            <li> Always get compliments with this! Smells very similar to Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Fierce Cologne. Great product!</li>
            <li> Was looking around for a couple of good scents on the cheap and the reviews on this one caught my attention. I would definitely recommend this one, good smell, lasts a while. Also arrived super fast, so add it to your arsenal already.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend recommended this cologne and wanted me to get it. So I got it and I love it!!! One of the better colognes in my collection</li>
            <li> Great for the price. Wish it would last a little longer in the day. But great over all. Wife loves this on me. 😄</li>
            <li> This cologne smells good, but it is the EXACT same scent as Axe Apollo. This gives it kind of a cheap smell, but I still like it. Shipping took over 2 weeks, though. Overall I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> This playboy scent is the best in my opinion.  It is not overpowering yet it lasts all day. I would recommend this to anyone who likes blue water or light floral.</li>
            <li> Love the combination of vanilla with this smell. No need to pay more money for all those expensive brands.  This smells great.</li>
            <li> First bought this type of perfume in Washington D.C. and now I really enjoy it.  Reminds me of my trip out to New York.  Great smell.  Not flora.</li>
            <li> Great smelling cheap cologne!</li>
            <li> A friend bought with playboy , i think its the Miami, which I really love and get some compliment when i use it. When its running out I tried to shop for another one and give New York a try. Its nothing compared to Miami. I barely use it. The smell is not that strong, strong in the sense that you have to spray a lot to know yourself that you wearing it.</li>
            <li> THIS IS DA BOMB....WILL RECOMMEND AND WILL BUY AGAIN FOR MY HUSBAND. HE LOVES IT AS WELL. YOU SHOULD TRY IT!!</li>
            <li> At first I was surprised by the smell because it didn&#x27;t strike me as exactly masculine, almost smelled more like stores in the mall. (a cross between floral smells and Hollister maybe?) but then I got used to the smell (not that it was ever bad, just not what I expected) and now I love it. Fantastic price for a very decent amount of ounces. I&#x27;ll be buying more playboy colognes in the future.</li>
            <li> CAME ON TIME AND SMELLS GOOD,CLASSIC MATURE TYPE SCENT,IT&#x27;S A LITTLE STRONG SO YOU DON&#x27;T HAVE TO SPRAY MUCH,I THINK THIS SCENT IS BETTER FOR MEN THAT ARE ABOUT 25 ON UP,THIS IS NOT REALLY A CLUB TYPE SCENT.</li>
            <li> nice scent, not bad for the price. sorry I have to make up words to fill the required number of words for a review. STUPID.</li>
            <li> I love best cologne for the price smells great and it gets the ladies attention. right on . ill defiantly be buying again</li>
            <li> 5 stars, it smells fresh, kind of sweet but also masculine. Recommended for younger people but its all up to you.</li>
            <li> Got this for my uncle and ex-boyfriend and they loved it. The scent has the right amount of aroma that isn&#x27;t too over-bearing. I&#x27;d purchase this again for a gift.</li>
            <li> This was given as a gift and the person receiving loved that is was Playboy.. nifty gift idea.. will buy again</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 different bottles based on reviews: PB New York, PB London, and PB Vegas.  New York is by far my favorite and smells absolutely amazing.  The London is also great but, not quite as good as New York.  I think I will likely wear London to work regularly and save the New York for special occasions.  Vegas was my least favorite.  It is not really the style of smell I like, so I will likely give it away to a friend or maybe my nephew.  It is a decent smell but, not what I was looking for.  I would consider it more of a &amp;#34;lucky you&amp;#34; smell as opposed to Aqua Di Gio like the London and New York.  Overall, the Play Boy brands did not disappoint and for the price, you cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li> Awesome, just as described and really fast shipping too :)</li>
            <li> My husband loves it and he gets compliments everywhere he goes</li>
            <li> Good product, Nice smell</li>
            <li> I got this for my fiance and it smells good but doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long. He wears it all the time</li>
            <li> It smells great. My girlfriend thinks its smells good. I guess that&#x27;s all that matters. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Very mild inconspicuous fruity smell.  Will never cause a headache from overpowered cologne.  It&#x27;s inexpensive and lovely and will cause ladies turn heads :-)</li>
            <li> New York...New York...Boi this fragrance smell&#x27;s fruity,Sweet &amp; clean. Don&#x27;t really would know if this is a fragrance i would want to purchase any time in the future, But for now...It&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li> smells great fast shipping</li>
            <li> My girlfriend likes it, so I like it!!!</li>
            <li> my fianc&amp;eacute;e loves this one. I my self love the VIP on him,but for the price I got this just for him. :)</li>
            <li> Got it for my son. He love the smell</li>
            <li> Amazing Product. Must Buy..Gifted my husband and he just loves it.. Long lasting and smells great.</li>
            <li> Really does smell great women love it, not a small bottle.</li>
            <li> I underestimated the size of this product.&lt;br /&gt;The cost, compared to how much you receive, is absolutely fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;Better yet, the scent has to be one of my favorite smells currently in existence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is that the scent doesn&#x27;t last the longest amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;Have to reapply after a fairly brief amount of time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, but it is not that smell!</li>
            <li> I love best cologne for the price smells great and it gets the ladies attention. right on . ill defiantly be buying again</li>
            <li> Smell of the Colon is great(sweetish), lasts long enough for such a cheap product, package is really eye-catching. I&#x27;ve bought it from Yamanni for $11,2. Product arrived in time and wasn&#x27;t damaged. I recommend Playboy New York for every user who is not going to pay  $30 and more for fragrances</li>
            <li> Smells good and I get a lot of compliments. Unfortunatly it doesn&#x27;t really last super long with some materials of clothes but with things like cotton or falanals its great!</li>
            <li> Smell is nice.  Bottle is pretty. Recipient likes it.</li>
            <li> cheap, you could say very cheap, and for this price i thought the smell was going to be cheap but its pretty good smell i like it</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift, he likes it!</li>
            <li> My grandson loves to smell good. I purchase him scents all the time. He has enjoyed the Playboy line, he has had them all and he has his favorites and he likes New York and the Miami scent a lot. Love the affordable price and love doing my shopping through the merchants at Amazon, I know I have great choices and the products are great! The scent is not a long lasting scent, but like I said he likes it!</li>
            <li> This is my sons favorite</li>
            <li> Very good EDT for the price. At first I was a little wary of the buy because there was a few mixed reviews, but am very glad I did buy this. It smells really good, and I&#x27;ve gotten nothing but complements for it. The longevity is very good because I can spray it in the morning and still smell it when I go to bed. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone because it is a cheap buy for a great EDT. The only thing I can say that&#x27;s bad about it is that I use it every day and am going to have to buy another bottle soon because like I said, I&#x27;ve received nothing but complements for wearing it. The scent is a good one for all times, but I think mostly for like a romantic dinner with someone special or when you hit the club and are trying to pick up ladies.</li>
            <li> Best cologne I have ever worn ever.  I found this in highschool,  and even now, get compliments and notices just for this exact cologne</li>
            <li> Its somewhat Okay type..</li>
            <li> A decent aroma just with a more flowery fragrance. Overall it last long enough to put it on the morning and still be present by late afternoon.</li>
            <li> I love perfumes by Playboy. They leave that awesome fragrance to you that confuses people to decide if its strong or subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fragrance is just like the deodorant. It lasts for a 8-10 hours easily. I have previously used these perfumes and always...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean it every single time I get compliments for using it. My girlfriend is head-over-heels when I wear this fragrance. So Mission Accomplished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its an amazing fragrance and you wont have second thought to why you bought it.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and they crushed the box to stuff (and I mean stuff) it in an envelope. It make giving this as a gift impossible now. The price was great for the size so if you don&#x27;t want it as a gift its a good buy.</li>
            <li> Smells good, got some compliments, in my opinion best if the playboy line fragrance.</li>
            <li> It was as pic was shown, but I found it cheaper at a local store the was the only thing:/</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my nephew who is 18 yrs old.  He really loves it!!</li>
            <li> Gift. For my son, he loved the fragrance, the reviews helped me decide. Good choice.</li>
            <li> i love this because it smells amazing and its more then i expected get this its only 12 dollars or get l&#x27;homme libre its 50 dollars but amazing</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like, but what do you expect from such an affordable fragrance.</li>
            <li> This cologne is my favorite &amp;#34;night cologne&amp;#34;.  It smells so unique and is actually refreshing.  It has a stronger scent than some of the other Playboy colognes, so a little goes a long way. I like to wear cologne for myself, not others, so I have a bad habit of over doing it a bit. With the Playboy New York, that is not necessary! You can smell it for a while without overpowering those around you! Unlike most of the &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; colognes, this scent lasts a long time! It is a great value so snag up a few bottles, you won&#x27;t regret it! :)</li>
