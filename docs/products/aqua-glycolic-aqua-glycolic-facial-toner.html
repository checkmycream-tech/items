            <li>Just Love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for some time and love the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>I informed the vendor just as an FYI - not expecting a replacement as it wasn&#x27;t enough to be concerned about - but they apologized and sent me a replacement - GREAT customer service !</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ll update this review if I have any issues with the product, but so far it&#x27;s been a great choice.</li>
            <li>Great product and helped my skin clear up.</li>
            <li>It amazes me at how much dirt comes out of my pores even after washing with a good cleanser.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant scent and works beautifully on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great for removing that last trace of makeup after cleansing.</li>
            <li>Helps to smooth and prevent acne.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful toner, because it not only cleans up anything left after you wash your face, it continues to clean your face through the glycolic.</li>
            <li>This product is super, and is so economically priced.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh without stinging and the glycolic ingredients improve skin tone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and a half now and have had nothing but good results.</li>
            <li>Most toners either don&#x27;t do anything to help or they actually cause acne for me, or their fragrance does.</li>
            <li>I think this helps because it pulls the dirt out before closing my pores and making my face so smooth and clear.</li>
            <li>Gentle on the skin and leaves me fresh always.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff it has made a big improvement with my complexion.  </li>
            <li>It now feels smooth and clear of blackheads.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m enjoying clear skin with the exception of occasional mild flare-ups.</li>
            <li>Not enough glycolic to stop a flare up, but good enough to maintain skin tone during the summer months.</li>
            <li>I have struggled with sebaceous cysts for some time now, and I found many recommendations online to use Aqua Glycolic (particularly the glycolic acid in it) to treat and the facial cleanser to prevent the cysts.  </li>
            <li>I needed a toner that is gentle yet strong enough to get rid of blackheads.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different kinds of toners over the years on my sensitive, severe-acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>Never disappointed with Aqua Glycolic Facial Cleanser!  </li>
            <li>this is the only type of lotion i want to use to clean my face skin.</li>
            <li>Think of the Toner as a micro skin peel every day and the Facial Cleanser (with mild abrasives) as a micro-dermabrasion every day.  </li>
            <li>I have used several other  more costly brands, and I prefer this one.  </li>
            <li>and since then my face is clear.</li>
            <li>The only downside is the sharp smell of the product (which fades fairy quickly)</li>
            <li>I like this toner for daily use, it is gentle enough.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 54-year old male and both products</li>
            <li>So far, having used it for a few months, it&#x27;s worked pretty well.  </li>
            <li>- I was using proactive but finally switched completely over to acne.org), but my dermatologist wanted me to try aczone and ziana combo therapy because of rosacea that was starting.</li>
            <li>In this last order the top had not been properly taped closed and a small amount had leaked out.</li>

            <li> Always consistently good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different kinds of toners over the years on my sensitive, severe-acne prone skin. Most toners either don&#x27;t do anything to help or they actually cause acne for me, or their fragrance does. I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and a half now and have had nothing but good results. I was using acne.org line of skin care (still use their cleanser and moisturizer, it&#x27;s the best) with the benzoyl peroxide (great skin care combinations to clear up skin and keep it pretty clear - I was using proactive but finally switched completely over to acne.org), but my dermatologist wanted me to try aczone and ziana combo therapy because of rosacea that was starting. This is the toner I believe I&#x27;ve finally settled on and I&#x27;m enjoying clear skin with the exception of occasional mild flare-ups.</li>
            <li> I like this toner for daily use, it is gentle enough.  Not enough glycolic to stop a flare up, but good enough to maintain skin tone during the summer months.</li>

I have used several other  more costly brands, and I prefer this one.  I also use their cleanser and moisturizer product.  Do be sure to use sun protection when using however.  I use this with DCL Peptides Plus Serum in place of the moisture at night.  Good result on fine lines and prevention of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels great after using this.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. It has been an integral part of how nice my skin looks now, well into my 40&#x27;s.  It has a pleasant scent and works beautifully on my sensitive skin. It amazes me at how much dirt comes out of my pores even after washing with a good cleanser.

            <li> My doctor had prescribed this toner many years ago for my acne prone skin. It works really well. I have purchased this numerous times. I use it after cleansing my face and it removes any residual makeup/dirt.&lt;br /&gt;Will keep repurchasing</li>
            <li> Excellent, excellent product.  Just Love this product. Hooray!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It does exfoliate and I have noticed a slight difference in blackheads. It isn&#x27;t very strong and you will not see significant results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for some time and love the way it feels on my skin. It&#x27;s fresh without stinging and the glycolic ingredients improve skin tone. I use it twice daily and it&#x27;s great for removing that last trace of makeup after cleansing. I decant some into a smaller bottle when traveling. In this last order the top had not been properly taped closed and a small amount had leaked out. I informed the vendor just as an FYI - not expecting a replacement as it wasn&#x27;t enough to be concerned about - but they apologized and sent me a replacement - GREAT customer service ! Thank you!</li>
            <li> i have sensitive skin and this toner works great, does not irritate my skin at all, and got rid of my oily pores...</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s one of my must-haves. The only problem is that it can be a little too harsh on the skin</li>
            <li> Great for skin m! Helps to smooth and prevent acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and love using it. I have oily skin and it helps to control breakouts and cleanses my face removing any remaining makeup. Be careful if you have sensitive skin because it may be too harsh.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with sebaceous cysts for some time now, and I found many recommendations online to use Aqua Glycolic (particularly the glycolic acid in it) to treat and the facial cleanser to prevent the cysts.  So far, having used it for a few months, it&#x27;s worked pretty well.  The toner bottle itself has a pumping apparatus in it, so all you need is a cotton ball or makeup pad to get the toner.  I&#x27;ll update this review if I have any issues with the product, but so far it&#x27;s been a great choice.</li>
            <li> Never disappointed with Aqua Glycolic Facial Cleanser!  Gentle on the skin and leaves me fresh always.  A must buy for anyone!</li>
            <li> I had facial issues for a long time and then I went to this excellent dermatologist that recommended this product for me and since then my face is clear. I don&#x27;t even apply it everyday. Only 2-3 times a week before bed.</li>
            <li> this is the only type of lotion i want to use to clean my face skin. i don&#x27;t have problem as long as i use this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;but the price is getting up, i used to buy this under $11.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it has made a big improvement with my complexion.  I am forty three now, I wish I would have discovered it in my teens.  I have a bad habit of picking my face when I see a zit, I have mild acne.  So, I have dark marks from the picking, they are slowing going away but now I don&#x27;t get zits as often.  My pores are even shrinking.  I never realized Glycolic can make such an improvent on your skin!</li>
            <li> Great product and helped my skin clear up. It now feels smooth and clear of blackheads. Combined with wash and cream</li>
            <li> I needed a toner that is gentle yet strong enough to get rid of blackheads. This does the job. I use it twice a day and its working great. I&#x27;m thinking of ordering the aqua glycolic face cream to go along with this. I&#x27;ll keep you updated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Aqua Glycolic Toner product for at least 15 years, usually before going to sleep, and I use the Aqua Glycolic Facial Cleanser in the morning, using a battery powered rotary scrubber.  I&#x27;m a 54-year old male and both products keep my skin looking younger.  Think of the Toner as a micro skin peel every day and the Facial Cleanser (with mild abrasives) as a micro-dermabrasion every day.  As long as I&#x27;m getting results, I won&#x27;t be stopping the use of Aqua Glycolic products!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful toner, because it not only cleans up anything left after you wash your face, it continues to clean your face through the glycolic. I have compliments on  my skins all of the time and I attribute it to this product.</li>
