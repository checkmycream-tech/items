            <li>I&#x27;ve used this texturizing product for many years.  </li>
            <li>Better than Bead Head Manipulator</li>
            <li>Truly gives your hair a lovely shine without looking greasy or feeling sticky.</li>
            <li>I used to love this product because I cannot find it anywhere.</li>
            <li>For years now, the beauty shops haven&#x27;t carried it, so I&#x27;m so glad that Amazon now has it available.</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair shine and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a product that has a strong hold like a hairspray or gel, this is not it.</li>
            <li>It is great on short hair...</li>
            <li>It really is the best finishing product, especially for hair like mine that gets frizzy in the humidity.  </li>
            <li>i WAS SO EXCITED TO FIND THIS</li>
            <li>I was excited to find it on Amazon</li>
            <li>Sleek Smooth and Sophisticated Look Shine Pomade&amp;#34; is very satisfactory.</li>
            <li>It is the best pomade I have tried -- it has just the right amount of &amp;#34;goop&amp;#34; to hold my hair styling in place, but is not too runny or messy.  </li>
            <li>when my hair dries, I have shinny, full curls.  </li>
            <li>It is amazing on short, fine hair.</li>
            <li>A year ago I got lucky and found it at a salon going out of business</li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon, you made my day!!</li>
            <li>This stuff is great for smoothing fly-aways and separating my curls a little.  </li>
            <li>Makes my limp but \\&quot;fly away\\</li>
            <li>It adds great texture into my short hair and a shine like no other product can make.</li>
            <li>I looked for it on Amazon and found it right away.</li>
            <li>great product for fine, thin hair</li>
            <li>Just a little bit makes my hair behave and look good.</li>
            <li>and I have not been able to find it in the last 10 months!</li>
            <li>A friend of mine gave me my first jar of Textureline and I&#x27;ve been hooked on it ever since.</li>
            <li>AND I WILL PURCHASE MORE IN THE FUTURE!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, I have blonde hair</li>
            <li>Many guys use American Crew pomade.</li>
            <li>This product is great for short hair which can be used by rubbing your hands together and applying to clean, dried hair.</li>
            <li>This stuff lightly applied and brushed in</li>
            <li>ON THIS STOREFRONT FOR CHARGING SO MUCH FOR A DISCONTINUED PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>i have tried many different brands of hair gel and none of them come close to the features that this brand offers.  </li>
            <li>The product lasts a long time time because it takes very little for great results.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m thinking maybe I should buy a few more just in case.  </li>
            <li>Textureline gives a slight sheen to my silver hair and helps with the few fly away hairs.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for years - only &#x27;gel&#x27; that suits my short, fine hair</li>
            <li>I have fine, limp hair and gets frizzy when it&#x27;s humid out.  </li>
            <li>It styles your hair but still leaves it manageable and not stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve made it clear that they do not want our business and our money.&lt;br /&gt;Take</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for nearly eleven years.  </li>
            <li>It really works on short hair and does not leave it gummy or sticky.</li>
            <li>and it really, really makes it shine and works whether my hair is longer or short.  </li>
            <li>and this helps me manage wild hair.  </li>
            <li>I have very short straight gray hair.  </li>
            <li>It must be old because it has a funky smell.</li>
            <li>I have short blonde hair and E-texture keeps it in place with just the right amount of shine and no greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>This product is very hard to find and I was very pleased to not only find it at this vendor but at the lowest price.</li>
            <li>It is also light enough that it doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down.</li>
            <li>I SEARCHED HIGH AND LOW FOR THIS PRODUCT AFTER THE STORE I PURCHASED IT STOPED CARRING</li>
            <li>Have used in the past until no longer available.</li>
            <li>Not heavy and just a tiny bit does the job.</li>
            <li>It arrived very promptly and was of usual high standard.</li>

            <li> It arrived very promptly and was of usual high standard.</li>
            <li> I have used other products that claim the same results and they came no where near meeting my expectations.  </li>
            <li> i have fine, silver grey hair and all the other brands i&#x27;ve tried either dull my hair or flatten it or both.  </li>
            <li> Came early and exactly as I expected!</li>
            <li> My jar lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only product that has stopped my fine hair from electricity in the cold winter.  </li>
            <li> It lasts forever because you only need a little tiny bit.  </li>
            <li> After blowdrying, I select a few strands of hair and pull the product through the strands and they stay straight and gives it a little shine to offset the frizziness.  </li>
            <li> I have fine,curly hair and it not only keeps friz down</li>
            <li> Now I am down to the end of the last jar.  </li>
            <li> or &#x27;wet&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday just to put the final &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; on my hair.....</li>
            <li> It controls the frizzy flyaways and gives hair a slight wet look but not really shiny and crunchy.</li>
            <li> Hair looks dull and stiff with their new product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> No thanks!</li>
            <li> bought five jars of the product because it is one that can no longer be found (other than the flimsy gel products) and one that you can manipulate hair with</li>
            <li> My hair stays in place but not weighed down.</li>
            <li> But I usually just towel dry my hair, use some frizz serum, comb and then shape with</li>
            <li> A subtle hold that doesn&#x27;t freeze my hair into an obvious &amp;#34;do&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE GOES ALONG WAY.</li>
            <li> If he runs out he gets a little panicky.</li>
            <li> You just use a small amount so this small jar lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li> After I give my limp hair a curl, I add a touch of this to give definition to my style.</li>
            <li> I use a very small amount as I have very long thick hair.</li>
            <li> Still works but cannot get past the smell.</li>
            <li> Loreal has unfortunately decided to discontinue manufacturing this product and instead has come out with one that&#x27;s similar but does not impart any shine to hair as before.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a scent, which is hard to find nowadays in hair products.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for this product for at least 8 months.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair of medium length for a guy.</li>
            <li> That stuff is utter crap compared to this.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s difficult to find suppliers.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I understand this product has been discontinued, so I have to search online to find it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very expensive however.</li>
            <li> To me that jus plan BAD BUSINESS......</li>
            <li> bad.</li>
            <li> I was shocked it was still in production.</li>
            <li> but when I got it, I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A DISGUSTING EXAMPLE OF OPPORTUNISM  AND DEEPLY SAD TO ME.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR 18 YEARS AND AM SO DISAPPOINTED</li>

            <li> I love this product !  Textureline gives a slight sheen to my silver hair and helps with the few fly away hairs. You just use a small amount so this small jar lasts a very long time.  I notice when I use textureline I get a lot of compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair of medium length for a guy. I like to run around without hair product, but I also like to have my hair stay out of my face. This stuff lightly applied and brushed in does the trick. A subtle hold that doesn&#x27;t freeze my hair into an obvious &amp;#34;do&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> best product for short hair.  Gives a wonderful shine and helps keep hair in whatever order you comb it in.</li>
            <li> I SEARCHED HIGH AND LOW FOR THIS PRODUCT AFTER THE STORE I PURCHASED IT STOPED CARRING IT  I WILL NOT USE ANTHING ELSE  LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Great product..unfortunately has been discontinued,</li>
            <li> Love. Love. Perfect for my curly hair. Now it&#x27;s been discontinued.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years.  I have fine,curly hair and it not only keeps friz down but it gives hair a nice shine.  It is also light enough that it doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down.</li>
            <li> I prefer this product to Bed Head hair manipulator.  It is easier to work with and not as sticky and tacky.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 10 years and I have not been able to find it in the last 10 months! so glad I had stock piled some. It is amazing on short, fine hair. Gives it body and shine.Thanks, Amazon, you made my day!!</li>
            <li> A friend of mine gave me my first jar of Textureline and I&#x27;ve been hooked on it ever since. It adds great texture into my short hair and a shine like no other product can make. I was so glad to be able to find this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years - only &#x27;gel&#x27; that suits my short, fine hair but it&#x27;s difficult to find suppliers. It arrived very promptly and was of usual high standard.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I found this product! It had been discontinued and I thought it was gone forever.  I have been using it for years and didn&#x27;t know what i was going to do without it!  A year ago I got lucky and found it at a salon going out of business and I bought the last three jars they had.  Now I am down to the end of the last jar.  I just bought four on Amazon and I&#x27;m thinking maybe I should buy a few more just in case.  It really is the best finishing product, especially for hair like mine that gets frizzy in the humidity.  I am a happy camper today!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for nearly eleven years.  The place that I used to purchase it retail stopped stocking it, so I was very happy to find it on-line!  I have short blonde hair and E-texture keeps it in place with just the right amount of shine and no greasy feeling.  My hair stays in place but not weighed down.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS AND CAN&#x27;T SEEM TO FIND IT ANYMORE. AMAZON FOUND IT AND I WILL PURCHASE MORE IN THE FUTURE!</li>
            <li> All of us former Textureline Texture Shine customers know what made this discontinued product so great.&lt;br /&gt;Guess what? We not only have a voice, we have a choice:&lt;br /&gt;If L&#x27;Oreal will not stand by their customers, AXE certainly offers an excellent and comparable product.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Axe Sleek Smooth and Sophisticated Look Shine Pomade&amp;#34; is very satisfactory. It&#x27;s only $6.97 at Walmart too.&lt;br /&gt;Beat that price Amazon! Stop begging L&#x27;Oreal. They&#x27;ve made it clear that they do not want our business and our money.&lt;br /&gt;Take your business and money to AXE.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks AXE! You rock!</li>
            <li> i have tried many different brands of hair gel and none of them come close to the features that this brand offers.  i have fine, silver grey hair and all the other brands i&#x27;ve tried either dull my hair or flatten it or both.  this gel gives my hair shine and body.  i worry that it is not being continued since the company was bought by l&#x27;oreal.</li>
            <li> Great product. Have used in the past until no longer available. It really works on short hair and does not leave it gummy or sticky. Only downside is the cost of shipping. Once added on the cost rises to $25 per puck. Yikes!!!!</li>
            <li> Have grown to LOVE this stuff.  Makes my limp but \\&quot;fly away\\&quot; hair do what I want.  So glad I found it.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this product for at least 8 months. It had been discontinued...so everyone says. However, I found it today on Amazon. Hallejuah! I am a happy customer and so it my hair!  It is great on short hair...just follow directions and look beautiful with great hair!!!!!    Thank you</li>
            <li> This has been my most favorite hair product I have ever used!  I wish they would start making it again!  Nothing compares to it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only product that has stopped my fine hair from electricity in the cold winter.  Just a pat leaves my hair without electricity and not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;It is very expensive however. My jar lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I used this product for many years. Just a little bit makes my hair behave and look good. However, I was dismayed with the price. I used to pay $17 to $20 for it. Now the price is $71! Yikes, is it made of gold? What happened?</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I have blonde hair and it really, really makes it shine and works whether my hair is longer or short.  And, it&#x27;s the only place I can find it!</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years.  It is going out of production so bought my stash.  I have gray hair, wear it short and this helps me manage wild hair.  Only product I will use!</li>
            <li> i WAS SO EXCITED TO FIND THIS ARTEC TEXTURLINE SHINE JAR FOR SALE AT YOUR WEBSITE. i THINK IT HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED EVERYWHERE . THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING. IT CONTROLS THE FLYAWAYS IN MY HAIR AND ADDS SHINE. A LITTLE GOES ALONG WAY.</li>
            <li> I discovered this hair cream in college over 11 years ago. This is the hand-down BEST texture/shine/hold paste out there. Better hold than a pomade. Smells nice but not sissy-smelling, adds great control and shine without looking like it&#x27;s greased up or &#x27;wet&#x27;. Not crunchy like a gel or greasy feeling like a pomade. Many guys use American Crew pomade. That stuff is utter crap compared to this. Get this stuff, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> great product for fine, thin hair</li>
            <li> This is the only hair product my husband uses. He has used it for years...about 20. If he runs out he gets a little panicky. It controls the frizzy flyaways and gives hair a slight wet look but not really shiny and crunchy.</li>
            <li> I can no longer find the product in town so finding it on Amazon is great. I have been using it for years and it is perfect for my fine hair - gives it body without being sticky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this texturizing product for many years.  It lasts forever because you only need a little tiny bit.  I use it everyday just to put the final &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; on my hair.....it even works for just taming those fly-aways after blow drying</li>
            <li> This is my favorite texture product for my hair!!  Shiny, piecey, easy to work with!  Better than Bead Head Manipulator</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. It styles your hair but still leaves it manageable and not stiff or sticky. It is worth the cost the the seller was awesome.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair shine and easy to manage.  I have very short straight gray hair.  I put just a dab on my hands and rub them together before putting on my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t have a scent, which is hard to find nowadays in hair products.  If you are looking for a product that has a strong hold like a hairspray or gel, this is not it. But if you want a bit of control and lots of shine, this is a great product.  For years now, the beauty shops haven&#x27;t carried it, so I&#x27;m so glad that Amazon now has it available.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for smoothing fly-aways and separating my curls a little.  I don&#x27;t use a lot so a jar lasts forever.</li>
            <li> I hope they never take this item off the market.  I have fine, limp hair and gets frizzy when it&#x27;s humid out.  After blowdrying, I select a few strands of hair and pull the product through the strands and they stay straight and gives it a little shine to offset the frizziness.  But I usually just towel dry my hair, use some frizz serum, comb and then shape with texture line shine  -- when my hair dries, I have shinny, full curls.  A great product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to give ummph to styles.  After I give my limp hair a curl, I add a touch of this to give definition to my style.</li>
            <li> Textureline is the best product of its kind on the market.  Truly gives your hair a lovely shine without looking greasy or feeling sticky.</li>
            <li> This product adds beautiful shine while giving shape and body.  Not heavy and just a tiny bit does the job.</li>
            <li> I discovered Texturline pomade several years ago, and have been a devoted follower ever since.  It is the best pomade I have tried -- it has just the right amount of &amp;#34;goop&amp;#34; to hold my hair styling in place, but is not too runny or messy.  Sadly, I understand this product has been discontinued, so I have to search online to find it.</li>
            <li> I used to love this product because I cannot find it anywhere. I was excited to find it on Amazon but when I got it, I was disappointed. It must be old because it has a funky smell. Still works but cannot get past the smell.</li>
            <li> I have used this product forever and it is amazing. It was about $15. However, it has been discontinued for a while, Now the price is $70??  What a ripoff!!  No thanks!</li>
            <li> I had a jar of this for 11 years. I use a very small amount as I have very long thick hair. I looked for it on Amazon and found it right away. I was shocked it was still in production. Came early and exactly as I expected!</li>
            <li> Textureline Shine by Artec is a fatastic product for ALL types of hair...and I can&#x27;t believe that it is being taken on the market!!.I would llike to know what L&#x27;Oreal plans are to replace this product.??..Why is it that when a good hair product is so popular the manufacture takes it off the market. To me that jus plan BAD BUSINESS......</li>
            <li> Product is great and the price is the best one I have found anywhere. This product is very hard to find and I was very pleased to not only find it at this vendor but at the lowest price.</li>
            <li> I have used other products that claim the same results and they came no where near meeting my expectations.  The product lasts a long time time because it takes very little for great results.</li>
            <li> This product is great for short hair which can be used by rubbing your hands together and applying to clean, dried hair. It gives one incredible body AND shine. Loreal has unfortunately decided to discontinue manufacturing this product and instead has come out with one that&#x27;s similar but does not impart any shine to hair as before. Hair looks dull and stiff with their new product.&lt;br /&gt;I bought five jars of the product because it is one that can no longer be found (other than the flimsy gel products) and one that you can manipulate hair with, it stays and still looks great!&lt;br /&gt;Too bad. I also miss Revenescence (used to be Charles of the Ritz) too!</li>
            <li> SHAME! SHAME! SHAME! ON THIS STOREFRONT FOR CHARGING SO MUCH FOR A DISCONTINUED PRODUCT.  CAPITALISM IS THE DEVIL IF IT REQUIRES YOU CHARGE $129 FOR A PRODUCT AVERAGING $17 EVEN IF IT IS DISCONTINUED.  THIS IS A DISGUSTING EXAMPLE OF OPPORTUNISM  AND DEEPLY SAD TO ME. I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR 18 YEARS AND AM SO DISAPPOINTED IT HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED AND HAS SPARKED THIS GREEDY EXPLOITATION.  AGAIN, SHAME ON YOU, @Stuff4Beauty Inc.</li>
