    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>And my best feature was my hair!</li>
            <li>so I decided against my own best judgement to buy it.  </li>
            <li>may be good for hair, but hasn&#x27;t helped noticeably with the color</li>
            <li>and I am getting a lot of good complimens on it.</li>
            <li>The gray hairs then look like highlights; the hair is much more shiny and attractive.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased, no joke</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results I am getting from this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I liked it</li>
            <li>but, it is a nice shampoo and did seem to improve the texture of my hair.  </li>
            <li>The nice thing about this product is that it makes the hair darker, more like it was before the gray began to show.  </li>
            <li>I use the more effective it will be</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay; I guess.  </li>
            <li>I have taken pictures of my head (gray) and it appears as if either I am noticing results; but mosely, it seems as if I am getting more grayer.  </li>
            <li>,however I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Especially when there are so many reviews telling you...</li>
            <li>and I think I had more hair on d drain every time I use it.i</li>
            <li>I can also see the most difference every time I get a hair cut since the gray is getting trimmed off.</li>
            <li>PLEASED HERE HAVE TO HAVE PATIENCE.</li>
            <li>I purchased more.  </li>
            <li>it might give better reaults.</li>
            <li>maybe the more</li>
            <li>Sound&#x27;s to good to be true?</li>
            <li>This product was great for my hair because it made my hair feel soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>My hair is clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>Did not see significant results.  </li>
            <li>because I can&#x27;t evaluate yet if it really prevent &amp; reverse gray hair but sure will get more if it keeps making miracles and hopefully would be able to say that my hair is not only looking good but also has recover it natural color!</li>
            <li>i could have bought that actually smell good and clean your hair.  </li>
            <li>Money\\&quot; has made the miracle and my hair looks again smooth, silky, no frizz, no dirty looking.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money - this did not work at all and is very speculative at best as to why it might help.  </li>
            <li>People think that I just have good genes because they don&#x27;t see grey hairs.</li>
            <li>My nice hair is back, my year has turn around!</li>
            <li>I expect to order more in the future.</li>
            <li>, at first I thought I see some changes for the batter.</li>
            <li>One other reviewer mentioned might work better on men that could be true.</li>
            <li>It helps with the natural hair color but it leaves your hair not feeling shampoo clean.</li>
            <li>I am very gray and I am starting to see more color coming to my hair.</li>
            <li>pure garbage...</li>
            <li>I have targeted my vision on certain gray hairs to see if there is any change.  </li>
            <li>The results are positive, at least as good as when I used to use Greisen Formula.  </li>
            <li>And it was all I expected and more</li>
            <li>And my hairs looks and feels much healthier and shinier.</li>
            <li>It promises much and delivers nothing.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really think it would make my gray go away</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny because when you first start using it you could almost swear it is actually doing something, but if you take pictures and look closely, you will find that is</li>
            <li>My hairs looks better with this than it does when I use much more expensive brands of shampoo.</li>
            <li>just thinking of all of the high end nivea, axe brand shampoos</li>
            <li>and I bought it knowing it, because several other people mentioned how nice the hair was looking, grays included.</li>
            <li>I was turning almost completely white on the sides but now  there&#x27;s a nice mixture of gray and dark hair.</li>
            <li>Seems like a positive product, however I haven&#x27;t used the product enough to know if it works or not...</li>
            <li>Go away BLACK!&lt;br /&gt;After using this my black hair went away and too many white hairs..</li>
            <li>The reason was because I find some white hair with black ruts, but I wasn&#x27;t sure.</li>
            <li>The hair is clearly darker than it was before trying the products.  </li>
            <li>The jury is still out on this one, we have used one bottle and so far can&#x27;t tell any difference, we will see what happens after bottle number 2.,??</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not totally gray either mixed with brown, if you are totally grayed might not be product for you, more for someone just turning gray possible.</li>
            <li>and my hair has kept its natural color.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for four weeks, almost every day, and so far have not seen any improvement.  </li>
            <li>This product is very inefficient;  I have used it daily and after 1 month I had more grey hair than before.&lt;br /&gt;Simply waste of money.</li>
            <li>I use to buy locally in Charlotte, but now by from Amazon for less and free shipping with qty.</li>
            <li>If no results, will just consider myself lucky to have only wasted money on two bottles.</li>
            <li>Maybe all those others just didn&#x27;t do it right, or they are not the chosen few...</li>
            <li>People I work with noticed within months when I first started using the shampoo which I use everyday and conditioner</li>
            <li>maybe every other day mainly for time constraints in the morning, but I never cond.</li>

            <li> this shampoo is made for cleaning horses, just like the mane n tail brand that claims to get rid of grey too.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it that long, but it does seem to have reduced some of the gray.  </li>
            <li> I have not used it for long.  </li>
            <li> I can tell when I stop using it because of running out, my hair starts to turn a little back to the gray tint.</li>
            <li> Somewhere somebody nicknamed this shampoo &#x27;Go Away Money&#x27; since it didn&#x27;t worked as they expected with gray&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> I will continue using it till the bottle is empty....</li>
            <li> Gray capsules missed, but when I used it too frequently (daily), it really dried my hair out.</li>
            <li> Yea keep telling yourself that, if you are looking for false hope, and have money you&#x27;d like to flush down the toilet, then I highly recommend this product for you.</li>
            <li> It has a mixture of gray and dark hair.  </li>
            <li> leaves a slightly oily feeling after use, too.</li>
            <li> To me, no lather, no clean.</li>
            <li> It did not clean my hair and did not suds.</li>
            <li> As I had mentioned in my other surveys for the Conditioner and Capsules; I am not sure if these products are doing anything at all.  </li>
            <li> After a few uses I stopped using it because it just wasn&#x27;t cleaning my hair.</li>
            <li> They are there but very few.</li>
            <li> so I feel I need to do something to give it a chance, even though I&#x27;m very skeptical about all the natural hair stuff.</li>
            <li> , it is a slow process since the hair growing out is where the change comes.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that my hair doesn&#x27;t look fake with all dark hair.  </li>
            <li> However I&#x27;ve felt stupid for thinking that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After taking this for two months I still can&#x27;t say that I see a big difference</li>
            <li> Eventually when you do finally come to the realization that it is worthless</li>
            <li> False marketing and false results.</li>
            <li> either looks to dry or looks to to greasy (and that made it looks really dirty!),  to the point that I&#x27;m always wearing a hat to hide it.</li>
            <li> you are too disgusted and embarrassed to want to come back and admit you were suckered by this con.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I have been having a bad hair year, depending on the shampoo Im trying (and I have a collection sitting by the tub)</li>
            <li> I am quite disappointed with this.</li>
            <li> this crap is worthless also.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but because I hate gray hair with a passion</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It helps with the natural hair color but it leaves your hair not feeling shampoo clean. I use it occasionally.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay; I guess.  As I had mentioned in my other surveys for the Conditioner and Capsules; I am not sure if these products are doing anything at all.  I have taken pictures of my head (gray) and it appears as if either I am noticing results; but mosely, it seems as if I am getting more grayer.  If only there was something to go by.  Something to use as a baseline/timeline.</li>
            <li> may be good for hair, but hasn&#x27;t helped noticeably with the color</li>
            <li> The nice thing about this product is that it makes the hair darker, more like it was before the gray began to show.  The gray hairs then look like highlights; the hair is much more shiny and attractive.  I think it even helps make my fingernails stronger after I have scrubbed and rubbed the shampoo into my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> I judge shampoos by their lathering quality. To me, no lather, no clean. I don&#x27;t even know if I&#x27;ll finish using the bottle.</li>
            <li> I did not like it at all!! It did not clean my hair and did not suds.</li>
            <li> Go away BLACK!&lt;br /&gt;After using this my black hair went away and too many white hairs..so a big NO NO to this.</li>
            <li> Somewhere somebody nicknamed this shampoo &#x27;Go Away Money&#x27; since it didn&#x27;t worked as they expected with gray&#x27;s hair and I bought it knowing it, because several other people mentioned how nice the hair was looking, grays included. And it was all I expected and more, I have been having a bad hair year, depending on the shampoo Im trying (and I have a collection sitting by the tub) either looks to dry or looks to to greasy (and that made it looks really dirty!),  to the point that I&#x27;m always wearing a hat to hide it. And my best feature was my hair! Well, &#x27;Go Away Money\\&quot; has made the miracle and my hair looks again smooth, silky, no frizz, no dirty looking. Love it! My nice hair is back, my year has turn around! I&#x27;m not giving it 5* because I can&#x27;t evaluate yet if it really prevent &amp; reverse gray hair but sure will get more if it keeps making miracles and hopefully would be able to say that my hair is not only looking good but also has recover it natural color! Wouldn&#x27;t that be 2 birds with a stone? Wait and see...</li>
            <li> I liked it but I did not quite know what to expect,however I am satisfied.I expect to order more in the future.</li>
            <li> Sound&#x27;s to good to be true? And why do you suppose that is? It&#x27;s funny because when you first start using it you could almost swear it is actually doing something, but if you take pictures and look closely, you will find that is just you deluding yourself with wishful thinking. Eventually when you do finally come to the realization that it is worthless you are too disgusted and embarrassed to want to come back and admit you were suckered by this con.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially when there are so many reviews telling you... Oh but there are some who claim... Maybe all those others just didn&#x27;t do it right, or they are not the chosen few... Yea keep telling yourself that, if you are looking for false hope, and have money you&#x27;d like to flush down the toilet, then I highly recommend this product for you.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s too premature to give a review coz I just used it for 2 weeks ? ... no change noticed and I think I had more hair on d drain every time I use it.i don&#x27;t experience this with my regular shampoo....I will continue using it till the bottle is empty....let&#x27;s see.</li>
            <li> The jury is still out on this one, we have used one bottle and so far can&#x27;t tell any difference, we will see what happens after bottle number 2.,??</li>
            <li> pure garbage...just thinking of all of the high end nivea, axe brand shampoos i could have bought that actually smell good and clean your hair.  this shampoo is made for cleaning horses, just like the mane n tail brand that claims to get rid of grey too.  save your money folks</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t suds well and left my hair feeling grungy. After a few uses I stopped using it because it just wasn&#x27;t cleaning my hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money - this did not work at all and is very speculative at best as to why it might help.  It was inexpensive so I decided against my own best judgement to buy it.  Also, adding insult to injury, I bought the shampoo and the pills to take.  zero result after taking all three products as directed until finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Snake oil here folks!</li>
            <li> product did not work at all, used every day, no visual changes on my hair. False marketing and false results.</li>
            <li> Seems like a positive product, however I haven&#x27;t used the product enough to know if it works or not... I am hopeful..</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo and the conditioner for about 2 years and I&#x27;m very pleased, no joke, it is a slow process since the hair growing out is where the change comes. I can tell when I stop using it because of running out, my hair starts to turn a little back to the gray tint. I can also see the most difference every time I get a hair cut since the gray is getting trimmed off. Patience is the key I believe and not everything works the same on every person. I use to buy locally in Charlotte, but now by from Amazon for less and free shipping with qty. breaks. People I work with noticed within months when I first started using the shampoo which I use everyday and conditioner maybe every other day mainly for time constraints in the morning, but I never cond. my hair regularly before using this product. One other reviewer mentioned might work better on men that could be true. I&#x27;m not totally gray either mixed with brown, if you are totally grayed might not be product for you, more for someone just turning gray possible. PLEASED HERE HAVE TO HAVE PATIENCE.</li>
            <li> I have been using the shampoo for over a year now and my hair has kept its natural color. People think that I just have good genes because they don&#x27;t see grey hairs. They are there but very few. I will continue using the shampoo. My hair is clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> This product is very inefficient;  I have used it daily and after 1 month I had more grey hair than before.&lt;br /&gt;Simply waste of money.</li>
            <li> I use the shampoo, conditioner and capsules. It has taken three months but I&#x27;m seeing the difference. If you don&#x27;t give the products three months you are wasting your money.</li>
            <li> I use both the shampoo and the conditioner of this brand of product, alternating the days I use them.  I use the shampoo Monday through Friday and the conditioner on the weekends.  The results are positive, at least as good as when I used to use Greisen Formula.  I like the fact that my hair doesn&#x27;t look fake with all dark hair.  It has a mixture of gray and dark hair.  The hair is clearly darker than it was before trying the products.  I was turning almost completely white on the sides but now  there&#x27;s a nice mixture of gray and dark hair.</li>
            <li> I used this with Go Away Gray 60 count pills and just like that product this crap is worthless also.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still Gray as Gray can be and did not see any, any, any improvement after doing this with 2 pills per day for 4 months now.&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;s A Big SCAM !!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it that long, but it does seem to have reduced some of the gray.  And my hairs looks and feels much healthier and shinier. It also feels thicker.  I purchased more.  My hairs looks better with this than it does when I use much more expensive brands of shampoo.</li>
            <li> This product definitely helped with the resistant stragglers that the Go Away Gray capsules missed, but when I used it too frequently (daily), it really dried my hair out.</li>
            <li> I am using \\&quot;Go Away Gray\\&quot; stuff for a while now, at first I thought I see some changes for the batter. The reason was because I find some white hair with black ruts, but I wasn&#x27;t sure. However I&#x27;ve felt stupid for thinking that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After taking this for two months I still can&#x27;t say that I see a big difference but because I hate gray hair with a passion so I feel I need to do something to give it a chance, even though I&#x27;m very skeptical about all the natural hair stuff.</li>
            <li> Did not see significant results.  may be with extended use it might give better reaults.</li>
            <li> Need to use product like this for 6mos to 1 year for results.</li>
            <li> have tried the shampoo several times since purchased...hasn&#x27;t made any change to my hair color....will continue to use....maybe the more I use the more effective it will be</li>
            <li> I am quite disappointed with this. It promises much and delivers nothing.</li>
            <li> This product was great for my hair because it made my hair feel soft and silky.  I like this product a lot. But it didn&#x27;t change my hair color.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really think it would make my gray go away but, it is a nice shampoo and did seem to improve the texture of my hair.  I would buy this product again but not for the claim it makes.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me.  I understand it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone (depends on why you&#x27;re going gray) but... Didn&#x27;t work for me.  leaves a slightly oily feeling after use, too.</li>
            <li> No effect, whatsoever</li>
            <li> I have been using it for four weeks, almost every day, and so far have not seen any improvement.  Perhaps it works on younger people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A. Brunton</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results I am getting from this shampoo.  My hair is getting thicker and healthier looking.  I am very gray and I am starting to see more color coming to my hair. I have chosen to quit coloring my hair and I am getting a lot of good complimens on it.</li>
            <li> I have not used it for long.  I have targeted my vision on certain gray hairs to see if there is any change.  Nothing growing darker at the roots.  I will keep using it for another bottle.  If no results, will just consider myself lucky to have only wasted money on two bottles.</li>
