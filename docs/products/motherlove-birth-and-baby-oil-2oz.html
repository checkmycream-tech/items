            <li>Smells good, very mild and also works for labor which I would have but didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It is very, very lightly scented- not at all overwhelming.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m glad it is multi-use</li>
            <li>I really do love Motherlove and their products.</li>
            <li>but since then, I use it for SO MANY things.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>because it smells better.)</li>
            <li>I like this oil way better than</li>
            <li>I always like products that I can get more than one use out of.  </li>
            <li>I really love this birth and baby oil for both baby and me.</li>
            <li>Lovely calming scent too.</li>
            <li>It spreads easily.</li>
            <li>It smells great and leaves her super soft and not too oily.</li>
            <li>Not as much smell as I would have liked</li>
            <li>If I need a quick change I use this oil because it&#x27;s so easy to spread around.</li>
            <li>It has a light, pleasant smell as well that my son actually didn&#x27;t mind having on him . . .</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, so you don&#x27;t have an oily baby.</li>
            <li>I loved using it on my stretching belly, shrinking belly, for perineal massage, for baby massage, on baby&#x27;s scalp to prevent cradle cap and help with dry scalp, etc, etc.  </li>
            <li>It works great after her baths, for little baby massages, as her diaper &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; whenever I change her, on her cradle cap, etc.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, she sleeps so well after a bath/shower following this product and a massage, though it says it&#x27;s for cradle cap too, in my opinion it&#x27;s alright.</li>
            <li>If the baby is calm I will use a petroleum jelly alternative instead(Just</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s useful for &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; times</li>
            <li>Works amazing on dry skin even eczema on you and Baby!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s organic, smells wonderful, but not overpowering, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It really works for Mom during birth!</li>
            <li>any powder/corn starch(my husband tried this at first.</li>
            <li>is more then enough, it lasts forever.  </li>
            <li>She has sensitive skin and some of the most well known brands known to be sensitive to babies’ skin</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>This oil lasts much longer than any baby or olive oil</li>
            <li>I also used it for peeinial massage during my water birth it lasts very well</li>
            <li>The oil doesn&#x27;t really have an odor</li>
            <li>and I tried breastmilk and coconut oil and neither really helped, they just hid it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend !</li>
            <li>i used it afterwards to moisturize my newborns skin and it worked very well.</li>
            <li>not so with many other baby lotions.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t really need this for myself because I ended up having c-section, BUT it works great on cradle cap.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>One little jar, many uses.  </li>
            <li>You will definitely get your money&#x27;s worth out of this one.</li>
            <li>Bought for my daughter and new grandbaby.</li>
            <li>Like many people here, I was skeptical that I needed this oil, and I originally got it for a home birth.</li>
            <li>and well the girls are growing as I near the end of my pregnancy.</li>
            <li>I rub this on my baby boy every evening after his bath, it keeps his skin so soft &amp; def</li>
            <li>I was reluctant to purchase this oil at first because it was expenzive for a small amount, but (1) it is worth the expense, and (2) 2 oz.</li>
            <li>She uses it whenever small bumps appear on that cute little baby face and the bumps disappear almost immediately.</li>

            <li> She uses it whenever small bumps appear on that cute little baby face and the bumps disappear almost immediately.</li>
            <li> This product is described to contain Lavender flowers in Apricot and Grapeseed oil, and can help relieve dry skin and clear up eczema, so I bought it for my 5-month-old baby who has very dry skin due to eczema.</li>
            <li> I use it on my newborn for that dry newborn peely skin.</li>
            <li> Anyway, since this product got 5-star reviews, I told myself it may work well for dry skin</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of use it did not relieve my baby dry skin at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only moisturizer I&#x27;ve used for my little lady.</li>
            <li> Smell is strong and unpleasant.</li>
            <li> One little squirt goes a LONG way.  </li>
            <li> One small dollop (about 1/4 dime size) will cover the entire baby.</li>
            <li> About chocked the baby out) or other diaper cream.</li>
            <li> I use this on my nipples as well as down south</li>
            <li> but I do use it for infant massage and as a massage oil for my little girl.  </li>
            <li> so it wasn&#x27;t a wasted purchase.</li>
            <li> However, I was disappointed when I got this baby oil  and found it only contains apricot oil and lavender flower, no grapeseed oil, and it is indicated for labor, infant massage and cradle cap, no dry skin.</li>
            <li> I take the oil when I&#x27;m out and about because it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue behind like my other one does.</li>
            <li> I ended up hardly using it(and turns out I didn&#x27;t need it for that anyway).</li>
            <li> It is cold</li>
            <li> My daughters scalp ended up getting really bad</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Worked great for massages and cradle cap.</li>
            <li> Love this oil-- gentle scent, perfect for my baby!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as perineal oil for my home birth. However, it wasn&#x27;t needed. So, I&#x27;m glad it is multi-use so it wasn&#x27;t a wasted purchase. I use it on my newborn for that dry newborn peely skin. It works really well. It spreads easily. It absorbs quickly, so you don&#x27;t have an oily baby. It doesn&#x27;t stain clothing. It is very, very lightly scented- not at all overwhelming. The bottle is going to last forever, though. One small dollop (about 1/4 dime size) will cover the entire baby.</li>
            <li> I used everything on my infant&#x27;s cradle cap. This and earth mama angel baby soap was the only thing that kept it cleared up. This oil lasts much longer than any baby or olive oil I&#x27;ve used. I also used it for peeinial massage during my water birth it lasts very well</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t use on perineum but a few times &amp; ended up having a c-section so can&#x27;t attest to this property of the oil. However, we noticed some overall redness on newborn&#x27;s scalp thinking might be start of cradle&#x27;s cap. We applied this once and was GONE! The oil doesn&#x27;t really have an odor either..worth a try for any scalp rashes, etc.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and is great for cradle cap, infant massages, and dry spots.  It&#x27;s made in the USA and organic... also great.  I really do love Motherlove and their products. All are wonderful.</li>
            <li> Like many people here, I was skeptical that I needed this oil, and I originally got it for a home birth. I have no idea if the midwives used it then, but since then, I use it for SO MANY things. It&#x27;s the only moisturizer I&#x27;ve used for my little lady. It works great after her baths, for little baby massages, as her diaper &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; whenever I change her, on her cradle cap, etc. etc. bonus, it&#x27;s useful for &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; times too whenever you&#x27;re up to it. it&#x27;s organic, smells wonderful, but not overpowering, and a little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve used it every day since she was born for all the things I mentioned above, and only used 3 bottles in 5 months.</li>
            <li> This is for external use only!&lt;br /&gt;While it is promoted for &amp;#34;perineal massage&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It is cold and well the girls are growing as I near the end of my pregnancy. I use this on my nipples as well as down south (prepare for labor)  I love the smell and makes my skin feel great.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, she sleeps so well after a bath/shower following this product and a massage, though it says it&#x27;s for cradle cap too, in my opinion it&#x27;s alright. I use it to soothe her scalp but wouldn&#x27;t recommend for treating. Overall, I purchased this to give baby massages after bath. Smells good, very mild and also works for labor which I would have but didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t really need this for myself because I ended up having c-section, BUT it works great on cradle cap. My daughters scalp ended up getting really bad and I tried breastmilk and coconut oil and neither really helped, they just hid it. When I started putting this on her scalp after every bath at night her cradle cap started disappearing, now it&#x27;s almost gone. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> It really works for Mom during birth! Give it a try, you&#x27;ll be happy you did! Loved it, works for both!</li>
            <li> I bought this initially to help stretch my perineum during labor. I ended up hardly using it(and turns out I didn&#x27;t need it for that anyway). So now I am using it when I change my baby&#x27;s diaper.  If I need a quick change I use this oil because it&#x27;s so easy to spread around. If the baby is calm I will use a petroleum jelly alternative instead(Just because it smells better.) I take the oil when I&#x27;m out and about because it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue behind like my other one does. I like this oil way better than any powder/corn starch(my husband tried this at first. About chocked the baby out) or other diaper cream.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t judge it as birth oil because I received it the day after I delivered but I use it for my baby&#x27;s cradle cap and to massage her and I like it a lot. It smells great and leaves her super soft and not too oily.</li>
            <li> I rub this on my baby boy every evening after his bath, it keeps his skin so soft &amp; def helps with the sleep!</li>
            <li> Smell is strong and unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Wonderful oil for mother and baby.  It is apricot oil infused with lavender flowers.  The smell is to die for.  Its excellent for baby massage and for the birthing process.</li>
            <li> This product is described to contain Lavender flowers in Apricot and Grapeseed oil, and can help relieve dry skin and clear up eczema, so I bought it for my 5-month-old baby who has very dry skin due to eczema. However, I was disappointed when I got this baby oil  and found it only contains apricot oil and lavender flower, no grapeseed oil, and it is indicated for labor, infant massage and cradle cap, no dry skin. Anyway, since this product got 5-star reviews, I told myself it may work well for dry skin and then I tried it for my baby twice a day. After 3 weeks of use it did not relieve my baby dry skin at all. I was upset and finally gave up.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to using this product in labour, but I do use it for baby massages, especially for her feet. The lavendar smell is wonderful, but not too powerful.</li>
            <li> I always like products that I can get more than one use out of.  I was reluctant to purchase this oil at first because it was expenzive for a small amount, but (1) it is worth the expense, and (2) 2 oz. is more then enough, it lasts forever.  I loved using it on my stretching belly, shrinking belly, for perineal massage, for baby massage, on baby&#x27;s scalp to prevent cradle cap and help with dry scalp, etc, etc.  One little jar, many uses.  It has a light, pleasant smell as well that my son actually didn&#x27;t mind having on him . . . not so with many other baby lotions.  One little squirt goes a LONG way.  You will definitely get your money&#x27;s worth out of this one.</li>
            <li> I really love this birth and baby oil for both baby and me. Lovely calming scent too. Highly recommend !</li>
            <li> my baby had rash however when baby use this product everything perfect! good for baby !!!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a big motherlove fan, and this product is no exception!  it smells so great, and i used it while in labor and didnt tear (i don&#x27;t know if this is why, but i&#x27;m sure it didn&#x27;t hurt!).  i used it afterwards to moisturize my newborns skin and it worked very well.</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter and new grandbaby.She uses it whenever small bumps appear on that cute little baby face and the bumps disappear almost immediately. Uses in baby&#x27;s hair wonderful smell and no cradle cap..highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Great product.  I didn’t use the oil during labor but I do use it for infant massage and as a massage oil for my little girl.  She has sensitive skin and some of the most well known brands known to be sensitive to babies’ skin break her out in a rash.  Plus the lavender relaxes her for bedtime.</li>
            <li> This oil is a godsend! Works amazing on dry skin even eczema on you and Baby! It also works amazing while in labor to help loosen area&#x27;s up so you don&#x27;t rip!</li>
            <li> Not as much smell as I would have liked, however this is for a baby</li>
