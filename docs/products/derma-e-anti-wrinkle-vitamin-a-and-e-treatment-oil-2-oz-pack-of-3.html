    <ol>
            <li>I have had very good luck purchasing this product from Amazon</li>
            <li>Inexpensive and very good piece for my cream.</li>
            <li>It is great for a lot of things on too.</li>
            <li>I use it nightly and get great results.</li>
            <li>I am happy to see you can get 3 bottles at a time on this site!&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I thought this oil would clog my pores and create pimples but, surprisingly, it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I am almost 75 yrs of age and people tell me how good I look</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>Just wanted a good moisturizing solution</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!!!</li>
            <li>One week and my skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li>Vitamin A &amp; E are supposed to be effective for these things.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I think this is very important now as I have lost many good oils not doing so.  </li>
            <li>I know it wasn&#x27;t any $30, so you might want to look for a better deal.</li>
            <li>If the bottles were made from plastic and had either a shaker or roll on top to make application easier</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to be better.  </li>
            <li>I think that if you exfoliate and use chemical peels this products claims are 100 percent satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I swear I look five years better.</li>
            <li>If you want fragrance, mix your favorite body lotion for scent.</li>
            <li>On top of that my acne is coming out with no digging.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say this worked better for me both for moisturizing and for acne management, and I&#x27;m going to keep using it.</li>
            <li>also love this oil for my face.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m extremely happy with my unexpected results!</li>
            <li>Firstly, it makes a great moisturizer because, not only does it soften skin, it leaves a very nice youthful shine and glow.</li>
            <li>Plus for an oil its moisturizes incredibly well at it actually penetrates the pores.  </li>
            <li>my packaging was fine and all 3 bottles arrived in tact.</li>
            <li>Well, I just survived my first Minnesota winter, and thanks to this oil, my skin did great.</li>
            <li>The oil absorbs quickly and is relatively easy to apply from the bottle.  </li>
            <li>However, it does have the anti-aging benefit of making skin look very moist and healthy.</li>
            <li>I really love this gentle refining Vitamin A oil.</li>
            <li>so I know its true.  </li>
            <li>It works great to easily remove mascara, eye-liner and eye shadow without excessive rubbing and pulling of the skin.</li>
            <li>I have 2 more old scars on my face to fade</li>
            <li>nice and simple with no preservative.</li>
            <li>I could give this product 5 stars \\&quot;just\\&quot; for being cruelty-free...but there are actually a lot more reasons to like it.</li>
            <li>It is highly effective on dry areas and it is gentle.  </li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t notice any difference in that regard.</li>
            <li>I use this oil morning and at night and it has softened my face and it feels much smother as well.</li>
            <li>Cover with band aid or liquid band aid and it will heal fast.</li>
            <li>(I acted fast,  </li>
            <li>I bought a bottle for 4 bucks at my local natural produce &amp; goods store, not really expecting much, assuming it could possibly be a good moisturizing agent for my skin.</li>
            <li>I usually just use coconut oil or shea butter but felt I needed something a little more consistent and would penetrate and have some &amp;#34;staying power&amp;#34; for lack of a better description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazon replaced it with another complete order (Thanks Amazon).  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t take more than a few days to get it.</li>
            <li>Been using for 3 weeks nothing noticeable in fine line reduction, puffiness or dark spots area.</li>
            <li>Other than moisturizing, I have not seen any effect regarding wrinkles; however, I am young and Asian and so I don&#x27;t have so many at this time.</li>
            <li>To clear up my face for YEARS.  </li>
            <li>If you have a scratch or open skin, clean with peroxide then pat dry</li>
            <li>I applied it to my face before going outside nearly every time I was going to spend any length of time out in the sub-zero temperatures, and I think it really helped to keep my skin from drying out.</li>
            <li>And some of those old scars have been with me for a while</li>
            <li>I cover my old scars with makeup...</li>
            <li>So I thought that if the oil had worked so well for my surgery scar ... Why not try it on my old acne scars that are scattered all over my face.</li>
            <li>Completely life changing for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the price of this product my skin is soft and I will continue to use up the 3 bottles.</li>
            <li>and my skin is so soft.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this item as a facial moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>am 30 years old and have acne-prone, sensitive and oily skin.  </li>
            <li>The climate is extremely dry and hot in the summer.</li>
            <li>Despite how much I like it, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth $30.</li>
            <li>only 31.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what it&#x27;s worth, I switched to this after years of using Est√©e Lauder&#x27;s DayWear Plus, which is vastly more expensive.</li>
            <li>I live in the Sierra foothills in central California.</li>
            <li>Immediately as I applied a small half of a dime size amount, dotted all across my face, smoothening it out, it felt like some kind of restoration treatment.</li>
            <li>I also believe it helps clear up and prevent acne, but that might be partly thanks to other changes I&#x27;ve made.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and tend to break out with traditional moisturizers.</li>
            <li>You can mix with Vit E and apply directly to skin or do the same by itself.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m only 32 years old</li>

            <li> You only need a very small amount and it leaves your face feeling very soft.  </li>
            <li> the oil penetrated effortlessly into my skin like some melted butter soaked into dry brittle bread, softening it up and making it supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!!! I took a chance of buying this product because of the other reviews but my surgeon suggested that I try vitamin A &amp; E oil into my regime.  I&#x27;ve had a laparotomy and have an 8 inch scar down my abdomen.  I&#x27;ve combined the usage of the A&amp;E oil with Mederma and it has done wonders for my scarring from my surgery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;ve always struggled with stubborn scars either from acne and just being a tomboy, when I was younger. And some of those old scars have been with me for a while and now I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s. I cover my old scars with makeup... A lot of makeup. So I thought that if the oil had worked so well for my surgery scar ... Why not try it on my old acne scars that are scattered all over my face. BOOM!!! I used the oil on my face for 2 weeks and my skin is glowing!  I. Have. Tried. Everything. To clear up my face for YEARS.  And I look forward to days that I don&#x27;t have to hide behind a coat of makeup everyday.  I have 2 more old scars on my face to fade and I&#x27;m extremely happy with my unexpected results! Completely life changing for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and btw- my packaging was fine and all 3 bottles arrived in tact.</li>
            <li> I could give this product 5 stars \\&quot;just\\&quot; for being cruelty-free...but there are actually a lot more reasons to like it. Firstly, it makes a great moisturizer because, not only does it soften skin, it leaves a very nice youthful shine and glow. It IS an oil but, oddly enough, it doesn&#x27;t feel excessively oily on the face. I wear it under other creams and my foundation make-up. (Have to be on the look-out though...if you close your eyes, it can tranfer mascara to under eye area) I thought this oil would clog my pores and create pimples but, surprisingly, it doesn&#x27;t. It works great to easily remove mascara, eye-liner and eye shadow without excessive rubbing and pulling of the skin. I also wear it at night and it doesn&#x27;t make my face stick to the pillow like some oils and creams do. I bought it on sale at a local healthfood store and although I don&#x27;t remember what I paid for it,  I know it wasn&#x27;t any $30, so you might want to look for a better deal. Despite how much I like it, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth $30. I bought it to reduce the signs of aging (wrinkles, bags, sags) and I really don&#x27;t notice any difference in that regard. However, it does have the anti-aging benefit of making skin look very moist and healthy. I would definitely buy it again...if under $30.</li>
            <li> I bought a set of three.&lt;br /&gt;When we opened the package one was broken.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was not secure enogh for this product as the bottles spilled all over the rest of the items, because it as broken.</li>
            <li> I really love this gentle refining Vitamin A oil. I am on my second bottle.  I live in the Sierra foothills in central California. The climate is extremely dry and hot in the summer. I use this oil morning and at night and it has softened my face and it feels much smother as well.</li>
            <li> Leaves the skin feeling soft and hydrated, just like any other oil I used (almond oil, argan oil, olive oil), but it is inefficient as a wrinkle treatment. I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and tend to break out with traditional moisturizers. I apply this at night after washing my face and with in three days of using it my coworkers were asking me what gave my skin such a healthy glow (this is the secret!)</li>
            <li> Ordered these to help out with some skin irritation that one of my kids was having.  It made an immediate improvement to his condition and we apply it every day.  The oil absorbs quickly and is relatively easy to apply from the bottle.  The bottles are made of glass and one broken during shipment due to poor packaging.  Amazon replaced it with another complete order (Thanks Amazon).  If the bottles were made from plastic and had either a shaker or roll on top to make application easier it would be 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The bottle was not sealed and the consistency of the product was not the same as store bought. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Been using for 3 weeks nothing noticeable in fine line reduction, puffiness or dark spots area. There is not even a tinge from the Vit A when applied, so it&#x27;s not working on the skin to remove the dead skin as Vit A does.  (retin A) Possibly becuase it has Vit E in it.  Reading reivews I was expecting it to be better.  For the price of this product my skin is soft and I will continue to use up the 3 bottles. May try another product before reordering for comparison</li>
            <li> This has done wonders for my skin!  I had started getting stretch marks and with a few drops of this added to my nightly lotion, they turned from angry &#x27;tiger stripes&#x27; to fine silvery lines that I hardly notice at all.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001ET6XT8 derma e Vitamin A with E Wrinkle Treatment Oil, 2 fl oz (60 ml) (Pack of 3)]] I&#x27;ve had permanent makeup since 2008 and started using derma e Vitamin A with E wrinkle treatment since then. It was recommended by the permanent makeup lady.  Now had plastic surgery on my eyelids and still using A and E. I wish I would have known about A and E before. I am almost 75 yrs of age and people tell me how good I look and my skin is so soft.  I have had very good luck purchasing this product from Amazon and it doesn&#x27;t take more than a few days to get it.</li>
            <li> The product has no smell so it can be used with scented lotions. It does not make you feel &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;, but it still moisturizes. The only annoying is that it is hard to get out of the bottle without spilling a little down the side.</li>
            <li> I think that if you exfoliate and use chemical peels this products claims are 100 percent satisfied.  I am currently use it retin a and on the days I don&#x27;t when my skin is just dried out and haggard from the exhaustion, I apply this and it glows and it looks plump!  I swear I look five years better. Plus for an oil its moisturizes incredibly well at it actually penetrates the pores.  this is the second time so I know its true.  I keep it in the refrigerator and I think this is very important now as I have lost many good oils not doing so.  Also Derma e is on of the few companies I trust for consistency of quality and purity all around at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. You can mix with Vit E and apply directly to skin or do the same by itself. My secret is Vit E, Vit A oils ! Aloe cream, and glycerin mixed in a plastic bottle. If you want fragrance, mix your favorite body lotion for scent. You can use for face, body, elbows, knees, etc. makes a big difference. It is the healing oil. You should also take internal Vit A and Vit E tabs. It is great for a lot of things on too. Secret!! If you have a scratch or open skin, clean with peroxide then pat dry; stick a pin in Vit A capsule (gel cap) and squeeze on wound. Cover with band aid or liquid band aid and it will heal fast. Approx 2 days.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle for 4 bucks at my local natural produce &amp; goods store, not really expecting much, assuming it could possibly be a good moisturizing agent for my skin. I usually just use coconut oil or shea butter but felt I needed something a little more consistent and would penetrate and have some &amp;#34;staying power&amp;#34; for lack of a better description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whoa!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a shower last night, dried my face thoroughly and had forgotten to put it on. Immediately as I applied a small half of a dime size amount, dotted all across my face, smoothening it out, it felt like some kind of restoration treatment. the oil penetrated effortlessly into my skin like some melted butter soaked into dry brittle bread, softening it up and making it supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m won over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only 32 years old btw and don&#x27;t have any wrinkles. Just wanted a good moisturizing solution and I&#x27;ve lucked up.</li>
            <li> My adult cystic acne sucks. I decided to try and pop it and of course bleeding, infection, ugliness. This wound would have taken a year to correct. Two days and I could walk around without a band aide. One week and my skin looks amazing. Crazy. Coupled with 3200 mg of fish oil and constantly putting the vitamin oil topically. I am healed. On top of that my acne is coming out with no digging. Get this use it and see what I see.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil as a moisturizer several times a day for about 8 months now. I have sensitive, acne-prone, dry skin, and I always struggle with painful and visible dryness in the winter (flaking- yuck!) Well, I just survived my first Minnesota winter, and thanks to this oil, my skin did great. I applied it to my face before going outside nearly every time I was going to spend any length of time out in the sub-zero temperatures, and I think it really helped to keep my skin from drying out. It feels so soothing when you put it on, and never leaves my face feeling dry and tight after washing. I also believe it helps clear up and prevent acne, but that might be partly thanks to other changes I&#x27;ve made. Also, I can&#x27;t speak to its anti-wrinkle powers, as I&#x27;m only 31.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what it&#x27;s worth, I switched to this after years of using Est√©e Lauder&#x27;s DayWear Plus, which is vastly more expensive. I&#x27;d say this worked better for me both for moisturizing and for acne management, and I&#x27;m going to keep using it.</li>
            <li> also love this oil for my face. nice and simple with no preservative. it gets off the sun spots.</li>
            <li> You only need a very small amount and it leaves your face feeling very soft.  I use it nightly and get great results.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this item as a facial moisturizer.  One 2 ounce bottle lasted me about 4 months.  I originally purchased this at CVS and went to get another and was so disappointed when I was told they no longer carried it.  I am happy to see you can get 3 bottles at a time on this site!&lt;br /&gt;For me it erased my sun spots (I acted fast,  I&#x27;ve only started getting then in the last 6 years),&lt;br /&gt;Evened out my skin tone,&lt;br /&gt;Reduced reddness,&lt;br /&gt;Caused my skin to be less irritated,&lt;br /&gt;Softened AND conditioned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps some people!</li>
            <li> I purchased this hoping it would help with post acne hypermigmentation, in addition to preventing wrinkles etc.  Vitamin A &amp; E are supposed to be effective for these things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 30 years old and have acne-prone, sensitive and oily skin.  I also have eczema on my face which is why I did not mind that it is designed for dry skin.  It is a very dense oil and a little bit goes a long way.  However, I believe it can clog pores so I use it sparingly.  It is highly effective on dry areas and it is gentle.  I even dab it on my eyelids and under eye area as an eye treatment and it doesn&#x27;t sting and cured my eczema there such that I don&#x27;t have to use my prescription cream anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it sparingly on my face, but use it liberally on my neck which doesn&#x27;t have the same issues.  It seems to work well in moisturizing here.  Other than moisturizing, I have not seen any effect regarding wrinkles; however, I am young and Asian and so I don&#x27;t have so many at this time.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my mom and we added to the coconut oil and using it as my day cream. Inexpensive and very good piece for my cream. Good stuff.</li>
