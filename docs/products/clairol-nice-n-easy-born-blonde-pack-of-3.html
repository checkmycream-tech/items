    <ol>
            <li>The customer support provided by Clairol is excellent.  </li>
            <li>I have used this every 6 weeks for about 8 years with great results.  </li>
            <li>I was happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This product promises not to turn hair copper/yellow, reviews sounded great...</li>
            <li>This hair color is so great.</li>
            <li>I have always had great results with great compliments.</li>
            <li>According to my wife, great stuff.  </li>
            <li>It worked well and my hair feels as good as it did before.  </li>
            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>My test strands (yes, plural) came out good.</li>
            <li>I was very satisfied with this purchase and the product itself.  </li>
            <li>and she was very pleased with application and results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is the best for a great natural looking hair</li>
            <li>.. go ahead at your own risk.o..</li>
            <li>go ahead at your own risk.</li>
            <li>Oh, make sure to do the strand test beforehand.</li>
            <li>Would \\&quot;blue\\&quot; be even better than \\&quot;ash\\&quot;?</li>
            <li>I now have a magnificent, healthy blonde color with lots of radiance and dimension.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>no problems arrived okay.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Having just recently started to color my hair by myself after years of professional colorists, I was very happy that this was easy to do with great results.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft, and I&#x27;m happy with the color.</li>
            <li>I used this according to the instructions (90 minutes developing time), and overall was VERY pleased with the results!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still getting used to it and deciding whether I like it this light.</li>
            <li>Maybe with so light a shade</li>
            <li>did a test strip first, and it turned out ok.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is horrendous and MUST be put on either in a well-ventilated room (or even out doors, lol), but the color lift combined with the minimal damage is completely worth it if you are going blonde on your own!</li>
            <li>But I was prepared for that with my box of cool ash blonde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All she had to do was put in a cool violet undertoned</li>
            <li>I did complete the strand test before a full head application more to make sure my hair was healthy enough for the process.</li>
            <li>As long as I have that \\&quot;ash\\&quot; cooling agent, I&#x27;m in good shape.</li>
            <li>I apply and then rinse out as quickly as possible to get a more naturel look, as it is strong for my once-blond, now browning hair.</li>
            <li>(I do not recommend 40, because your hair can possibly fall out into mush, but, again, at your own risk.)</li>
            <li>This color is definitely not a \\&quot;works with your own tones and highlights\\&quot; sort of color.</li>
            <li>I am pretty excited to be able to blonde myself without spending $200 at the salon</li>
            <li>It is a box mix, a robber, and it sucks, just go to the local hair academy to get a good deal and a good result (if your on a budget)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is also great for blondes to achieve the lightest, whitest, blonde.&lt;br /&gt;Timing is essential for the blonde you want to be.</li>
            <li>I wanted to look amazing for my husband&#x27;s military graduation.</li>
            <li>The first time was bleaching products that were bought seperately.  </li>
            <li>to find the exact shade I wanted.</li>
            <li>If you cannot afford a pro, or know a friend/family member that is one (which is the BEST advice to give) - Go to Sally&#x27;s or any local public beauty supply store &amp; pick up blue powder bleach, &amp; 30 volume developer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I have so many grays these days, I decided to go with an ash blonde.</li>
            <li>Pretty aggravating.</li>
            <li>I had first used a hair color stripper</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s bleach) but not fried to a crisp or unmanageable.</li>
            <li>and I am going to have to spend all day today fixing this mess and spending more money!</li>
            <li>I ended up with a fairly even and very platinum shade, which is noticeably lighter than my usual color.</li>
            <li>My hair is a hideous light yellow.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure I could have done this part on my own for less money, but I was feeling a little stressed and needed the reassurance from a pro.</li>
            <li>I applied a cool blonde permanent color to tone it to a wearable state.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li>I left it on for the full 90 minutes.</li>
            <li>it if you want a more white blonde rather than yellow,&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just know that toning or a second coloring is in your future... :)</li>
            <li>you have to be realistic about stuff like this.</li>
            <li>I have naturally strawberry blonde/ light red hair.</li>
            <li>I have a short bob that ends just about my chin, if you have longer hair it might be easier with a friend to make sure the back is coated.</li>
            <li>My roots are super yellow.</li>
            <li>If your hair is black/brown-jet black or just black, I donot recomend going platinum at your own, most pro&#x27;s won&#x27;t even touch your hair because it can be a big liability.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Lightest Ash or Extra Light Ash blonde shades for years and always had good luck with them, but I was tired of waiting for my shades to go on sale, and I was hoping to find a bulk price here on Amazon that would be the equivalent of getting them on sale while saving me a trip to the store.</li>
            <li>I was intrigued by the Ultra Blue, because I have a Medium Brown color naturally that has underlying red tones, but otherwise takes easily to color.</li>
            <li>Those items worked, but left my hair very, very damaged...dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li>story short - don&#x27;t expect to buy a box kit claiming it to magically turn your hair white blonde.</li>
            <li>It is very useful for dark hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Certainly not the results pictured on box, certainly not what reviews lead you expect, and certainly nothing even a little acceptable. :P  </li>
            <li>Natural Instincts is what they suggest and is what I prefer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;especially if your natural hair is brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You will have to get professional help/</li>
            <li>professional bleach/volume/toner from a BEAUTY SUPPLY STORE.</li>
            <li>I am a professional stylist/colorist.</li>
            <li>My natural color is medium ashy blonde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, but haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores, lately.  </li>
            <li>My hair as a whole came out yellow.</li>
            <li>I wanted to dye my hair blonde (as pictured with product) to go with a turquoise color (the turquoise would have been more emerald green</li>
            <li>If you have super dark hair go with MAXI.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, if your goal is cool blonde or platinum as the product promises, just know that you will need to either tone your hair, or color with a blonde that gives you the color/tone you actually want.</li>
            <li>I left it on for the full 90 minutes as expected and the hair was not shriveled or gummy (terrified of this outcome by the by).</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t recommend that either, too much box dye on hair will also dry it out.)</li>
            <li>I wanted a cooler, more champange blonde, so I deep conditioned my hair a few days and then toned it...and voila!</li>
            <li>Unless you are a natural blonde, and if that even works, going lighter through using a box kit WILL not work.</li>
            <li>My very dark blond hair was lightened nicely to a very light yellow blonde color, with minimal (if any) damage.</li>
            <li>If your are a natural (or dyed) brunette/black/red haired, do not expect to buy a box (like this one) and expect it to turn your hair bleached blonde white.</li>

            <li> this did dry my hair out</li>
            <li> I decided to try out Born Blonde to get the overly dark brown, semi permanent color, out of my hair, since it wouldn&#x27;t wash out.  </li>
            <li> My sister is buying me a dark blonde.</li>
            <li> Only 30 volume can if your hair is dark to begin with.</li>
            <li> Especially if it is dyed dark.</li>
            <li> My hair was a very dark blonde before using this product, with some gray and growing out blond highlights in the front.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Clearly this product is for people who have a harder time getting their hair to take color than mine.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a different ball game, but it left me with yellow tones that I didn&#x27;t expect from a \\&quot;blue\\&quot; haircolor.</li>
            <li> Not as harsh as the Blonde Brilliance.</li>
            <li> Going dark from a box is okay, but going lighter is .99% of the time is impossible.</li>
            <li> When I saw this due at Walmart I thought I&#x27;d found my color.</li>
            <li> My main complaint is that the \\&quot;blue\\&quot; tones didn&#x27;t seem to work as well as my usual \\&quot;ash\\&quot; tones in removing brassiness.</li>
            <li> Despite careful mixing and application (by a licensed beautician) there were several places that remained dark and had to be processed twice!!!  </li>
            <li> a dark purple/red.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;to cut down on damage.</li>
            <li> I mean YELLOW.</li>
            <li> What a waste of $10!</li>
            <li> I expected it to smell bad, but I only caught a whiff once or twice that made my eyes sting a bit.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read the negative reviews until it was already on my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I seriously almost had a panic attack.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have to strip the dye out of your hair and keep bleaching it until your hair gets to a pale yellow stage (with the help of using some toners with a PURPLE base to cancel out the red/orange tones you&#x27;ll get after bleaching.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &amp; bleach will too.&lt;br /&gt;Now - if your roots just needs touch - ups, and your roots are close to blonde as it is, then using a box kit isn&#x27;t bad, if your hair will lift..</li>
            <li> Not a good product.</li>
            <li> Color can&#x27;t lift color, nor can weak bleach (under 10 - 20</li>
            <li> She has wavy thin bleach hair</li>
            <li> Well, I was wrong.</li>
            <li> at times turned my hair crazy colors.</li>
            <li> crap I said, now what.</li>
            <li> VERY UNHAPPY!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was very satisfied with this purchase and the product itself.  Having just recently started to color my hair by myself after years of professional colorists, I was very happy that this was easy to do with great results.  The customer support provided by Clairol is excellent.  The price I paid for the product was cheaper than any chain pharmacy.  The product arrived on time.</li>
            <li> This is only the second time I have used a bleach type hair color remover.  The first time was bleaching products that were bought seperately.  Those items worked, but left my hair very, very damaged...dry and brittle.  I decided to try out Born Blonde to get the overly dark brown, semi permanent color, out of my hair, since it wouldn&#x27;t wash out.  It worked well and my hair feels as good as it did before.  I did do alot of reading up on this product, before I decided to purchase it.  One mistake, I often saw, was that women often thought this was a dye.  It is just a color remover.  If you like the color you end up with, you can just use it.  But, I am way too blonde and have to get some darker blonde dye...Natural Instincts is what they suggest and is what I prefer.  I would not hesitate to use this product, again.  Oh, make sure to do the strand test beforehand.</li>
            <li> I have used this every 6 weeks for about 8 years with great results.  I apply and then rinse out as quickly as possible to get a more naturel look, as it is strong for my once-blond, now browning hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using Born Blonde for over 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;It is the best for a great natural looking hair color.&lt;br /&gt;It is the lightest of the 3 Born Blonde lighteners.&lt;br /&gt;However, is is rough on fragile hair, damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a hair repair treatment before and after use&lt;br /&gt;to cut down on damage. Born Blonde Ultra is the next&lt;br /&gt;highest concentrate. It helps eliminate brassiness.&lt;br /&gt;Use it if you want a more white blonde rather than yellow,&lt;br /&gt;especially if your natural hair is brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, there is the Maxi Blonde. It is very useful for dark hair.&lt;br /&gt;It is also great for blondes to achieve the lightest, whitest, blonde.&lt;br /&gt;Timing is essential for the blonde you want to be. It took me many&lt;br /&gt;applications to find the exact shade I wanted.</li>
            <li> I have dark blonde hair that I had been dying a medium blonde. When I saw this due at Walmart I thought I&#x27;d found my color. Well, I was wrong. I didn&#x27;t read the negative reviews until it was already on my hair.&lt;br /&gt; I kept it on for an 80 minutes. My hair is a hideous light yellow. I seriously almost had a panic attack. My sister is buying me a dark blonde. Hopefully my hair doesnt fall out. I wanted to look amazing for my husband&#x27;s military graduation. $&amp;!?</li>
            <li> If your are a natural (or dyed) brunette/black/red haired, do not expect to buy a box (like this one) and expect it to turn your hair bleached blonde white. IT WILL NOT. You will have to get professional help/professional bleach/volume/toner from a BEAUTY SUPPLY STORE. Color cannot lift color. Only 30 volume can if your hair is dark to begin with. Especially if it is dyed dark. Unless you are a natural blonde, and if that even works, going lighter through using a box kit WILL not work. I am a professional stylist/colorist. Going dark from a box is okay, but going lighter is .99% of the time is impossible. The volume that comes in these at home bleaching kits is only up to 10 volume, that will not lift the color out of your hair enough to turn it white blonde. If you cannot afford a pro, or know a friend/family member that is one (which is the BEST advice to give) - Go to Sally&#x27;s or any local public beauty supply store &amp; pick up blue powder bleach, &amp; 30 volume developer. (I do not recommend 40, because your hair can possibly fall out into mush, but, again, at your own risk.) If your hair is black/brown-jet black or just black, I donot recomend going platinum at your own, most pro&#x27;s won&#x27;t even touch your hair because it can be a big liability. You&#x27;ll have to strip the dye out of your hair and keep bleaching it until your hair gets to a pale yellow stage (with the help of using some toners with a PURPLE base to cancel out the red/orange tones you&#x27;ll get after bleaching.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short - don&#x27;t expect to buy a box kit claiming it to magically turn your hair white blonde. Color can&#x27;t lift color, nor can weak bleach (under 10 - 20 vol.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your going darker, then go nuts with box dye if you want. (I don&#x27;t recommend that either, too much box dye on hair will also dry it out.) &amp; bleach will too.&lt;br /&gt;Now - if your roots just needs touch - ups, and your roots are close to blonde as it is, then using a box kit isn&#x27;t bad, if your hair will lift..&lt;br /&gt;So.. go ahead at your own risk.o.. go ahead at your own risk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Lightest Ash or Extra Light Ash blonde shades for years and always had good luck with them, but I was tired of waiting for my shades to go on sale, and I was hoping to find a bulk price here on Amazon that would be the equivalent of getting them on sale while saving me a trip to the store. I was intrigued by the Ultra Blue, because I have a Medium Brown color naturally that has underlying red tones, but otherwise takes easily to color. As long as I have that \\&quot;ash\\&quot; cooling agent, I&#x27;m in good shape. Would \\&quot;blue\\&quot; be even better than \\&quot;ash\\&quot;? I decided to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearly this product is for people who have a harder time getting their hair to take color than mine. This color is definitely not a \\&quot;works with your own tones and highlights\\&quot; sort of color. I ended up with a fairly even and very platinum shade, which is noticeably lighter than my usual color. I&#x27;m still getting used to it and deciding whether I like it this light. My main complaint is that the \\&quot;blue\\&quot; tones didn&#x27;t seem to work as well as my usual \\&quot;ash\\&quot; tones in removing brassiness. Maybe with so light a shade it&#x27;s a different ball game, but it left me with yellow tones that I didn&#x27;t expect from a \\&quot;blue\\&quot; haircolor. Perhaps I should have left it on longer (I only did 45 minutes, and the instructions say you can leave it on up to 90 minutes), but I fear I would have ended up with white hair if I left it on for any longer than I did.</li>
            <li> My hair was a very dark blonde before using this product, with some gray and growing out blond highlights in the front. I used this according to the instructions (90 minutes developing time), and overall was VERY pleased with the results! My very dark blond hair was lightened nicely to a very light yellow blonde color, with minimal (if any) damage. If yellow blonde is your goal from dark blond/ brown hair, look no further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if your goal is cool blonde or platinum as the product promises, just know that you will need to either tone your hair, or color with a blonde that gives you the color/tone you actually want. I wanted a cooler, more champange blonde, so I deep conditioned my hair a few days and then toned it...and voila! I now have a magnificent, healthy blonde color with lots of radiance and dimension.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is horrendous and MUST be put on either in a well-ventilated room (or even out doors, lol), but the color lift combined with the minimal damage is completely worth it if you are going blonde on your own! Just know that toning or a second coloring is in your future... :)</li>
            <li> no problems arrived okay.</li>
            <li> you have to be realistic about stuff like this. I had died my hair deep copper red about 8 months ago. It had faded a lot and my grays were coming through. My natural color is medium ashy blonde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have so many grays these days, I decided to go with an ash blonde. I was thinking I could hide the grays in ash the way dirt hides on a silver car lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a test strip first, and it turned out ok. I used this on my faded copper hair, it set for an hour and 15 minutes. It did just what I thought it would. It turned my hair yellow. But I was prepared for that with my box of cool ash blonde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the ash I had was not what I needed. I found out later, I needed a Demi permanent color, what I had was a regular box of regular dye. It burned my scalp so I washed it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well crap I said, now what. I went to see a stylist. All she had to do was put in a cool violet undertoned Demi permanent toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure I could have done this part on my own for less money, but I was feeling a little stressed and needed the reassurance from a pro. I worry about my hair falling out lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product did not make my hair platinum, but that wasn&#x27;t my expectation either. My hair is soft, and I&#x27;m happy with the color. I&#x27;ve added some pictures of my hair before, during and after. Good luck&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, but haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores, lately.  I was happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I prefer this to lighten my hair. Not as harsh as the Blonde Brilliance.</li>
            <li> I have naturally strawberry blonde/ light red hair. I wanted to dye my hair blonde (as pictured with product) to go with a turquoise color (the turquoise would have been more emerald green I think had I not bleached/lightened ish). This product promises not to turn hair copper/yellow, reviews sounded great... My test strands (yes, plural) came out good. My hair as a whole came out yellow. I mean YELLOW. Bleh. Pretty aggravating. But this is not professional, soo... what do you expect? Certainly not the results pictured on box, certainly not what reviews lead you expect, and certainly nothing even a little acceptable. :P  It is a box mix, a robber, and it sucks, just go to the local hair academy to get a good deal and a good result (if your on a budget)</li>
            <li> This hair color is so great. If you have brown hair and want to be blond this works. Does not make your hair orange or other crazy colors just nice blond. If you have super dark hair go with MAXI.  I use to pay lots of money and even the hair stylist at times turned my hair crazy colors. Just grab a friend or family member and have them help. I have always had great results with great compliments. :)</li>
            <li> I used this after I had dyed my hair brunette a dark purple/red. I had first used a hair color stripper so my hair had lightened to a gingery color before using this bleach kit.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly I expected it to smell bad, but I only caught a whiff once or twice that made my eyes sting a bit. I did complete the strand test before a full head application more to make sure my hair was healthy enough for the process. I left it on for the full 90 minutes as expected and the hair was not shriveled or gummy (terrified of this outcome by the by). I was left with a very light blonde with subtle orangish pink undertones, despite what the woman from the Clairol helpline phone center said, I can&#x27;t imagine the product working as a standalone without needing a toning application of color afterwards. I applied a cool blonde permanent color to tone it to a wearable state.&lt;br /&gt;Yes this did dry my hair out (it&#x27;s bleach) but not fried to a crisp or unmanageable. I am using a keratin protein deep conditioner daily to help with the dryness. I am pretty excited to be able to blonde myself without spending $200 at the salon my hair feels the same. I have a short bob that ends just about my chin, if you have longer hair it might be easier with a friend to make sure the back is coated. I will be using this to touch up my roots as needed.</li>
            <li> According to my wife, great stuff.  It eliminates steps and does what it says.  She has wavy thin bleach hair and she was very pleased with application and results.</li>
            <li> My hair was a darker brown, which on the box it says will even take that color to blonde. LIES! My roots are super yellow. The rest of my hair is RED. I left it on for the full 90 minutes. I have an interview tomorrow and I am going to have to spend all day today fixing this mess and spending more money! What a waste of $10! VERY UNHAPPY!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years, however the last 2 times I used it it did not work well.  Despite careful mixing and application (by a licensed beautician) there were several places that remained dark and had to be processed twice!!!  I would actually like to return the 2 unopened boxes.</li>
            <li> Not a good product. Does not work well at all!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get it anymore at retail stores.  This is the shade I like.</li>
