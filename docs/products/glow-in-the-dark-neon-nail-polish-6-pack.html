            <li>My girlfriend love them</li>
            <li>Love it, i am happy with my purchase, fast delivery</li>
            <li>These polishes were Ok  </li>
            <li>This is a top coat....</li>
            <li>I thought it would be better....</li>
            <li>however this would be great for a child who wants to be like her mommy</li>
            <li>Shipping was quicker than i thought! :)</li>
            <li>It took three layers of polish to be able to see it.</li>
            <li>My grand baby love them all</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>This product would have been great for a 10 year old girl to play with, maybe to use on her dolls.</li>
            <li>These nail polishes are very cute and bright in the package but they are not actually a color.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d pay this price again for what turns out to be just a parlor trick while I was looking for genuine magic.</li>
            <li>Fabulous that there are so many colors at such a good price!  </li>
            <li>I had to put 4 coats on to see any real color, and the glow is dim at best.</li>
            <li>goes on easily.</li>
            <li>Colors are nice but you have to use several coats for it to look bright because it is too sheer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very happy when I found out it did glow in the dark.</li>
            <li>so the little polish was perfect size.</li>
            <li>She used every color, placed her hands under a light and then turned off the light, what a show she put on for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It polish glows great with only one coat.</li>
            <li>my granddaugher thinks its really cool to have her nails glow in the dark, colors aren&#x27;t to noticable, but they work good as an over coat over a good color polish.</li>
            <li>When I first put it on the polish was very light</li>
            <li>My daughter was so excited to get these too;</li>
            <li>, thats probably the only good thing about it.</li>
            <li>Would order this product again if she wants more.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s cool for what it is as a novelty.</li>
            <li>This was a great price compared to other products I had seen.</li>
            <li>That way, you still have a great nail color, and your nails will still glow in the dark.</li>
            <li>The concept is great, my kids loved holding their hands under a light before bed to watch them glow (some colors glow better than others); but the nails I painted with the green paint stayed green for 2 months!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s initially really cool, but the effect wears off mighty fast.  </li>
            <li>Great colors but needs a few coats.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my 12 year old grand daughter, it was a smashing hit.  </li>
            <li>They are nice for a child or to put over an actual polish color.</li>
            <li>I used the product right after I received it</li>
            <li>They are super cute and aftr placing my hands under a regular 70 watt light bulb for about 5 mins the glow in the dark effect is realli vibrent and cool!  </li>
            <li>for the whole family!</li>
            <li>Did not glow tried holding my hands under direct light etc still would not hlow.</li>
            <li>I expected different colors but as far as glowing they were great!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone who wants their nails to be SEEN!</li>
            <li>I personally would want more for the money</li>
            <li>white first then do a coat of color on top.</li>
            <li>However, the colors really  pop especially when exposed to UV light!</li>
            <li>The bottles are kind of small and the colors in normal light aren&#x27;t very vibrant</li>
            <li>It was a real hit at her birthday party.  </li>
            <li>They did however come in a protective package and in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>It goes on very translucent.  </li>
            <li>You would need to apply it all day to get any real color from it.  </li>
            <li>The polish itself is very watery.</li>
            <li>The way you have to handle this polish is very particular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A clear top coat definitely helps because it can peel.</li>
            <li>so it takes many coats to even see the color properly in either the light or the dark.  </li>
            <li>it was very light when i put it on and didnt glow in the dark</li>
            <li>beautiful colors, really glow in the dark, the only thing wrong is that they are very Clarita and more heches</li>
            <li>Ok once you add a little polish remover.</li>
            <li>These bottle are so cute for little girl.</li>
            <li>Cute set for little girls.</li>
            <li>This was neat because no one could tell my nails were going to glow - they just looked like normal purple nail polish -</li>
            <li>color in normal lighting is iridescent.</li>
            <li>The other colors came off just fine.  </li>
            <li>polish color are to light it looks dark</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I made her put on a solid color first, then paint the glow over it.</li>
            <li>I have not used them yet on a client, but I have held the bottles in the light and then viewed them in the dark, and they DO glow.</li>
            <li>I received 3 of the exact same color pinks out Of the 6.</li>
            <li>This is more for kitties not so much people who take nail polish seriously.</li>
            <li>*this fingernail polish does NOT require a black light to see them glow</li>
            <li>This glow in the dark set works, but it is appropriate for younger girls.  </li>
            <li>I bought these for my 7 and 4 yr old girls</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>This nail polish truely glows in the dark.  </li>
            <li>This is another one of those products I spent a lot of time reading reviews, and for $15 bucks I wanted to get my moneys worth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like these at all, I expected them to be able to glow in the dark after just a few hours in the light or sunlight but</li>
            <li>, they have to be directly under a lamp for a while before they get any kind of glow to them and its not very bright and doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>They had to grow out to go back to normal.  </li>
            <li>And they really glowed in the dark after you expose your nails to light for a little while.</li>
            <li>It was a let down to my friends so even more of a let down to me.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to get these because the thought of my nails glowing in the dark is just awesome, the only problem with them is that i had to do SEVERAL coats just to make it glow, and that was a little disappointing, aside from that</li>
            <li>it came in before the due date thanks!</li>
            <li>I liked to use blue nail polish, and then I would place either green or purple glow in the dark ont op of it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bottle was small and won&#x27;t last as long as most polishes.  </li>
            <li>These colors barely show up.</li>
            <li>So the color (blue, orange, pink, green, yellow, purple) does show up on the white polish nicely, but they only glow yellow.</li>
            <li>But they really glow in the dark</li>
            <li>I brought this nail polish that really don&#x27;t glow in the dark n</li>
            <li>We had to hold a black light to our nails in order to see them glow even in the darkest conditions and even then it only lasted a few seconds.  </li>
            <li>you are expecting some vibrant glow in the dark polish, do not consider purchasing it.</li>
            <li>The polish does have a powerful yellow glow in the dark-- even without a black light, just holding them to a regular bulb for a few seconds and they glow in the dark.</li>

            <li> , they have to be directly under a lamp for a while before they get any kind of glow to them and its not very bright and doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> They had to grow out to go back to normal.  </li>
            <li> And they really glowed in the dark after you expose your nails to light for a little while.</li>
            <li> It was a let down to my friends so even more of a let down to me.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to get these because the thought of my nails glowing in the dark is just awesome, the only problem with them is that i had to do SEVERAL coats just to make it glow, and that was a little disappointing, aside from that</li>
            <li> it came in before the due date thanks!</li>
            <li> I liked to use blue nail polish, and then I would place either green or purple glow in the dark ont op of it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bottle was small and won&#x27;t last as long as most polishes.  </li>
            <li> These colors barely show up.</li>
            <li> So the color (blue, orange, pink, green, yellow, purple) does show up on the white polish nicely, but they only glow yellow.</li>
            <li> But they really glow in the dark</li>
            <li> I brought this nail polish that really don&#x27;t glow in the dark n</li>
            <li> We had to hold a black light to our nails in order to see them glow even in the darkest conditions and even then it only lasted a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> you are expecting some vibrant glow in the dark polish, do not consider purchasing it.</li>
            <li> The polish does have a powerful yellow glow in the dark-- even without a black light, just holding them to a regular bulb for a few seconds and they glow in the dark.</li>
            <li> The colors are very transparent (not different from other glow in the dark polishes).</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they colors themseleves, without th glow in the dark effect, are very dull and should only be used as a top coat!  </li>
            <li> these bottles are soooo tiny, not worth the total cost plus shipping!</li>
            <li> they are smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> The glow lasts a long time and they like their nails the funky color.  </li>
            <li> It stays glowing for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I bought these for myself and my friends to wear during a week long festival.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted, a little small</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sticky and never seemed to dry.</li>
            <li> but they take a bit longer time to dry</li>
            <li> it was so dry</li>
            <li> The glow is only faint, but I still found it to be fun.</li>
            <li> The glow in the dark portion doesn&#x27;t really last that long.  </li>
            <li> Glow in th Dark Neon Nail Polish (6 PK) was on the wishlist of my teen granddaughter.  </li>
            <li> It only glows in the dark while in the jars.</li>
            <li> they weren&#x27;t thick enough you have to put on several coats to get  it to glow &amp;</li>
            <li> It was a complete let down!!!</li>
            <li> I suggest you put a base coat of another color down, and then put one of the glow in the dark polishes on top of it, as the final coat.</li>
            <li> Glowed like crazy without a black light.</li>
            <li> For instance, I painted my nails white and then painted over it with the green glow-in-the-dark!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the money .I</li>
            <li> Does glow in the dark though</li>
            <li> Did not glow in the dark</li>
            <li> too expensive to suck sooooo much</li>
            <li> They do glow in the dark though.</li>
            <li> It DOES NOT glow in the dark.</li>
            <li> Now I just need to find glow in the dark body paint</li>
            <li> These nail polishes take about five coats to even glow in the dark?</li>
            <li> It glow green only,  all the color glow green, But they do glow, They all glow green color</li>
            <li> And they don&#x27;t glow in the dark unless it is pitch black.</li>
            <li> not cool</li>
            <li> All of them glow green in the dark.  </li>
            <li> if you will buy it for a little girl, she will not be happy.&lt;br /&gt;we</li>
            <li> This nail polish did not glow in the dark!  </li>
            <li> it glows green....</li>
            <li> i put a few coats on.</li>
            <li> If I could I would give it 0 stars because the package delivered and it was an empty package!!!!</li>
            <li> The bottles are small but there is six of them.</li>
            <li> The bottles are small but the advertised pic advertised the bottles as being small!</li>
            <li> They hardly show up  at all on your nails.</li>
            <li> This product was purchased for Halloween, but was a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> The polish took way too long to dry and was annoying to cope with.  </li>
            <li> the bottles are very very small  not a fan of this polish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to get enough on your nails to glow.</li>
            <li> The glow in the dark nail polish is very thin.</li>
            <li> so you may have to use a white base coat to bring out the color, or use the glow in the dark polish over a base coat of the same color.  </li>
            <li> tried white cost before I put it on and nothing happened ,I was really disappointed because it was for my 8 years girl&#x27;s birthday</li>
            <li> Very very tiny bottles. :-(</li>
            <li> I bought this nail polish for my friends daughter, and it disappointingly did not glow in the dark.  </li>
            <li> disappointed glow in the dark not even!</li>
            <li> little disappointed in this product.</li>

            <li> Weird.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This nail polish truely glows in the dark.  Just what my daughter wanted &amp; we&#x27;ve been searching for.  It was a real hit at her birthday party.  Fabulous that there are so many colors at such a good price!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> disappointed glow in the dark not even! polish color are to light it looks dark but when you put it on its all most transparent</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the money .I doesn&#x27;t glow whatsoever&lt;br /&gt;I tried white cost before I put it on and nothing happened ,I was really disappointed because it was for my 8 years girl&#x27;s birthday</li>
            <li> they are smaller than expected. But they really glow in the dark</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 7 and 4 yr old girls and they work great.  The glow lasts a long time and they like their nails the funky color.  Definitely might buy them again for a gift.</li>
            <li> I used the product right after I received it and it worked great. I used it for camp and the girls loved it. I was even more impressed by how fast it shipped. It went ground shipping but  got to me in two days.</li>
            <li> I thought they were bigger in size, and its kinda gunkey. Ok once you add a little polish remover. Colors are very light, you can bearly see them. You have to keep applying to your nails just for it to show. Does glow in the dark though, thats probably the only good thing about it.</li>
            <li> These bottle are so cute for little girl. And they really glowed in the dark after you expose your nails to light for a little while. Comes off with nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> I love these little bottles of joy LOL!!! They are super cute and aftr placing my hands under a regular 70 watt light bulb for about 5 mins the glow in the dark effect is realli vibrent and cool!  Can&#x27;t wait to hit up a nightclub and wear these polihes over my regular polish on my feet and hands!    My only complaint is that they colors themseleves, without th glow in the dark effect, are very dull and should only be used as a top coat!  The bottles are small but the advertised pic advertised the bottles as being small!</li>
            <li> I put this nail polish on on 10-30-13, &amp; 18 days later the nail polish is still on with no cracks or chips. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> The glow in the dark nail polish is very thin. It would probably glow alright, but I bought it to put on gun sights and it was to light and to thin.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my 12 year old grand daughter, it was a smashing hit.  It stays glowing for a long time.  She used every color, placed her hands under a light and then turned off the light, what a show she put on for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fun for the whole family!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for glow-in-the-dark nail polish for months!  This stuff is GREAT!  They glow VERY bright and look great, too!  I recommend painting the glow-in-the-dark nail polish OVER regular polish.  For instance, I painted my nails white and then painted over it with the green glow-in-the-dark!  Wow!  I&#x27;ve painted my nails purple and then painted over the top of it with the purple glow-in-the-dark nail polish.  This was neat because no one could tell my nails were going to glow - they just looked like normal purple nail polish - but when the lights went out - they were very bright!!! :)  ***this fingernail polish does NOT require a black light to see them glow***</li>
            <li> The concept is great, my kids loved holding their hands under a light before bed to watch them glow (some colors glow better than others); but the nails I painted with the green paint stayed green for 2 months!  They had to grow out to go back to normal.  The other colors came off just fine.  Weird.</li>
            <li> beautiful colors, really glow in the dark, the only thing wrong is that they are very Clarita and more heches you paint my nail looks!</li>
            <li> Glow in th Dark Neon Nail Polish (6 PK) was on the wishlist of my teen granddaughter.  This was a great price compared to other products I had seen. The product arrived In excellent condition. Would order this product again if she wants more.</li>
            <li> I had to put 4 coats on to see any real color, and the glow is dim at best. It&#x27;s sticky and never seemed to dry.</li>
            <li> Did not glow tried holding my hands under direct light etc still would not hlow. Very very tiny bottles. :-(</li>
            <li> I got this for my 5 yo. I made her put on a solid color first, then paint the glow over it. Reviews recommended I did that, so I did!&lt;br /&gt; It glowed ok. It&#x27;s not gonna keep ur child awake all night cuz it&#x27;s SO bright. But it glows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re happy.</li>
            <li> Would not purchase this again! Picture is deceiving....these bottles are soooo tiny, not worth the total cost plus shipping! Will update rateing again once Christmas comes to see if my daughter likes how the color shows up.</li>
            <li> It glow green only,  all the color glow green, But they do glow, They all glow green color not cool</li>
            <li> As soon as I got this I tested it to make sure it glowed and it did!  The bottles are kind of small and the colors in normal light aren&#x27;t very vibrant so I paint them over my regular colors.  All of them glow green in the dark.  Great for kids.</li>
            <li> These are TINY bottles. They hardly show up  at all on your nails. And they don&#x27;t glow in the dark unless it is pitch black. Even then, it&#x27;s only a tiny tiny glow</li>
            <li> This nail polish is great, but it does have its flaws.  When I first put it on the polish was very light and it took 3 coats to make it look like polish and not stained nails.  The polish took way too long to dry and was annoying to cope with.  The bottle was small and won&#x27;t last as long as most polishes.  I was very happy when I found out it did glow in the dark. The price was great.  The outcome was great, but it took a while toto finish</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time. I have not used them yet on a client, but I have held the bottles in the light and then viewed them in the dark, and they DO glow. I&#x27;d give 5 stars, but I haven&#x27;t used them to see whether or not they work on fingers.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend love them but they take a bit longer time to dry</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like these at all, I expected them to be able to glow in the dark after just a few hours in the light or sunlight but that is no so, they have to be directly under a lamp for a while before they get any kind of glow to them and its not very bright and doesn&#x27;t last long. I was very upset with my purchase and feel I have wasted my money. They did however come in a protective package and in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> This product was purchased for Halloween, but was a big disappointment. It only glows in the dark while in the jars. It&#x27;s impossible to get enough on your nails to glow.</li>
            <li> If I could I would give it 0 stars because the package delivered and it was an empty package!!!! I can&#x27;t believe it, I know that a lot of the 1 star reviews say they tried and it didn&#x27;t work but this is infuriating I didn&#x27;t even get to try!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love it, i am happy with my purchase, fast delivery</li>
            <li> Great colors but needs a few coats. A clear top coat definitely helps because it can peel. However, the colors really  pop especially when exposed to UV light!</li>
            <li> I bought this nail polish for my friends daughter, and it disappointingly did not glow in the dark.  It was a gift, so I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> These polishes were Ok  they weren&#x27;t thick enough you have to put on several coats to get  it to glow &amp; the bottles are very very small  not a fan of this polish.</li>
            <li> I bought these for myself and my friends to wear during a week long festival.  We applied the nail polish 2-3 days into the event.  I was very excited to surprise them with it!  It goes on very translucent.  You would need to apply it all day to get any real color from it.  We had to hold a black light to our nails in order to see them glow even in the darkest conditions and even then it only lasted a few seconds.  It was a let down to my friends so even more of a let down to me.  I purchased this year years ago and have not worn it since even as a regular nail polish because it is so translucent.</li>
            <li> Ok quality, not the best but for the price it&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li> Im gonna start off by saying this is a bad product I bought it for my son sister for xmas and the polish wasn&#x27;t good it was like powder had to add water it was so dry but it worked out good I guess</li>
            <li> I expected different colors but as far as glowing they were great!</li>
            <li> I brought this nail polish that really don&#x27;t glow in the dark n their small was very disappointed :( I will never buy this again</li>
            <li> This product would have been great for a 10 year old girl to play with, maybe to use on her dolls.</li>
            <li> Did not glow in the dark</li>
            <li> This is a top coat....the only color that glows is blue....n it glows green....I thought it would be better.... too expensive to suck sooooo much</li>
            <li> Glow is faint. but still works. goes on easily. color in normal lighting is iridescent. I would buy it again</li>
            <li> was looking for bright colors and a good quailty nail polish this is great my duaghter does nails for people wanted me to  find colors fora reasonble price this is it</li>
            <li> i was very unhappy with this it was very light when i put it on and didnt glow in the dark i wouldnt get this for myself again however this would be great for a child who wants to be like her mommy</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get these because the thought of my nails glowing in the dark is just awesome, the only problem with them is that i had to do SEVERAL coats just to make it glow, and that was a little disappointing, aside from that, i love it! Shipping was quicker than i thought! :)</li>
            <li> These colors barely show up. I would not consider them anything close to being neon. They do glow in the dark though. The polish itself is very watery.</li>
            <li> Colors don&#x27;t show up, not even when layered multiple times. My daughter was so excited to get these too;( Too bad!</li>
            <li> It took three layers of polish to be able to see it. But it does work once the lights are out.</li>
            <li> The colors are very transparent (not different from other glow in the dark polishes). I use an opaque base that matches the glow in the dark color. It polish glows great with only one coat. Very bright. My daughter is very happy with them. The bottles are small but there is six of them. That&#x27;s a lot of glow polish for a great price.</li>
            <li> Colors are nice but you have to use several coats for it to look bright because it is too sheer.&lt;br /&gt;A little disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> This is the worst polish I have encountered! It DOES NOT glow in the dark. It was a complete let down!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter and her frenz had a blast with these colors. Now I just need to find glow in the dark body paint</li>
            <li> These nail polishes take about five coats to even glow in the dark? I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone who wants their nails to be SEEN! This is more for kitties not so much people who take nail polish seriously.</li>
            <li> It does not glow. if you will buy it for a little girl, she will not be happy.&lt;br /&gt;we tried all the colors but they did not glow at all.</li>
            <li> my granddaugher thinks its really cool to have her nails glow in the dark, colors aren&#x27;t to noticable, but they work good as an over coat over a good color polish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted, a little small but it came packaged nicely and my fiend loved it. Glowed like crazy without a black light.</li>
            <li> These nail polishes are very cute and bright in the package but they are not actually a color. They are probably suppose to go over a color. They DO glow though!! They are nice for a child or to put over an actual polish color.</li>
            <li> This nail polish did not glow in the dark!  We bought it for my daughter to wear on Halloween and we were so disappointed that it did not work.  I emailed the seller twice and they did not e-mail me back.</li>
            <li> The way you have to handle this polish is very particular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are not giving this to your kids to use, this is a very light polish. I suggest you put a base coat of another color down, and then put one of the glow in the dark polishes on top of it, as the final coat. That way, you still have a great nail color, and your nails will still glow in the dark. I liked to use blue nail polish, and then I would place either green or purple glow in the dark ont op of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are expecting some vibrant glow in the dark polish, do not consider purchasing it. The glow is only faint, but I still found it to be fun.</li>
            <li> The glow in the dark portion doesn&#x27;t really last that long.  It&#x27;s initially really cool, but the effect wears off mighty fast.  Also, the color doesn&#x27;t saturate all so well so it takes many coats to even see the color properly in either the light or the dark.  But it&#x27;s cool for what it is as a novelty. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d pay this price again for what turns out to be just a parlor trick while I was looking for genuine magic.</li>
            <li> This was for my neice so the little polish was perfect size. I personally would want more for the money but she loved it.</li>
            <li> This is another one of those products I spent a lot of time reading reviews, and for $15 bucks I wanted to get my moneys worth. I believe I did. The polish does have a powerful yellow glow in the dark-- even without a black light, just holding them to a regular bulb for a few seconds and they glow in the dark. I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised. Notice the variety of color with the polish, to get that color to show up I had to paint my nails white first then do a coat of color on top. So the color (blue, orange, pink, green, yellow, purple) does show up on the white polish nicely, but they only glow yellow. This polish is a MUST have if you are attending any glow event!</li>
            <li> My daughter loved the colors and the price was good too.  Arrived very quickly!  Very pleased with purchase and would buy again</li>
            <li> My grand baby love them all</li>
            <li> Only one of the polishes is Neon....I received 3 of the exact same color pinks out Of the 6. Save your money!!</li>
            <li> This purchase was made because I wanted to try the product and at that time there was nothing like this in my area.</li>
            <li> Todo excelente con el producto enviado. muchas gracias el envio fue perfecto. llego de muy buena manera al pais. ok</li>
            <li> This product works great i like it (: it came in before the due date thanks! i put a few coats on. Great for my party looking forward to buying more (:</li>
            <li> This glow in the dark set works, but it is appropriate for younger girls.  I would say up to age 10.  They go on very light so you may have to use a white base coat to bring out the color, or use the glow in the dark polish over a base coat of the same color.  Cute set for little girls.</li>
