            <li>This product worked perfect and worth the money.</li>

            <li>And that&#x27;s exactly why this is a great product!</li>
            <li>I always liked the smell of the Phoenix scent.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice, but no way lasts 12 hours....</li>
            <li>But, nice smell...</li>
            <li>This smells nice but doesn&#x27;t prevent me from sweating and having that sticky pit feeling.</li>

            <li>I love the smell of this deodorant, but I love the price I paid for it even better!</li>
            <li>So glad to have found this great Axe deodorant  that smells great and does not break out my teen.</li>
            <li>/&gt; like many others do.</li>
            <li>Received many compliments.....</li>
            <li>I am going to buy more...</li>
            <li>I like the axe antiperspirant much better.</li>
            <li>Itâ€™s not sticky like this one, and works much better.</li>
            <li>and I thought I&#x27;d be using it for years more.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>Since then, I&#x27;ve done many tests to verify.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>At first, it smells good</li>
            <li>Unlike the antiperspirant deodorant, this one goes on clean!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other deodorants and I like the Axe (Phoenix) the best.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me and love the original one I&#x27;d say look for the remaining original ones in a store so you can make sure the label does not say \\&quot;now even better\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>The old kind was so rich and smelled of an amazing fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Fantastic....</li>
            <li>Has a light powder smell that lasts all day</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>Great deal and S&amp;S makes it way cheaper than the local stores.</li>
            <li>loves this stuff:).It has great odor control and that&#x27;s especially important for growing teenage boys because as a lot of us know their tend to have strong body odor at that age ,and when he wears this specific brand he smells good all day long</li>
            <li>Yes, but keep it clean under there as well.</li>
            <li>Pheonix has a light powder smell to it and it lasts throughout the day, what is odd about this deodorant is that the more you sweat the stronger the powder smell becomes, but it is a lot better than smelling your own foul body</li>
            <li>the old kind</li>
            <li>, I got several compliments EVERY WEEK on how good I smelled, and people would ask what I was wearing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>anyone knows where I can buy the old kind, please let me know.</li>
            <li>lucky to get 8.  </li>
            <li>Keeps him dry and smelling good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found for myself, I rarely can stop the sweat</li>
            <li>Not horrible by any means, but if I had a choice I&#x27;d go with the old fragrance 100% of the time.</li>
            <li>buy Axe Fresh products because they do not flake.  </li>
            <li>I love this particular scent and their products are reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>It smells good and it does not leave a trail of scent that other people do not want to smell on</li>
            <li>If you need an anti-perspirant, this is not the right deodorant stick for you.  </li>
            <li>Pleasant scent, but not particularly long lasting.</li>
            <li>the price I paid here for the two was better than having to pay for one outside.</li>
            <li>Great smell, long lasting</li>
            <li>, exactly what you would expect from Axe.</li>
            <li>Most of the stores now carry only the antiperspirant variety, which causes me to itch.  </li>
            <li>I personally love the smell, but I think everyone likes different smells.</li>
            <li>This is my next favorite scent.</li>
            <li>It actually makes me sweat more and then stains my shirts.</li>
            <li>When I purchased this twin pack, I was expecting more of the same.</li>
            <li>It took me about two weeks before the first rash started breaking out.</li>
            <li>It does last 24 hours or more.  </li>
            <li>but this is just as good if not better then</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much stronger now, reminds me of a mix between the original scent and old spice.</li>
            <li>Willing to pay decent $$ for it.</li>
            <li>This stick deodorant really works well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My wife likes it so much that she uses it from time to time too</li>
            <li>really, what is</li>
            <li>Old Spice smells better but this actually works.</li>
            <li>The label says something like \\&quot;now even better!\\&quot; but it&#x27;s certainly not for someone who really liked the old scent.</li>
            <li>Has nice smell, is long lasting, does not cause a rash or stain clothing.</li>
            <li>Price is over the top for this below average product</li>
            <li>This is okay, but I ordered this by mistake thinking this one is the white solid bar.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have very low body odor, and I rarely ever smell, even after playing a couple hours of basketball, or working out without using deodorant.  </li>
            <li>In the past, companies have changed the formula or discontinued products but Axe is going strong with Phoenix!</li>
            <li>I wish companies wouldn&#x27;t change their products, but I guess that&#x27;s the way of the world to keep evolving and trying new things to get new customers.</li>
            <li>The new version smells closer to what my dad might wear.</li>
            <li>, the new formulation causes my skin to itch and break out in rash.</li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin, this stick doesn&#x27;t cause burns</li>
            <li>I get complimented all the time on my scent, and people would be very surprised to learn that it is from Axe.</li>
            <li>Interesting I expected the opposite of AXE and Old Spice.</li>
            <li>Come on Axe... just bring it back as a &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; a la Coke Classic!</li>
            <li>It still spreads on clear, so no biggie.</li>
            <li>He only wants to use this.</li>
            <li>I think it was in an attempt to compete with old spice.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>, I never got a rash from the old kind.&lt;br /&gt;*This</li>
            <li>I have NEVER encountered any problem with the old formulation.</li>
            <li>Those of us sensitive to antiperspirant chemicals need to send Axe a message that there are still a lot of people who cannot tolerate antiperspirants, and want the qualities Axe deodorants offer.</li>
            <li>If you have strong body odor, it may last in less time for you.  </li>
            <li>The new formulation is definitely different - it&#x27;s not crazily dramatic, but the difference is definitely noticeable.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t make the connection to the new Axe until a couple weeks later when I had to go on a trip</li>
            <li>new stuff just smells like a generic old spice deodorant bought at a local drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent generally lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>prefer this clear solid so that it does not stain my shirts when I sweat.&lt;br /&gt;*Even</li>
            <li>The old formulation used to be white, and the &amp;#34;now even better&amp;#34; version I got is blue.</li>
            <li>I have tried the Toms brand, and although all natural, it does not work for very long.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought it was some other unknown allergen.</li>

            <li> At first, I thought it was some other unknown allergen.</li>
            <li> though I&#x27;ve used this for so long, I actually only just recently learned that it does not have aluminum in it</li>
            <li> This deoderant is getting harder and harder to find.  </li>
            <li> stuff causes me to get a rash sometimes, although not often and not very</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since it&#x27;s not really an antiperspirant, you might want to avoid if you stink a lot when you sweat.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> its getting harder t find this one, works all day and keeps the smell away</li>
            <li> I have been trying to get away from antiperspirant due to metals as well as just not allowing the toxins to leave your body through sweat.</li>
            <li> I have used Axe Phoenix forever - literally, I have NOT used anything else other than Axe Phoenix since I started using deodorant.</li>
            <li> The first sign that something might be wrong is the color.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unless Axe brings back the old formulation, I am afraid I am going to have to switch to a different brand from now on.</li>
            <li> Plain Axe  deodorants are getting harder and harder to find, because Axe is now pushing antiperspirants.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money and the effort.</li>
            <li> He loves that it does not turn his skin dark .</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t like Dove deodorant, I do switch off deodorants from Axe to Dove from time to time for my pits to be less</li>

            <li> This stick deodorant really works well.&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin, this stick doesn&#x27;t cause burns&lt;br /&gt; like many others do.</li>
            <li> I got this for my teenage son .He loves this stuff:).It has great odor control and that&#x27;s especially important for growing teenage boys because as a lot of us know their tend to have strong body odor at that age ,and when he wears this specific brand he smells good all day long .So I definitely recommend this brand of deodorant .Also the price I paid here for the two was better than having to pay for one outside.</li>
            <li> Great smell, long lasting, exactly what you would expect from Axe.</li>
            <li> This deoderant is getting harder and harder to find.  Most of the stores now carry only the antiperspirant variety, which causes me to itch.  Further, Amazon price is competitive.  I get complimented all the time on my scent, and people would be very surprised to learn that it is from Axe.</li>
            <li> If you need an anti-perspirant, this is not the right deodorant stick for you.  This is for those that need a great smelling deodorant.  I&#x27;ve tried many other deodorants and I like the Axe (Phoenix) the best.  It applies well and smells wonderful.  My wife likes it so much that she uses it from time to time too and I have to admit that it smells great on her too!</li>
            <li> Axe Deodorant Stick, specifically the Phoenix scent, is where it&#x27;s at for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smells great. It is deodorant rather than antiperspirant with deodorant. I&#x27;ve found for myself, I rarely can stop the sweat and it annoys me when I do sweat with antiperspirant on. Also, antiperspirant has the byproduct of making white shirts have yellow pits. Not a great lady attractor. The scent generally lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Dependent on your skin, you may get a rash from using on a regular basis. Although I don&#x27;t like Dove deodorant, I do switch off deodorants from Axe to Dove from time to time for my pits to be less irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;It may not attract a hottie to you, but this product can&#x27;t hurt your chances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating: 5 out of 5&lt;br /&gt;Recommended: Yes, but keep it clean under there as well.</li>
            <li> Just what you&#x27;d expect. I personally love the smell, but I think everyone likes different smells. So, who knows.</li>
            <li> My son loves this product. He only wants to use this. Keeps him dry and smelling good. In fact he loves all the Axe products.</li>
            <li> Despite the picture not showing it. This is in fact the new awful updated version of the deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;Once opened, you will see the &amp;#34;now even better&amp;#34; on the sticks.&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea why axe decided to do this. I think it was in an attempt to compete with old spice.&lt;br /&gt;But this new stuff just smells terrible..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the old kind, I got several compliments EVERY WEEK on how good I smelled, and people would ask what I was wearing.&lt;br /&gt;These stopped a few years ago... THE SAME TIME they updated the deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;Just smelling this stuff directly, it just smells awful. The old kind was so rich and smelled of an amazing fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;This new stuff just smells like a generic old spice deodorant bought at a local drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*On a side note, I never got a rash from the old kind.&lt;br /&gt;*This stuff causes me to get a rash sometimes, although not often and not very serious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF anyone knows where I can buy the old kind, please let me know. Willing to pay decent $$ for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years! (6-8 years?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*The scent is great.&lt;br /&gt;*I prefer this clear solid so that it does not stain my shirts when I sweat.&lt;br /&gt;*Even though I&#x27;ve used this for so long, I actually only just recently learned that it does not have aluminum in it (Aluminum is used as an antiperspirant and is supposedly bad for you)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Since it&#x27;s not really an antiperspirant, you might want to avoid if you stink a lot when you sweat.  Though give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uses as listed on product:&lt;br /&gt;Reduces underarm odor.  24 hour protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients as listed on product:&lt;br /&gt;Dipropylene Glycol, Water (Aqua), Propylene Glycol, Sodium Stearate, Fragrance (Parfum), C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Disodium EDTA, BHT, Blue 1 (Cl 42090), Ext. Violet 2 (Cl 60730)</li>
            <li> At first, it smells good but as you start sweating it starts stinking. Not worth the money and the effort.</li>
            <li> smell like a million bucks</li>
            <li> Not a good value.  Price is over the top for this below average product</li>
            <li> I have been trying to get away from antiperspirant due to metals as well as just not allowing the toxins to leave your body through sweat. I have tried the Toms brand, and although all natural, it does not work for very long. This has been a good balance between the two.</li>
            <li> Good Price - Smells Fantastic.... Received many compliments..... I had the Axe Green before and it was great but this is just as good if not better then my last. I am going to buy more... AAA+++</li>
            <li> This is okay, but I ordered this by mistake thinking this one is the white solid bar. I like the axe antiperspirant much better. Itâ€™s not sticky like this one, and works much better. I shouldâ€™ve done a little research before buying.</li>
            <li> This are the Axe deodorants you need. non- staining and smell good.</li>
            <li> My favorite deodorant for years, it is not an antiperspirant and has a great scent. In the past, companies have changed the formula or discontinued products but Axe is going strong with Phoenix!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant for years and I thought I&#x27;d be using it for years more. I opened it up and was saddened to learn they changed the scent. The label says something like \\&quot;now even better!\\&quot; but it&#x27;s certainly not for someone who really liked the old scent. It&#x27;s much stronger now, reminds me of a mix between the original scent and old spice. I wish companies wouldn&#x27;t change their products, but I guess that&#x27;s the way of the world to keep evolving and trying new things to get new customers. Sad day for my arm pits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I tried applying this for a day because I was out of deodorant and the smell of it just got worse and worse. I even tried scrubbing it off halfway through the day but the smell still lingered. I can&#x27;t stress enough how bad this \\&quot;now even better\\&quot; Axe Phoenix is. If you&#x27;re like me and love the original one I&#x27;d say look for the remaining original ones in a store so you can make sure the label does not say \\&quot;now even better\\&quot;. Avoid this one at all costs.</li>
            <li> I love the smell. Girlfriend does too. I use to use Axe &amp;#34;Clix&amp;#34; - but can&#x27;t seem to find it anymore. This is my next favorite scent. I don&#x27;t do antiperspirant because it doesn&#x27;t work for me. It actually makes me sweat more and then stains my shirts.</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s exactly why this is a great product! If you love the smell of Axe, and do not like the sticky side effects of antiperspirant, then this is the perfect product for you.</li>
            <li> I have always used the antiperspirant and no problem.. This gave me rashes and had to throw away</li>
            <li> I have used Axe Phoenix forever - literally, I have NOT used anything else other than Axe Phoenix since I started using deodorant. It&#x27;s always worked perfectly for me. When I purchased this twin pack, I was expecting more of the same. The first sign that something might be wrong is the color. The old formulation used to be white, and the &amp;#34;now even better&amp;#34; version I got is blue. It still spreads on clear, so no biggie. The next thing I noticed was the fragrance. The new formulation is definitely different - it&#x27;s not crazily dramatic, but the difference is definitely noticeable. The new version smells closer to what my dad might wear. Not horrible by any means, but if I had a choice I&#x27;d go with the old fragrance 100% of the time. Obviously, this is subjective. I think over time I&#x27;d get used to the change in fragrance - not a deal breaker per se.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why the one-star rating, you ask?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the new formulation causes my skin to itch and break out in rash. I have NEVER encountered any problem with the old formulation. It took me about two weeks before the first rash started breaking out. At first, I thought it was some other unknown allergen. I didn&#x27;t make the connection to the new Axe until a couple weeks later when I had to go on a trip and I forgot to pack it. My armpit stopped itching, and the redness and bumps subsided almost immediately within 24 hours. Since then, I&#x27;ve done many tests to verify. The itching and redness returns within an hour of putting it on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless Axe brings back the old formulation, I am afraid I am going to have to switch to a different brand from now on. Come on Axe... just bring it back as a &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; a la Coke Classic!</li>
            <li> This is one of the really great deodorants.  So glad to have found this great Axe deodorant  that smells great and does not break out my teen. He loves that it does not turn his skin dark . Doctor J</li>
            <li> I always liked the smell of the Phoenix scent. Unlike the antiperspirant deodorant, this one goes on clean! I would recommend this one over the white powdered one which is not found in stores.</li>
            <li> My husband only uses Axe shower gel and deodorant.  I love this particular scent and their products are reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Love it. Old Spice smells better but this actually works. Taking care perspiration. Interesting I expected the opposite of AXE and Old Spice.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice, but no way lasts 12 hours....lucky to get 8.  But, nice smell...</li>
            <li> This deodorant definitely works well, it lasts all day for me whether I am at the office or at the gym. Pheonix has a light powder smell to it and it lasts throughout the day, what is odd about this deodorant is that the more you sweat the stronger the powder smell becomes, but it is a lot better than smelling your own foul body odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Has a light powder smell that lasts all day&lt;br /&gt;- No aluminum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- None that I can think of&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Country of Origin: USA</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read the description well enough.  I&#x27;m a big fan of Axe antiperspirant/deodorant.  This smells nice but doesn&#x27;t prevent me from sweating and having that sticky pit feeling.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected. This product worked perfect and worth the money.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;You&#x27;re not going to like the answer.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;No really, what is it?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;It&#x27;s the Axe Effect.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Shut UP!\\&quot; /Elaine Benes shove</li>
            <li> has a niche smooth Deodorant Stick applicator its not sticky has a good smell. It works when you need it to I use it all rge time</li>
            <li> This has a wonderful scent. It goes on smooth. When you get to the end and you try to use the remaining sliver it pops out of the container making it difficult to apply. I just use my fingers to apply it.</li>
            <li> If you are allergic to chemicals used in antiperspirants, you should buy some Axe deodorant sticks.  Plain Axe  deodorants are getting harder and harder to find, because Axe is now pushing antiperspirants. In fact, I cannot find Axe deodorant at any price in any stores, and must now buy it online.  Those of us sensitive to antiperspirant chemicals need to send Axe a message that there are still a lot of people who cannot tolerate antiperspirants, and want the qualities Axe deodorants offer. Buying up Axe deodorants is the most effective way to send this message.</li>
            <li> A good to great deodorant stick.  It smells good and it does not leave a trail of scent that other people do not want to smell on you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy Axe Fresh products because they do not flake.  We do not like flakes after we put on our deodorant, do we? No, we do not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not experienced any allergic reactions from use.  I have used this product for a few years now.  It does last 24 hours or more.  If you have strong body odor, it may last in less time for you.  We are all different.  I have very low body odor, and I rarely ever smell, even after playing a couple hours of basketball, or working out without using deodorant.  For me, this works wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great value.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Pleasant scent, but not particularly long lasting.</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant on the market right now.  This scent is great for a man of any age.</li>
            <li> be prepared to smell your bo with few hours</li>
            <li> its getting harder t find this one, works all day and keeps the smell away</li>
            <li> Great deal and S&amp;S makes it way cheaper than the local stores. Great scent and works well considering it is a deodorant only.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this AXE deodorant. Has nice smell, is long lasting, does not cause a rash or stain clothing.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this deodorant, but I love the price I paid for it even better! Cheaper than you can find in any store, including Walmart!</li>
