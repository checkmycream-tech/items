            <li>BEST DENTAL REPORT EVER.  </li>
            <li>I use this tip with a model WP-100W Waterpik, and it is the best way I&#x27;ve found for removing food that sticks under my tooth implant.</li>
            <li>So happy I discovered them!</li>
            <li>Very good product.</li>
            <li>perfect, will order again, great for Implants</li>
            <li>Works great for removing plaque</li>
            <li>These tips work great for &amp;#34;flossing&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Great value and works great with my waterpik.</li>
            <li>These pics worked great and very effective.</li>
            <li>It is very effective for periodontal disease control.  </li>
            <li>great product and good price</li>
            <li>Dentist recommended Water Pik and my cleanings have gotten good grades.</li>
            <li>Works good with my machine</li>
            <li>Replaced the original plaque remover with these and they work perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I love how the waterpik plaque removers work and make my teeth/gums feel great.</li>
            <li>I love these!  </li>
            <li>Nevertheless, this is an effective product that I like, and I&#x27;ll continue to purchase and use it.</li>
            <li>nice replacements.</li>
            <li>im thrilled.</li>
            <li>Excellent replacement tips, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Nice seller and quick shipping but a bit overpriced for what you get.</li>
            <li>Great price, super fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>The product was not like the original.  </li>
            <li>The Plaque Seeker Tip does seem to flush out more food stuff and massages the gums more effectively than the regular tip and all the other fancy tips in the more advanced Waterpik Water Flosser.  </li>
            <li>Quick checkup and cleaning contributed to use of my waterpik. unit.</li>
            <li>It also does an excellent job cleaning between my other teeth, so much so that my dental hygienist noticed a considerable improvement after I started using it.</li>
            <li>You can see it with your own eyes on how much tiny bits of food stuffs come out AND your gums are gently massaged.</li>
            <li>These were exactly like the ones my son uses to floss his braces.  </li>
            <li>It seems to work well but won&#x27;t know for sure until my next checkup</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>As my teeth are very close to each other, I find this tip easier and more comfortable to use than dental floss, which cuts my gums to ribbons.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that these tips must be replaced every three months -- you can see that they are becoming worn by that time.</li>
            <li>These work really well around implants.  </li>
            <li>Worked very well with the water pik.</li>
            <li>I think they work very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The package contains two color-coded tips so you can tell one from the other, which is convenient if more than one person in the household needs to use them.  </li>
            <li>While the cost seems a little high, I still consider it a worthwhile expense.  </li>
            <li>New in package, just as described in the description.</li>
            <li>They are too soft and do not do the job.  </li>
            <li>I feel they work very well and take the Water Pik up to the next level.</li>
            <li>no compliance so far..</li>
            <li>Good but a bit expensive.</li>
            <li>After brushing for 2minutes with an electric toothbrush I always rinse with these, and never fail to find another bit of stuff the toothbrush miseed ( or just worked loose).</li>
            <li>But, no other choice if I want to use my Water Pik.</li>
            <li>Just for comparison, I switched back to the simple water jet, but it did not perform nearly as well as these tips.</li>
