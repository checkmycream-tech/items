            <li>Itâ€™s like looking naturally beautiful!!!</li>
            <li>guess is that this product is targeted to women who already have flawless skin.</li>
            <li>99% of the time - my skin isn&#x27;t flawless, but it isn&#x27;t in dire need of correction or even moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have to say I&#x27;m not at all impressed.</li>

            <li>She said she got a great deal and gave me the extras.</li>
            <li>This tinted moisturizer works great.  </li>
            <li>A great product, if you&#x27;re not looking for made up make up look.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not as happy with the tinted aspect.</li>
            <li>mo1RGB9XQASGUIY]]I had been wanting to try a BB cream for some time as they seem to be all the rage these days, so I was happy to have the opportunity to use and review this one by Olay.</li>
            <li>I never felt like I was wearing the product, which is great.</li>
            <li>LOL  </li>
            <li>It is perfect if your skin doesn&#x27;t have a lot of flaws and it blends nicely and provide protection</li>
            <li>I put it on about 20 minutes ago and it feels great.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t note a great difference in moisture from my day cream or foundation.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!!</li>
            <li>Very nice if you just want a bit of color to run to the grocery store etc.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice product...it does moisturize, and add some cover...with powder</li>
            <li>It smells amazing too!</li>
            <li>It was very nice feeling, almost silky, which is good</li>
            <li>The cream makes my skin feel very smooth (even after washing it off) and it also has a very pleasant scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a fair, freckled, 40+ woman.</li>
            <li>It also smells really good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and makes my skin looks great!</li>
            <li>The price was good on the olay</li>
            <li>Good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>For the price, smoothness and good color matching, I would recommend this.</li>
            <li>She used the cream and it makes her look amazingly good.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Minimizing the need for concealer and foundation\\&quot; is a bit of a stretch - it doesn&#x27;t do a good job of evening skin tone, concealing or adding color.</li>
            <li>I figured this might be a good product for me -</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a good product for the price.</li>
            <li>I knew that it wouldn&#x27;t be as good when I saw that you are supposed to apply it every 2 hours and 15 minutes before sun exposure.</li>
            <li>I do have good genes</li>
            <li>The product is good and the smell is good.</li>
            <li>but otherwise it does a good job.  </li>
            <li>Good coverage and SPF.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a good cream though.</li>
            <li>This review is written by my wife:  Good sunscreen and hydrating without being too greasy.  </li>
            <li>The coverage is good, although I had to use foundation over it.</li>
            <li>The smell is awesome, very fresh...</li>
            <li>Olay Fresh Effects Bb Cream Skin Perfecting Tinted Moisturizer with Sunscreen is a great multitasker!  </li>
            <li>Great quality and lovely fragrance.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Try the Garnier BB cream, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li>And it smells nice too! :)</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to get a laundry soap to smell like this!</li>
            <li>Olay Fresh Effects BB Cream is a very good product.  </li>
            <li>Great product and fantastic price.  </li>
            <li>This BB cream is great to use as a light makeup to even out skin tone and of course for it&#x27;s SPF</li>
            <li>I suppose it looks nice....</li>
            <li>you have a nice daytime</li>
            <li>It blends in nicely with my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a makeup mask on my mask that I wear when treating patients.  </li>
            <li>This product is a bit oilier than the Olay brand, but it is nice to put two steps into one.</li>
            <li>I love this tinted moisturizer, it&#x27;s a good shade</li>
            <li>I liked the way my skin felt all day.</li>
            <li>Olay - if you&#x27;re reading - do you make this kind of moisturizer without scent, please?</li>
            <li>It kind of looks like makup instead of a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>The cream smells nice and it lightweight.</li>
            <li>This has a fragrance to it and is kind of greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>is a perfect example of a BB that really lives up to the hype.</li>
            <li>how well I liked it.</li>
            <li>Something like this Olay Fresh Effects BB Cream is perfect for me most days, especailly because it contains a sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>; while having all three products--tint, moisturizer, sunscreen--in one convenient application is nice, I&#x27;ll stick with my mineral makeup and moisturize beforehand.</li>
            <li>; while having all three products--tint, moisturizer, sunscreen--in one convenient application is nice, I&#x27;ll stick with my mineral makeup and moisturize beforehand.</li>
            <li>It has a nice light weight, is non-irritating (even around the eyes), and the color looks good too.  </li>
            <li>There is a light fragrance to it that is pleasant - not overpowering, nor is it medicinal/clinical in nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was how good it smelled!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need much makeup on my face, so this is ideal.  </li>
            <li>It did give a nice dewy finish to my face and made it look smoother and more even-toned.</li>
            <li>This is the best one I have tried so far.  </li>
            <li>Smells good, feels light, but stays a bit sticky after application.  </li>
            <li>I loved how fresh it was!</li>
            <li>The cream is great for light, natural looking coverage with great hydration</li>
            <li>The lotion goes on smoothly, provides good moisture, and give a nice, light coverage.</li>
            <li>Seems too good to be true.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Besides getting it to match your skin tone, this lotion is fine in a pinch!</li>
            <li>It is a very light weight cream with a touch of coverage.  </li>
            <li>It is very light &amp; not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>I applied it VERY lightly though.</li>
            <li>The light to medium was actually very light (I have light skin and thought it was too fair for me).</li>
            <li>I started out using the the fair to light shade, but am replacing it with the light to medium shade now since I will probably get some sun this summer.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and blends nicely.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love anything by Olay.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of the satin moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It also covers a lot of flaws and makes your skin appear more even.</li>
            <li>You can find more information on this product by going to [...] and purchase at either [...] and http://www.amazon.com.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>I love this BB cream.  </li>
            <li>though I don&#x27;t have many.</li>
            <li>It is a nice color (I got the light to medium, works well for me).  </li>
            <li>I love the concept of BB creams and the ease of use, and I am so glad I finally found the perfect one for me!</li>
            <li>This does help with dryness, nice light coverage</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I wish the spring was higher.&lt;br /&gt;Great love it.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Olay overall is the best product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>But it is OK.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing and light on my face.</li>
            <li>More just a moisturizer than anything.</li>
            <li>But i use this under my foundation and I love it</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Once again, the redness and tingling sensation begins, and the bumps appear in greater quantity than before.  </li>
            <li>Once more I wash my face, removing all traces of the BB cream, and pop another antihistamine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(and/or the issues develop after more than an hour) -</li>
            <li>Love this BB Cream.</li>
            <li>It has added sunscreen, so that is a plus for most.  </li>
            <li>- good moisturizer, contains sunscreen, ok for my sensitive skin, blends well into my fair skin tone&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>in all, I didn&#x27;t love this BB Cream.</li>
            <li>Okay coverage.</li>
            <li>The Olay brand may be okay for you if you are just looking for a sunscreen, because I saw no coverage value to it whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>I think for the cost, it does what it says, gives a more flawless, glowing finish with moderate coverage, with moisturizing and SPF</li>
            <li>I continued to apply it just to see if it made my skin look any better.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>boyfriend pointed out that it did not blend well into my skin, but after some more rubbing, it went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love that it has spf.</li>
            <li>Okay for the money.</li>
            <li>- this moisturizer works so well for me and protects my face for any more sun damage.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of BB creams.</li>
            <li>My skin tone did look better, and it had a bit of a glow after applying this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this tinted moisturizer</li>
            <li>To me this is more of a tinted moisturizer which is what I like some brands feel like cover-up</li>
            <li>more even look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Color: I got the light to medium although I just heard that they had fair to light</li>
            <li>I use it every day and sometimes I put a foundation over it to give me more coverage.</li>
            <li>but it does help my skin tone be more even.  </li>
            <li>Just ok.  </li>
            <li>If it weren&#x27;t for the sticky feeling, I would love it.  </li>
            <li>I love Olay.  </li>
            <li>I love BB creams.</li>
            <li>(You will often get a better deal here).</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll look better</li>
            <li>I love the convenience of having my moisturizer, SPF, and foundation in one step.  </li>
            <li>It is better suited for my coloring during the summer months.</li>
            <li>they were to add a lighter shade to their product selection, then I would seek this out for sure - but would not buy it again in this formulation.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure how well this would work.  </li>
            <li>Love this product and I&#x27;ve heard they are discontinuing it.</li>
            <li>Not a bad smell, a nice one, but strong and perfumy!</li>
            <li>If you just want a general evening of tone, light moisturizing, and a bit of sunscreen, this would be perfect but don&#x27;t expect it to do a lot of work for your skin.</li>
            <li>It felt great on my skin and my skin was not oily or greasy with it (normal skin).</li>
            <li>I loved this product when I first got it.</li>
            <li>When I first received the product I loved how it felt on my face</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call it a pleasant fragrance, but it isn&#x27;t terribly strong or long-lasting.  </li>
            <li>I like this better than Garnier as it goes on more smoothly.  </li>
            <li>It is very dry in Colorado, so it feels wonderful.</li>
            <li>But it does moisturize and provide a nice healthy tint to your skin that feels fresh and light and leaves a dewy finish.</li>
            <li>It made my skin looks smooth and healthy.  </li>
            <li>The tint is minimal at best</li>
            <li>and I love how smooth it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would provide me with the moisturizer and light coverage that I was wanting.  </li>
            <li>The coverage is light but pretty good</li>
            <li>I also love that it is a light weight foundation, SPF, and moisturizer all in one.</li>
            <li>This has a lovely scent and goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I have fair skin with peach undertones and this product really enhanced that.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t put any makeup over it, you have a nice dewy and fresh faced</li>
            <li>Olay really does make good products</li>
            <li>Love Olay Fresh Effects BB Cream!.</li>
            <li>Those few days I used the bb cream, I did notice that the coverage was good and created a pretty flawless look.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Using this cream has given my skin a more even tone, and reduced my breakouts significantly.</li>
            <li>Strong scent that lasts and burned my eyes.</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t have any funky smells or strong fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And, the smell is strong (floral? grandmotherly?)</li>
            <li>The color I received was called Light to Medium, though I think calling it Light would be more accurate.</li>
            <li>Simple and beautiful.</li>
            <li>The cream is pretty oily but the tint color is nice.  </li>
            <li>The Garnier side was very red/purplish while the Olay side was more of a yellow tone, which matches my tone best.</li>
            <li>This is my first try with BB cream of any kind.</li>
            <li>The scent seems light and pretty, didn&#x27;t seem chemically or anything, I liked the scent - in the tube.</li>
            <li>It felt really light to me and was easy to blend into the skin.  </li>
            <li>I put it on half my face and wasn&#x27;t impressed until my girlfriend said &amp;</li>
            <li>cream has &#x27;grown on me&#x27;, and now it&#x27;s what I use most days, even though I didn&#x27;t love it at first.</li>
            <li>Lucky me!</li>
            <li>(mild scents are usually OK).</li>
            <li>I would describe my skin as a light medium, so this color was fine for me.  </li>
            <li>instead, it&#x27;s a light tinted moisturizer</li>
            <li>When I have it on, my skin looks smooth and even and luminous, and my pores are noticeably minimized.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit more money but worth it after trying this.</li>
            <li>Light and non-oily coverage</li>
            <li>and I ordered the light to medium.</li>
            <li>It turns out to be too light for me though.</li>
            <li>The coverage is quite light.</li>
            <li>I bought this product hoping for something that would give me light coverage, while also moisturizing my face.</li>
            <li>Love the fresh effects line</li>
            <li>It smells light, its not greasy.</li>
            <li>The color is light.</li>
            <li>Even using the shine control cleanser, which came as a free sample with the BB Cream didn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a side note, I love the fresh effects shine control cleanser.</li>
            <li>I have light/medium skin with a bit of a summer tan, rosacea and light freckling.</li>
            <li>I should have probably got something darker than the \\&quot;light to medium\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I got the color minimized, I relaxed a bit before checking if my skin felt smooth and looked brighter and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>I wash my face and use toner, then I craftily wait fifteen or twenty minutes before applying the BB</li>
            <li>If I could find that, I might skip the tinted / light correction need even.</li>
            <li>This makes my face look and feel smooth.  </li>
            <li>Feels light.</li>
            <li>It went on smooth and (somewhat) evenly.</li>
            <li>I love the Olay Fresh Effects Bb Cream tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>In the summer I don&#x27;t like to look like I am wearing makeup,  I wanted something light to moisturize</li>
            <li>I will not buy it again because they are not cruelty free.</li>
            <li>I use it every day for a great moisturizer and now I don&#x27;t have to use foundation because it has enough tint to it.  </li>
            <li>Went on smooth not sticky</li>
            <li>This one light to medium works just as fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this product didn&#x27;t smooth them out, but it did minimize them quite a bit.</li>
            <li>But going to the store, or every day, ; those days when you zip on concealer, lip gloss and light cover of mascara</li>
            <li>This cream is thicker, and is almost a bit sticky as I smooth it over my face.  </li>
            <li>I have medium skin and bought the light to medium colour.  </li>
            <li>I think that it is too light for me</li>
            <li>I got a free sample of this</li>
            <li>The texture of the lotion is satiny smooth.  </li>
            <li>My complexion is in between light and medium</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth to put on, isn&#x27;t noticeable and wears well.</li>
            <li>as most I have used cover all the areas of concern for me, but I would say it is a good \\&quot;moisturizer\\&quot; that I may purchase again only for that reason alone.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, lovely texture that blends right into your skin.</li>
            <li>has definitely become my favorite for my summer make up regime will be purchasing again!!</li>
            <li>I very rarely use foundation, so I was hoping to get SOME level of coverage from this \\&quot;skin perfecting\\&quot; cream.</li>
            <li>However, I found the very strong fragrance bothersome and the color didn&#x27;t add much.  </li>
            <li>This may be too dark for very fair skin tones.</li>
            <li>I love the way the cream makes my skin look and feel when I first apply it.</li>
            <li>This Olay Fresh Effects cream applied really smoothly and the color looks great, not too yellow or orangey.</li>
            <li>chose Olay Fresh Effects Bb Cream!</li>
            <li>#34;wow look at your face!&amp;#34;  I looked in the rearview mirror and sure enough my skin on that side looked more radiant and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I used the fair to light in hopes that it would even out the tiny imperfections in my skin tone</li>
            <li>would be a great moisturizer for me (based on my admittedly limited use of it).</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t cake, it blended easily and the moisture was just right.</li>
            <li>This would be great for someone with very dry skin.</li>
            <li>sensitive skin was okay with it, although it does have a very strong perfumy scent when you first put it on.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t settle into fine wrinkles like makeup likes to, and the skin tone on it seems just right for lighter skin.  </li>
            <li>For me it is a great alternative to foundation, it goes on pretty sheer and doesn&#x27;t look overdone.  </li>
            <li>When I first applied this product I was so happy with the even coverage and instant color.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by how much I liked this product.</li>
            <li>I really like this bb cream:)</li>
            <li>I still needed just as much foundation on top.</li>
            <li>That hasn&#x27;t been true with the Bb cream.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this is a good product.  </li>
            <li>True, it does not cover everything, but is good enough for me.  </li>
            <li>Unlike with the moisturizer that glides on silky, and absorbs into the skin quickly, the BB cream has an almost greasy feel.</li>
            <li>My skin gets darker to more of a deep olive over the summer, and so probably wouldn&#x27;t be able to use the product then.</li>
            <li>My biggest offense with the cream is that every time I use it my face gets super shiny within an hour.</li>
            <li>worked well, dark enough for my skin tone, covers imperfections very nicely and makes you look good.</li>
            <li>First, this stuff was way too light for my skin.  </li>
            <li>And that is what this exactly feels like - a light moisturizer with SPF.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin, dry in the winter and oily in the summer and prone to breakouts with a lot of products, so I&#x27;m picky about what I put on my face.  </li>
            <li>But overall a fantastic BB cream!!</li>
            <li>It does a good job moisturizing, and the light color did give my face a slight glow.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant scent, and is gentle enough for my skin.  </li>
            <li>Excellent for mature skin without being heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>decided to give this one a try along with the fresh effects satin moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Love how natural my face looks and feels.</li>
            <li>I am a healthcare professional that spends most of my day wearing a mask and surgical hat.  </li>
            <li>I received the Olay Fresh Effects BB cream-Light to Medium complimentary from Influenster to test.  </li>
            <li>After using my on the spot medicated acne cream, I apply Olay Fresh Effects BB Cream.</li>
            <li>However, of all the products, I have to say the Olay Fresh Effects BB Cream is probably the worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried two BB creams, this Olay Fresh Effects and Clinique&#x27;s BB Cream.  </li>
            <li>I bought this cream/tint today and used it immediately on a freshly cleansed face.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping this Olay BB Cream would be a great product since it is much cheaper than my current BB cream.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The supposed benefits of Olay Fresh Effects BB Cream and my results:&lt;br</li>
            <li>I put it on and it had a fresh feeling to it.</li>
            <li>:Smelled fresh like Olay soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a good BB cream but not great to be honest.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice consistency as it goes on, and does moisturize, not simply tint the skin.  </li>
            <li>However, it therefore has a potentially more natural</li>
            <li>It does, however, blend in nicely and even out skin tone to some degree, with basic coverage.  </li>
            <li>products have never disappointed me and this one more than met the standard.</li>
            <li>Other than that it is a good product.</li>
            <li>It is true this is a good moisturizing cream, however, I thought the fragrance was a little over powering.</li>
            <li>, right?  </li>
            <li>the mineral powder (from Sally Beauty) settles right in</li>
            <li>The right (Olay side) smoothed right in</li>
            <li>This seems to work all right.</li>
            <li>is, however this one is a just right shade for me.  </li>
            <li>It being winter right now</li>
            <li>I think this cream would work best for people with younger skin, no skin problems and no under eye wrinkles or dark circles.</li>
            <li>I can also use it as a foundation, then add a little make up over it if I want to look a little more flawless.  </li>
            <li>In general, my skin looks better with it, and I can tell the difference on the days when I&#x27;m in a hurry and skip the BB step.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally do this with any of my moisturizers, so this made the BB cream sound like a sun screen you would use at the beach.</li>
            <li>Overall, I liked the look and feel of this product and will certainly consider purchasing it.</li>
            <li>I first put some on my right hand where I have some age spots and they disappeared.</li>
            <li>Overall, is a great bargain for the price if you are looking for sheer coverage.</li>
            <li>Luckily, my skin heeled fast from the peel</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t love this product as much as department store brands (i.e. Clinique), this BB cream is not bad and is a fraction of the cost of those bigger name brands.  </li>
            <li>I was a little concerne when I saw the word \\&quot;tinted,\\&quot; but the product blended well and looked good</li>
            <li>The product also has a nice, clean, rather green-floral scent to it, though it&#x27;s a bit heavy and might be cloying to some.  </li>
            <li>thought this would be a nice, inexpensive addition to the collection (maybe for days when I&#x27;m just running errands), but I cannot think of a single positive aspect to using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can see and feel a difference in the first use.</li>
            <li>This product has really made a difference in the appearance of my skin!</li>
            <li>It is a bit tacky after first putting it on (so put your eye makeup on first), but once it sets, it stays put.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sticky or gross feeling and it leaves me feeling more polished.</li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t bother with foundation, I probably should use a SPF moisturizer, but I find myself skipping the moisturizer most mornings as a \\&quot;not enough impact for the effort\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I tend to be a bit (okay, more than a bit) lazy when it comes to moisturizers&lt;br /&gt;and cosmetics.</li>
            <li>I use this more as a primer under my mineral makeup and it seems to prolong the life of my daily makeup.</li>
            <li>If you want a BB cream that will truly do all of these things, has a higher spf</li>
            <li>the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can put it on fairly thickly and it feels like a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This product was the first BB cream I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>the cream cause me to sweat more, and since I used it as a moisturizer my makeup would get ruined because of the constant sweating.</li>
            <li>Then to top things off after 2 weeks of usage, suddenly my face broke out overnight, everywhere on my face</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>First off I have to say I don&#x27;t think the people giving it one star</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like this product the first time I tried it.  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried the Olay Fresh Effects Bb Cream, I didn&#x27;t really see a difference in my skin as I put it on.  </li>
            <li>more polished, and just more \\&quot;put together\\&quot; than it usually does.  </li>
            <li>This was my first experience with BB cream.</li>
            <li>I really like this moisturizer/conditioner/makeup all in one!</li>
            <li>I could use this perhaps in the summer, when I want more of a sheer look.</li>
            <li>I tried this out on my wife who is an avid foundation and sunscreen wearer.  </li>
            <li>This is my first experience with a \\&quot;BB\\&quot; product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll help smooth out your skin, but it won&#x27;t completely hide imperfections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works great, and helps with my dry skin, oily skin, and red flaky skin.</li>
            <li>It is light coverage, so it didn&#x27;t cover my freckles or redness, but it make me look a little more even.</li>
            <li>Love the way it smels and goes on, but a little too light.  </li>
            <li>Although it did cover somewhat I saw a distinctive unfavorable yellowish cast...made me look strange, Perhaps it will be better when I am not in winter skin mode.</li>
            <li>some color correction wouldbe worth the time to apply it, light enough that I don&#x27;t feel I&#x27;m wearing foundation that I don&#x27;t really need/want, and the moisturizing and SPF</li>
            <li>Sadly, I have too many skin issues to wear any kind of BB cream, I simply need more coverage.</li>
            <li>It is light enough to wear during the hot summer.</li>
            <li>so i don&#x27;t look either shiny or too dry where the powder sits on top of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and people always complimented how great my skin look (weird but true).</li>
            <li>My husband even commented on the scent as too strong after I washed it off - from several feet</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s in a bigger package than I expected, has a pleasant scent, and gives my skin a pleasing glow.  </li>
            <li>I think this is a much more natural appearance than a foundation that makes your whole face the exact same color, from hairline to chin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives a very light coverage and the colour was not what I expected it to me.  </li>
            <li>The moisturizer helps with the fine lines, and the color doesn&#x27;t sink into the larger wrinkles like some foundations</li>
            <li>I had very high hopes for this BB cream becuase</li>
            <li>If you go with the BB creams that have higher SPF they usually use zinc oxide which can make your skin look very light, and Olay Fresh Effects didn&#x27;t have that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It went on as a light smooth layer and didn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy in any way -</li>
            <li>way to much for the performance do not buy</li>
            <li>What I really like about this is....</li>
            <li>I really like this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>foundations look really cakey.</li>
            <li>and it really covers all</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light and translucent but smooths out the red in my skin and provides sun protection.  </li>
            <li>It does not offer much in the way of coverage.</li>
            <li>really like the feel  and look on my face and the tops of my hands.  </li>
            <li>I had to really blend blend blend</li>
            <li>This may be the reason it felt so light, but may also contribute to one of my big negatives - it gave NO coverage/correction at all.</li>
            <li>Automatically goes into my &#x27;absolutely can not wear again&#x27; list.</li>
            <li>the whole - not for me.</li>
            <li>some do - it blends very well into my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>after a week of use I have not broken out.  </li>
            <li>I really like the way this makes my skin look and feel</li>
            <li>The left (Garnier side)looked cakey and accentuated the wrinkles and too light for my skin.</li>
            <li>It made all of my skin oily, I guess technically it did smooth it</li>
            <li>B0079HNKLI Smashbox Camera Ready BB Cream SPF 35 Light/Medium]]</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t like spending too much time or money on my skin...</li>
            <li>And this one i got from Amazon is much cheaper than the one I got from supermarket.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I&#x27;m very used to wearing moisturizers with SPF.</li>
            <li>So if you want to avoid having bumps on your face anddo not use this product the sun block really clogs pores.</li>
            <li>Plus, it has really evened out my skin tone</li>
            <li>This one is really creamy and</li>
            <li>I have used Oil of Olay for years as a moisturizer and really like it.</li>
            <li>Very oily and no coverage.</li>
            <li>really understand what a BB cream is used for.</li>
            <li>It will not replace makeup for coverage or how much it evens your tone.  </li>
            <li>also really like the moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I wondered if it was really doing anything.</li>
            <li>My face looked much smoother,</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;tint\\&quot; wasn&#x27;t enough to cover even my light skin.</li>
            <li>I really like it a lot.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it really does, that I&#x27;ve seen</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just part of the whole \\&quot;sitting on my skin\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several BB creams, and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>After having used a few of the Olay Fresh Effects, I am in love with this collection.</li>
            <li>I mean it is touted as being able to smooth your skin.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice amount of moister, though with my dry skin I need extra moister first.  </li>
            <li>B009UTCT6U Dr. Jart+ Black Label Detox BB Beauty Balm]] is a relatively new one, but, WOW it has really gorgeous</li>
            <li>I have fair skin with a ton of freckles and not exactly the same color skin all over my face...until I started using this.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this new BB cream from Olay, but the fragrance in it was a little too strong for my skin.</li>
            <li>It gives me that touch of color I need in order to look alive and not completely pale in the mornings right after I wake up!</li>
            <li>One of the things that I didn&#x27;t like about this BB Cream is that it has very light coverage, it doesn&#x27;t cover dark spots caused by acne, for example.</li>
            <li>I find this is super heavy and pretty full coverage.</li>
            <li>do have to give this 4 star as opposed to 5 because the two color options are only good for people with fair to medium skin, and not particularly good for people with olive to dark skin.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re sensitive to fragrances, this would likely be too strong for you.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have olive skin, that more on the dark side of medium.  </li>
            <li>As I said, my skin is pretty sensitive</li>
            <li>I am a BIG fan of Olay products--my bathroom is full of Olay lotions, eye creams, etc.--and generally find them to be high quality, useful products.</li>
            <li>I really like that Olay offers a few different shades for their Bb Cream, because I have very fair skin, especially here in the wintertime, and those brands that go for a one-shade-suits-</li>
            <li>cream is a light beige-ish color, and is fairly thick but smooth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m older now</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>It did provide me with the level of coverage that I expected from a product like this, however, after several hours of wearing it I discovered dark circles under my eyes because it had dissolved my very good waterproof mascara.  </li>
            <li>It does not cover my zits and dark spots but it makes them less noticeable, which is great for me because I cannot use concealer.  </li>
            <li>I also have very fair skin, and because this is only slightly tinted, it does not show up as orange or pink on my face like</li>
            <li>My new favorite basic that I use daily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another positive aspect is that it evens out skin tone/complexion - but as expected, not as thoroughly as a true base/foundation would.  </li>
            <li>I tried the Light to Medium shade, which was just about right for my complexion which tends toward the pale of the medium end of the spectrum.</li>
            <li>First, a little background -- I&#x27;m middle aged, with fair, sensitive skin, I don&#x27;t work outside the home, so I don&#x27;t need to \\&quot;make up\\&quot; most of the time.  </li>
            <li>It definitely speeds up my morning and helps make you pretty but not over made up!  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any sort of correction for the most part, it made my face a little brighter</li>
            <li>(warning: Smashbox BB Cream is expensive, but it works great for oily skin).</li>
            <li>There were several days over Christmas break that I didn&#x27;t use it, and I experienced increased breakouts, and many painful spots.</li>
            <li>For really stubborn spots, I still needed to apply some concealer, but I wasn&#x27;t surprised; after all, this is a tinted moisturizer, not a foundation.  </li>
            <li>Product goes on like normal moisturizer, wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone looking to substitute foundation</li>
            <li>, my face looked fairly normal, so I decide to give the cream another go.  </li>
            <li>and I wanted some coverage without using foundation since most foundations just feel too heavy to me.  </li>
            <li>In case you&#x27;re wondering, my wife reviewed this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using another manufacturer&#x27;s BB cream for several months when I got the tube of Olay&#x27;s Fresh Effects BB cream.  </li>
            <li>Olay fresh effects is the only one that feels like a moisturizer and doesn&#x27;t give me color but makes my face look balanced.</li>
            <li>it gave me just enough coverage to look fresh and awake.</li>
            <li>My skin is noticeably softer at the end of the day when I&#x27;ve worn this cream, rather than my normal moisturizer plus foundation routine.  </li>
            <li>But as I turn 40 this year, I think I&#x27;m going to appreciate the extra polish that the Olay Fresh Effects Bb Cream gives my skin.  </li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s probably because I&#x27;m not wearing the Fresh Effects Cream on a daily basis (which has nothing to do with the product and everything to do with how my life is ordered at the moment).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was sitting on the shelf right next to another BB cream that said it would specifically NOT make your face oily or greasy.</li>
            <li>I did not notice any light reflecting pigments like some other BB creams.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida</li>
            <li>Expected better coverage and left skin feeling oily.</li>
            <li>The effects are subtle, but nice.  </li>
            <li>When I first put it on I was worried about the fragrance, I usually buy fragrance free</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 54 and people frequently think I&#x27;m my daughter&#x27;s (24) older sister.</li>
            <li>It goes on almost exactly like a normal facial lotion, and doesn&#x27;t flake or pill.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned with dark circles and Olay BB cream did not cover up the dark circles; I had to still use cover up on them.  </li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m going out, I add a little foundation to it, mix it together and smooth it on for a little more coverage.  </li>
            <li>I have to say I was very surprised with this product, it was not greasy like some BB creams and it didn&#x27;t cause my skin to misbehave at all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few different BB creams by other top drug store brands, and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>The Olay Fresh Effects does have a slight melon smell and a warning to stop using it if you develop a rash, so be aware of that.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to people who don&#x27;t already have fairly nice skin; this is very sheer, and your skin definitely &amp;#34;comes through.&amp;#34; However, it&#x27;s a very nice product for people who only have a few slight discolorations or just want a</li>
            <li>My 17 year old daughter loves this product!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really natural looking on the skin !</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin prone to break-outs (still, at age 38!)</li>
            <li>I especially like the fact that it is SPF 15 which eliminates the hassle of trying to be sure that my moisturizer or other product has a sunscreen.</li>
            <li>shades are to dark as often light med.</li>
            <li>but it definitely looked better than it does with only a regular moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a tint to it, which is pretty sheer.  </li>
            <li>Instead, it just kind of floats on top, or at least that&#x27;s the sensation I get, especially after I&#x27;ve worn it for a few hours.  </li>
            <li>So, first of all, be careful how much you use.</li>
            <li>The lotion has sunscreen, SPF 15, which is minimal but probably adequate.  </li>
            <li>I am middle aged and think it would be suitable for younger.</li>
            <li>Some reviewers say it is thin and greasy, but this is the thickest BB cream I&#x27;ve used yet with the most coverage, and while other BB creams left my face very shiny (to the point I had to either use mattifier underneath or powder over top), this one does not.</li>
            <li>The ones I have tried in the department store have more coverage - which I need - and therefore I use those under my regular foundation on days that I need a little bit more camouflage than usual.  </li>
            <li>Just a little too light</li>
            <li>I just smooth it on after my shower over my face and neck, slap on a little blush</li>
            <li>one aspect that is not ideal is that I am very fair, and this is a bit too dark.  </li>
            <li>I am an adult who still experiences acne and sensitive skin, so after Olay stopped producing the moisturizer for acne</li>
            <li>My face also had red splotches and a very itchy feeling accompanied.</li>
            <li>Very sheer coverage if any and Very oily.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not a heavy make-up...</li>
            <li>I try not to get it too close to my eyes because I think I am a bit sensitive to it</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m 29 years old.</li>
            <li>I also have been using it on the tops of my almost 60 year old hands.  </li>
            <li>It may work for others, but not for me or my not so sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a 60-year old woman and sun/age spots have become an issue for me.</li>
            <li>blends effortlessly with your natural skin tone, helping hide imperfections and minizing the need for concealer and foundation.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried wearing it even after the headache began in the hopes that the scent would fade a bit - it didn&#x27;t fade, or didn&#x27;t do so fast enough for me to notice it.</li>
            <li>skin looks &#x27;dewy&#x27;, soft, and</li>
            <li>I now have to use it with primer or it becomes very shiny and wrinkly, if that&#x27;s possible?</li>
            <li>- doesn&#x27;t do much to cover problem areas such as acne, enlarged pores&lt;</li>
            <li>It does seem to offer a bit of coverage while still feeling natural.  </li>
            <li>I did notice after some time in natural sunlight</li>
            <li>prone sensitive skin type.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was surprised that my normally sensitive skin didn&#x27;t have any issues with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so you still have a natural look.</li>
            <li>only problem that I have with this is the coverage, It doesn&#x27;t provide much at all.</li>
            <li>(I am 53 years old.))</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I have sensitive, breakout-prone skin that reacts to almost ANYTHING, so when I used this and found my breakouts decreasing, it was a godsend.</li>
            <li>It works well with my sensitive skin, no problems.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;BB creams are supposed to hydrate but this left my skin really, really shiny ... \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; looking.</li>
            <li>it still looked natural ...</li>
            <li>and I was surprised</li>
            <li>It is also fragrant, so if you are sensitive to perfumes, this is not for you.  </li>
            <li>, she&#x27;s not in the sun as much as in the summer, so we can&#x27;t speak totally to its sunscreening abilities.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even said to leave skin glowing and naturally even after just one use.  </li>
            <li>Most BB Creams are designed to last all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin and as a result I am not a huge fan of a lot of tinted moisturizers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For those like myself who are fragrance sensitive, the smell of this product really bothered me the first time I used it, but bothered me less today when I did the video review.</li>
            <li>I have light to pale skin, med.</li>
            <li>far as coverage, the Olay Fresh Effects BB Cream does as well as some of the other products I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first time I tried this product, I got a little zealous with my application, and wasted more than I should have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greasy.</li>
            <li>It contains SPF 15 which is fine for me as I don&#x27;t spend excessive amounts of time</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel as dried out as the Neutrogena shine control cleanser, but leaves it feeling clean.</li>
            <li>I found this to be true, in fact I skipped a day or two when I was running late and could really tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>The coverage is sheer, but better than a lot of the others, and it covers enough that I can hardly see my dark circles and light blemishes</li>
            <li>I usually finish with a light dusting of a mineral foundation powder.  </li>
            <li>With an SPF of 15, it&#x27;s not a heavy-duty sunscreen, but for casual, everyday use, it&#x27;s perfectly acceptable, though for longer wear outside, you might want to layer it with another sunscreen-containing product or a face-formulated sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very light coverage, so I still need to use a cover up, and I use a mineral powder after applying, because as other reviewers state, it does make you look a little bit greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Skin Perfecting Moisturizer with Sunscreen-Light to Medium because beauty balms (BBs) are the new big thing in skin creams, or so the magazines would have us believe.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel like this product had very  much tint or coverage compared to other BB creams I have used.  </li>
            <li>It does not due miracles</li>
            <li>I have some freckles and small age spots, and they are visible through the cream, but the contrast has been reduced significantly.  </li>
            <li>I generally like Olay products, but this was a no from me.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t heavy or clogged my pores either.&lt;br /&gt;- Smells fresh.</li>
            <li>Well, I didn&#x27;t see that happen, sorry to say, but when I used the Fresh Effects Cream, it did provide a nice layer of sheer color on my face, evening things out and toning down any patchy skin or blemishes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this for younger users with normal to dry, not too sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The previous product has been relegated to my travel bag, and the Olay Fresh Effects is now my daily choice.</li>
            <li>I simply cannot use this product because it made me break out so profoundly.</li>
            <li>The pores still appear large, and do not cover any imperfections on the skin, a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li>my only complaint is I wish they would go cruelty free as once this runs out</li>
            <li>I have tried the a number of different BB creams and they made me look older because my skin is dry.</li>
            <li>far, I&#x27;ve found BB creams to be something I&#x27;d use in addition to my other make-up but haven&#x27;t found any that would completely replace them.</li>
            <li>As a busy mom, I especially like that there isn&#x27;t an extra step or extra weight involved in wearing it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There is an inch-long list of inactive ingredients on the box with many syllables and a third of the back of the tube is taken up by warnings (like not to use this on broken skin, keep out of eyes, etc.).</li>
            <li>the Olay Fresh Effects BB Cream, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s nice about this product is that it does have a hint of color that smooths over a few discolorations and ever so slightly tones down my under eye circles.</li>
            <li>I also have huge pores on my nose - it helps very little in this area - I have to use other pore-minimizing products for that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Iâ€™ve been having breakouts for a few months now, so I cannot use certain make-up products.</li>
            <li>I am 62 years old with very dry skin</li>
            <li>With a little blush, I am ready to go to work.  </li>
            <li>This worked as a moisturizer/SPF from what little I tested of it, but the tint was too sheer to really get any correction/coverage</li>
            <li>Too bad because I loved the price and the concept.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not as happy with the tinted aspect.</li>
            <li> mo1RGB9XQASGUIY]]I had been wanting to try a BB cream for some time as they seem to be all the rage these days, so I was happy to have the opportunity to use and review this one by Olay.</li>
            <li> I never felt like I was wearing the product, which is great.</li>
            <li> LOL  </li>
            <li> It is perfect if your skin doesn&#x27;t have a lot of flaws and it blends nicely and provide protection</li>
            <li> I put it on about 20 minutes ago and it feels great.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t note a great difference in moisture from my day cream or foundation.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!!</li>
            <li> Very nice if you just want a bit of color to run to the grocery store etc.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product...it does moisturize, and add some cover...with powder</li>
            <li> It smells amazing too!</li>
            <li> It was very nice feeling, almost silky, which is good</li>
            <li> The cream makes my skin feel very smooth (even after washing it off) and it also has a very pleasant scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a fair, freckled, 40+ woman.</li>
            <li> It also smells really good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and makes my skin looks great!</li>
            <li> The price was good on the olay</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> For the price, smoothness and good color matching, I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> She used the cream and it makes her look amazingly good.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Minimizing the need for concealer and foundation\\&quot; is a bit of a stretch - it doesn&#x27;t do a good job of evening skin tone, concealing or adding color.</li>
            <li> I figured this might be a good product for me -</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a good product for the price.</li>
            <li> I knew that it wouldn&#x27;t be as good when I saw that you are supposed to apply it every 2 hours and 15 minutes before sun exposure.</li>
            <li> I do have good genes</li>
            <li> The product is good and the smell is good.</li>
            <li> but otherwise it does a good job.  </li>
            <li> Good coverage and SPF.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a good cream though.</li>
            <li> This review is written by my wife:  Good sunscreen and hydrating without being too greasy.  </li>
            <li> The coverage is good, although I had to use foundation over it.</li>
            <li> The smell is awesome, very fresh...</li>
            <li> Olay Fresh Effects Bb Cream Skin Perfecting Tinted Moisturizer with Sunscreen is a great multitasker!  </li>
            <li> Great quality and lovely fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Try the Garnier BB cream, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> And it smells nice too! :)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to get a laundry soap to smell like this!</li>
            <li> Olay Fresh Effects BB Cream is a very good product.  </li>
            <li> Great product and fantastic price.  </li>
            <li> This BB cream is great to use as a light makeup to even out skin tone and of course for it&#x27;s SPF</li>
            <li> I suppose it looks nice....</li>
            <li> you have a nice daytime</li>
            <li> It blends in nicely with my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a makeup mask on my mask that I wear when treating patients.  </li>
            <li> This product is a bit oilier than the Olay brand, but it is nice to put two steps into one.</li>
            <li> I love this tinted moisturizer, it&#x27;s a good shade</li>
            <li> I liked the way my skin felt all day.</li>
            <li> Olay - if you&#x27;re reading - do you make this kind of moisturizer without scent, please?</li>
            <li> It kind of looks like makup instead of a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> The cream smells nice and it lightweight.</li>
            <li> This has a fragrance to it and is kind of greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> is a perfect example of a BB that really lives up to the hype.</li>
            <li> how well I liked it.</li>
            <li> Something like this Olay Fresh Effects BB Cream is perfect for me most days, especailly because it contains a sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> ; while having all three products--tint, moisturizer, sunscreen--in one convenient application is nice, I&#x27;ll stick with my mineral makeup and moisturize beforehand.</li>
            <li> ; while having all three products--tint, moisturizer, sunscreen--in one convenient application is nice, I&#x27;ll stick with my mineral makeup and moisturize beforehand.</li>
            <li> It has a nice light weight, is non-irritating (even around the eyes), and the color looks good too.  </li>
            <li> There is a light fragrance to it that is pleasant - not overpowering, nor is it medicinal/clinical in nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was how good it smelled!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need much makeup on my face, so this is ideal.  </li>
            <li> It did give a nice dewy finish to my face and made it look smoother and more even-toned.</li>
            <li> This is the best one I have tried so far.  </li>
            <li> Smells good, feels light, but stays a bit sticky after application.  </li>
            <li> I loved how fresh it was!</li>
            <li> The cream is great for light, natural looking coverage with great hydration</li>
            <li> The lotion goes on smoothly, provides good moisture, and give a nice, light coverage.</li>
            <li> Seems too good to be true.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides getting it to match your skin tone, this lotion is fine in a pinch!</li>
            <li> It is a very light weight cream with a touch of coverage.  </li>
            <li> It is very light &amp; not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> I applied it VERY lightly though.</li>
            <li> The light to medium was actually very light (I have light skin and thought it was too fair for me).</li>
            <li> I started out using the the fair to light shade, but am replacing it with the light to medium shade now since I will probably get some sun this summer.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and blends nicely.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love anything by Olay.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of the satin moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It also covers a lot of flaws and makes your skin appear more even.</li>
            <li> You can find more information on this product by going to [...] and purchase at either [...] and http://www.amazon.com.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream.  </li>
            <li> though I don&#x27;t have many.</li>
            <li> It is a nice color (I got the light to medium, works well for me).  </li>
            <li> I love the concept of BB creams and the ease of use, and I am so glad I finally found the perfect one for me!</li>
            <li> This does help with dryness, nice light coverage</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I wish the spring was higher.&lt;br /&gt;Great love it.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> Olay overall is the best product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> But it is OK.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and light on my face.</li>
            <li> More just a moisturizer than anything.</li>
            <li> But i use this under my foundation and I love it</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Once again, the redness and tingling sensation begins, and the bumps appear in greater quantity than before.  </li>
            <li> Once more I wash my face, removing all traces of the BB cream, and pop another antihistamine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (and/or the issues develop after more than an hour) -</li>
            <li> Love this BB Cream.</li>
            <li> It has added sunscreen, so that is a plus for most.  </li>
            <li> - good moisturizer, contains sunscreen, ok for my sensitive skin, blends well into my fair skin tone&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> in all, I didn&#x27;t love this BB Cream.</li>
            <li> Okay coverage.</li>
            <li> The Olay brand may be okay for you if you are just looking for a sunscreen, because I saw no coverage value to it whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> I think for the cost, it does what it says, gives a more flawless, glowing finish with moderate coverage, with moisturizing and SPF</li>
            <li> I continued to apply it just to see if it made my skin look any better.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> boyfriend pointed out that it did not blend well into my skin, but after some more rubbing, it went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I love that it has spf.</li>
            <li> Okay for the money.</li>
            <li> - this moisturizer works so well for me and protects my face for any more sun damage.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of BB creams.</li>
            <li> My skin tone did look better, and it had a bit of a glow after applying this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this tinted moisturizer</li>
            <li> To me this is more of a tinted moisturizer which is what I like some brands feel like cover-up</li>
            <li> more even look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Color: I got the light to medium although I just heard that they had fair to light</li>
            <li> I use it every day and sometimes I put a foundation over it to give me more coverage.</li>
            <li> but it does help my skin tone be more even.  </li>
            <li> Just ok.  </li>
            <li> If it weren&#x27;t for the sticky feeling, I would love it.  </li>
            <li> I love Olay.  </li>
            <li> I love BB creams.</li>
            <li> (You will often get a better deal here).</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll look better</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of having my moisturizer, SPF, and foundation in one step.  </li>
            <li> It is better suited for my coloring during the summer months.</li>
            <li> they were to add a lighter shade to their product selection, then I would seek this out for sure - but would not buy it again in this formulation.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure how well this would work.  </li>
            <li> Love this product and I&#x27;ve heard they are discontinuing it.</li>
            <li> Not a bad smell, a nice one, but strong and perfumy!</li>
            <li> If you just want a general evening of tone, light moisturizing, and a bit of sunscreen, this would be perfect but don&#x27;t expect it to do a lot of work for your skin.</li>
            <li> It felt great on my skin and my skin was not oily or greasy with it (normal skin).</li>
            <li> I loved this product when I first got it.</li>
            <li> When I first received the product I loved how it felt on my face</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call it a pleasant fragrance, but it isn&#x27;t terribly strong or long-lasting.  </li>
            <li> I like this better than Garnier as it goes on more smoothly.  </li>
            <li> It is very dry in Colorado, so it feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> But it does moisturize and provide a nice healthy tint to your skin that feels fresh and light and leaves a dewy finish.</li>
            <li> It made my skin looks smooth and healthy.  </li>
            <li> The tint is minimal at best</li>
            <li> and I love how smooth it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would provide me with the moisturizer and light coverage that I was wanting.  </li>
            <li> The coverage is light but pretty good</li>
            <li> I also love that it is a light weight foundation, SPF, and moisturizer all in one.</li>
            <li> This has a lovely scent and goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> I have fair skin with peach undertones and this product really enhanced that.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t put any makeup over it, you have a nice dewy and fresh faced</li>
            <li> Olay really does make good products</li>
            <li> Love Olay Fresh Effects BB Cream!.</li>
            <li> Those few days I used the bb cream, I did notice that the coverage was good and created a pretty flawless look.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Using this cream has given my skin a more even tone, and reduced my breakouts significantly.</li>
            <li> Strong scent that lasts and burned my eyes.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t have any funky smells or strong fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And, the smell is strong (floral? grandmotherly?)</li>
            <li> The color I received was called Light to Medium, though I think calling it Light would be more accurate.</li>
            <li> Simple and beautiful.</li>
            <li> The cream is pretty oily but the tint color is nice.  </li>
            <li> The Garnier side was very red/purplish while the Olay side was more of a yellow tone, which matches my tone best.</li>
            <li> This is my first try with BB cream of any kind.</li>
            <li> The scent seems light and pretty, didn&#x27;t seem chemically or anything, I liked the scent - in the tube.</li>
            <li> It felt really light to me and was easy to blend into the skin.  </li>
            <li> I put it on half my face and wasn&#x27;t impressed until my girlfriend said &amp;</li>
            <li> cream has &#x27;grown on me&#x27;, and now it&#x27;s what I use most days, even though I didn&#x27;t love it at first.</li>
            <li> Lucky me!</li>
            <li> (mild scents are usually OK).</li>
            <li> I would describe my skin as a light medium, so this color was fine for me.  </li>
            <li> instead, it&#x27;s a light tinted moisturizer</li>
            <li> When I have it on, my skin looks smooth and even and luminous, and my pores are noticeably minimized.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit more money but worth it after trying this.</li>
            <li> Light and non-oily coverage</li>
            <li> and I ordered the light to medium.</li>
            <li> It turns out to be too light for me though.</li>
            <li> The coverage is quite light.</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping for something that would give me light coverage, while also moisturizing my face.</li>
            <li> Love the fresh effects line</li>
            <li> It smells light, its not greasy.</li>
            <li> The color is light.</li>
            <li> Even using the shine control cleanser, which came as a free sample with the BB Cream didn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a side note, I love the fresh effects shine control cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have light/medium skin with a bit of a summer tan, rosacea and light freckling.</li>
            <li> I should have probably got something darker than the \\&quot;light to medium\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I got the color minimized, I relaxed a bit before checking if my skin felt smooth and looked brighter and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> I wash my face and use toner, then I craftily wait fifteen or twenty minutes before applying the BB</li>
            <li> If I could find that, I might skip the tinted / light correction need even.</li>
            <li> This makes my face look and feel smooth.  </li>
            <li> Feels light.</li>
            <li> It went on smooth and (somewhat) evenly.</li>
            <li> I love the Olay Fresh Effects Bb Cream tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> In the summer I don&#x27;t like to look like I am wearing makeup,  I wanted something light to moisturize</li>
            <li> I will not buy it again because they are not cruelty free.</li>
            <li> I use it every day for a great moisturizer and now I don&#x27;t have to use foundation because it has enough tint to it.  </li>
            <li> Went on smooth not sticky</li>
            <li> This one light to medium works just as fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this product didn&#x27;t smooth them out, but it did minimize them quite a bit.</li>
            <li> But going to the store, or every day, ; those days when you zip on concealer, lip gloss and light cover of mascara</li>
            <li> This cream is thicker, and is almost a bit sticky as I smooth it over my face.  </li>
            <li> I have medium skin and bought the light to medium colour.  </li>
            <li> I think that it is too light for me</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this</li>
            <li> The texture of the lotion is satiny smooth.  </li>
            <li> My complexion is in between light and medium</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth to put on, isn&#x27;t noticeable and wears well.</li>
            <li> as most I have used cover all the areas of concern for me, but I would say it is a good \\&quot;moisturizer\\&quot; that I may purchase again only for that reason alone.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, lovely texture that blends right into your skin.</li>
            <li> has definitely become my favorite for my summer make up regime will be purchasing again!!</li>
            <li> I very rarely use foundation, so I was hoping to get SOME level of coverage from this \\&quot;skin perfecting\\&quot; cream.</li>
            <li> However, I found the very strong fragrance bothersome and the color didn&#x27;t add much.  </li>
            <li> This may be too dark for very fair skin tones.</li>
            <li> I love the way the cream makes my skin look and feel when I first apply it.</li>
            <li> This Olay Fresh Effects cream applied really smoothly and the color looks great, not too yellow or orangey.</li>
            <li> chose Olay Fresh Effects Bb Cream!</li>
            <li> #34;wow look at your face!&amp;#34;  I looked in the rearview mirror and sure enough my skin on that side looked more radiant and healthy.  </li>
            <li> I used the fair to light in hopes that it would even out the tiny imperfections in my skin tone</li>
            <li> would be a great moisturizer for me (based on my admittedly limited use of it).</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cake, it blended easily and the moisture was just right.</li>
            <li> This would be great for someone with very dry skin.</li>
            <li> sensitive skin was okay with it, although it does have a very strong perfumy scent when you first put it on.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t settle into fine wrinkles like makeup likes to, and the skin tone on it seems just right for lighter skin.  </li>
            <li> For me it is a great alternative to foundation, it goes on pretty sheer and doesn&#x27;t look overdone.  </li>
            <li> When I first applied this product I was so happy with the even coverage and instant color.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by how much I liked this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this bb cream:)</li>
            <li> I still needed just as much foundation on top.</li>
            <li> That hasn&#x27;t been true with the Bb cream.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this is a good product.  </li>
            <li> True, it does not cover everything, but is good enough for me.  </li>
            <li> Unlike with the moisturizer that glides on silky, and absorbs into the skin quickly, the BB cream has an almost greasy feel.</li>
            <li> My skin gets darker to more of a deep olive over the summer, and so probably wouldn&#x27;t be able to use the product then.</li>
            <li> My biggest offense with the cream is that every time I use it my face gets super shiny within an hour.</li>
            <li> worked well, dark enough for my skin tone, covers imperfections very nicely and makes you look good.</li>
            <li> First, this stuff was way too light for my skin.  </li>
            <li> And that is what this exactly feels like - a light moisturizer with SPF.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin, dry in the winter and oily in the summer and prone to breakouts with a lot of products, so I&#x27;m picky about what I put on my face.  </li>
            <li> But overall a fantastic BB cream!!</li>
            <li> It does a good job moisturizing, and the light color did give my face a slight glow.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant scent, and is gentle enough for my skin.  </li>
            <li> Excellent for mature skin without being heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> decided to give this one a try along with the fresh effects satin moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love how natural my face looks and feels.</li>
            <li> I am a healthcare professional that spends most of my day wearing a mask and surgical hat.  </li>
            <li> I received the Olay Fresh Effects BB cream-Light to Medium complimentary from Influenster to test.  </li>
            <li> After using my on the spot medicated acne cream, I apply Olay Fresh Effects BB Cream.</li>
            <li> However, of all the products, I have to say the Olay Fresh Effects BB Cream is probably the worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried two BB creams, this Olay Fresh Effects and Clinique&#x27;s BB Cream.  </li>
            <li> I bought this cream/tint today and used it immediately on a freshly cleansed face.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this Olay BB Cream would be a great product since it is much cheaper than my current BB cream.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The supposed benefits of Olay Fresh Effects BB Cream and my results:&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put it on and it had a fresh feeling to it.</li>
            <li> :Smelled fresh like Olay soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a good BB cream but not great to be honest.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice consistency as it goes on, and does moisturize, not simply tint the skin.  </li>
            <li> However, it therefore has a potentially more natural</li>
            <li> It does, however, blend in nicely and even out skin tone to some degree, with basic coverage.  </li>
            <li> products have never disappointed me and this one more than met the standard.</li>
            <li> Other than that it is a good product.</li>
            <li> It is true this is a good moisturizing cream, however, I thought the fragrance was a little over powering.</li>
            <li> , right?  </li>
            <li> the mineral powder (from Sally Beauty) settles right in</li>
            <li> The right (Olay side) smoothed right in</li>
            <li> This seems to work all right.</li>
            <li> is, however this one is a just right shade for me.  </li>
            <li> It being winter right now</li>
            <li> I think this cream would work best for people with younger skin, no skin problems and no under eye wrinkles or dark circles.</li>
            <li> I can also use it as a foundation, then add a little make up over it if I want to look a little more flawless.  </li>
            <li> In general, my skin looks better with it, and I can tell the difference on the days when I&#x27;m in a hurry and skip the BB step.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally do this with any of my moisturizers, so this made the BB cream sound like a sun screen you would use at the beach.</li>
            <li> Overall, I liked the look and feel of this product and will certainly consider purchasing it.</li>
            <li> I first put some on my right hand where I have some age spots and they disappeared.</li>
            <li> Overall, is a great bargain for the price if you are looking for sheer coverage.</li>
            <li> Luckily, my skin heeled fast from the peel</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t love this product as much as department store brands (i.e. Clinique), this BB cream is not bad and is a fraction of the cost of those bigger name brands.  </li>
            <li> I was a little concerne when I saw the word \\&quot;tinted,\\&quot; but the product blended well and looked good</li>
            <li> The product also has a nice, clean, rather green-floral scent to it, though it&#x27;s a bit heavy and might be cloying to some.  </li>
            <li> thought this would be a nice, inexpensive addition to the collection (maybe for days when I&#x27;m just running errands), but I cannot think of a single positive aspect to using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can see and feel a difference in the first use.</li>
            <li> This product has really made a difference in the appearance of my skin!</li>
            <li> It is a bit tacky after first putting it on (so put your eye makeup on first), but once it sets, it stays put.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky or gross feeling and it leaves me feeling more polished.</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t bother with foundation, I probably should use a SPF moisturizer, but I find myself skipping the moisturizer most mornings as a \\&quot;not enough impact for the effort\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I tend to be a bit (okay, more than a bit) lazy when it comes to moisturizers&lt;br /&gt;and cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I use this more as a primer under my mineral makeup and it seems to prolong the life of my daily makeup.</li>
            <li> If you want a BB cream that will truly do all of these things, has a higher spf</li>
            <li> the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can put it on fairly thickly and it feels like a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This product was the first BB cream I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> the cream cause me to sweat more, and since I used it as a moisturizer my makeup would get ruined because of the constant sweating.</li>
            <li> Then to top things off after 2 weeks of usage, suddenly my face broke out overnight, everywhere on my face</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> First off I have to say I don&#x27;t think the people giving it one star</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product the first time I tried it.  </li>
            <li> The first time I tried the Olay Fresh Effects Bb Cream, I didn&#x27;t really see a difference in my skin as I put it on.  </li>
            <li> more polished, and just more \\&quot;put together\\&quot; than it usually does.  </li>
            <li> This was my first experience with BB cream.</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer/conditioner/makeup all in one!</li>
            <li> I could use this perhaps in the summer, when I want more of a sheer look.</li>
            <li> I tried this out on my wife who is an avid foundation and sunscreen wearer.  </li>
            <li> This is my first experience with a \\&quot;BB\\&quot; product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll help smooth out your skin, but it won&#x27;t completely hide imperfections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works great, and helps with my dry skin, oily skin, and red flaky skin.</li>
            <li> It is light coverage, so it didn&#x27;t cover my freckles or redness, but it make me look a little more even.</li>
            <li> Love the way it smels and goes on, but a little too light.  </li>
            <li> Although it did cover somewhat I saw a distinctive unfavorable yellowish cast...made me look strange, Perhaps it will be better when I am not in winter skin mode.</li>
            <li> some color correction wouldbe worth the time to apply it, light enough that I don&#x27;t feel I&#x27;m wearing foundation that I don&#x27;t really need/want, and the moisturizing and SPF</li>
            <li> Sadly, I have too many skin issues to wear any kind of BB cream, I simply need more coverage.</li>
            <li> It is light enough to wear during the hot summer.</li>
            <li> so i don&#x27;t look either shiny or too dry where the powder sits on top of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and people always complimented how great my skin look (weird but true).</li>
            <li> My husband even commented on the scent as too strong after I washed it off - from several feet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s in a bigger package than I expected, has a pleasant scent, and gives my skin a pleasing glow.  </li>
            <li> I think this is a much more natural appearance than a foundation that makes your whole face the exact same color, from hairline to chin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives a very light coverage and the colour was not what I expected it to me.  </li>
            <li> The moisturizer helps with the fine lines, and the color doesn&#x27;t sink into the larger wrinkles like some foundations</li>
            <li> I had very high hopes for this BB cream becuase</li>
            <li> If you go with the BB creams that have higher SPF they usually use zinc oxide which can make your skin look very light, and Olay Fresh Effects didn&#x27;t have that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It went on as a light smooth layer and didn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy in any way -</li>
            <li> way to much for the performance do not buy</li>
            <li> What I really like about this is....</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> foundations look really cakey.</li>
            <li> and it really covers all</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s light and translucent but smooths out the red in my skin and provides sun protection.  </li>
            <li> It does not offer much in the way of coverage.</li>
            <li> really like the feel  and look on my face and the tops of my hands.  </li>
            <li> I had to really blend blend blend</li>
            <li> This may be the reason it felt so light, but may also contribute to one of my big negatives - it gave NO coverage/correction at all.</li>
            <li> Automatically goes into my &#x27;absolutely can not wear again&#x27; list.</li>
            <li> the whole - not for me.</li>
            <li> some do - it blends very well into my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> after a week of use I have not broken out.  </li>
            <li> I really like the way this makes my skin look and feel</li>
            <li> The left (Garnier side)looked cakey and accentuated the wrinkles and too light for my skin.</li>
            <li> It made all of my skin oily, I guess technically it did smooth it</li>
            <li> B0079HNKLI Smashbox Camera Ready BB Cream SPF 35 Light/Medium]]</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like spending too much time or money on my skin...</li>
            <li> And this one i got from Amazon is much cheaper than the one I got from supermarket.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I&#x27;m very used to wearing moisturizers with SPF.</li>
            <li> So if you want to avoid having bumps on your face anddo not use this product the sun block really clogs pores.</li>
            <li> Plus, it has really evened out my skin tone</li>
            <li> This one is really creamy and</li>
            <li> I have used Oil of Olay for years as a moisturizer and really like it.</li>
            <li> Very oily and no coverage.</li>
            <li> really understand what a BB cream is used for.</li>
            <li> It will not replace makeup for coverage or how much it evens your tone.  </li>
            <li> also really like the moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> I wondered if it was really doing anything.</li>
            <li> My face looked much smoother,</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;tint\\&quot; wasn&#x27;t enough to cover even my light skin.</li>
            <li> I really like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it really does, that I&#x27;ve seen</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just part of the whole \\&quot;sitting on my skin\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several BB creams, and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> After having used a few of the Olay Fresh Effects, I am in love with this collection.</li>
            <li> I mean it is touted as being able to smooth your skin.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice amount of moister, though with my dry skin I need extra moister first.  </li>
            <li> B009UTCT6U Dr. Jart+ Black Label Detox BB Beauty Balm]] is a relatively new one, but, WOW it has really gorgeous</li>
            <li> I have fair skin with a ton of freckles and not exactly the same color skin all over my face...until I started using this.  </li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this new BB cream from Olay, but the fragrance in it was a little too strong for my skin.</li>
            <li> It gives me that touch of color I need in order to look alive and not completely pale in the mornings right after I wake up!</li>
            <li> One of the things that I didn&#x27;t like about this BB Cream is that it has very light coverage, it doesn&#x27;t cover dark spots caused by acne, for example.</li>
            <li> I find this is super heavy and pretty full coverage.</li>
            <li> do have to give this 4 star as opposed to 5 because the two color options are only good for people with fair to medium skin, and not particularly good for people with olive to dark skin.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re sensitive to fragrances, this would likely be too strong for you.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have olive skin, that more on the dark side of medium.  </li>
            <li> As I said, my skin is pretty sensitive</li>
            <li> I am a BIG fan of Olay products--my bathroom is full of Olay lotions, eye creams, etc.--and generally find them to be high quality, useful products.</li>
            <li> I really like that Olay offers a few different shades for their Bb Cream, because I have very fair skin, especially here in the wintertime, and those brands that go for a one-shade-suits-</li>
            <li> cream is a light beige-ish color, and is fairly thick but smooth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m older now</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It did provide me with the level of coverage that I expected from a product like this, however, after several hours of wearing it I discovered dark circles under my eyes because it had dissolved my very good waterproof mascara.  </li>
            <li> It does not cover my zits and dark spots but it makes them less noticeable, which is great for me because I cannot use concealer.  </li>
            <li> I also have very fair skin, and because this is only slightly tinted, it does not show up as orange or pink on my face like</li>
            <li> My new favorite basic that I use daily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another positive aspect is that it evens out skin tone/complexion - but as expected, not as thoroughly as a true base/foundation would.  </li>
            <li> I tried the Light to Medium shade, which was just about right for my complexion which tends toward the pale of the medium end of the spectrum.</li>
            <li> First, a little background -- I&#x27;m middle aged, with fair, sensitive skin, I don&#x27;t work outside the home, so I don&#x27;t need to \\&quot;make up\\&quot; most of the time.  </li>
            <li> It definitely speeds up my morning and helps make you pretty but not over made up!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any sort of correction for the most part, it made my face a little brighter</li>
            <li> (warning: Smashbox BB Cream is expensive, but it works great for oily skin).</li>
            <li> There were several days over Christmas break that I didn&#x27;t use it, and I experienced increased breakouts, and many painful spots.</li>
            <li> For really stubborn spots, I still needed to apply some concealer, but I wasn&#x27;t surprised; after all, this is a tinted moisturizer, not a foundation.  </li>
            <li> Product goes on like normal moisturizer, wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone looking to substitute foundation</li>
            <li> , my face looked fairly normal, so I decide to give the cream another go.  </li>
            <li> and I wanted some coverage without using foundation since most foundations just feel too heavy to me.  </li>
            <li> In case you&#x27;re wondering, my wife reviewed this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using another manufacturer&#x27;s BB cream for several months when I got the tube of Olay&#x27;s Fresh Effects BB cream.  </li>
            <li> Olay fresh effects is the only one that feels like a moisturizer and doesn&#x27;t give me color but makes my face look balanced.</li>
            <li> it gave me just enough coverage to look fresh and awake.</li>
            <li> My skin is noticeably softer at the end of the day when I&#x27;ve worn this cream, rather than my normal moisturizer plus foundation routine.  </li>
            <li> But as I turn 40 this year, I think I&#x27;m going to appreciate the extra polish that the Olay Fresh Effects Bb Cream gives my skin.  </li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s probably because I&#x27;m not wearing the Fresh Effects Cream on a daily basis (which has nothing to do with the product and everything to do with how my life is ordered at the moment).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was sitting on the shelf right next to another BB cream that said it would specifically NOT make your face oily or greasy.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any light reflecting pigments like some other BB creams.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida</li>
            <li> Expected better coverage and left skin feeling oily.</li>
            <li> The effects are subtle, but nice.  </li>
            <li> When I first put it on I was worried about the fragrance, I usually buy fragrance free</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 54 and people frequently think I&#x27;m my daughter&#x27;s (24) older sister.</li>
            <li> It goes on almost exactly like a normal facial lotion, and doesn&#x27;t flake or pill.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned with dark circles and Olay BB cream did not cover up the dark circles; I had to still use cover up on them.  </li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m going out, I add a little foundation to it, mix it together and smooth it on for a little more coverage.  </li>
            <li> I have to say I was very surprised with this product, it was not greasy like some BB creams and it didn&#x27;t cause my skin to misbehave at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different BB creams by other top drug store brands, and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> The Olay Fresh Effects does have a slight melon smell and a warning to stop using it if you develop a rash, so be aware of that.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to people who don&#x27;t already have fairly nice skin; this is very sheer, and your skin definitely &amp;#34;comes through.&amp;#34; However, it&#x27;s a very nice product for people who only have a few slight discolorations or just want a</li>
            <li> My 17 year old daughter loves this product!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really natural looking on the skin !</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin prone to break-outs (still, at age 38!)</li>
            <li> I especially like the fact that it is SPF 15 which eliminates the hassle of trying to be sure that my moisturizer or other product has a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> shades are to dark as often light med.</li>
            <li> but it definitely looked better than it does with only a regular moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a tint to it, which is pretty sheer.  </li>
            <li> Instead, it just kind of floats on top, or at least that&#x27;s the sensation I get, especially after I&#x27;ve worn it for a few hours.  </li>
            <li> So, first of all, be careful how much you use.</li>
            <li> The lotion has sunscreen, SPF 15, which is minimal but probably adequate.  </li>
            <li> I am middle aged and think it would be suitable for younger.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers say it is thin and greasy, but this is the thickest BB cream I&#x27;ve used yet with the most coverage, and while other BB creams left my face very shiny (to the point I had to either use mattifier underneath or powder over top), this one does not.</li>
            <li> The ones I have tried in the department store have more coverage - which I need - and therefore I use those under my regular foundation on days that I need a little bit more camouflage than usual.  </li>
            <li> Just a little too light</li>
            <li> I just smooth it on after my shower over my face and neck, slap on a little blush</li>
            <li> one aspect that is not ideal is that I am very fair, and this is a bit too dark.  </li>
            <li> I am an adult who still experiences acne and sensitive skin, so after Olay stopped producing the moisturizer for acne</li>
            <li> My face also had red splotches and a very itchy feeling accompanied.</li>
            <li> Very sheer coverage if any and Very oily.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a heavy make-up...</li>
            <li> I try not to get it too close to my eyes because I think I am a bit sensitive to it</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m 29 years old.</li>
            <li> I also have been using it on the tops of my almost 60 year old hands.  </li>
            <li> It may work for others, but not for me or my not so sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a 60-year old woman and sun/age spots have become an issue for me.</li>
            <li> blends effortlessly with your natural skin tone, helping hide imperfections and minizing the need for concealer and foundation.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried wearing it even after the headache began in the hopes that the scent would fade a bit - it didn&#x27;t fade, or didn&#x27;t do so fast enough for me to notice it.</li>
            <li> skin looks &#x27;dewy&#x27;, soft, and</li>
            <li> I now have to use it with primer or it becomes very shiny and wrinkly, if that&#x27;s possible?</li>
            <li> - doesn&#x27;t do much to cover problem areas such as acne, enlarged pores&lt;</li>
            <li> It does seem to offer a bit of coverage while still feeling natural.  </li>
            <li> I did notice after some time in natural sunlight</li>
            <li> prone sensitive skin type.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was surprised that my normally sensitive skin didn&#x27;t have any issues with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so you still have a natural look.</li>
            <li> only problem that I have with this is the coverage, It doesn&#x27;t provide much at all.</li>
            <li> (I am 53 years old.))</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I have sensitive, breakout-prone skin that reacts to almost ANYTHING, so when I used this and found my breakouts decreasing, it was a godsend.</li>
            <li> It works well with my sensitive skin, no problems.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;BB creams are supposed to hydrate but this left my skin really, really shiny ... \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; looking.</li>
            <li> it still looked natural ...</li>
            <li> and I was surprised</li>
            <li> It is also fragrant, so if you are sensitive to perfumes, this is not for you.  </li>
            <li> , she&#x27;s not in the sun as much as in the summer, so we can&#x27;t speak totally to its sunscreening abilities.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even said to leave skin glowing and naturally even after just one use.  </li>
            <li> Most BB Creams are designed to last all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin and as a result I am not a huge fan of a lot of tinted moisturizers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For those like myself who are fragrance sensitive, the smell of this product really bothered me the first time I used it, but bothered me less today when I did the video review.</li>
            <li> I have light to pale skin, med.</li>
            <li> far as coverage, the Olay Fresh Effects BB Cream does as well as some of the other products I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this product, I got a little zealous with my application, and wasted more than I should have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greasy.</li>
            <li> It contains SPF 15 which is fine for me as I don&#x27;t spend excessive amounts of time</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel as dried out as the Neutrogena shine control cleanser, but leaves it feeling clean.</li>
            <li> I found this to be true, in fact I skipped a day or two when I was running late and could really tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> The coverage is sheer, but better than a lot of the others, and it covers enough that I can hardly see my dark circles and light blemishes</li>
            <li> I usually finish with a light dusting of a mineral foundation powder.  </li>
            <li> With an SPF of 15, it&#x27;s not a heavy-duty sunscreen, but for casual, everyday use, it&#x27;s perfectly acceptable, though for longer wear outside, you might want to layer it with another sunscreen-containing product or a face-formulated sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very light coverage, so I still need to use a cover up, and I use a mineral powder after applying, because as other reviewers state, it does make you look a little bit greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Skin Perfecting Moisturizer with Sunscreen-Light to Medium because beauty balms (BBs) are the new big thing in skin creams, or so the magazines would have us believe.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel like this product had very  much tint or coverage compared to other BB creams I have used.  </li>
            <li> It does not due miracles</li>
            <li> I have some freckles and small age spots, and they are visible through the cream, but the contrast has been reduced significantly.  </li>
            <li> I generally like Olay products, but this was a no from me.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t heavy or clogged my pores either.&lt;br /&gt;- Smells fresh.</li>
            <li> Well, I didn&#x27;t see that happen, sorry to say, but when I used the Fresh Effects Cream, it did provide a nice layer of sheer color on my face, evening things out and toning down any patchy skin or blemishes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this for younger users with normal to dry, not too sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The previous product has been relegated to my travel bag, and the Olay Fresh Effects is now my daily choice.</li>
            <li> I simply cannot use this product because it made me break out so profoundly.</li>
            <li> The pores still appear large, and do not cover any imperfections on the skin, a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> my only complaint is I wish they would go cruelty free as once this runs out</li>
            <li> I have tried the a number of different BB creams and they made me look older because my skin is dry.</li>
            <li> far, I&#x27;ve found BB creams to be something I&#x27;d use in addition to my other make-up but haven&#x27;t found any that would completely replace them.</li>
            <li> As a busy mom, I especially like that there isn&#x27;t an extra step or extra weight involved in wearing it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is an inch-long list of inactive ingredients on the box with many syllables and a third of the back of the tube is taken up by warnings (like not to use this on broken skin, keep out of eyes, etc.).</li>
            <li> the Olay Fresh Effects BB Cream, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s nice about this product is that it does have a hint of color that smooths over a few discolorations and ever so slightly tones down my under eye circles.</li>
            <li> I also have huge pores on my nose - it helps very little in this area - I have to use other pore-minimizing products for that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Iâ€™ve been having breakouts for a few months now, so I cannot use certain make-up products.</li>
            <li> I am 62 years old with very dry skin</li>
            <li> With a little blush, I am ready to go to work.  </li>
            <li> This worked as a moisturizer/SPF from what little I tested of it, but the tint was too sheer to really get any correction/coverage</li>
            <li> Too bad because I loved the price and the concept.</li>
            <li> I usually use a daily moisturizer and have sensitive skin that tends to break out when I try a new product.  </li>
            <li> The cream is very thick and rich, almost like a mousse.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;ve just scrubbed my skin, or used a harsh cleanser or toner, this BB cream makes my skin a little bit red, but it quickly dissipates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use a small amount of the BB, and don&#x27;t blend as much</li>
            <li> Second, I only used it a couple times, a few days apart, and it made my 38 year old face break out like it was 14...</li>
            <li> Not really good for evening skin tone but all right as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> At last spread all over face and neck and let dry.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the only one that works for my dry acne</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different brands and so far, I like this one</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I have dry, rough, uneven, sensitive mature skin.  </li>
            <li> This takes a little work, as I am not particularly dark complected, nor am I particularly fair-I am generally in the light-medium category, but this cream was not a good match at all for my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> This cream is like water, and to top it all off, my face itched like crazy every time I tried to use it.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take long to blend in and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue or any streaks.</li>
            <li> However, my sensitive skin broke out after a few days of use of this product.  </li>
            <li> It had a gritty texture that made my skin feel like it was being scratched every time I put it on, and it made my skin look extremely greasy.</li>
            <li> I never go out other house to car, car to store and back</li>
            <li> and I think almost highlighted in a bad way - they seemed more obvious to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get dry skin from the weather here and</li>
            <li> but I think if you don&#x27;t have dry skin it would be too oily.</li>
            <li> I like this product for moisturizing dry winter skin and protecting my face from the sun.</li>
            <li> product may work for some people with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried every single BB cream, whether it is drug store or prestige.  </li>
            <li> all approach can sometimes be just dark enough that I have that telltale Oopma-Loompa line at the jaw.  </li>
            <li> I applied a pretty thin coating that I expect to not just sit on the surface but to sink in a bit and moisturize.</li>
            <li> I find that other BB creams are thick and have too much pigment.  </li>
            <li> I then put a small dab of the Garnier on a white cotton pad along with the Olay and smeared into the white pad and let it sit.</li>
            <li> If you typically utilize Olay products and have no issues, you likely can use this product.  </li>
            <li> now I can do the same thing with less time.  </li>
            <li> Sadly those feelings changed quickly when I noticed how greasy my face felt and</li>
            <li> Initially I thought it felt a little bit greasy</li>
            <li> I finished my look with mineral powder and the me I see in my mirror looks a little younger already!</li>
            <li> Looks natural and hardly notice that there is anything on my face.</li>
            <li> The consistency is silky, not greasy (it seems less \\&quot;runny\\&quot; than the other product) and evens out my overall skin tone, including any reddish areas.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and was really frustrated when I could no longer find it on the shelves of the stores I shop at.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several BB creams in the past and they tended to leave a grey sheen/undertone.</li>
            <li> I wear the Olay BB Cream daily, as a replacement to heavy foundations.</li>
            <li> As I said earlier, when I missed a few days I could tell the difference.  </li>
            <li> Another con is that it makes my skin look very oily (considering that I have a combination skin, it looks worse).</li>
            <li> Curiously satisfied--probably won&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> That being said, the coverage is minimal and I found myself wishing I had stuck with the Garnier BB cream for the days I don&#x27;t feel like wearing foundation.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely not recommend this product</li>
            <li> A few hours after using this product my face started turning red and swelling up.</li>
            <li> What I got was thin, greasy cream that did absolutely nothing that I could see.</li>
            <li> Not really what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This Olay BB Cream doesn&#x27;t come even closed of meeting my expectations.</li>
            <li> The cover is very sheer, so I had to be a bit heavy handed with it to get the coverage that I wanted.</li>
            <li> Though it&#x27;s a moisturizer, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it really sinks into my skin.  </li>
            <li> However, for the temporary improvement it provides as well as its performance as a sunscreen, I&#x27;d still rank it as a nice addition to my makeup regimen.  </li>
            <li> However, for the temporary improvement it provides as well as its performance as a sunscreen, I&#x27;d still rank it as a nice addition to my makeup regimen.  </li>
            <li> With only SPF 15 and directions to apply every 2 hours, I could not trust this alone to protect my pale skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and some acne scars and while this provides some coverage, it&#x27;s certainly not something you can wear to replace your foundation if you have problem</li>
            <li> do (I have very sensitive skin and usually do not fair well with cheaper brands).  </li>
            <li> My skin feels less dry when I use this cream.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve been putting on Olay lotion pretty thick before using makeup to make it spread and not cover so thickly...</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin or even not this stuff is not good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not fond of SPF in my moisturizers because it usually feels heavy and greasy on my face, and it usually doesn&#x27;t moisturize my skin as much as I need.  </li>
            <li> and I have yet to have a problem with this or any other Olay product.</li>
            <li> well, for starters, I had to wash it off after about an hour due to the scent.</li>
            <li> I know that the description of this product says BB Cream AND Tinted Moisturizer (which a product should be one or the other, not both), but I wanted to try it anyhow.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t think this would replace my other products, I use Laura Geller Bronze Spackle (primer) and Brighten and Balance</li>
            <li> I wish now I would have tried the other.</li>
            <li> this is not for you and other BB creams aren&#x27;t either.</li>
            <li> , I still need primer due to dull/rough/dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it as much as my other BB cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a Bb cream or a tinted moisturizer before, so I can&#x27;t compare this to other Bb creams or tinted moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t cover like one, and it makes my skin a little dry if i wear it by itself.  </li>
            <li> The active ingredients on the tube are sunscreens, and the instructions say to reapply every two hours-which, to me, defeats the purpose of a 24 hour moisturizing cream.  </li>
            <li> you have a chance, pop over to Sephora or Ulta and try a few BB cremes from a few different cosmetic companies.</li>
            <li> The product does have the active ingredients to protect from UVA and UVB rays, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> I also always have little flakes of dry skin on my forehead in the winter, but after a couple days of using this they are gone!  </li>
            <li> This is one of the better BB creams I&#x27;ve tried - and one of the least expensive, but I haven&#x27;t found one that would replace all my usual make-up.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and can only say one negative thing.  </li>
            <li> I am not much for heavy makeup.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear scents - I&#x27;m sensitive to strong scent as it gives me horrible migraines</li>
            <li> I prefer hands down the Clinique version.  </li>
            <li> This one did not let me down.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed some evening of skin tone and clearer complexion, but can&#x27;t say if it is the BB cream working or if I am just wearing less makeup (I.e no powder and foundation) and that has cleared my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s half the price than in stores here.</li>
            <li> (maybe my toner irritated my skin the previous day).  </li>
            <li> This product is your typical - you get what you pay for...</li>
            <li> I also found this shade to be a little too dark for my skin in the winter.</li>
            <li> This is not good, I think to myself, so I wash my face, thereby removing the skin benefiting cream, and take some generic Benedryl.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am having a rough or lazy morning</li>
            <li> I look in the mirror, and I see the reddened skin (from the blending, you know), and little bumps.  </li>
            <li> There was little tint and little to no coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Claims</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thicker than I like.</li>
            <li> I usually wear SPF 30-50 lotion under my makeup, but I was in a rush the other day and decided to use this instead of both.</li>
            <li> If I got a little bit of sun, it would be okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It made me look a little pastey.</li>
            <li> I have a suggestion: with the lighter color tones, Olay may want to up the SPF a little.</li>
            <li> They looked a little wierd.</li>
            <li> and if i get a little tan on my face, i may have to stop using this.  </li>
            <li> However, I certainly prefer it to a chemical or artificial</li>
            <li> Also, unlike some moisturizers or BB creams it doesn&#x27;t have a heavy scent.</li>
            <li> Not as heavy as foundation, so it doesn&#x27;t get cakey and clog pores.</li>
            <li> but in a few minutes that feeling had gone away.  </li>
            <li> However, after a few hours my skin is so oily and greasy looking that my boyfriend kept asking me why I was sweating.</li>
            <li> So for me it was just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Bumpy blotchy uneven skin is supposed to be reduced by judicious application of cosmetic creams, not caused by them.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, I don&#x27;t recommend you waste your money.your money.</li>
            <li> I think, but the uneven tones were still there</li>
            <li> Now to find a moisturizer that feels just like this, but without the heavy perfume.</li>
            <li> I feel like it&#x27;s so heavy</li>
            <li> My skin was still uneven looking&lt;</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t like anything too heavy.  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s heavy SPF in it</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy as I put it on, or as I wear it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had no problems with it after using it for a few months.  </li>
            <li> So I appreciated this Olay product that combines moisturizer and sunscreen with just enough tint to compensate for a base coverup.</li>
            <li> &quot; it up a bit, making me look not so pale.</li>
            <li> I have very pale skin, and this was just a hair too dark for me.</li>
            <li> I looked like a mess!</li>
            <li> Sadly, this one was a major disappointment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually just moisturize, add a little bit of eye makeup, and go.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting the age spots on my hands, so the sun screen will help stop that, or slow it down a bit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Add a small amount of blusher, mascara and lip gloss an</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not sure if that will change in the summer when my skin gets greasier, but until then I&#x27;ll continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> It did hydrate my skin into an oil slick</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;shimmer&amp;#34; is bascally small glitter that goes into your pores.</li>
            <li> And, even though I used a small amount, when the wind blew, my hair literally stuck to my face.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it does not live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever like the smell of any concealer, BB cream, foundation, etc</li>
            <li> It moisturizes my skin, protects it with SPF, and evens out my skintone so my foundation doesn&#x27;t need to work as hard.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for something to moisturize with a little tint to even your skin this is for you!!</li>
            <li> at least not during the winter months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a mineral foundation base that goes on very silky.  </li>
            <li> &quot; they mean shiny, then it did do this&lt;</li>
            <li> Worst of all, after just about a week of use my skin (which is usually clear and is not sensitive) started breaking out all over.</li>
            <li> I apparently had a bad reaction to something in this product.</li>
            <li> This product is not good for your skin at all.</li>
            <li> Contact dermatitis is not a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than the unpleasant skin reaction, I like the way the cream felt on my fingers, and the smell was tolerable.  </li>
            <li> Very thick.</li>
            <li> Will give it another try, but doubtful the outcome will be different.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended I stop using this product because it was clogging my pores and irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> I was also confused as the directions said to re-apply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of foundation; it feels like my skin can&#x27;t breathe and looks so fake!</li>
            <li> very disappointed i actually bought this at at store for 14 dollars!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Sadly, that feeling did not go away in a minutes like I had hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know, this is a weird thing to mention</li>
            <li> Also, the napkins were covered in \\&quot;color or foundation.\\&quot; I do NOT wear make up, so I was not fond of the color my face was leaving behind on everything I touched!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it was just ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell</li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t go wrong with Olay.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a rather uncomfortable sensation, as though the cream is going to rub off onto anything I touch.  </li>
            <li> It did not refresh for me since it made me feel dirty and oily</li>
            <li> Its crazy what they expect you to pay at walmart or walgreens</li>
            <li> However, the bb cream leaves a greasy feeling and after wearing both for three days my face started breaking out really badly.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too bad this makes your face look wet/oily.  </li>
            <li> Bad...</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> How inconvenient!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s day 2 of an oily and a greasy face :(</li>
            <li> I use it as a base and then touch up with concealer where needed.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed, as I use a lot of Olay products.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> and i broke out horribly from this product</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t terrible and it does provide moisture.</li>
            <li> Worst part I broke out badly!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This one is horrible!</li>
            <li> After two days of wearing this &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; my face broke out terribly.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s almost impossible to get makeup that work!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was surprised by how much I liked this product. I have tried several BB creams in the past and they tended to leave a grey sheen/undertone. I have fair skin with peach undertones and this product really enhanced that. The product reminds me of Clinque&#x27;s Almost Makeup, before they discontinued it. I wear the Olay BB Cream daily, as a replacement to heavy foundations. It is light enough to wear during the hot summer. I started out using the the fair to light shade, but am replacing it with the light to medium shade now since I will probably get some sun this summer. Overall, is a great bargain for the price if you are looking for sheer coverage. I have noticed some evening of skin tone and clearer complexion, but can&#x27;t say if it is the BB cream working or if I am just wearing less makeup (I.e no powder and foundation) and that has cleared my face. Would recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> I suppose it looks nice.... but it smells! Not a bad smell, a nice one, but strong and perfumy! Fragrance should not be used on your face. This product is not good for your skin at all. Plus, it was also to oily.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Goes on smooth and blends nicely.</li>
            <li> My 17 year old daughter loves this product!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love anything by Olay. I am an adult who still experiences acne and sensitive skin, so after Olay stopped producing the moisturizer for acne I started using the total effects moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give this one a try along with the fresh effects satin moisturizer. I love the feel of the satin moisturizer. However, the bb cream leaves a greasy feeling and after wearing both for three days my face started breaking out really badly. My face also had red splotches and a very itchy feeling accompanied. I stopped using both products.</li>
            <li> This product makes your skin feel great. It also covers a lot of flaws and makes your skin appear more even. You can see and feel a difference in the first use. Also, unlike some moisturizers or BB creams it doesn&#x27;t have a heavy scent.</li>
            <li> I really like this bb cream:) it&#x27;s really natural looking on the skin !</li>
            <li> Great product and fantastic price.  Beats my big box store prices to bits!</li>
            <li> Love how natural my face looks and feels.</li>
            <li> Very sheer coverage if any and Very oily.</li>
            <li> I am a healthcare professional that spends most of my day wearing a mask and surgical hat.  Because of this I don&#x27;t like to wear makeup to work.  I received the Olay Fresh Effects BB cream-Light to Medium complimentary from Influenster to test.  I usually use a daily moisturizer and have sensitive skin that tends to break out when I try a new product.  I have to say I was very surprised with this product, it was not greasy like some BB creams and it didn&#x27;t cause my skin to misbehave at all.  Olay states that their BB Cream takes care of the following 6 needs in 1:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Refreshes. This moisturizer is supposed to refresh your skin with 24 hour hydration. I found this to be true, in fact I skipped a day or two when I was running late and could really tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Brightens. My complexion is very fair so I feel that this \\&quot;perked\\&quot; it up a bit, making me look not so pale. Add a small amount of blusher, mascara and lip gloss an you have a nice daytime look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Evens tone. My skin tone is fairy even so I can&#x27;t comment on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Hydrates. My skin feels less dry when I use this cream. As I said earlier, when I missed a few days I could tell the difference.  I would necessarily attribute it to this products superiority as my daily moisturizer hydrates just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) Smooths. My skin does feel smoother and healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) Protects. I live in Florida so SPF is a must! It contains SPF 15 which is fine for me as I don&#x27;t spend excessive amounts of time outside!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I received this product to test, I will definitely purchase it when I run out of what I have.  For me it is a great alternative to foundation, it goes on pretty sheer and doesn&#x27;t look overdone.  It blends in nicely with my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a makeup mask on my mask that I wear when treating patients.  It has a pleasant smell and a little goes a long way.  The only improvement I could suggest to Olay is to add extra SPF. It definitely speeds up my morning and helps make you pretty but not over made up!  You can find more information on this product by going to [...] and purchase at either [...] and http://www.amazon.com.</li>
            <li> it gave me coverage but at the end off the day i would take it off and i had a rash and i broke out horribly from this product very disappointed i actually bought this at at store for 14 dollars!!!!!!! way to much for the performance do not buy</li>
            <li> I love this product and was really frustrated when I could no longer find it on the shelves of the stores I shop at.  I am a fair, freckled, 40+ woman. With this product I get dewy looking skin with sunscreen built in. Plus it smells great without being overpowering.  What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream.  It is a very light weight cream with a touch of coverage.  It is very dry in Colorado, so it feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> worked well, dark enough for my skin tone, covers imperfections very nicely and makes you look good. Buy it now.</li>
            <li> This product is a bit oilier than the Olay brand, but it is nice to put two steps into one.</li>
            <li> Just a little too light but I like it for the sunscreen effect.</li>
            <li> It made my skin looks smooth and healthy.  With a little blush, I am ready to go to work.  Simple and beautiful.</li>
            <li> One of the things that I didn&#x27;t like about this BB Cream is that it has very light coverage, it doesn&#x27;t cover dark spots caused by acne, for example. Another con is that it makes my skin look very oily (considering that I have a combination skin, it looks worse).</li>
            <li> What I really like about this is....it&#x27;s not a heavy make-up...instead, it&#x27;s a light tinted moisturizer</li>
            <li> This product has really made a difference in the appearance of my skin! Wonderful!</li>
            <li> Very thick. Not really good for evening skin tone but all right as a moisturizer.  The tint is minimal at best</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different BB creams by other top drug store brands, and this is by far my favorite. The coverage is sheer, but better than a lot of the others, and it covers enough that I can hardly see my dark circles and light blemishes though I don&#x27;t have many. It also smells really good. I hardly ever like the smell of any concealer, BB cream, foundation, etc and this one wasn&#x27;t offensive at all. I have pretty sensitive skin and this didn&#x27;t break my skin out at all.</li>
            <li> The lotion goes on smoothly, provides good moisture, and give a nice, light coverage. Not as heavy as foundation, so it doesn&#x27;t get cakey and clog pores.</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer.  It is very light &amp; not greasy at all.  I wear it as a foundation.  It is a nice color (I got the light to medium, works well for me).  True, it does not cover everything, but is good enough for me.  I finish with a mineral veil powder.  I am not much for heavy makeup.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Great buy, Great Seller!!</li>
            <li> Item isn&#x27;t satisfactory coverage. Will give it another try, but doubtful the outcome will be different. Curiously satisfied--probably won&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t terrible and it does provide moisture. That being said, the coverage is minimal and I found myself wishing I had stuck with the Garnier BB cream for the days I don&#x27;t feel like wearing foundation. If you just want a general evening of tone, light moisturizing, and a bit of sunscreen, this would be perfect but don&#x27;t expect it to do a lot of work for your skin.</li>
            <li> I have to wonder if the formula has been changed since some of these reviews were written because it seems like we&#x27;re reviewing two different products. I&#x27;ve tried several BB creams, and this is by far my favorite. Some reviewers say it is thin and greasy, but this is the thickest BB cream I&#x27;ve used yet with the most coverage, and while other BB creams left my face very shiny (to the point I had to either use mattifier underneath or powder over top), this one does not. It is a bit tacky after first putting it on (so put your eye makeup on first), but once it sets, it stays put. It&#x27;s the longest-lasting BB cream I&#x27;ve used. When I have it on, my skin looks smooth and even and luminous, and my pores are noticeably minimized. The color also suits me perfectly. I have sensitive skin prone to break-outs (still, at age 38!) and I have yet to have a problem with this or any other Olay product. I love the concept of BB creams and the ease of use, and I am so glad I finally found the perfect one for me!</li>
            <li> I loved this product when I first got it. Four stars only because I broke out the next day. Otherwise it does what it&#x27;s supposed to. I&#x27;m going back to neutrogena. It&#x27;s a bit more money but worth it after trying this.</li>
            <li> I bought this on Amazon after I tried my roommates out. It&#x27;s half the price than in stores here. I get dry skin from the weather here and foundations look really cakey. This does help with dryness, nice light coverage but I think if you don&#x27;t have dry skin it would be too oily.</li>
            <li> This is the best tinted moisturizer!! It&#x27;s light and makes my skin looks great! It smells amazing too!</li>
            <li> I love this tinted moisturizer, it&#x27;s a good shade and I love how smooth it makes my skin feel. It&#x27;s not sticky or gross feeling and it leaves me feeling more polished.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is great to use as a light makeup to even out skin tone and of course for it&#x27;s SPF</li>
            <li> Love it.  It covers well and protects well with the Spf.  I wish the spring was higher.&lt;br /&gt;Great love it.</li>
            <li> I love this. It makes you look great without looking like you added anything to do so.Light and non-oily coverage</li>
            <li> Olay overall is the best product. I&#x27;ve been using this as if it is my foundation and it really covers all</li>
            <li> I like BB cream and have used garnier before. The price was good on the olay and I ordered the light to medium. It turns out to be too light for me though. Other than that it is a good product.</li>
            <li> This is the only makeup I use--  it&#x27;s light and translucent but smooths out the red in my skin and provides sun protection.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It works great, and helps with my dry skin, oily skin, and red flaky skin. Score!</li>
            <li> Does not replace foundation, but adds color. Good moisturizer. Olay products are a bargain and prove you don&#x27;t have to go broke to look great.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase and give this cream 5 stars. The cream is great for light, natural looking coverage with great hydration</li>
            <li> The coverage is quite light. Almost not there. But it is OK. I try not to get it too close to my eyes because I think I am a bit sensitive to it and it makes my eyes water.</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping for something that would give me light coverage, while also moisturizing my face. I was extremely disappointed. It had a gritty texture that made my skin feel like it was being scratched every time I put it on, and it made my skin look extremely greasy. Worst of all, after just about a week of use my skin (which is usually clear and is not sensitive) started breaking out all over. I would absolutely not recommend this product</li>
            <li> It makes me break out and I&#x27;m 29 years old. Too bad because I loved the price and the concept.</li>
            <li> First, this stuff was way too light for my skin.  Second, I only used it a couple times, a few days apart, and it made my 38 year old face break out like it was 14...</li>
            <li> Very nice if you just want a bit of color to run to the grocery store etc. Absorbs well.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and light on my face. They stopped selling it at my local target. It isn&#x27;t too oily and is the only bb cream that doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out.</li>
            <li> Expected better coverage and left skin feeling oily. Product goes on like normal moisturizer, wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone looking to substitute foundation</li>
            <li> When I first applied this product I was so happy with the even coverage and instant color. However this is not a 12 hour hold! Buy 4pm I looked like a mess! It just melted away. Not what I was expecting. In the directions it even says apply every 2 hours. How inconvenient! I will be looking for longer lasting creams from now on.</li>
            <li> This has not even the slightest coverage. More just a moisturizer than anything. Strong scent that lasts and burned my eyes. Worst part I broke out badly!!!!!! Love the fresh effects line just this product is the miss of them. Try the Garnier BB cream, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> As a woman in my 60&#x27;s I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would provide me with the moisturizer and light coverage that I was wanting.  I am very happy with my purchase.  It&#x27;s in a bigger package than I expected, has a pleasant scent, and gives my skin a pleasing glow.  Initially I thought it felt a little bit greasy but in a few minutes that feeling had gone away.  I liked the way my skin felt all day.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too bad this makes your face look wet/oily.  otherwise the color was perfect for  my skin.  if you don&#x27;t mind the oily look then go for it.</li>
            <li> I bought this last summer. I ran out and I bought it again.  It smells light, its not greasy. The color is light. It does not offer much in the way of coverage. But i use this under my foundation and I love it</li>
            <li> My new favorite basic that I use daily. Excellent for mature skin without being heavy or greasy. I love it</li>
            <li> I love the way the cream makes my skin look and feel when I first apply it. However, after a few hours my skin is so oily and greasy looking that my boyfriend kept asking me why I was sweating. Even using the shine control cleanser, which came as a free sample with the BB Cream didn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, I love the fresh effects shine control cleanser. It doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel as dried out as the Neutrogena shine control cleanser, but leaves it feeling clean.</li>
            <li> I actually got 2 tubes of this from my sister. She said she got a great deal and gave me the extras. Lucky me! Onto the review: Face it, this is a tinted moisturizer with SPF. I have light/medium skin with a bit of a summer tan, rosacea and light freckling. This Olay Fresh Effects cream applied really smoothly and the color looks great, not too yellow or orangey. It is light coverage, so it didn&#x27;t cover my freckles or redness, but it make me look a little more even. For the price, smoothness and good color matching, I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> A few hours after using this product my face started turning red and swelling up. For several days I looked like i&lt;br /&gt;I had been beaten up. I apparently had a bad reaction to something in this product. So for me it was just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Never knew this existed, but it&#x27;s perfect! It gives me that touch of color I need in order to look alive and not completely pale in the mornings right after I wake up! And it smells nice too! :)</li>
            <li> This cream is like water, and to top it all off, my face itched like crazy every time I tried to use it.  I am very disappointed, as I use a lot of Olay products.  This one is horrible!</li>
            <li> I just had to use this while I was healing from the TCP peel I had done.  The cream is pretty oily but the tint color is nice.  I don&#x27;t like my skin to look too oily.  Luckily, my skin heeled fast from the peel and I don&#x27;t have to use it anymore.  This would be great for someone with very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Love Olay Fresh Effects BB Cream!. Iâ€™ve been having breakouts for a few months now, so I cannot use certain make-up products. I decided to try this cream and Iâ€™ve been using it for about five days now. After using my on the spot medicated acne cream, I apply Olay Fresh Effects BB Cream. It does not cover my zits and dark spots but it makes them less noticeable, which is great for me because I cannot use concealer.  The cream makes my skin feel very smooth (even after washing it off) and it also has a very pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;My mom has flawless skin. She used the cream and it makes her look amazingly good. Itâ€™s like looking naturally beautiful!!!</li>
            <li> This tinted moisturizer works great.  I don&#x27;t need much makeup on my face, so this is ideal.  I can also use it as a foundation, then add a little make up over it if I want to look a little more flawless.  It&#x27;s got a sunscreen, so will help ward off those aging effects.  I also have been using it on the tops of my almost 60 year old hands.  It softens the skin and gives them a bit of a dewy look.  I&#x27;m getting the age spots on my hands, so the sun screen will help stop that, or slow it down a bit.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the feel  and look on my face and the tops of my hands.  A great product, if you&#x27;re not looking for made up make up look.  The effects are subtle, but nice.  I like the smell and can only say one negative thing.  I have olive skin, that more on the dark side of medium.  I should have probably got something darker than the \\&quot;light to medium\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Contact dermatitis is not a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose Olay Fresh Effects Bb Cream! Skin Perfecting Moisturizer with Sunscreen-Light to Medium because beauty balms (BBs) are the new big thing in skin creams, or so the magazines would have us believe.  So, when I was offered the opportunity to try the BB from Olay, I jumped at the chance.  Let&#x27;s just say it i may have made a mistake, albeit one that is not life-threatening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is a light beige-ish color, and is fairly thick but smooth.  The smell is noticeable, but not overpowering to my nose, but may be off-putting to some individuals.  The active ingredients on the tube are sunscreens, and the instructions say to reapply every two hours-which, to me, defeats the purpose of a 24 hour moisturizing cream.  Of course it will provide 24 hour moisture if you reapply it every two hours!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I washed and toned my skin, then squeezed out some of the bb cream onto my fingertips.  It was very nice feeling, almost silky, which is good, right?  I mean it is touted as being able to smooth your skin.  I apply the cream to my face, and blend it into my skin.  This takes a little work, as I am not particularly dark complected, nor am I particularly fair-I am generally in the light-medium category, but this cream was not a good match at all for my skin tone.  I had to really blend blend blend so I didn&#x27;t look like I was wearing foundation three shades to pale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I got the color minimized, I relaxed a bit before checking if my skin felt smooth and looked brighter and refreshed.  It did look brighter-actually reddish in color, but I chalked that up to overenthusiastic blending.  Then my skin started to tingle-refreshing!  Then it began to burn- uh oh.  I look in the mirror, and I see the reddened skin (from the blending, you know), and little bumps.  All over my face.  This is not good, I think to myself, so I wash my face, thereby removing the skin benefiting cream, and take some generic Benedryl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I awoke the next morning, my face looked fairly normal, so I decide to give the cream another go.  I wash my face and use toner, then I craftily wait fifteen or twenty minutes before applying the BB (maybe my toner irritated my skin the previous day).  I use a small amount of the BB, and don&#x27;t blend as much (so I looked a bit blotchy-I wasn&#x27;t going anywhere anytime soon).  Once again, the redness and tingling sensation begins, and the bumps appear in greater quantity than before.  Once more I wash my face, removing all traces of the BB cream, and pop another antihistamine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, this BB cream is not for me.  Bumpy blotchy uneven skin is supposed to be reduced by judicious application of cosmetic creams, not caused by them.  Other than the unpleasant skin reaction, I like the way the cream felt on my fingers, and the smell was tolerable.  It may work for others, but not for me or my not so sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I like this product for moisturizing dry winter skin and protecting my face from the sun. I&#x27;m not as happy with the tinted aspect. \\&quot;Minimizing the need for concealer and foundation\\&quot; is a bit of a stretch - it doesn&#x27;t do a good job of evening skin tone, concealing or adding color. I still needed just as much foundation on top.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1RGB9XQASGUIY]]I had been wanting to try a BB cream for some time as they seem to be all the rage these days, so I was happy to have the opportunity to use and review this one by Olay. I am a BIG fan of Olay products--my bathroom is full of Olay lotions, eye creams, etc.--and generally find them to be high quality, useful products. Sadly, this one was a major disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a 60-year old woman and sun/age spots have become an issue for me. I very rarely use foundation, so I was hoping to get SOME level of coverage from this \\&quot;skin perfecting\\&quot; cream. What I got was thin, greasy cream that did absolutely nothing that I could see. There was little tint and little to no coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Claims made on the packaging:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Say bye-bye to blotches and imperfections and hello to instant skin-perfectin coverage.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;...blends effortlessly with your natural skin tone, helping hide imperfections and minizing the need for concealer and foundation.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you will see in the video, my sun spots are just as noticeable AFTER using this BB cream as they were before--just shinier, which isn&#x27;t something I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those like myself who are fragrance sensitive, the smell of this product really bothered me the first time I used it, but bothered me less today when I did the video review. It isn&#x27;t necessarily a perfumey smell but there is a smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active ingredients in this product:&lt;br /&gt;Avobenzone 3.0%&lt;br /&gt;Homosalate 4.0%&lt;br /&gt;Octisalate 4.5%&lt;br /&gt;Octocrylene 2.6%&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is an inch-long list of inactive ingredients on the box with many syllables and a third of the back of the tube is taken up by warnings (like not to use this on broken skin, keep out of eyes, etc.). Granted, when you put sunscreen in a product, there are going to be chemicals, but this just seemed like overkill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My guess is that this product is targeted to women who already have flawless skin. Otherwise, I don&#x27;t recommend you waste your money.your money.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start with the positives:&lt;br /&gt;This would be a great moisturizer for me (based on my admittedly limited use of it). It felt great on my skin and my skin was not oily or greasy with it (normal skin). It went on as a light smooth layer and didn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy in any way - I applied it VERY lightly though. This may be the reason it felt so light, but may also contribute to one of my big negatives - it gave NO coverage/correction at all. My face, even after washing it off, does feel softer even after just about an hour of wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad... well, for starters, I had to wash it off after about an hour due to the scent. The scent seems light and pretty, didn&#x27;t seem chemically or anything, I liked the scent - in the tube. On my face though, I can&#x27;t escape it when it gets to be \\&quot;too much\\&quot;. I don&#x27;t wear scents - I&#x27;m sensitive to strong scent as it gives me horrible migraines (mild scents are usually OK). Guess what I have now? Yeah, a scent-induced migraine from this product. Automatically goes into my &#x27;absolutely can not wear again&#x27; list. I tried wearing it even after the headache began in the hopes that the scent would fade a bit - it didn&#x27;t fade, or didn&#x27;t do so fast enough for me to notice it. Even after washing my face for 5 minutes with water and cleanser, I still smell it. My husband even commented on the scent as too strong after I washed it off - from several feet away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The maybe-good-maybe-bad... I used the fair to light in hopes that it would even out the tiny imperfections in my skin tone, it was so sheer it may as well have not been tinted. I don&#x27;t wear foundation or powder 99% of the time - my skin isn&#x27;t flawless, but it isn&#x27;t in dire need of correction or even moisturizer. Since I don&#x27;t bother with foundation, I probably should use a SPF moisturizer, but I find myself skipping the moisturizer most mornings as a \\&quot;not enough impact for the effort\\&quot;. I figured this might be a good product for me - some color correction wouldbe worth the time to apply it, light enough that I don&#x27;t feel I&#x27;m wearing foundation that I don&#x27;t really need/want, and the moisturizing and SPF I should have daily all in one step. This worked as a moisturizer/SPF from what little I tested of it, but the tint was too sheer to really get any correction/coverage - I&#x27;m not looking for this to replace concealer and foundation and powder, I didn&#x27;t expect miracle coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others mentioned greasy and left color everywhere - I&#x27;m guessing they applied it a LOT heavier than I did (and/or the issues develop after more than an hour) - and/or their skin just reacts differently than mine did. I applied a pretty thin coating that I expect to not just sit on the surface but to sink in a bit and moisturize. I didn&#x27;t see any sort of correction for the most part, it made my face a little brighter I think, but the uneven tones were still there and I think almost highlighted in a bad way - they seemed more obvious to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the whole - not for me. Now to find a moisturizer that feels just like this, but without the heavy perfume. If I could find that, I might skip the tinted / light correction need even. Olay - if you&#x27;re reading - do you make this kind of moisturizer without scent, please? Tinted or not.</li>
            <li> Love this BB Cream. I stumbled upon it accidentally when a friend let me try it. I pair this with just a pressed mineral powder and bronzer... thats is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks &#x27;dewy&#x27;, soft, and the mineral powder (from Sally Beauty) settles right in so i don&#x27;t look either shiny or too dry where the powder sits on top of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I am having a rough or lazy morning i just throw this on and go... evens out my tone &amp; protects from the sun.</li>
            <li> I have to say I&#x27;m not at all impressed. I thought this cream would help my face look fresher but it&#x27;s day 2 of an oily and a greasy face :( I don&#x27;t recommend this product it hasn&#x27;t helped me in the slightest!</li>
            <li> I find this is super heavy and pretty full coverage. I now have to use it with primer or it becomes very shiny and wrinkly, if that&#x27;s possible? I feel like it&#x27;s so heavy it creates lines where there are not any lines. I only use a dime sized amount and still experience this. I&#x27;d try something lighter...</li>
            <li> This makes my face look and feel smooth.  I am using this for my foundation now.  Looks natural and hardly notice that there is anything on my face.</li>
            <li> This product is your typical - you get what you pay for... While I don&#x27;t love this product as much as department store brands (i.e. Clinique), this BB cream is not bad and is a fraction of the cost of those bigger name brands.  The ones I have tried in the department store have more coverage - which I need - and therefore I use those under my regular foundation on days that I need a little bit more camouflage than usual.  The Olay brand&#x27;s does not have the coverage that I would like, but then again it lives up to it&#x27;s name as a \\&quot;tinted moisturizer\\&quot;.  I would say it does well on the moisturizing level and it does not break out my face or cause it to sting like some brands do (I have very sensitive skin and usually do not fair well with cheaper brands).  It has added sunscreen, so that is a plus for most.  I also have very fair skin, and because this is only slightly tinted, it does not show up as orange or pink on my face like some do - it blends very well into my skin tone.  I also have huge pores on my nose - it helps very little in this area - I have to use other pore-minimizing products for that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;br /&gt;Pros - good moisturizer, contains sunscreen, ok for my sensitive skin, blends well into my fair skin tone&lt;br /&gt;Cons - doesn&#x27;t do much to cover problem areas such as acne, enlarged pores&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t call this a \\&quot;BB cream\\&quot; as most I have used cover all the areas of concern for me, but I would say it is a good \\&quot;moisturizer\\&quot; that I may purchase again only for that reason alone.</li>
            <li> After having used a few of the Olay Fresh Effects, I am in love with this collection. However, of all the products, I have to say the Olay Fresh Effects BB Cream is probably the worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Olay Fresh Effects BB Cream, a little goes a long way. So, first of all, be careful how much you use. The first time I tried this product, I got a little zealous with my application, and wasted more than I should have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greasy. Unlike with the moisturizer that glides on silky, and absorbs into the skin quickly, the BB cream has an almost greasy feel. Sadly, that feeling did not go away in a minutes like I had hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as coverage, the Olay Fresh Effects BB Cream does as well as some of the other products I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I didn&#x27;t love this BB Cream.</li>
            <li> Perfect color match...works great under primer.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin, dry in the winter and oily in the summer and prone to breakouts with a lot of products, so I&#x27;m picky about what I put on my face.  I gave this a try since I trust Oil of olay products and I wanted some coverage without using foundation since most foundations just feel too heavy to me.  When I first put it on I was worried about the fragrance, I usually buy fragrance free just so I don&#x27;t break out, however, after a week of use I have not broken out.  I also always have little flakes of dry skin on my forehead in the winter, but after a couple days of using this they are gone!  It felt really light to me and was easy to blend into the skin.  It does seem to offer a bit of coverage while still feeling natural.  I just put a bit of powder over it.  I really like the way this makes my skin look and feel, I&#x27;m not sure if that will change in the summer when my skin gets greasier, but until then I&#x27;ll continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Having used this product for over a month now, here are my thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Blends in well. It doesn&#x27;t take long to blend in and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue or any streaks. If you don&#x27;t put any makeup over it, you have a nice dewy and fresh faced finish.&lt;br /&gt;- Okay coverage. I have combination skin and some acne scars and while this provides some coverage, it&#x27;s certainly not something you can wear to replace your foundation if you have problem skin.&lt;br /&gt;- Feels light. I never felt like I was wearing the product, which is great. It wasn&#x27;t heavy or clogged my pores either.&lt;br /&gt;- Smells fresh. I know, this is a weird thing to mention but I think it bares mentioning just in case! This product doesn&#x27;t have any funky smells or strong fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good product for the price. Don&#x27;t think of this as a replacement for foundation with a finished look - because it isn&#x27;t. But it does moisturize and provide a nice healthy tint to your skin that feels fresh and light and leaves a dewy finish.</li>
            <li> I tend to be a bit (okay, more than a bit) lazy when it comes to moisturizers&lt;br /&gt;and cosmetics. So I appreciated this Olay product that combines moisturizer and sunscreen with just enough tint to compensate for a base coverup. I was a little concerne when I saw the word \\&quot;tinted,\\&quot; but the product blended well and looked good (admittedly, I am not an expert in this area).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay products have never disappointed me and this one more than met the standard.</li>
            <li> I have tried two BB creams, this Olay Fresh Effects and Clinique&#x27;s BB Cream.  I prefer hands down the Clinique version.  The Olay brand may be okay for you if you are just looking for a sunscreen, because I saw no coverage value to it whatsoever.  I generally like Olay products, but this was a no from me.</li>
            <li> product is o.k. but does not work well on my skin</li>
            <li> I bought this cream/tint today and used it immediately on a freshly cleansed face. I&#x27;ve used a similar product from Garnier B&amp;B. I first put some on my right hand where I have some age spots and they disappeared. On my left hand I used the Garnier for a comparison. The left (Garnier side)looked cakey and accentuated the wrinkles and too light for my skin. The right (Olay side) smoothed right in and I couldn&#x27;t tell it was there, age spots were minimized. I then put a small dab of the Garnier on a white cotton pad along with the Olay and smeared into the white pad and let it sit. The Garnier side was very red/purplish while the Olay side was more of a yellow tone, which matches my tone best. At last spread all over face and neck and let dry. I did notice after some time in natural sunlight, my skin looked darker, I used light/medium. This may be too dark for very fair skin tones. However, I&#x27;ve been working on a tan, and it seemed to work for me. Haven&#x27;t had any problems with sensitivity as yet. I think for the cost, it does what it says, gives a more flawless, glowing finish with moderate coverage, with moisturizing and SPF benefits.&lt;br /&gt;Good product!</li>
            <li> In case you&#x27;re wondering, my wife reviewed this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using another manufacturer&#x27;s BB cream for several months when I got the tube of Olay&#x27;s Fresh Effects BB cream.  I tried the Light to Medium shade, which was just about right for my complexion which tends toward the pale of the medium end of the spectrum. The consistency is silky, not greasy (it seems less \\&quot;runny\\&quot; than the other product) and evens out my overall skin tone, including any reddish areas.  I use this more as a primer under my mineral makeup and it seems to prolong the life of my daily makeup. I especially like the fact that it is SPF 15 which eliminates the hassle of trying to be sure that my moisturizer or other product has a sunscreen. In general, my skin looks better with it, and I can tell the difference on the days when I&#x27;m in a hurry and skip the BB step. The previous product has been relegated to my travel bag, and the Olay Fresh Effects is now my daily choice.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product.  No coverage at all.  I am middle aged and think it would be suitable for younger.</li>
            <li> If you typically utilize Olay products and have no issues, you likely can use this product.  However, my sensitive skin broke out after a few days of use of this product.  Those few days I used the bb cream, I did notice that the coverage was good and created a pretty flawless look.  I simply cannot use this product because it made me break out so profoundly. Historically speaking, I have had the same result with just about any Olay product I have tried.</li>
            <li> Olay Fresh Effects Bb Cream Skin Perfecting Tinted Moisturizer with Sunscreen is a great multitasker!  It moisturizes my skin, protects it with SPF, and evens out my skintone so my foundation doesn&#x27;t need to work as hard.  I really like that Olay offers a few different shades for their Bb Cream, because I have very fair skin, especially here in the wintertime, and those brands that go for a one-shade-suits-all approach can sometimes be just dark enough that I have that telltale Oopma-Loompa line at the jaw.  That doesn&#x27;t happen with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this Bb Cream performs beautifully.  It has a pleasant scent, and is gentle enough for my skin.  This is a winner, in my book!</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this Olay BB Cream would be a great product since it is much cheaper than my current BB cream. Unfortunately, it does not live up to my expectations. I knew that it wouldn&#x27;t be as good when I saw that you are supposed to apply it every 2 hours and 15 minutes before sun exposure. Most BB Creams are designed to last all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin and as a result I am not a huge fan of a lot of tinted moisturizers. I know that the description of this product says BB Cream AND Tinted Moisturizer (which a product should be one or the other, not both), but I wanted to try it anyhow. I was hoping that it was not greasy. The second I put it on my skin, I felt oily and gross. I continued to apply it just to see if it made my skin look any better. It didn&#x27;t. It made it look as oily as it felt and it didn&#x27;t really do much for my uneven skin. I had to wash it off 15 minutes later and my face still felt gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The supposed benefits of Olay Fresh Effects BB Cream and my results:&lt;br /&gt;*Refreshes- It did not refresh for me since it made me feel dirty and oily&lt;br /&gt;*Brightens- If by \\&quot;Brightens\\&quot; they mean shiny, then it did do this&lt;br /&gt;*Evens Tone- definitely not. My skin was still uneven looking&lt;br /&gt;*Hydrates- It did hydrate my skin into an oil slick&lt;br /&gt;*Smoothes- It made all of my skin oily, I guess technically it did smooth it&lt;br /&gt;*Protects- With only SPF 15 and directions to apply every 2 hours, I could not trust this alone to protect my pale skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product may work for some people with dry skin. It just did not work for me. If you want a BB cream that will truly do all of these things, has a higher spf and you only have to apply ONCE a day; try [[ASIN:B0079HNKLI Smashbox Camera Ready BB Cream SPF 35 Light/Medium]] (warning: Smashbox BB Cream is expensive, but it works great for oily skin).</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I started using last year when they were running a promotion at my local drugstore.  I put it on half my face and wasn&#x27;t impressed until my girlfriend said &amp;#34;wow look at your face!&amp;#34;  I looked in the rearview mirror and sure enough my skin on that side looked more radiant and healthy.  I&#x27;m older now but I use to have oily skin and I don&#x27;t like anything too heavy.  This seems to have just enough coverage and it has sunscreen too.  I do have good genes but I don&#x27;t like spending too much time or money on my skin... so all I is use my Clarisonic brush at night, an Avalon Vit C moisturizer cream and this. I&#x27;m 54 and people frequently think I&#x27;m my daughter&#x27;s (24) older sister. Ha!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thicker than I like.</li>
            <li> I love it. The product is good and the smell is good. Not pungent at all. And this one i got from Amazon is much cheaper than the one I got from supermarket.</li>
            <li> I usually wear SPF 30-50 lotion under my makeup, but I was in a rush the other day and decided to use this instead of both. It went on smooth and (somewhat) evenly. This is the \\&quot;light-to-medium\\&quot; shade. I have very pale skin, and this was just a hair too dark for me. If I got a little bit of sun, it would be okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish it was higher than SPF 15 (which seems almost pointless to me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend pointed out that it did not blend well into my skin, but after some more rubbing, it went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does moisturize, something sunscreen does NOT do (a big pet peeve). It goes on almost exactly like a normal facial lotion, and doesn&#x27;t flake or pill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides getting it to match your skin tone, this lotion is fine in a pinch!</li>
            <li> I love the Olay Fresh Effects Bb Cream tinted moisturizer. It fits well with my skin tone and I love that it has spf.</li>
            <li> Okay for the money. It kind of looks like makup instead of a moisturizer.  Not really what I was looking for. Don&#x27;t know if I would buy it again. In the summer I don&#x27;t like to look like I am wearing makeup,  I wanted something light to moisturize</li>
            <li> I am 62 years old with very dry skin and I spend lots of time in the sun - this moisturizer works so well for me and protects my face for any more sun damage.</li>
            <li> It does moisturize the face, however there is no tint to it. It just looked like I put regular moisturizing cream on.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of BB creams. One bottle that moisturizes, hides imperfections AND protects you from the sun. Seems too good to be true. I&#x27;ve tried a few different brands and so far, I like this one the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can put it on fairly thickly and it feels like a great moisturizer. The coverage is light but pretty good and it has SPF 15. If you go with the BB creams that have higher SPF they usually use zinc oxide which can make your skin look very light, and Olay Fresh Effects didn&#x27;t have that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sensitive skin was okay with it, although it does have a very strong perfumy scent when you first put it on. If you&#x27;re sensitive to fragrances, this would likely be too strong for you. I also don&#x27;t think this would replace my other products, I use Laura Geller Bronze Spackle (primer) and Brighten and Balance (mineral foundation powder) as my daily make-up. I could skip the spackle with this, although I like the bronze tint, so I probably wouldn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;ve found BB creams to be something I&#x27;d use in addition to my other make-up but haven&#x27;t found any that would completely replace them. It&#x27;s like the search for the perfect lipstick! LOL  This is one of the better BB creams I&#x27;ve tried - and one of the least expensive, but I haven&#x27;t found one that would replace all my usual make-up. I like the SPF too.</li>
            <li> Olay Fresh Effects BB Cream is a very good product.  As soon as I opened the box I noticed that the tube is double the size of designer department store brands.  This BB cream has an SPF 15 compared to the SPF 50 of the designer brands but otherwise it does a good job.  It has a nice light weight, is non-irritating (even around the eyes), and the color looks good too.  My skin tone did look better, and it had a bit of a glow after applying this product.  I also love that it is a light weight foundation, SPF, and moisturizer all in one.</li>
            <li> I love this tinted moisturizer it&#x27;s the only one that works for my dry acne prone sensitive skin type. I have tried the a number of different BB creams and they made me look older because my skin is dry. Olay fresh effects is the only one that feels like a moisturizer and doesn&#x27;t give me color but makes my face look balanced. To me this is more of a tinted moisturizer which is what I like some brands feel like cover-up and since I have never worn cover-up I don&#x27;t like it. I like moisturizer with a bit of a tint so this is perfect. Olay really does make good products my only complaint is I wish they would go cruelty free as once this runs out I will not buy it again because they are not cruelty free.</li>
            <li> I like this better than Garnier as it goes on more smoothly.  It is perfect if your skin doesn&#x27;t have a lot of flaws and it blends nicely and provide protection</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this new BB cream from Olay, but the fragrance in it was a little too strong for my skin. It did give a nice dewy finish to my face and made it look smoother and more even-toned. It didn&#x27;t cake, it blended easily and the moisture was just right. The instructions on it were those for a sunscreen, so I take it there&#x27;s heavy SPF in it and it needs to be applied and reapplied accordingly.  The color I received was called Light to Medium, though I think calling it Light would be more accurate. It made me look a little pastey. I hope they make a fragrance-free BB in their Regenerist line, too. I&#x27;d recommend this for younger users with normal to dry, not too sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This seems to work all right. I have a suggestion: with the lighter color tones, Olay may want to up the SPF a little. I&#x27;m definitely not using this when I need to start using 30+ SPF in the later spring/summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised that my normally sensitive skin didn&#x27;t have any issues with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue was that I had to wipe the cream off my brown eyebrows. They looked a little wierd.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel like this product had very  much tint or coverage compared to other BB creams I have used.  I also didn&#x27;t care for the smell, and it made my combination skin too oily.  I gave it to a girlfriend to try and I bought Neutrogena&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of foundation; it feels like my skin can&#x27;t breathe and looks so fake! I don&#x27;t know how people do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;m very used to wearing moisturizers with SPF. And that is what this exactly feels like - a light moisturizer with SPF. What&#x27;s nice about this product is that it does have a hint of color that smooths over a few discolorations and ever so slightly tones down my under eye circles. Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to people who don&#x27;t already have fairly nice skin; this is very sheer, and your skin definitely &amp;#34;comes through.&amp;#34; However, it&#x27;s a very nice product for people who only have a few slight discolorations or just want a more even look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to give this 4 star as opposed to 5 because the two color options are only good for people with fair to medium skin, and not particularly good for people with olive to dark skin. My skin gets darker to more of a deep olive over the summer, and so probably wouldn&#x27;t be able to use the product then.</li>
            <li> The cream smells nice and it lightweight. The coverage is lacking. I did not notice any light reflecting pigments like some other BB creams. My biggest offense with the cream is that every time I use it my face gets super shiny within an hour. I would not recommend this if you have the slightest oily skin.</li>
            <li> This product was the first BB cream I&#x27;ve tried. It was sitting on the shelf right next to another BB cream that said it would specifically NOT make your face oily or greasy. I choose to go with the Olay cream instead. I wish now I would have tried the other. The first thing I noticed was how good it smelled! I loved how fresh it was! Then the second thing I noticed was how oily and greasy my face was the entire day!! I was blotching it with napkins all day! Also, the napkins were covered in \\&quot;color or foundation.\\&quot; I do NOT wear make up, so I was not fond of the color my face was leaving behind on everything I touched! My cell phone, shirt, hands! I am going to the store tomorrow and buying a different BB  cream, any suggestions?</li>
            <li> When I first received the product I loved how it felt on my face it gave me just enough coverage to look fresh and awake. Sadly those feelings changed quickly when I noticed how greasy my face felt and the cream cause me to sweat more, and since I used it as a moisturizer my makeup would get ruined because of the constant sweating. Then to top things off after 2 weeks of usage, suddenly my face broke out overnight, everywhere on my face I had acme cosmetica. My doctor recommended I stop using this product because it was clogging my pores and irritating my skin. I knew it was this product and not my makeup because I have been using Stilla foundation for years and people always complimented how great my skin look (weird but true). So if you want to avoid having bumps on your face anddo not use this product the sun block really clogs pores.</li>
            <li> I have tried every single BB cream, whether it is drug store or prestige.  This is the best one I have tried so far.  I have fair skin with a ton of freckles and not exactly the same color skin all over my face...until I started using this.  I use it every day for a great moisturizer and now I don&#x27;t have to use foundation because it has enough tint to it.  Plus, it has really evened out my skin tone and I don&#x27;t need foundation anymore.  I find that other BB creams are thick and have too much pigment.  This one is really creamy and the perfect tint so you still have a natural look.</li>
            <li> I received this as a sample in the mail, when I opened it, it had a wonderful fragrance.I put it on and it had a fresh feeling to it. Unfortunately it was just ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell:Smelled fresh like Olay soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Feel: Went on smooth not sticky&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Color: I got the light to medium although I just heard that they had fair to light which is what I should use instead.This one light to medium works just as fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem that I have with this is the coverage, It doesn&#x27;t provide much at all.If it provided coverage I would definitely buy it.</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> This has a lovely scent and goes on smoothly.  It did provide me with the level of coverage that I expected from a product like this, however, after several hours of wearing it I discovered dark circles under my eyes because it had dissolved my very good waterproof mascara.  I won&#x27;t be buying it again for that reason.</li>
            <li> I have used Oil of Olay for years as a moisturizer and really like it. Today I decided to try their BB cream - I put it on about 20 minutes ago and it feels great. I had my hubby check out my face to see if it actually minimizes the pores in the T zone and he said that yes, it does! I have some especially noticeable pores on my chin... this product didn&#x27;t smooth them out, but it did minimize them quite a bit. I finished my look with mineral powder and the me I see in my mirror looks a little younger already! (I am 53 years old.))</li>
            <li> Very oily and no coverage. This product did nothing for me. Maybe it will work for you. I threw it away.</li>
            <li> First off I have to say I don&#x27;t think the people giving it one star really understand what a BB cream is used for. It&#x27;s not to be replaced as a foundation but does have color in it. If you are looking for something that will cover all your blemishes and flaws this is not for you and other BB creams aren&#x27;t either. It also is not strictly a moisturizer as it does have a tint. If you are looking for something to moisturize with a little tint to even your skin this is for you!! I didn&#x27;t find it oily for my skin but everyone&#x27;s is different. I use it every day and sometimes I put a foundation over it to give me more coverage. I absolutely love it!!</li>
            <li> Love the way it smels and goes on, but a little too light.  1 shade darker would have been perfect.</li>
            <li> Watch your face. If you have sensitive skin or even not this stuff is not good. The &amp;#34;shimmer&amp;#34; is bascally small glitter that goes into your pores. After two days of wearing this &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; my face broke out terribly. I&#x27;m korean american raised and it&#x27;s almost impossible to get makeup that work!! Warning</li>
            <li> This BB cream has not replaced my skincare routine, but I am using it in place of a foundation now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very light coverage, so I still need to use a cover up, and I use a mineral powder after applying, because as other reviewers state, it does make you look a little bit greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have sensitive, breakout-prone skin that reacts to almost ANYTHING, so when I used this and found my breakouts decreasing, it was a godsend. If I&#x27;ve just scrubbed my skin, or used a harsh cleanser or toner, this BB cream makes my skin a little bit red, but it quickly dissipates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this cream has given my skin a more even tone, and reduced my breakouts significantly. There were several days over Christmas break that I didn&#x27;t use it, and I experienced increased breakouts, and many painful spots. As soon as I resumed use of the BB cream, my breakouts have all but gone away.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I have dry, rough, uneven, sensitive mature skin.  I need a lot of moister and colour to even out the tone.  I can not use makeup as it cakes, even with primer. I never go out other house to car, car to store and back so out about 15 min&#x27;s a week so no need for the sun screen.&lt;br /&gt;Ok, I still need primer due to dull/rough/dry skin.  I have light to pale skin, med. shades are to dark as often light med. is, however this one is a just right shade for me.  It does not due miracles but it does help my skin tone be more even.  It has a nice amount of moister, though with my dry skin I need extra moister first.  It works well with my sensitive skin, no problems.  It will not replace makeup for coverage or how much it evens your tone.  But going to the store, or every day, ; those days when you zip on concealer, lip gloss and light cover of mascara this is just the thing.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product the first time I tried it.  I&#x27;ve been using a mineral foundation base that goes on very silky.  This cream is thicker, and is almost a bit sticky as I smooth it over my face.  I didn&#x27;t like this initial impression.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I did like the level of coverage.  It&#x27;s very sheer coverage, that evens out color variation but isn&#x27;t a coat of paint.  I have some freckles and small age spots, and they are visible through the cream, but the contrast has been reduced significantly.  I think this is a much more natural appearance than a foundation that makes your whole face the exact same color, from hairline to chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really like the moisturizing.  My skin is noticeably softer at the end of the day when I&#x27;ve worn this cream, rather than my normal moisturizer plus foundation routine.  The moisturizer helps with the fine lines, and the color doesn&#x27;t sink into the larger wrinkles like some foundations well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream has &#x27;grown on me&#x27;, and now it&#x27;s what I use most days, even though I didn&#x27;t love it at first.</li>
            <li> I am a BB cream junkie.  I&#x27;ll try just about all of them, or the ones I can afford.  This one did not let me down.  Does what it says it will do and you can&#x27;t go wrong with Olay.</li>
            <li> This has a fragrance to it and is kind of greasy feeling. I don&#x27;t like it as much as my other BB cream.</li>
            <li> Just ok.  Smells good, feels light, but stays a bit sticky after application.  If it weren&#x27;t for the sticky feeling, I would love it.  Good coverage and SPF.</li>
            <li> I had very high hopes for this BB cream becuase I love Olay.  It is a good BB cream but not great to be honest.  It gives a very light coverage and the colour was not what I expected it to me.  I have medium skin and bought the light to medium colour.  I think that it is too light for me and if i get a little tan on my face, i may have to stop using this.  Otherwise, lovely texture that blends right into your skin.</li>
            <li> This Olay BB Cream doesn&#x27;t come even closed of meeting my expectations. The pores still appear large, and do not cover any imperfections on the skin, a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> i wouldn&#x27;t buy again, it&#x27;s a BB but it doesn&#x27;t cover like one, and it makes my skin a little dry if i wear it by itself.  It&#x27;s still a good cream though.</li>
            <li> my daughter loves this.</li>
            <li> No problems with my order.</li>
            <li> I love BB creams. [[ASIN:B0079RJ1QG Stila Stay All Day 10-in-1 HD Beauty Balm]] is a perfect example of a BB that really lives up to the hype. [[ASIN:B009UTCT6U Dr. Jart+ Black Label Detox BB Beauty Balm]] is a relatively new one, but, WOW it has really gorgeous results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BB creams are supposed to hydrate but this left my skin really, really shiny ... \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; looking. And, even though I used a small amount, when the wind blew, my hair literally stuck to my face. Ick. And, the smell is strong (floral? grandmotherly?) and totally unnecessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought this would be a nice, inexpensive addition to the collection (maybe for days when I&#x27;m just running errands), but I cannot think of a single positive aspect to using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a chance, pop over to Sephora or Ulta and try a few BB cremes from a few different cosmetic companies. Then, return here to make your purchase. (You will often get a better deal here).</li>
            <li> has definitely become my favorite for my summer make up regime will be purchasing again!! Its crazy what they expect you to pay at walmart or walgreens</li>
            <li> This review is written by my wife:  Good sunscreen and hydrating without being too greasy.  However, I found the very strong fragrance bothersome and the color didn&#x27;t add much.  The light to medium was actually very light (I have light skin and thought it was too fair for me).</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve been putting on Olay lotion pretty thick before using makeup to make it spread and not cover so thickly...now I can do the same thing with less time.  This is a very nice product...it does moisturize, and add some cover...with powder I can&#x27;t tell the difference between this and regular makeup how I&#x27;ve been doing it.  It doesn&#x27;t settle into fine wrinkles like makeup likes to, and the skin tone on it seems just right for lighter skin.  It should be washed off at night like any makeup.  I&#x27;ll be getting this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a Bb cream or a tinted moisturizer before, so I can&#x27;t compare this to other Bb creams or tinted moisturizers.  The first time I tried the Olay Fresh Effects Bb Cream, I didn&#x27;t really see a difference in my skin as I put it on.  I wondered if it was really doing anything. But several hours later when I was once again standing in front of a mirror, I noticed the difference.  My face looked much smoother, more polished, and just more \\&quot;put together\\&quot; than it usually does.  It didn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;d put on a ton of makeup ... it still looked natural ... but it definitely looked better than it does with only a regular moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not fond of SPF in my moisturizers because it usually feels heavy and greasy on my face, and it usually doesn&#x27;t moisturize my skin as much as I need.  That hasn&#x27;t been true with the Bb cream.  It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy as I put it on, or as I wear it.  However, I definitely need to use a night time moisturizer every night, because the Bb cream doesn&#x27;t give my face enough moisture during the day ... at least not during the winter months.  I haven&#x27;t yet tried it during the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a big \\&quot;make-up\\&quot; person.  I haven&#x27;t worn foundation or even powder in over 15 years.  I usually just moisturize, add a little bit of eye makeup, and go.  But as I turn 40 this year, I think I&#x27;m going to appreciate the extra polish that the Olay Fresh Effects Bb Cream gives my skin.  As a busy mom, I especially like that there isn&#x27;t an extra step or extra weight involved in wearing it.  I am basically still just moisturizing, adding my eye make up, and going ... but I&#x27;ll look better afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give the Bb Cream 5 stars is because I do need to use a different moisturizer at night to supplement the Bb Cream.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with BB cream. I love the convenience of having my moisturizer, SPF, and foundation in one step.  The cover is very sheer, so I had to be a bit heavy handed with it to get the coverage that I wanted. I also found this shade to be a little too dark for my skin in the winter. It is better suited for my coloring during the summer months.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this and I was surprised how well I liked it. The smell is awesome, very fresh... I&#x27;d love to get a laundry soap to smell like this! It does a good job moisturizing, and the light color did give my face a slight glow. Sadly, I have too many skin issues to wear any kind of BB cream, I simply need more coverage. But overall a fantastic BB cream!!</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer/conditioner/makeup all in one!</li>
            <li> First, a little background -- I&#x27;m middle aged, with fair, sensitive skin, I don&#x27;t work outside the home, so I don&#x27;t need to \\&quot;make up\\&quot; most of the time.  Something like this Olay Fresh Effects BB Cream is perfect for me most days, especailly because it contains a sunscreen.  I just smooth it on after my shower over my face and neck, slap on a little blush and I look perfectly presentable.  If I&#x27;m going out, I add a little foundation to it, mix it together and smooth it on for a little more coverage.  The Olay Fresh Effects does have a slight melon smell and a warning to stop using it if you develop a rash, so be aware of that.  As I said, my skin is pretty sensitive and I&#x27;ve had no problems with it after using it for a few months.  Would I purchase this item in a store?  Yes, I&#x27;m planning to -- it works that well for me.</li>
            <li> This is my first try with BB cream of any kind. The cream is very thick and rich, almost like a mousse. It is also fragrant, so if you are sensitive to perfumes, this is not for you.  The coverage is good, although I had to use foundation over it. The \\&quot;tint\\&quot; wasn&#x27;t enough to cover even my light skin. I could use this perhaps in the summer, when I want more of a sheer look. I didn&#x27;t note a great difference in moisture from my day cream or foundation.</li>
            <li> Product as promised. Great quality and lovely fragrance.</li>
            <li> I tried this out on my wife who is an avid foundation and sunscreen wearer.  She wanted to see how O of O&#x27;s lower-cost product stacked up to higher-priced options: IT DOESN&#x27;T. In terms of \\&quot;skin perfecting,\\&quot; it provides no coverage. It being winter right now, she&#x27;s not in the sun as much as in the summer, so we can&#x27;t speak totally to its sunscreening abilities. The product does have the active ingredients to protect from UVA and UVB rays, so that&#x27;s a plus. She might wear this just as a sunscreen, but as make-up, she would not.</li>
            <li> Received Olay BB Cream for Vine review.  It is true this is a good moisturizing cream, however, I thought the fragrance was a little over powering. I am fair skinned with dark circles and Olay BB cream did not cover up the dark circles; I had to still use cover up on them.  I was also confused as the directions said to re-apply. I don&#x27;t normally do this with any of my moisturizers, so this made the BB cream sound like a sun screen you would use at the beach. I think this cream would work best for people with younger skin, no skin problems and no under eye wrinkles or dark circles.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a good product.  It has a nice consistency as it goes on, and does moisturize, not simply tint the skin.  There is a light fragrance to it that is pleasant - not overpowering, nor is it medicinal/clinical in nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another positive aspect is that it evens out skin tone/complexion - but as expected, not as thoroughly as a true base/foundation would.  However, it therefore has a potentially more natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one aspect that is not ideal is that I am very fair, and this is a bit too dark.  There is a noted contrast between my face when I&#x27;m wearing this, and my neck - which somewhat defeats the purpose of a tinted moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they were to add a lighter shade to their product selection, then I would seek this out for sure - but would not buy it again in this formulation.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with a \\&quot;BB\\&quot; product.  The texture of the lotion is satiny smooth.  It has a tint to it, which is pretty sheer.  If you&#x27;re looking for foundation-level coverage, this isn&#x27;t it.  It does, however, blend in nicely and even out skin tone to some degree, with basic coverage.  I use it as a base and then touch up with concealer where needed.  I usually finish with a light dusting of a mineral foundation powder.  I would describe my skin as a light medium, so this color was fine for me.  There is a fragrance to this product.  I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call it a pleasant fragrance, but it isn&#x27;t terribly strong or long-lasting.  I have break-out prone skin but I did not experience any break-outs while using Skin Perfecting Tinted Moisturizer.  The lotion has sunscreen, SPF 15, which is minimal but probably adequate.  Overall, I liked the look and feel of this product and will certainly consider purchasing it.</li>
            <li> My complexion is in between light and medium so I wasn&#x27;t sure how well this would work.  I really like it a lot. It&#x27;s smooth to put on, isn&#x27;t noticeable and wears well. I do still use powder with it if I am going out.</li>
            <li> Although it did cover somewhat I saw a distinctive unfavorable yellowish cast...made me look strange, Perhaps it will be better when I am not in winter skin mode.</li>
            <li> Best product ever. I use it for foundation and sun protection. I bought it thru Amazon because they no longer stock this at my local stores.</li>
            <li> Love this product and I&#x27;ve heard they are discontinuing it.</li>
            <li> ...But that&#x27;s probably because I&#x27;m not wearing the Fresh Effects Cream on a daily basis (which has nothing to do with the product and everything to do with how my life is ordered at the moment).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the product description, this &#x27;BB&#x27; tinted moisturizer not only acts as a sunscreen, with an SPF 15, but hides blotches and imperfections, minimizing the need for concealer and foundation.  It&#x27;s even said to leave skin glowing and naturally even after just one use.  Well, I didn&#x27;t see that happen, sorry to say, but when I used the Fresh Effects Cream, it did provide a nice layer of sheer color on my face, evening things out and toning down any patchy skin or blemishes.  For really stubborn spots, I still needed to apply some concealer, but I wasn&#x27;t surprised; after all, this is a tinted moisturizer, not a foundation.  It&#x27;ll help smooth out your skin, but it won&#x27;t completely hide imperfections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the fact that&#x27;s it&#x27;s also a sunscreen as it saves me applying a second product for that specific use.  With an SPF of 15, it&#x27;s not a heavy-duty sunscreen, but for casual, everyday use, it&#x27;s perfectly acceptable, though for longer wear outside, you might want to layer it with another sunscreen-containing product or a face-formulated sunscreen.  The product also has a nice, clean, rather green-floral scent to it, though it&#x27;s a bit heavy and might be cloying to some.  However, I certainly prefer it to a chemical or artificial odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is how it actually feels on my skin.  Though it&#x27;s a moisturizer, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it really sinks into my skin.  Instead, it just kind of floats on top, or at least that&#x27;s the sensation I get, especially after I&#x27;ve worn it for a few hours.  It&#x27;s a rather uncomfortable sensation, as though the cream is going to rub off onto anything I touch.  I don&#x27;t think it really does, that I&#x27;ve seen, it&#x27;s just part of the whole \\&quot;sitting on my skin\\&quot; feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, I still haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in the quality of my skin from using this product, but that&#x27;s my fault.  However, for the temporary improvement it provides as well as its performance as a sunscreen, I&#x27;d still rank it as a nice addition to my makeup regimen.  That said, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be going out of my way to buy it in future; while having all three products--tint, moisturizer, sunscreen--in one convenient application is nice, I&#x27;ll stick with my mineral makeup and moisturize beforehand.I said, I still haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in the quality of my skin from using this product, but that&#x27;s my fault.
