            <li>I love this face mist!</li>
            <li>Love the lightness of the rose water scent!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this spray!</li>
            <li>I especially love it on a hot sunny day.</li>
            <li>Feels good and very light mist.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the Body Shop&#x27;s Vitamin E Mist, and the results were amazing.  </li>
            <li>Great light rose fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is just rose water.  </li>
            <li>And, the rose water scent is revitalizing and calming.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice plus a nice size bottle</li>
            <li>It smells so nice and keeps my face hydrated throughout the day without making it oily.</li>
            <li>This comes in handy while traveling too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice pick me up during the day as well.  </li>
            <li>I could just make a homemade one with my own scents.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s really nice to have something I can spray on over my makeup to help moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li>This is handy when traveling or at work when you need a pick me up.</li>
            <li>I am a rose fan.  </li>
            <li>Healthy glow and so good for your skin</li>
            <li>This rose-scented face spray is a great way to cool off during the summer.  </li>
            <li>, I know I am going to love this product during the summer months because it is so refreshing!</li>
            <li>Best of all, no harsh chemicals or ingredients.</li>
            <li>It also is a very fine mist</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>This mist is wonderful on a hot day, it really refreshes you, it smells really good also.</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful very mild scent, and it feels soft and nice on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I started using the Body Shop&#x27;s Vitamin E Face Mist about 2 years ago after I had decided to try using a powdered mineral face makeup that was becoming popular</li>
            <li>It goes on very light on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It spritzed on very lightly and evenly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the overly strong rose smell.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t great, but the lack of fragrance is probably part of what makes my skin like it so much.</li>
            <li>Easily better than $80</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t work well for everyone</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more when I&#x27;m out.</li>
            <li>It gives me a lovely dewy look.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>While ordering a mister from Amazon, I noticed many people also ordered the Body Shop Vitamin E Face Mist.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how much better the face mist made the mineral makeup look.  </li>
            <li>I would not be able to use mineral makeup if it were not for this mist.  </li>
            <li>The mist has a light rose petal scent.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I will re-order it for sure.</li>
            <li>I think the Korean Face Mists are made a lot better...</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>Applewel Therapeutics has a face and body mist that I think works much better.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I am extremely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I love the light rose water scent</li>
            <li>I like it, feels refreshing.</li>
            <li>I think the rosewater is primarily added to give the product a nice scent, but rosewater&lt;br /&gt;is</li>
            <li>Its safe enough to use for kiddos in the summer, and perfectly sized for your purse.</li>
            <li>This is so refreshing.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff-</li>
            <li>Just normal, nothing great about it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does smell good and cools you off when you first use it, but it doesn&#x27;t have a moisturizing effect that lasts.</li>
            <li>I like the rose aroma very much!</li>
            <li>It works well for that and has a slight rose scent that is very pleasant.</li>
            <li>I was looking more for an aresol, but this works fine.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect it, but it is very true smelling</li>
            <li>Feels refreshing and is light.</li>
            <li>The mist is light, and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>Ideal product for airplane travel, simple application, and the light scent is lovely.</li>
            <li>this product &amp; recommend it strongly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly refreshing and for anyone living in a hot climate, you will love using this.  </li>
            <li>The mist spray is fine, not like a stream.</li>
            <li>A couple of spritzes worked fine for a while, but I&#x27;ve stopped using it since I started getting itchy skin, then redness.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for setting make-up too, especially if you finish with powder.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite product and I use it right after i wash my face.</li>
            <li>will make your skin feel great for a long time after using the spray as well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a small bottle, perfect for a purse.  </li>
            <li>My original review is below.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how it will hold up in summer (when it is a lot hotter), but this winter it has been awesome!</li>
            <li>Body Shop is one of my favorite brands since it is natural and readily available at the mall!</li>
            <li>It is also so easy to apply, I just did it right there in my seat and didn&#x27;t even have to get up.</li>
            <li>Great for very dry skin that needs to be moistured in a pinch.</li>
            <li>read other reviews that said this is great for setting your makeup, but what I was looking for in a spray is something that will moisturize my face for a long time without having to go to great lengths to apply a cream or lotion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had two blemishes that had scabbed over and taking their dear sweet time healing.</li>
            <li>This is one of those rare \\&quot;finds\\&quot; that I will enjoy for years to come.  </li>
            <li>It feels cool and lightweight on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have to have several sprays to make my skin feel good</li>
            <li>, I thought that I would give it a try, given that the price was reasonable compared to more upscale brands.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product for those with sensitive skin who are looking for a refreshing, lightly moisturizing mist.</li>
            <li>I live in a dry climate so this is a perfect spritz to give you that fresh out of the shower feel on your face.  </li>
            <li>makes my skin feel great, especially over make up, makes foundation feel much lighter and fresher.</li>
            <li>A great, calming hydrating must for dry skin, hot weather and stressful situations.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It contains the antioxidant vitamin E, which protects the skin, glycerin moisturizes and a slight fragrance of rosewater refreshes and smells great.</li>
            <li>However, it definitely does work, and I will most certainly buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li>It smells like rosewater, which I don&#x27;t really like, but have come to enjoy when I spritz my face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth noting that I&#x27;ve never had a problem with [[ASIN:B000HJUYAU</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel so fresh</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great to spritz on your eyeshadow brush before applying if you want to get a creamer, more dramatic color.</li>
            <li>There are other sprays that are also good for the skin, but you get them in the eye and OUCH</li>
            <li>I guess my expectation was it would feel moisturized right away.</li>
            <li>I have also discovered that on the days I wear make up if I spritz right before I apply my mineral powder</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive and break out easily.  </li>
            <li>The second most obvious thing is the nice smell.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle and non-irritating.&lt;br</li>
            <li>hot days</li>
            <li>it makes my skin so soft and smooth</li>
            <li>I wondered if I found a facial mist to spray over the makeup, would my skin look more dewy rather than powdery/dry?  </li>
            <li>My makeup really does stay fresh all day.  </li>
            <li>Works pretty well.</li>
            <li>But spraying this mist before and after putting make up HELPS so much!</li>
            <li>you apply the product to your face, the first thing you notice is a cooling sensation.</li>
            <li>Even after the first application, there is a smoother feel to the skin.</li>
            <li>However, when I first used the product, within minutes, it feels like my skin is drier than when I started.</li>
            <li>Once your skin dries, it is drier than when you started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might try using a moisturizer first and then applying this product to see if I am happier with the results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for the winter, especially if you&#x27;ve got dry flaky skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a soft mist that sets your makeup &amp; gives you a cool feeling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is great for combination skin in dry weather, and dry skin in all types of weather.</li>
            <li>I may sound like Goldilocks here, but I&#x27;ve tried some mist sprays that are too heavy and some that are too light, but this one is just right.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin with dry cheeks, and this spray is light enough not to make me break out, but refreshing and moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>The fragrance of the rosewater is a little too much for me, but this is a nice product.  </li>
            <li>Or anytime really.</li>
            <li>Hydrates very well.</li>
            <li>It absolutely corrects that issue.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d come home looking like I did before getting ready that morning.  </li>
            <li>and this is gentle and has not caused me any irritation.</li>
            <li>so I really need a product to help with skin irritation.</li>
            <li>It seals my face haha</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve very shinny and oily skin</li>
            <li>It is gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>I got it for days that my bare minerals makeup looked dry on my skin to use as a setting lotion and to look more dewy fresh.  </li>
            <li>Just cool and adds enough moisture to your face without feeling like mud.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>I mainly use it to set my make-up.</li>
            <li>I use this mainly to set my makeup after applying.  </li>
            <li>My mother particularly likes this product as a way to \\&quot;freshen up\\&quot; during the day without needing to remove or reapply makeup.    </li>
            <li>I use it after bathing, sun exposure, or mainly after shaving.</li>
            <li>I travel a lot between the USA and South Africa (very long flights), and on my most recent trip I bought the face mist at duty free to see if it helps with the beating my skin takes from the dry airplane air.</li>
            <li>But wow, it helps me so much.  </li>
            <li>However, I feel the mist is not so effective per spray, at least to my skin.</li>
            <li>Refreshing and a staple to everyday makeup sealer</li>
            <li>Since I got back, I&#x27;ve kept on using it, because my skin feels super soft, and I&#x27;m now looking into buying the rest of the Vitamin E series.</li>
            <li>I spray it lightly over my face makeup to set it and it gives slightly dewy effect.</li>
            <li>Face feels cool and refreshed when applied, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything other than that.  </li>
            <li>I would warn to have a light finger on the spray nozzle as if you don&#x27;t it can look a little plasticky which happened to me</li>
            <li>I just need a little moisture after the shower but many lotions or facial products make me greasy immediately...  </li>
            <li>This gives my skin a soft and supple appearance and the powdery look is gone.  </li>
            <li>After sprayed, the skin feels a bit velvety and soft to touch.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN</li>
            <li>Face Mist really helps with daily care including razor burn.</li>
            <li>I like to keep my skincare fairly natural and aside from facewash</li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s a \\&quot;feminine\\&quot; floral scent, I&#x27;ve never seen a sweaty guy turn down a spritz to help cool off.  </li>
            <li>Actually, it&#x27;s also awesome for cold, windy, dry air too, so just buy it.  </li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s small enough to fit easily in the door) and take it out for a little pick-me-up to help beat the heat.  </li>
            <li>In the several weeks I have been using it, my skin has been better, less dry,  with a much nicer overall appearance&lt;</li>
            <li>For over 7 years I have been battling Adult Acne Rosacea with little success.  </li>
            <li>I used the makeup very sparingly, but even so, found that my skin looked a bit powdery and dry.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve searching for a product to moisturizer my face during the day,  I had used evian in the past, so I&#x27;m excited to use this.  </li>
            <li>If I spritz a little of this on after applying my makeup I still have a fresh face of foundation, bronzer, shadow, etc.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first mist, so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s any better or worse than any other one.</li>
            <li>I generally use this to set my makeup.  </li>
            <li>I use this under my bare minerals powder foundation as a primer.</li>
            <li>Bare Minerals).  </li>
            <li>I spray it on bare skin as a pick me up</li>
            <li>Usually, I have no problem with The Body Shop&#x27;s products on my sensitive skin, but something in this face spray doesn&#x27;t work right for me.  </li>
            <li>The spray application system means that you only use a tiny amount per application, so a bottle will last you a pretty long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do love this face spray, I make it stretch a little further by pouring a little into another smaller spray bottle and mixing it with water.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also spray it on my bare face when I&#x27;m not wearing makeup and before going outside in the sun.</li>
            <li>When my makeup looks so dry after applying, I spray the mist on my face and there is a soft glow.</li>
            <li>bought this thinking it would be a cheaper solution than other items I would normally buy.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Body Shop has a great product here.</li>
            <li> Great</li>
            <li> It feels great and never makes my face look shiny or feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> Also great as a way to set or freshen make-</li>
            <li> The redness and breakouts have greatly diminished and I&#x27;m once again getting comments from people on how very nice my skin is looking.  </li>
            <li> Also very good for skin and very refreshing to use throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Very Nice</li>
            <li> BUT, this is AMAZING!  </li>
            <li> Smells great and feels good on the skin.</li>
            <li> But I make the concession because this stuff just works so well and feels so good.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel smooth and flawless.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smoother and just looks fresher...worth every penny and surprisingly inexpensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also really great and keeping makeup from looking cakey or powdery and leaves my face with a nice glow.</li>
            <li> also reputedly good for cleansing and toning skin</li>
            <li> and it gives my face a nice bit of moisture and pleasant aroma  </li>
            <li> I need to stock up before the price goes up, love that the company cares about the environment too, all around a great product</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> and I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> and I think you will love it, too!</li>
            <li> I love this face mist!</li>
            <li> Love the lightness of the rose water scent!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this spray!</li>
            <li> I especially love it on a hot sunny day.</li>
            <li> Feels good and very light mist.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the Body Shop&#x27;s Vitamin E Mist, and the results were amazing.  </li>
            <li> Great light rose fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is just rose water.  </li>
            <li> And, the rose water scent is revitalizing and calming.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice plus a nice size bottle</li>
            <li> It smells so nice and keeps my face hydrated throughout the day without making it oily.</li>
            <li> This comes in handy while traveling too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice pick me up during the day as well.  </li>
            <li> I could just make a homemade one with my own scents.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s really nice to have something I can spray on over my makeup to help moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li> This is handy when traveling or at work when you need a pick me up.</li>
            <li> I am a rose fan.  </li>
            <li> Healthy glow and so good for your skin</li>
            <li> This rose-scented face spray is a great way to cool off during the summer.  </li>
            <li> , I know I am going to love this product during the summer months because it is so refreshing!</li>
            <li> Best of all, no harsh chemicals or ingredients.</li>
            <li> It also is a very fine mist</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love love love!</li>
            <li> This mist is wonderful on a hot day, it really refreshes you, it smells really good also.</li>
            <li> It has a wonderful very mild scent, and it feels soft and nice on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I started using the Body Shop&#x27;s Vitamin E Face Mist about 2 years ago after I had decided to try using a powdered mineral face makeup that was becoming popular</li>
            <li> It goes on very light on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It spritzed on very lightly and evenly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the overly strong rose smell.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t great, but the lack of fragrance is probably part of what makes my skin like it so much.</li>
            <li> Easily better than $80</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t work well for everyone</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more when I&#x27;m out.</li>
            <li> It gives me a lovely dewy look.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> While ordering a mister from Amazon, I noticed many people also ordered the Body Shop Vitamin E Face Mist.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how much better the face mist made the mineral makeup look.  </li>
            <li> I would not be able to use mineral makeup if it were not for this mist.  </li>
            <li> The mist has a light rose petal scent.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love it</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I will re-order it for sure.</li>
            <li> I think the Korean Face Mists are made a lot better...</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> Applewel Therapeutics has a face and body mist that I think works much better.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am extremely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I love the light rose water scent</li>
            <li> I like it, feels refreshing.</li>
            <li> I think the rosewater is primarily added to give the product a nice scent, but rosewater&lt;br /&gt;is</li>
            <li> Its safe enough to use for kiddos in the summer, and perfectly sized for your purse.</li>
            <li> This is so refreshing.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff-</li>
            <li> Just normal, nothing great about it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does smell good and cools you off when you first use it, but it doesn&#x27;t have a moisturizing effect that lasts.</li>
            <li> I like the rose aroma very much!</li>
            <li> It works well for that and has a slight rose scent that is very pleasant.</li>
            <li> I was looking more for an aresol, but this works fine.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it, but it is very true smelling</li>
            <li> Feels refreshing and is light.</li>
            <li> The mist is light, and refreshing.  </li>
            <li> Ideal product for airplane travel, simple application, and the light scent is lovely.</li>
            <li> this product &amp; recommend it strongly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly refreshing and for anyone living in a hot climate, you will love using this.  </li>
            <li> The mist spray is fine, not like a stream.</li>
            <li> A couple of spritzes worked fine for a while, but I&#x27;ve stopped using it since I started getting itchy skin, then redness.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for setting make-up too, especially if you finish with powder.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product and I use it right after i wash my face.</li>
            <li> will make your skin feel great for a long time after using the spray as well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small bottle, perfect for a purse.  </li>
            <li> My original review is below.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it will hold up in summer (when it is a lot hotter), but this winter it has been awesome!</li>
            <li> Body Shop is one of my favorite brands since it is natural and readily available at the mall!</li>
            <li> It is also so easy to apply, I just did it right there in my seat and didn&#x27;t even have to get up.</li>
            <li> Great for very dry skin that needs to be moistured in a pinch.</li>
            <li> read other reviews that said this is great for setting your makeup, but what I was looking for in a spray is something that will moisturize my face for a long time without having to go to great lengths to apply a cream or lotion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had two blemishes that had scabbed over and taking their dear sweet time healing.</li>
            <li> This is one of those rare \\&quot;finds\\&quot; that I will enjoy for years to come.  </li>
            <li> It feels cool and lightweight on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have to have several sprays to make my skin feel good</li>
            <li> , I thought that I would give it a try, given that the price was reasonable compared to more upscale brands.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product for those with sensitive skin who are looking for a refreshing, lightly moisturizing mist.</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate so this is a perfect spritz to give you that fresh out of the shower feel on your face.  </li>
            <li> makes my skin feel great, especially over make up, makes foundation feel much lighter and fresher.</li>
            <li> A great, calming hydrating must for dry skin, hot weather and stressful situations.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It contains the antioxidant vitamin E, which protects the skin, glycerin moisturizes and a slight fragrance of rosewater refreshes and smells great.</li>
            <li> However, it definitely does work, and I will most certainly buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> It smells like rosewater, which I don&#x27;t really like, but have come to enjoy when I spritz my face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth noting that I&#x27;ve never had a problem with [[ASIN:B000HJUYAU</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel so fresh</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great to spritz on your eyeshadow brush before applying if you want to get a creamer, more dramatic color.</li>
            <li> There are other sprays that are also good for the skin, but you get them in the eye and OUCH</li>
            <li> I guess my expectation was it would feel moisturized right away.</li>
            <li> I have also discovered that on the days I wear make up if I spritz right before I apply my mineral powder</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive and break out easily.  </li>
            <li> The second most obvious thing is the nice smell.  </li>
            <li> Very gentle and non-irritating.&lt;br</li>
            <li> hot days</li>
            <li> it makes my skin so soft and smooth</li>
            <li> I wondered if I found a facial mist to spray over the makeup, would my skin look more dewy rather than powdery/dry?  </li>
            <li> My makeup really does stay fresh all day.  </li>
            <li> Works pretty well.</li>
            <li> But spraying this mist before and after putting make up HELPS so much!</li>
            <li> you apply the product to your face, the first thing you notice is a cooling sensation.</li>
            <li> Even after the first application, there is a smoother feel to the skin.</li>
            <li> However, when I first used the product, within minutes, it feels like my skin is drier than when I started.</li>
            <li> Once your skin dries, it is drier than when you started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might try using a moisturizer first and then applying this product to see if I am happier with the results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for the winter, especially if you&#x27;ve got dry flaky skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a soft mist that sets your makeup &amp; gives you a cool feeling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is great for combination skin in dry weather, and dry skin in all types of weather.</li>
            <li> I may sound like Goldilocks here, but I&#x27;ve tried some mist sprays that are too heavy and some that are too light, but this one is just right.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin with dry cheeks, and this spray is light enough not to make me break out, but refreshing and moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The fragrance of the rosewater is a little too much for me, but this is a nice product.  </li>
            <li> Or anytime really.</li>
            <li> Hydrates very well.</li>
            <li> It absolutely corrects that issue.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d come home looking like I did before getting ready that morning.  </li>
            <li> and this is gentle and has not caused me any irritation.</li>
            <li> so I really need a product to help with skin irritation.</li>
            <li> It seals my face haha</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve very shinny and oily skin</li>
            <li> It is gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> I got it for days that my bare minerals makeup looked dry on my skin to use as a setting lotion and to look more dewy fresh.  </li>
            <li> Just cool and adds enough moisture to your face without feeling like mud.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I mainly use it to set my make-up.</li>
            <li> I use this mainly to set my makeup after applying.  </li>
            <li> My mother particularly likes this product as a way to \\&quot;freshen up\\&quot; during the day without needing to remove or reapply makeup.    </li>
            <li> I use it after bathing, sun exposure, or mainly after shaving.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot between the USA and South Africa (very long flights), and on my most recent trip I bought the face mist at duty free to see if it helps with the beating my skin takes from the dry airplane air.</li>
            <li> But wow, it helps me so much.  </li>
            <li> However, I feel the mist is not so effective per spray, at least to my skin.</li>
            <li> Refreshing and a staple to everyday makeup sealer</li>
            <li> Since I got back, I&#x27;ve kept on using it, because my skin feels super soft, and I&#x27;m now looking into buying the rest of the Vitamin E series.</li>
            <li> I spray it lightly over my face makeup to set it and it gives slightly dewy effect.</li>
            <li> Face feels cool and refreshed when applied, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything other than that.  </li>
            <li> I would warn to have a light finger on the spray nozzle as if you don&#x27;t it can look a little plasticky which happened to me</li>
            <li> I just need a little moisture after the shower but many lotions or facial products make me greasy immediately...  </li>
            <li> This gives my skin a soft and supple appearance and the powdery look is gone.  </li>
            <li> After sprayed, the skin feels a bit velvety and soft to touch.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN</li>
            <li> Face Mist really helps with daily care including razor burn.</li>
            <li> I like to keep my skincare fairly natural and aside from facewash</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s a \\&quot;feminine\\&quot; floral scent, I&#x27;ve never seen a sweaty guy turn down a spritz to help cool off.  </li>
            <li> Actually, it&#x27;s also awesome for cold, windy, dry air too, so just buy it.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s small enough to fit easily in the door) and take it out for a little pick-me-up to help beat the heat.  </li>
            <li> In the several weeks I have been using it, my skin has been better, less dry,  with a much nicer overall appearance&lt;</li>
            <li> For over 7 years I have been battling Adult Acne Rosacea with little success.  </li>
            <li> I used the makeup very sparingly, but even so, found that my skin looked a bit powdery and dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searching for a product to moisturizer my face during the day,  I had used evian in the past, so I&#x27;m excited to use this.  </li>
            <li> If I spritz a little of this on after applying my makeup I still have a fresh face of foundation, bronzer, shadow, etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first mist, so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s any better or worse than any other one.</li>
            <li> I generally use this to set my makeup.  </li>
            <li> I use this under my bare minerals powder foundation as a primer.</li>
            <li> Bare Minerals).  </li>
            <li> I spray it on bare skin as a pick me up</li>
            <li> Usually, I have no problem with The Body Shop&#x27;s products on my sensitive skin, but something in this face spray doesn&#x27;t work right for me.  </li>
            <li> The spray application system means that you only use a tiny amount per application, so a bottle will last you a pretty long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do love this face spray, I make it stretch a little further by pouring a little into another smaller spray bottle and mixing it with water.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also spray it on my bare face when I&#x27;m not wearing makeup and before going outside in the sun.</li>
            <li> When my makeup looks so dry after applying, I spray the mist on my face and there is a soft glow.</li>
            <li> bought this thinking it would be a cheaper solution than other items I would normally buy.</li>
            <li> So I have very dry skin and was looking for a quick fix to help set my makeup since it usually flakes</li>
            <li> The Body Shop Vitamin E Body Butter]], which is from the same product line, so if you&#x27;re hoping to get the benefits of Vitamin E and have sensitive skin, there are other options.</li>
            <li> but the pricing is just too high with so little.</li>
            <li> push down spray action</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this hoping to add a little youthful sheen to this 63 year old complexion and this does the trick</li>
            <li> It gives just enough moisture and protects my face all day long!  </li>
            <li> My skin is extremely dry and gets flaky in winter, especially after putting make up.</li>
            <li> I still stand by the statement that my face feels more dry after using it, but after a few days of using it, I have noticed a DRAMATIC difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> so it lasts a really long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on a bad skin kick and haven&#x27;t been able to do that for the last 6 months!</li>
            <li> After washing my face in the shower, I tend to have dry spots.  </li>
            <li> My skin sometimes get dry</li>
            <li> and I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> Just wish it was a little bigger.</li>
            <li> I recently started regularly wearing makeup and was having a hard time finding a face powder (that wasn&#x27;t chalky looking) to set my foundation.</li>
            <li> It softens the look without adding a sheen or making it so moist that it looks wet.  </li>
            <li> and I wake up to a dewey, pink complexion like I had when</li>
            <li> with minimal effects.  </li>
            <li> Only used it a few times because of the smell.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no evidence whatsoever of it helping me look refreshed.</li>
            <li> but I learned and that was easily fixed by  tissuing off a little or putting a little powder over to tone it down.</li>
            <li> It seems hard to control the spray because it is a heavy mist, so having bangs makes this even more difficult to use, I don&#x27;t want it in my hair.</li>
            <li> It produces a mist, unlike other spray bottles where you can see beads of water on your face after spraying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not feel watery but like an extremely watered down moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is one of those products that is so hard to explain why it is sooo addictive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving The Body Shop Vitamin E Face Mist a four-star review because it&#x27;s not a great product for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> After reading a lot of reviews, I decided to try a face mist and based on previous reviews for this one</li>
            <li> for the first time i have a glow all over my face after being in cold windy weather.</li>
            <li> It is not a fine mist, so even with one spray it can literally run down your face.</li>
            <li> This hasn&#x27;t given me any trouble at all.</li>
            <li> The spray doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li> I have tried using other sprays after facials and seriously regretted it..</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like body shop stuff, but this is liquid gold.</li>
            <li> I used to use rosewater spray from Mario Badescu (might&#x27;ve spelled wrong), but I needed something travel sized for plane ride, especially the 14hr flight between US and China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product can be hard to find...</li>
            <li> Whenever i get up late, i spray it over my face.</li>
            <li> May as well just spray water, at least I wouldn&#x27;t have that smell to deal with.</li>
            <li> Not surprisingly, my makeup always used to wear off throughout the day</li>
            <li> After 3 days of using this, you can&#x27;t even see them unless you look really hard!</li>
            <li> I am not great at keeping up with moisturizing but with this one all I have to do is spritz my face when I walk by.</li>
            <li> You wont be sorry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit I get weird looks when i pull this out of my purse and just spray my face at random times.  </li>
            <li> It is January and unusually cold here, I start in the morning with this spray and then refresh in the afternoon as I work outdoors all day, even in the cold.</li>
            <li> This week, I have a terrible cold, and my skin feels dried out, even with my humidifier.  </li>
            <li> I hate that.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I may sound like Goldilocks here, but I&#x27;ve tried some mist sprays that are too heavy and some that are too light, but this one is just right. Perfect for the amount of moisture that my face needs.</li>
            <li> Excellent for setting makeup. Keeps mineral powder from looking &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34;. It softens the look without adding a sheen or making it so moist that it looks wet.  Also very good for skin and very refreshing to use throughout the day. Wish I could find a fully organic alternative that worked as well as this. But I make the concession because this stuff just works so well and feels so good.</li>
            <li> This is just rose water.  Face feels cool and refreshed when applied, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything other than that.  It would be cheaper to buy it locally or make it yourself.</li>
            <li> I use it hours after putting foundation on, to refresh my face. It makes my skin glisten and glow.</li>
            <li> Wish it was cheaper but it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I was looking more for an aresol, but this works fine.  I am planning a trip to Hawaii and wanted something to keep my skin refreshed.  I think this product will work well.</li>
            <li> Love it!  A great, calming hydrating must for dry skin, hot weather and stressful situations. A must have for everyone!</li>
            <li> I use this under my bare minerals powder foundation as a primer. I had two blemishes that had scabbed over and taking their dear sweet time healing. After 3 days of using this, you can&#x27;t even see them unless you look really hard! The smell isn&#x27;t great, but the lack of fragrance is probably part of what makes my skin like it so much. My blotchiness has evened out, and after only a week I can go out without makeup on. I&#x27;ve been on a bad skin kick and haven&#x27;t been able to do that for the last 6 months! Don&#x27;t be fooled by the brand. I usually don&#x27;t like body shop stuff, but this is liquid gold. I will never be without it. Easily better than $80+ stuff you would buy at a makeup counter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 50 something and I have very dry skin so I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t work well for everyone but my face loves this stuff. I mist it on before bed and I wake up to a dewey, pink complexion like I had when young(of course it does nothing for the wrinkles but I&#x27;m not asking for miracles!) It&#x27;s great for setting make-up too, especially if you finish with powder. Or anytime really. I will be ordering more when I&#x27;m out.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this hoping to add a little youthful sheen to this 63 year old complexion and this does the trick and it&#x27;s a great foundation setter instead of compact or powder. I would warn to have a light finger on the spray nozzle as if you don&#x27;t it can look a little plasticky which happened to me but I learned and that was easily fixed by  tissuing off a little or putting a little powder over to tone it down. Lov it!</li>
            <li> I do love this face spray, I make it stretch a little further by pouring a little into another smaller spray bottle and mixing it with water.&lt;br /&gt;On hot days I spray my legs, arms, hands and face!  (I mix about one part Face mist with 4 or so parts water)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it!!!</li>
            <li> So I have very dry skin and was looking for a quick fix to help set my makeup since it usually flakes, I know I am going to love this product during the summer months because it is so refreshing! I need to stock up before the price goes up, love that the company cares about the environment too, all around a great product and I will be buying more! Just wish it was a little bigger.</li>
            <li> After washing my face in the shower, I tend to have dry spots.  If I do nothing, by the end of the day my face is oily.  I hate that.  I just need a little moisture after the shower but many lotions or facial products make me greasy immediately...  BUT, this is AMAZING!  It gives just enough moisture and protects my face all day long!  I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I lived without this stuff. It&#x27;s great for the winter, especially if you&#x27;ve got dry flaky skin. I mainly use it to set my make-up. It gives me a lovely dewy look.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Makes my face feel smooth and flawless. Hydrates very well. I would purchase it again. Product arrived on time. Thank you.</li>
            <li> after i finish my makeup i use this and it gives my face a nice bit of moisture and pleasant aroma  I will purchase this again</li>
            <li> For over 7 years I have been battling Adult Acne Rosacea with little success.  I have used prescribed creams, facialists, OTC products, diet changes, etc. with minimal effects.  With the onset of winter I wanted to ensure my face was moisturized with the very low humidity.  While ordering a mister from Amazon, I noticed many people also ordered the Body Shop Vitamin E Face Mist.  I thought \\&quot;why not\\&quot;?  The results were almost immediate! The redness and breakouts have greatly diminished and I&#x27;m once again getting comments from people on how very nice my skin is looking.  You couldn&#x27;t ask for an easier application and it doesn&#x27;t give my skin a claustraphobic feeling.  And, the rose water scent is revitalizing and calming.  This is the best thing I&#x27;ve used in over 6 years.  I wholeheartedly recommend it, especially to premenopausal women  who are experiencing skin dryness.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product and I use it right after i wash my face. it makes my skin so soft and smooth</li>
            <li> Only used it a few times because of the smell.</li>
            <li> Whenever i get up late, i spray it over my face. It feels very good. You can use it in winter and it will protect your face from damaging. I love it</li>
            <li> This product can be hard to find...I bought two this last time.. This mist is delightful when you spray on your face.  I use it to seal my make-up as well as a re-fresherner....</li>
            <li> I travel a lot between the USA and South Africa (very long flights), and on my most recent trip I bought the face mist at duty free to see if it helps with the beating my skin takes from the dry airplane air. It was great, and every time I used it I felt refreshed. It is also so easy to apply, I just did it right there in my seat and didn&#x27;t even have to get up. Since I got back, I&#x27;ve kept on using it, because my skin feels super soft, and I&#x27;m now looking into buying the rest of the Vitamin E series.</li>
            <li> I started using the Body Shop&#x27;s Vitamin E Face Mist about 2 years ago after I had decided to try using a powdered mineral face makeup that was becoming popular (ie. Bare Minerals).  I used the makeup very sparingly, but even so, found that my skin looked a bit powdery and dry.  I wondered if I found a facial mist to spray over the makeup, would my skin look more dewy rather than powdery/dry?  I ordered the Body Shop&#x27;s Vitamin E Mist, and the results were amazing.  Now, I use a bit of the mineral face makeup, blush and then spray the facial mist as a final step. This gives my skin a soft and supple appearance and the powdery look is gone.  My makeup really does stay fresh all day.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how much better the face mist made the mineral makeup look.  I would not be able to use mineral makeup if it were not for this mist.  I also use it in the middle of the day to \\&quot;freshen\\&quot; up my look.  The mist has a light rose petal scent.  This is one of those rare \\&quot;finds\\&quot; that I will enjoy for years to come.  Try it and I think you will love it, too!</li>
            <li> This is one of those products that is so hard to explain why it is sooo addictive.  I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed any changes in my skin since starting to use it, but I LOOOOOVE it.  I got it for days that my bare minerals makeup looked dry on my skin to use as a setting lotion and to look more dewy fresh.  It absolutely corrects that issue.  It moisturizes as well.  It smells like rosewater, which I don&#x27;t really like, but have come to enjoy when I spritz my face.  It&#x27;s incredibly refreshing and for anyone living in a hot climate, you will love using this.  Actually, it&#x27;s also awesome for cold, windy, dry air too, so just buy it.  You wont be sorry.  It also is a very fine mist so it lasts a really long time.  don&#x27;t let the price scare you.</li>
            <li> The body shop has some awesome stuff this mist spray has a rosey scent it&#x27;s nice plus a nice size bottle so thank u a lot I will buy from u again definetely u guys rock!</li>
            <li> This mist is wonderful on a hot day, it really refreshes you, it smells really good also. I had used it before and decided to get another bottle, it&#x27;s great on the feet also.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well. Been using it off and on for years. Great for very dry skin that needs to be moistured in a pinch.</li>
            <li> I love this face mist! It smells so nice and keeps my face hydrated throughout the day without making it oily. It kinda makes my make-up last longer too.</li>
            <li> Looking for something in the winter to freshen up and plump your face? I purchased this hoping it would work and immediately saw fresher looking facial and neck skin. It is January and unusually cold here, I start in the morning with this spray and then refresh in the afternoon as I work outdoors all day, even in the cold. My skin feels smoother and just looks fresher...worth every penny and surprisingly inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searching for a product to moisturizer my face during the day,  I had used evian in the past, so I&#x27;m excited to use this.  So far so good.</li>
            <li> I use this mainly to set my makeup after applying.  Not surprisingly, my makeup always used to wear off throughout the day and I&#x27;d come home looking like I did before getting ready that morning.  If I spritz a little of this on after applying my makeup I still have a fresh face of foundation, bronzer, shadow, etc. when I get home.  It&#x27;s also great to spritz on your eyeshadow brush before applying if you want to get a creamer, more dramatic color.</li>
            <li> I used to use rosewater spray from Mario Badescu (might&#x27;ve spelled wrong), but I needed something travel sized for plane ride, especially the 14hr flight between US and China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a definite must:&lt;br /&gt;- I have combination skin with dry cheeks, and this spray is light enough not to make me break out, but refreshing and moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;- It does not feel watery but like an extremely watered down moisturizer. After sprayed, the skin feels a bit velvety and soft to touch.&lt;br /&gt;- The application is great. It produces a mist, unlike other spray bottles where you can see beads of water on your face after spraying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is great for combination skin in dry weather, and dry skin in all types of weather.</li>
            <li> The mist spray is fine, not like a stream. I spray it lightly over my face makeup to set it and it gives slightly dewy effect.</li>
            <li> The mister/pump did not work properly. So I had to put the contents into another spray bottle to use it.</li>
            <li> This is my all time fav face mist. I spray it on bare skin as a pick me up and you don&#x27;t have to worry about it stinging your eyes, it sets makeup perfectly plus the vitamin E is getting into your skin which helps with irritation, acne, rosacea, many skin ailments!  The PRICE is great and I plan on buying the vitamin C one next. A must have for your cosmetic bag and arrived in 2 days from ordering.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it but the pricing is just too high with so little.</li>
            <li> This rose-scented face spray is a great way to cool off during the summer.  We keep the bottle in the fridge (it&#x27;s small enough to fit easily in the door) and take it out for a little pick-me-up to help beat the heat.  Even though it&#x27;s a \\&quot;feminine\\&quot; floral scent, I&#x27;ve never seen a sweaty guy turn down a spritz to help cool off.  The Vitamin E contained in the mist will make your skin feel great for a long time after using the spray as well.  My mother particularly likes this product as a way to \\&quot;freshen up\\&quot; during the day without needing to remove or reapply makeup.    I&#x27;m giving The Body Shop Vitamin E Face Mist a four-star review because it&#x27;s not a great product for sensitive skin.  Usually, I have no problem with The Body Shop&#x27;s products on my sensitive skin, but something in this face spray doesn&#x27;t work right for me.  A couple of spritzes worked fine for a while, but I&#x27;ve stopped using it since I started getting itchy skin, then redness.  The rest of my family still enjoys this product, so we keep it on hand.      It&#x27;s worth noting that I&#x27;ve never had a problem with [[ASIN:B000HJUYAU The Body Shop Vitamin E Body Butter]], which is from the same product line, so if you&#x27;re hoping to get the benefits of Vitamin E and have sensitive skin, there are other options.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It goes on very light on my skin.  I use it after my cardio workouts to help refresh my skin for the rest of the day.  I can also carry it in my handbag and use it when I need to freshen up.  This comes in handy while traveling too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long day?  Use the Face Mist!  It feels cool and lightweight on my skin.  Very gentle and non-irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Body Shop is one of my favorite brands since it is natural and readily available at the mall!</li>
            <li> Feels good and very light mist.  Improved skin tone as well though I have only used it about two weeks.  I will re-order it for sure.</li>
            <li> Smells great and feels good on the skin. Feels refreshing and is light.</li>
            <li> This is a great makeup setting spray.  I use a powder mineral foundation and this helps set it for the day. It&#x27;s a nice pick me up during the day as well.  I have fairly sensitive skin and this is gentle and has not caused me any irritation.</li>
            <li> Just normal, nothing great about it. I also feel as if it&#x27;s a bit too watery. I could just make a homemade one with my own scents. It was a bit on the pricy side. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be purchasing it again. I think it&#x27;s a bit overrated here on Amazon. I think the Korean Face Mists are made a lot better...it doesn&#x27;t make you feel like you&#x27;re getting drenched with water.</li>
            <li> I HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN AND IT MADE MY FACE BREAKOUT</li>
            <li> LOVE The Body Shop E Face Mist!! Been using it for decades! I hope they never stop making this! I spray it on over my make-up to set it. I also spray it on my bare face when I&#x27;m not wearing makeup and before going outside in the sun. It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> I like the rose aroma very much! However, I feel the mist is not so effective per spray, at least to my skin. I have to have several sprays to make my skin feel good</li>
            <li> Applewel Therapeutics has a face and body mist that I think works much better. I use it after bathing, sun exposure, or mainly after shaving. I shave my head so I really need a product to help with skin irritation.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wedding and ended up adding it to my regular makeup routine. My skin sometimes get dry so it&#x27;s really nice to have something I can spray on over my makeup to help moisturize my skin. It&#x27;s also really great and keeping makeup from looking cakey or powdery and leaves my face with a nice glow.</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely dry and gets flaky in winter, especially after putting make up. But spraying this mist before and after putting make up HELPS so much! for the first time i have a glow all over my face after being in cold windy weather.</li>
            <li> The fragrance of the rosewater is a little too much for me, but this is a nice product.  I prefer the Urban Decay B6 spray.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff! Works great with powder foundation makeup</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit I get weird looks when i pull this out of my purse and just spray my face at random times.  But wow, it helps me so much.  This week, I have a terrible cold, and my skin feels dried out, even with my humidifier.  This is an instant relief for me and it&#x27;s soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep some on hand.  It&#x27;s a small bottle, perfect for a purse.  It has a wonderful very mild scent, and it feels soft and nice on the skin.  I&#x27;m very sensitive and break out easily.  This hasn&#x27;t given me any trouble at all.</li>
            <li> Love the lightness of the rose water scent! I didn&#x27;t expect it, but it is very true smelling and I feel like it does its job of keeping my face moist. It seals my face haha</li>
            <li> gotta remember to close your mouth when using.. not the best taste, but works great</li>
            <li> Body Shop has a great product here. Face Mist really helps with daily care including razor burn. Great light rose fragrance.</li>
            <li> I recently started regularly wearing makeup and was having a hard time finding a face powder (that wasn&#x27;t chalky looking) to set my foundation. After reading a lot of reviews, I decided to try a face mist and based on previous reviews for this one, I thought that I would give it a try, given that the price was reasonable compared to more upscale brands. I have to say that I am extremely pleased with this product. It spritzed on very lightly and evenly. I love the light rose water scent and it sets my makeup perfectly. In fact, yesterday, I was in a hurry and forgot to spray my face. When I got home, I noticed that my face a bit shiny and realized that I missed my Vitamin E face mist. That will NOT happen again! And the benefits of Vitamin E for my skin is just gravy.</li>
            <li> As soon as you spray this on your face you can actually feel your skin relax, it&#x27;s a trip. I live in a dry climate so this is a perfect spritz to give you that fresh out of the shower feel on your face.  I also use it to set my make-up. Love love love!</li>
            <li> I like it, feels refreshing. I put it on after my makeup it helps set it and seems to finish it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve very shinny and oily skin and when I apply HD foundation and powder my skin gets cakey and blah, this gives it back it&#x27;s glow, and controls my shine a bit at the same time.</li>
            <li> It is gentle on the skin. This is the only spray I use after I&#x27;ve had a facial while my skin is hypersensitive. I have tried using other sprays after facials and seriously regretted it..it stung and my face turned red, this is the only one I know of that doesnt. Another thing ,  it doesn&#x27;t sting if it gets in the eyes. There are other sprays that are also good for the skin, but you get them in the eye and OUCH&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you apply the product to your face, the first thing you notice is a cooling sensation. The second most obvious thing is the nice smell.  Even after the first application, there is a smoother feel to the skin. In the several weeks I have been using it, my skin has been better, less dry,  with a much nicer overall appearance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It contains the antioxidant vitamin E, which protects the skin, glycerin moisturizes and a slight fragrance of rosewater refreshes and smells great. I think the rosewater is primarily added to give the product a nice scent, but rosewater&lt;br /&gt;is also reputedly good for cleansing and toning skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The push down spray action is really good and sprays a wonderful mist onto your face (or wherever you spray it). The spray application system means that you only use a tiny amount per application, so a bottle will last you a pretty long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very Very Nice</li>
            <li> My original review is below. I still stand by the statement that my face feels more dry after using it, but after a few days of using it, I have noticed a DRAMATIC difference in my skin. It is smoother, softer, and it is truly moisturizing. I guess my expectation was it would feel moisturized right away. However, it definitely does work, and I will most certainly buy more when I run out. Great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;I bought this thinking it would be a cheaper solution than other items I would normally buy. However, when I first used the product, within minutes, it feels like my skin is drier than when I started. I sprayed on my face immediately after washing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read other reviews that said this is great for setting your makeup, but what I was looking for in a spray is something that will moisturize my face for a long time without having to go to great lengths to apply a cream or lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does smell good and cools you off when you first use it, but it doesn&#x27;t have a moisturizing effect that lasts. Once your skin dries, it is drier than when you started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might try using a moisturizer first and then applying this product to see if I am happier with the results. If so, I will come back and change my rating. For now, it is just \\&quot;ok\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I generally use this to set my makeup.  It feels great and never makes my face look shiny or feel greasy.  It also causes no breakouts.  I&#x27;m not sure how it will hold up in summer (when it is a lot hotter), but this winter it has been awesome!</li>
            <li> The mist is light, and refreshing.  No scent to it - which is what i wanted.  Just cool and adds enough moisture to your face without feeling like mud.</li>
            <li> This is handy when traveling or at work when you need a pick me up. The spray doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first mist, so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s any better or worse than any other one. They all seem to smell like rosewater. I like how it sets my make-up and it seems to help my skin stay hydrated all day with just the morning spritz!</li>
            <li> When my makeup looks so dry after applying, I spray the mist on my face and there is a soft glow.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product for those with sensitive skin who are looking for a refreshing, lightly moisturizing mist. Ideal product for airplane travel, simple application, and the light scent is lovely. Best of all, no harsh chemicals or ingredients. Its safe enough to use for kiddos in the summer, and perfectly sized for your purse. Also great as a way to set or freshen make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE this product &amp; recommend it strongly.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this spray! Makes my skin feel refreshed and hydrated. I also use it to set my make up. Will definitely buy again. I have oily acneic skin and it does not break me out.</li>
            <li> This has done nothing for me. I don&#x27;t like the overly strong rose smell. It is not a fine mist, so even with one spray it can literally run down your face. It seems hard to control the spray because it is a heavy mist, so having bangs makes this even more difficult to use, I don&#x27;t want it in my hair. I have absolutely no evidence whatsoever of it helping me look refreshed. May as well just spray water, at least I wouldn&#x27;t have that smell to deal with. Just not for me.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel so fresh and it smells wonderful.  I am a rose fan.  I bought 2 bottles, one for me and one for a gift.</li>
            <li> makes my skin feel great, especially over make up, makes foundation feel much lighter and fresher. I especially love it on a hot sunny day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time. I was very happy to find a place to buy it.  It always brightens up my make up and refreshes my face.</li>
            <li> This is so refreshing. It&#x27;s a soft mist that sets your makeup &amp; gives you a cool feeling. This is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve ordered it &amp; will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I use this product as a mist to set my makeup. It works well for that and has a slight rose scent that is very pleasant.</li>
            <li> Refreshing and a staple to everyday makeup sealer</li>
            <li> I love this stuff- I like to keep my skincare fairly natural and aside from facewash I am not great at keeping up with moisturizing but with this one all I have to do is spritz my face when I walk by. I have also discovered that on the days I wear make up if I spritz right before I apply my mineral powder it stays on longer!</li>
            <li> Healthy glow and so good for your skin</li>
