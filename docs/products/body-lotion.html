            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>and I will be buying more soon because its almost gone lol thanks again</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and light.</li>
            <li>I love this Bath &amp; Body Works lotion.</li>
            <li>Love this product, and its cheaper than buying it in the store so there you go.</li>
            <li>what more do you need?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is my favorite scent from Bath and Body works.</li>
            <li>love this product so much that I had to buy 2 at this price! :)</li>
            <li>It is sweet and light, I love it.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I am super picky about lotions and scents.</li>
            <li>, am just in love and gonna keep ordering the lotion, and boutta get ready and buy the SHOWERGEL:)</li>
            <li>I got mines quick and easy</li>
            <li>what was that scented powder people used to use in the 80s - Shower Fresh!</li>
            <li>Granted, I&#x27;ve never tried this scent before, but I was looking to try something new and this one sounded delicious based on the other reviews.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it arrived quickly, sealed, and in an adequate package.</li>
            <li>The lotion version of this scent is super moisturizing, which is the case with all bath and body works lotions.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>The moisturizing quality of these Bath &amp; Body Works lotions doesn&#x27;t really vary between each scent — overall, they&#x27;re okay, but I much prefer their triple-moisture creams as a truly GOOD moisturizer that works well.</li>
            <li>Was supposed to be for kids but more of an adult scent.</li>
            <li>just a little too strongly like flowers, in an almost sickly-sweet kind of way, for my tastes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for everyday wear or just occasionally!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li>it was fast...</li>
            <li>It is also very fragrant.</li>
            <li>it I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much from lotion</li>
            <li>It is very creamy and moisturizes well.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>i have some bath and body works lotion that&#x27;s three years old and the smell is still nice and long lasting...</li>
            <li>The lotion is very creamy and keeps my body hydrated and soft feeling.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like they mixed Shower Fresh with baby powder.</li>
            <li>Just what I wanted, although the bottle is in the new style, so don&#x27;t be misled by the picture.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion, I use it everyday after my bath!</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so soft!</li>
            <li>this is pure junk... if the company is making this it should go back to the old ways...</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t waste your money... not even if it&#x27;s free  the two stars are for the shipping</li>
            <li>If you like organic, natural, earthy floral scents, do not buy this.</li>
            <li>no long lasting smell not even for a minute...</li>

            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t stay for too long, but</li>
            <li> I like that you can get just the lotion and not have to buy a combo of lotion,body wash, and other stuff</li>
            <li> And I hate super sickly sweet smelling scents, because they just smell so chemically and fake.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this is the second worse scent they have, besides Pink Chiffon.</li>

            <li> and I use this everyday</li>
            <li> Maybe my smeller is broken, but this scent is definitely just not for me.</li>
            <li> Not strong..</li>
            <li> Except this one, smells like fake sugar scent and a tiny pinch of black pepper.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, really...</li>
            <li> They both have this horrible overpowering candy smell that reminds me of those sweet childrens perfumes.</li>
            <li> Just awful.</li>

            <li> My mother love it. I love them. They are the same way it is describe. Buy it for your girl. People should buy with no fear. I am happy that I bought them.</li>
            <li> I love the smell it is sort of like flowers, but the scent only lasts about an hour</li>
            <li> I Bought Different Scents For My Cousin On Her Birthday And She Loved Them, Her Favorite Was The &amp;#34;Paris Amour&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The moisturizing quality of these Bath &amp; Body Works lotions doesn&#x27;t really vary between each scent — overall, they&#x27;re okay, but I much prefer their triple-moisture creams as a truly GOOD moisturizer that works well. What I don&#x27;t like about this one, though, is the scent. I&#x27;ve been using it, but it&#x27;s definitely one of my least-favorite scents that I&#x27;ve ordered from B&amp;BW over the years. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, really...just a little too strongly like flowers, in an almost sickly-sweet kind of way, for my tastes.</li>
            <li> Thank u again I got mines quick and easy and I love it and I use this everyday and I will be buying more soon because its almost gone lol thanks again</li>
            <li> Another take on baby powder, IMO. As if they mixed... what was that scented powder people used to use in the 80s - Shower Fresh! It&#x27;s like they mixed Shower Fresh with baby powder. Voila, Paris Amour! Granted, I&#x27;ve never tried this scent before, but I was looking to try something new and this one sounded delicious based on the other reviews. Maybe my smeller is broken, but this scent is definitely just not for me. Otherwise, it arrived quickly, sealed, and in an adequate package.</li>
            <li> no long lasting smell not even for a minute... go figure... i have some bath and body works lotion that&#x27;s three years old and the smell is still nice and long lasting... this is pure junk... if the company is making this it should go back to the old ways... don&#x27;t waste your money... not even if it&#x27;s free  the two stars are for the shipping it was fast...</li>
            <li> Came the same as if I purchased it in the Bath &amp; Body Works store. Great price.</li>
            <li> Bought this for the wife.  She loves the smell.  Couldn&#x27;t find it at the stores, so got it here. it does smell good!</li>
            <li> Booo can i take it back</li>
            <li> Scent is all a matter of opinion. I personally like earthy/floral/lightly fruity scents. And I hate super sickly sweet smelling scents, because they just smell so chemically and fake. This is no exception. In my opinion, this is the second worse scent they have, besides Pink Chiffon. They both have this horrible overpowering candy smell that reminds me of those sweet childrens perfumes. Except this one, smells like fake sugar scent and a tiny pinch of black pepper. Just awful. But then again, all people like different scents. If you like organic, natural, earthy floral scents, do not buy this. The three stars is for the wonderful quality of the lotion itself.</li>
            <li> Nom nom smells soooo good. Was supposed to be for kids but more of an adult scent. (so of course I kept it)</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, I use it everyday after my bath! I like that you can get just the lotion and not have to buy a combo of lotion,body wash, and other stuff, this was a good price too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and light. Not strong.. Everyone likes it. . Always carry it in my purse and let people sample it when I use it.. no complaints. .</li>
            <li> This product is great.  The lotion is very creamy and keeps my body hydrated and soft feeling.  It is also very fragrant.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells incredible! The smell doesn&#x27;t stay for too long, but it I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much from lotion that&#x27;s pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> I love this Bath &amp; Body Works lotion. It is very creamy and moisturizes well. This is the lotion I keep at my desk and I get a lot of compliments about the scent. I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love love love this scent!! It is nice springy scent and it goes great with any fruity body spray/perfume! The lotion version of this scent is super moisturizing, which is the case with all bath and body works lotions. Highly recommend this!!</li>

            <li> Ok, so I am super picky about lotions and scents. I bought this lotion along with the fragrance mist in hopes that I would like it. I do! It&#x27;s perfect for everyday wear or just occasionally! I will definantly buy this again once I&#x27;m out!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! Great smell.</li>
            <li> Love this product, and its cheaper than buying it in the store so there you go.</li>

            <li> This is my favorite scent from Bath and Body works. It is sweet and light, I love it. I typically put this on after I shower, it makes the scent last longer. I also have this in the body spray as well. Makes my skin feel so soft!</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted, although the bottle is in the new style, so don&#x27;t be misled by the picture.</li>
            <li> Great deal on a wonderful scent!</li>
