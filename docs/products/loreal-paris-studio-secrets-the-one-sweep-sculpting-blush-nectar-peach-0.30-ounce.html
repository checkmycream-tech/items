            <li> Only deducted one star because the lighter color is a little bit too orange, even though color is peach.</li>
            <li> but I get color other requests and in turn was a compact powder and blush was reached</li>
            <li> Use it everyday.</li>
            <li> However I found the brush to be very stiff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a color that gives you subtle highlights on your cheek and not the &amp;#34;made up&amp;#34; look.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really useless.</li>
            <li> Awful, wasted money.</li>
            <li> Worst product ever!!!</li>
            <li> this is the worst blush ever !</li>

            <li> Just what my wife needed to do her make up!</li>
            <li> Pigments are so light. It&#x27;s really useless.</li>
            <li> Good engineering with the brush hidden underneath the blush. However I found the brush to be very stiff. It would be helpful to have the brush as 2 colored sides to let the user know which side has been used for blush and which side has been used for highlight. Overall, may be this is a good product, but it gave the feeling of a low quality makeup due to the stiffness of the brush. I cannot even tell if I have put on anything.</li>
            <li> Nice combination of colors for sculpting blush. convenient packaging, though i hoped for a softer brush. plenty of color combinations to choose from so i got a couple.</li>
            <li> I usually use the brand and like  it , Good quality , and I usually order for family and friends too</li>
            <li> Product came on time and in perfect shape. I like having the dual colors in one compact for contouring. Or, the darker color can be used as a quick eye shadow if you&#x27;re short on time.  Only deducted one star because the lighter color is a little bit too orange, even though color is peach.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal makeup products are very good.  They are easy to apply, the colors are amazing and the prices are very reasonable.</li>
            <li> It is what it says and does what it says. Very pleased with it and have to keep typing til it tells me I can submit lol</li>
            <li> This blush doesn&#x27;t grab onto my brush well, but that&#x27;s not a big issue with me. The brush that comes in this compact is useless, I would suggest using your own. I felt that the color was very beautiful and very natural, perfect for contouring the cheeks. I tend to just sweep the brush on both sides of the panel to get an equal amount of color, instead of using the blushes separately. Overall im satisfied with this product and will be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> I adore Loreal cosmetics and so happy to have it....my skin look so natural and perfect match to my skin tone</li>
            <li> Worst product ever!!! Dont buy this...i dont know if this is old or a copy but i get more color with nothing than with this...Awful, wasted money.</li>
            <li> the product is good but I get color other requests and in turn was a compact powder and blush was reached</li>
            <li> Nice product. Use it everyday. Looks very natural.</li>
            <li> I like it, it works wonderfully.  I would buy more from this brand.  I like the blush and bronzer together.</li>
            <li> I wanted a blush that is not obvious when you have it on.  It&#x27;s hard to find a color that gives you subtle highlights on your cheek and not the &amp;#34;made up&amp;#34; look.  This color combination is good, I like the peach most but I blend the 2 together as well.  I have medium to light skin, it is perfect for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> this is the worst blush ever ! nothing good about it ... save your money</li>
            <li> The blush to me is a very suttle blush. If you&#x27;re looking for vibrant colors look somewhere else. I like the idea of the brush but it&#x27;s more of a hassle. I use my own. I like it for in a pinch or for day wear would not be part of evening or event makeup</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even show on my face. These colors are too light</li>
            <li> just ok not great color</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be pinkish so I don&#x27;t want to add more pink with a blush.  This is a natural looking blush perfect for daytime and or professional business conservative look.  This is the 3rd one I&#x27;ve purchased and is my everyday go to and favorite blush color ever!  The picture looks a tad more brownish than it is.  It is a very nice natural peachy color.</li>
            <li> Excellent, just realized that there is an enclosed mirror and brush.  I prefer my own brush.  I use the brown to set concealer, as well.</li>
            <li> Penelope D.&lt;br /&gt;I really Love the product, I&#x27;d buy again. Thanks..</li>
            <li> good quality but shade is very light I have white skin and it doesn&#x27;t even show on my cheeks! I recommend in different color.</li>
