    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Cant go without this one, really good!</li>
            <li>I get comments all of the time on how great I look</li>
            <li>It would be really great to see the  &#x27;clinical study&#x27; results, which i believe were done in Relastin&#x27;s lab?  </li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>It works just as great as the revitalizer.  </li>
            <li>so I am happy with the Eye Silk.  </li>
            <li>It makes a great eye shadow primer before putting on makeup.  </li>
            <li>Well, I just got my new annual Best of Beauty issue of Allure and guess which product won best anti-aging eye cream?  </li>
            <li>And a good sunblock.  </li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>After searching for a product that would help improve the elasticity of the under eye area, I chose this product based on the good reviews, but have to admit that I see NO change in the elasticity of my skin.  </li>
            <li>and they both loved it too.</li>
            <li>It makes my face around my eyes feel really good.</li>
            <li>and she was sure I had had cosmetic surgery!  </li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for six months and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>It feels great when you apply it and it makes a huge difference in how my eyes look.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with the difference the eye silk has made.  </li>
            <li>It feels really nice and \\&quot;silky\\&quot; going on your skin, but as for wrinkle appearance improvement....</li>
            <li>Plus, it does a nice job firming and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>It feels really nice to the touch and on the skin.</li>
            <li>I use Relastin Skin Revitalizer and love it</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s my brighter eyes that are making the difference.  </li>
            <li>The eye silk is an important part of my nightly routine now!    </li>
            <li>Anyway, it is a great product and it really works.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ll let you know if things get better.</li>
            <li>so I could see which one worked better.</li>
            <li>where I could not say which one was had better skin.     </li>
            <li>As of 31 days of use, the eye I used Prevage on is definitely better.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I am a contact lens wearer, and many under-eye products seem to seep into my eyes and under my lenses during the course of the day.</li>
            <li>I apply it only around my eyes which paid off: my hiking pal was impressed that I don&#x27;t have a lot of crow&#x27;s feet at the age of 68.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I also love the consistency of the product; it is truly like silk.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for quite a while and love it.</li>
            <li>It is a refreshing feeling and people tell me that I do not look my age.</li>
            <li>Great under the eyes, really smoothens fine lines and make them invicible.</li>
            <li>But for under eye wrinkles and fine lines, the Prevage eye looks much better.     </li>
            <li>I have recommended this product to my two sisters (in their 50s) who have very fair, fragile skin</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I liked it after the first thre months</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t hoping for a miracle, just a reduction in fine lines.</li>
            <li>Relastin Eye Silk is supposed to \\&quot;promote the formation of elastin to reduce fine lines and wrinkles, enhance smoothness and restore elasticity.\\&quot;      </li>
            <li>I received a free sample of Relastin Eye Silk with an online purchase from another website.</li>
            <li>The Eye Silk has a smooth texture and it is non-greasy.</li>
            <li>I have used moisturizers(Garnier, vitamin enriched) for several years and the products do a good job at keeping my skin looking healthy.</li>
            <li>So far, the results are good</li>
            <li>From then on, though, I have seen a significant reduction in the lines and wrinkles around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>The eye silk product feels more like an ointment, and I didn&#x27;t notice much difference for about three weeks.  </li>
            <li>Um, not so much!!  </li>
            <li>That little boy told me what I&#x27;m sure everyone else was too nice to--which was that my eyes were giving away my age.  </li>
            <li>I read glowing reviews before buying it, so I figured it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>This is worth trying.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to order and receive this product, with anticipation that my 45 yr old eye bags were going to diminish.  </li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many many eye area products and this one is no better than any of the others.  </li>
            <li>My skin is much smoother and I can smile again without worrying that my eyes look crinkled.  </li>
            <li>this is the first product that I have used that I saw results immediately.  </li>
            <li>Nothing is working, it actually makes my eye bag and wrinkles even more visible.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure, but I believe I am noticing a slight reduction of fine lines under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve got a fine crop of wrinkles starting around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>how they felt in regards to their faces, we don&#x27;t really know if its relastin, or water retention or just hope that fountain of youth has been found.    </li>
            <li>This product really does feel like silk....</li>
            <li>Out of all the eye products, I really like this one.  </li>
            <li>I could only fit one in my \\&quot;fave-five\\&quot; list of look-young products:    </li>
            <li>I really like this product...</li>
            <li>I was amazed that it really worked to reduce the lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Normally a skeptic about skin products and their claims, but this Eye Silk has worked pretty well for me.  </li>
            <li>However, I really feel that I have seen the promised results from this product.  </li>
            <li>- Relastin stimulates new elastin production in your skin, for the first time since you were a teenager.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;Eye Silk\\&quot; is appropriately named, as the texture of the product is extremely silky.  </li>
            <li>I liked the product from what I could tell from the small amount provided, so decided to purchase a bottle from amazon.com.    </li>
            <li>I use the Eye Silk because that&#x27;s my particular neurosis, but my sister likes to use the Revitalizer product on her face and neck.  </li>
            <li>I am 57 years old and would describe my skin as relatively moist and full (not thin or dry)with wrinkles on my neck and around my eyes.</li>
            <li>OK, I&#x27;m a little biased -</li>
            <li>&quot; a few blemishes and imperfections, but it&#x27;s nice to have a product that actually fixes the root problem.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been back to ask that kindergartner, but everyone else seems to think my eyes are much improved!  </li>
            <li>the first did the same thing.  </li>
            <li>By the way, Dr. Hauschka Lemon Body Moisturizer also won in its category, which I also discovered WAY early.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I give it two stars is because it does feel really silky on the skin when you put it on.  </li>
            <li>I had tried different products before, but nothing really happened.</li>
            <li>I had given up completely on eye creams because none of them seemed to work, but after I became a believer in Relastin&#x27;s skin revitalizer, I decided to give the eye silk a shot.  </li>
            <li>But so far, I think I like it.</li>
            <li>The skin around my eyes was turning papery on the edges and puffy near my nose.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel baby soft and it makes the lines and wrinkles go away.  </li>
            <li>I use this after my moisturizer, just before i put make up on and it really makes a big diff</li>
            <li>I have really liked the Revitalizer, especially because it actually worked to firm up my skin and reduce my pores.  </li>
            <li>I might use the rest of the bottle of Relastin to see if any changes occur, but just occur more slowly.</li>
            <li>My favorite other products:  ...to look younger, Relastin Revitalizer  ...to feel younger, MBT Flame Sport Walkers   ...to live longer, Weil Daily Anti-Oxidant Tablets</li>
            <li>I bought this product after first trying out Relastin&#x27;s other product, Revitalizer.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have real dark circles, but I&#x27;m getting wrinkly eyes when I smile.  </li>
            <li>After a few weeks of using it, my unsightly crows feet were barely noticable and my tired, puffy eyes looked bright and shiny again.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over four weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in my eyes, in either fine lines or dark circles.  </li>
            <li>Maybe 1 month is not long enough for this cream, though their website says results occur in 2 to 4 weeks.</li>

            <li> Maybe 1 month is not long enough for this cream, though their website says results occur in 2 to 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> One of the main reasons our skin looks old is that it loses its elastin</li>
            <li> I tried Eye silk and so far, the skin around one eye has really improved while the other one is still a little puffy (don&#x27;t know why that is!).  </li>
            <li> I was dubious as to how this would &#x27;kick start&#x27; relastin production, so I sent the list to a few dermatologists/chemists, and they said that the ingredients are basically solvents (delivery agents) and an antiseptic and sunscreen agent + they were very distrusting of polysyllabic chemicals and could not see any active ingredients that would actually do anything.  </li>
            <li> If the Aveeno doesn&#x27;t work, I will probably see a physician for non-invasive correction such as laser or other topical treatments.</li>
            <li> I was starting to see a little crepe-iness above my eyes and that is one of the things this product claims to help.  </li>
            <li> It sits on your skin and makes it seem dry.  </li>
            <li> In fact, the eye silk seemed to deepen and increase the lines under my eyes, because it appeared to make the area dry.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t turn back the clock, but I&#x27;m not going down without a fight either!</li>
            <li> so will be curious to see how it&#x27;s worked after using it for longer.</li>
            <li> I decided to use Prevage Eye on one eye and Relastin on the other</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced a facial product that is so luscious that I&#x27;d like to apply it to my entire face, yet I resist given it&#x27;s cost.</li>

            <li> So I was volounteering in a Kindergarten class awhile ago and durring carpet time, one of the little kids looked at me and said, \\&quot;You&#x27;re eyes look ooooold.\\&quot;  And that&#x27;s when I decided to start using an eye cream.  That little boy told me what I&#x27;m sure everyone else was too nice to--which was that my eyes were giving away my age.  I use Relastin Skin Revitalizer and love it so I bought the eye silk to attmept to stop my eyes from looking oooold!  I haven&#x27;t been back to ask that kindergartner, but everyone else seems to think my eyes are much improved!  I&#x27;m thrilled with the difference the eye silk has made.  My saggy bags under my eyes seem to have disappeared and my eyelids aren&#x27;t droopy anymore.  I get comments all of the time on how great I look and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s my brighter eyes that are making the difference.  The eye silk is an important part of my nightly routine now!    Em  My beauty secrets:  Absolue SPF15 by Lancome, Skin Revitalizer by Relastin, and Melon Daiquiri Lip Shine by Philosophy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been raving about this product for a year, but I&#x27;m not sure anyone believed me.  Well, I just got my new annual Best of Beauty issue of Allure and guess which product won best anti-aging eye cream?  Relastin Eye Silk.  I feel SO vindicated.  Anyway, it is a great product and it really works.  Use the Revitalizer too, on the rest of your face.  And a good sunblock.  And maybe a hat.  By the way, Dr. Hauschka Lemon Body Moisturizer also won in its category, which I also discovered WAY early.  I should have bought stock, not product.  Well, in addition to product.  Good luck.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve seen all the hype about this product on the net and by various &#x27;beauty&#x27; editors and i started researching the ingredients.  A miracle youth generating eye cream for $69 just seems ..erm...funny...    Ingredients were a bit plastic sounding to me. I was dubious as to how this would &#x27;kick start&#x27; relastin production, so I sent the list to a few dermatologists/chemists, and they said that the ingredients are basically solvents (delivery agents) and an antiseptic and sunscreen agent + they were very distrusting of polysyllabic chemicals and could not see any active ingredients that would actually do anything.  Hmmm.      It would be really great to see the  &#x27;clinical study&#x27; results, which i believe were done in Relastin&#x27;s lab?  All I&#x27;ve seen of that study has been the % of women and how they felt in regards to their faces, we don&#x27;t really know if its relastin, or water retention or just hope that fountain of youth has been found.    Now, i&#x27;ve been putting this on one side of my eye area for 4 weeks and can&#x27;t see the slightest difference.  Feels like im patting in silicone, maybe if i get enough plastic into my eye area it will appear plumped? ;)  i&#x27;ll let you know if things get better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many many eye area products and this one is no better than any of the others.  It feels really nice and \\&quot;silky\\&quot; going on your skin, but as for wrinkle appearance improvement....I didn&#x27;t see any and I used it for about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> This stuff is horrible.  I read glowing reviews before buying it, so I figured it was worth a try.  The texture is weird.  It sits on your skin and makes it seem dry.  After two months of use there was no change in the appearance of my eyes. I wasn&#x27;t hoping for a miracle, just a reduction in fine lines.</li>
            <li> I was hopeful but skeptical of this eye cream. I decided to use Prevage Eye on one eye and Relastin on the other so I could see which one worked better. My eyes started out close enough where I could not say which one was had better skin.     As of 31 days of use, the eye I used Prevage on is definitely better. I don&#x27;t have crows feet so I can&#x27;t say if Relastin helps this or not. But for under eye wrinkles and fine lines, the Prevage eye looks much better.     I might use the rest of the bottle of Relastin to see if any changes occur, but just occur more slowly. Maybe 1 month is not long enough for this cream, though their website says results occur in 2 to 4 weeks. If so I will update this review.    UPDATE: Finished the bottle after 38 days of use and still no changes.</li>
            <li> This product really does feel like silk....Out of all the eye products, I really like this one.  I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> OK, I&#x27;m a little biased - I love this product.  I&#x27;m not above \\&quot;painting over\\&quot; a few blemishes and imperfections, but it&#x27;s nice to have a product that actually fixes the root problem.  One of the main reasons our skin looks old is that it loses its elastin - Relastin stimulates new elastin production in your skin, for the first time since you were a teenager.  Plus, it does a nice job firming and moisturizing.  Relastin comes in two versions - I use the Eye Silk because that&#x27;s my particular neurosis, but my sister likes to use the Revitalizer product on her face and neck.  Your call, but I could only fit one in my \\&quot;fave-five\\&quot; list of look-young products:    [[ASIN:B0002JVPT4 Lancome Absolue Replenishing Cream SPF 15]]  [[ASIN:B00024Y6W2 Clinique Clarifying Lotion 3]]  [[ASIN:B000NGRJB4 Relastin, Eye Silk, 0.5 oz, 15 ml]]  [[ASIN:B0009DSSC0 SkinCeuticals Ultimate UV Defense SPF 30 3oz]]  [[ASIN:B000OHE56Y RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Serum 1oz]]    I can&#x27;t turn back the clock, but I&#x27;m not going down without a fight either!</li>
            <li> After applied this Eye Silk, I feel like two blocks of wax under my eyes. If I touch it, it will peel off just like wax. And even worse, it looks like scurf of my skin.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001JYYDWM Skin Revitalizer]]  I took before and after photos and religiously applied this product in addition to the coordinating night cream and eye silk.  Unfortunately, it made no obvious difference in my skin.  Some report tightening, which I did not experience. In fact, the eye silk seemed to deepen and increase the lines under my eyes, because it appeared to make the area dry.  I returned the product and will try the comparable product being made by Aveeno which costs about $60 less (for the trio of products: day, night and eye treatments for elasticity).  You can buy them at Bed, Bath and Beyond with a coupon or at local CVS stores when they are on sale for about 34.99 each. I am 57 years old and would describe my skin as relatively moist and full (not thin or dry)with wrinkles on my neck and around my eyes. I have used moisturizers(Garnier, vitamin enriched) for several years and the products do a good job at keeping my skin looking healthy. Now, I need the elasticity.  If the Aveeno doesn&#x27;t work, I will probably see a physician for non-invasive correction such as laser or other topical treatments.</li>
            <li> I really like this product... It is the 2nd time purchasing it..  It makes my eyes less puffy, less lines and the eye lid is a little firmer..  It is the only eye cream that I have ever used that did what it said it was going to...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rapidly approaching 30.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s my kids, my job or just nature taking its course, but I&#x27;ve got a fine crop of wrinkles starting around my eyes.  I just started using Eye Silk a couple of months ago and, let me tell you, it&#x27;s helped a ton!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over four weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in my eyes, in either fine lines or dark circles.  For a little background...I don&#x27;t have real dark circles, but I&#x27;m getting wrinkly eyes when I smile.  After searching for a product that would help improve the elasticity of the under eye area, I chose this product based on the good reviews, but have to admit that I see NO change in the elasticity of my skin.  The only reason I give it two stars is because it does feel really silky on the skin when you put it on.  I don&#x27;t plan on buying this product again.</li>
            <li> I have been using Eye Silk for over 6 months.  I was amazed that it really worked to reduce the lines around my eyes.  I had tried different products before, but nothing really happened. But this one does. My skin is much smoother and I can smile again without worrying that my eyes look crinkled.  I have recommended this product to my two sisters (in their 50s) who have very fair, fragile skin and they both loved it too.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I am 48 and I have been battling dark circles around my eyes since reaching adulthood.  Over the years, I have used any number of products...this is the first product that I have used that I saw results immediately.  I like the eye silk so well, I ordered the Revitalizer for the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and used it for over a month now.  Nothing is working, it actually makes my eye bag and wrinkles even more visible.  Don&#x27;t buy this product.  You are wasting your money!</li>
            <li> I started using the both Relastin skin products a couple of months ago.  The eye silk product feels more like an ointment, and I didn&#x27;t notice much difference for about three weeks.  From then on, though, I have seen a significant reduction in the lines and wrinkles around my eyes.  Last week I ran into a friend I hadn&#x27;t seen in a while and she was sure I had had cosmetic surgery!  Guess I&#x27;m hooked.  I&#x27;d recommend both products.</li>
            <li> I had given up completely on eye creams because none of them seemed to work, but after I became a believer in Relastin&#x27;s skin revitalizer, I decided to give the eye silk a shot.  It works just as great as the revitalizer.  I love it!  After a few weeks of using it, my unsightly crows feet were barely noticable and my tired, puffy eyes looked bright and shiny again.  I use this product faithfully now.  It feels great when you apply it and it makes a huge difference in how my eyes look.  I get compliments all of the time and people always think I&#x27;m younger than I actually am!    Carolyn    My favorite other products:  ...to look younger, Relastin Revitalizer  ...to feel younger, MBT Flame Sport Walkers   ...to live longer, Weil Daily Anti-Oxidant Tablets</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Relastin Eye Silk with an online purchase from another website. I liked the product from what I could tell from the small amount provided, so decided to purchase a bottle from amazon.com.    Relastin Eye Silk is supposed to \\&quot;promote the formation of elastin to reduce fine lines and wrinkles, enhance smoothness and restore elasticity.\\&quot;      \\&quot;Eye Silk\\&quot; is appropriately named, as the texture of the product is extremely silky.  It feels really nice to the touch and on the skin. I am a contact lens wearer, and many under-eye products seem to seep into my eyes and under my lenses during the course of the day. This product does not do that.    I have been using Relastin Eye Silk for two weeks or so, and I would say that I do notice less puffiness when I get up in the morning. I can&#x27;t say for sure, but I believe I am noticing a slight reduction of fine lines under my eyes.  My lines aren&#x27;t that pronounced to begin with, so I can&#x27;t jump up and down with glee over Relastin Eye Silk.  But so far, I think I like it.</li>
            <li> Normally a skeptic about skin products and their claims, but this Eye Silk has worked pretty well for me.  The skin around my eyes was turning papery on the edges and puffy near my nose.  I tried Eye silk and so far, the skin around one eye has really improved while the other one is still a little puffy (don&#x27;t know why that is!).  I liked it after the first thre months so I bought the Revitalizer to see how that worked.  I would recommend both products.  I use both twice a day - I&#x27;m addicted to the results.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after first trying out Relastin&#x27;s other product, Revitalizer.  I have really liked the Revitalizer, especially because it actually worked to firm up my skin and reduce my pores.  But I have different problems around my eye area like puffiness and I thought the Eye Silk could address that, which is normally hard to reduce.  So far, the results are good so I am happy with the Eye Silk.  This is worth trying.</li>
            <li> The Eye Silk has a smooth texture and it is non-greasy. It makes my skin feel baby soft and it makes the lines and wrinkles go away.  I&#x27;ve been using it for six months and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Great under the eyes, really smoothens fine lines and make them invicible. I use this after my moisturizer, just before i put make up on and it really makes a big diff had i not put it on. Cant go without this one, really good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced a facial product that is so luscious that I&#x27;d like to apply it to my entire face, yet I resist given it&#x27;s cost. I apply it only around my eyes which paid off: my hiking pal was impressed that I don&#x27;t have a lot of crow&#x27;s feet at the age of 68. Love it.</li>
            <li> Will never buy this product again until they change the container it comes in.  Pump stops working half way thru the bottle.  This is my second bottle and the first did the same thing.  This is not cheap eye cream so you would think they would do something.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical before buying this because of the price and the product claims.  However, I really feel that I have seen the promised results from this product.  I was starting to see a little crepe-iness above my eyes and that is one of the things this product claims to help.  I have seen an improvement in this problem over my eyes and have been using the product for about 5 weeks.  I also love the consistency of the product; it is truly like silk.  It makes a great eye shadow primer before putting on makeup.  I will buy this product again!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to order and receive this product, with anticipation that my 45 yr old eye bags were going to diminish.  After all, that&#x27;s what the advertising bragged about.  Um, not so much!!  I applied Relastin faithfully and... NOTHING.  My advice - don&#x27;t waste $70 on this product. I wish I hadn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for quite a while and love it. It makes my face around my eyes feel really good. It is a refreshing feeling and people tell me that I do not look my age. I might could attribute that to this product. Anyway, I do like it a lot and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I have only been using it nightly for two weeks and already see a difference!  the lines in my eyer area are less visible, the skin is smoother, no bags or dark circles either.  I am using this in combination with Patricia wexler m.d. de-puffing eye gel in the am and then the eye silk in the pm! Definately a winner!</li>
            <li> I have ordered this three times and every time it has arrived without the pump attachment. This leaves no way to get the product out of the small hole !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying this product but I believe it may make a difference with wrinkles.  I like that it isn&#x27;t messy and it&#x27;s easy to use.  I&#x27;ve only had it a couple of weeks so will be curious to see how it&#x27;s worked after using it for longer.</li>
