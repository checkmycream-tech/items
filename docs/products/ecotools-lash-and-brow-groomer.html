    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It is a very attractive looking comb, and does the job.</li>
            <li>What a wonderful grooming tool.</li>
            <li>Great brand!</li>
            <li>great product.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice example of a hard-to-find grooming tool.  </li>
            <li>Eco Tools is a great name and all of their products are good.  </li>
            <li>This is a good quality product.  </li>
            <li>I am changing all my brushers to cruelty free, this is great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s some kind of plastic (</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find one of these comb/brush combos locally and was very happy to find this one.</li>
            <li>Years ago I paid about $30 for it, not knowing better.</li>
            <li>At under $5, this one by EcoTools is actually better.</li>
            <li>Love all ECO tools.</li>
            <li>Love the case easy to put in make up bag.</li>
            <li>I found this to be a great brow brush, not to stif and not to soft</li>
            <li>I bought this lash/ brow comb with a make up bag/ brush holder (also made by ecotools) which is fabulous (I also reviewed it here on amazon)</li>
            <li>and so far, so good.</li>
            <li>Great brow brush doble sided and long handel makes using it easy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, the comb does look nice, has decent bristles, is made from sustainable materials, and well, it does the job....</li>
            <li>This product is durable and environmentally and animal friendly too.</li>
            <li>The brush is nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I wanted to like this brush, and bought it because of the reviews, but it fell apart fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have never had such a nice brush.</li>
            <li>Basic, easy to use tool for lashes and brows with an easy to grip handle.  </li>
            <li>all the bristles fell right out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unfortunate, I was happy to get it at such a great price.</li>
            <li>This is not good if you wish to carry it with you as it is full sized, but great to keep in your makeup drawer.</li>
            <li>Soft bristles and fine comb.</li>
            <li>needless to say, these are the best brushes ever!</li>
            <li>It says the handle is bamboo, and I don&#x27;t doubt that it is, but to me it feels very light, or perhaps hollow, idk.&lt;br /&gt;I was also under the impression that the comb part would be made of aluminum.</li>
            <li>This is a solid, long-handled brow brush with dense rows of natural, plush bristles that do a better-than-usual job of combing even the most wirey brows into shape.</li>
            <li>The bristles for the eyebrow brush are relatively stiff ( not as stiff as many others I&#x27;ve used, but are still good), but there are some reasons I gave it four out of five stars....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with it, especially considering the price, and will definitely consider buying other brushes by them in the future.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had discount store brushes last much longer.</li>
            <li>As expected, decent price.</li>
            <li>Then the plastic cracked and the whole thing was gone in less than a week.</li>

            <li> but I was disappointed because I really did want a more durable comb</li>
            <li> I use it everyday, would highly recomend it.</li>
            <li> The handle is a little too long and the brush bristles weren&#x27;t stiff enough but the price was right until it broke after two months of use.</li>
            <li> This tool sorta helps me tame those wild Loong ones.</li>
            <li> Then when it comes to the lash comb, whereas the plastic teeth are oftentimes too thick to actually clean mascara clumps from and separate lashes, the teeth of this tool are thin yet sturdy enough to do both.</li>
            <li> Find I use this regularly to tame my brows while I did not find the same for other versions I have owned with plastic handles.</li>
            <li> Bought this and other brushes probably 4-5 years ago....</li>
            <li> The glue that holds the bristles in place came undone and half the bristles came out after two months.  </li>
            <li> My main, longtime brow brush is an expensive big-name one from a department store.</li>
            <li> I have some harsh thickets known as my brows.</li>
            <li> Used it a few times &amp; then threw it out.</li>
            <li> This tool eliminates the need for excessive mascara.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this lash groomer.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product was terrible.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this lash/ brow comb with a make up bag/ brush holder (also made by ecotools) which is fabulous (I also reviewed it here on amazon)..my last brow comb I bought for five dollars and hung onto it until the teeth from the comb began to break...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is made from sustainable materials, which is something I try to look for. It is a very attractive looking comb, and does the job. The bristles for the eyebrow brush are relatively stiff ( not as stiff as many others I&#x27;ve used, but are still good), but there are some reasons I gave it four out of five stars....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It says the handle is bamboo, and I don&#x27;t doubt that it is, but to me it feels very light, or perhaps hollow, idk.&lt;br /&gt;I was also under the impression that the comb part would be made of aluminum. It&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s some kind of plastic (recycled I suppose) but I was disappointed because I really did want a more durable comb so I don&#x27;t have the same problem as the last comb I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, the comb does look nice, has decent bristles, is made from sustainable materials, and well, it does the job....</li>
            <li> I have some harsh thickets known as my brows. This tool sorta helps me tame those wild Loong ones.</li>
            <li> What a wonderful grooming tool. Soft bristles and fine comb. I have never had such a nice brush.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find one of these comb/brush combos locally and was very happy to find this one.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this lash groomer. It didn&#x27;t separate my lashes well. Used it a few times &amp; then threw it out.</li>
            <li> The handle is a little too long and the brush bristles weren&#x27;t stiff enough but the price was right until it broke after two months of use. The glue that holds the bristles in place came undone and half the bristles came out after two months.  I&#x27;ve had discount store brushes last much longer.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this brush, and bought it because of the reviews, but it fell apart fairly quickly.  I&#x27;d only been using it for a month or so when, one morning I was brushing my eyebrows and felt the brushes falling on my face.  It literally just came apart- all the bristles fell right out.  It&#x27;s unfortunate, I was happy to get it at such a great price.</li>
            <li> always a fan of these eco tools.  great product.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice example of a hard-to-find grooming tool.  It&#x27;s well made and a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> Bought this and other brushes probably 4-5 years ago....needless to say, these are the best brushes ever! I still have all of them. Great brand!</li>
            <li> This is a solid, long-handled brow brush with dense rows of natural, plush bristles that do a better-than-usual job of combing even the most wirey brows into shape. Then when it comes to the lash comb, whereas the plastic teeth are oftentimes too thick to actually clean mascara clumps from and separate lashes, the teeth of this tool are thin yet sturdy enough to do both.

I&#x27;m very happy with it, especially considering the price, and will definitely consider buying other brushes by them in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a minimalist when it comes to makeup, especially around the eyes. This product will help shape your eyebrows and lengthen your eyelashes by separating each lash with the comb part. This tool eliminates the need for excessive mascara. I use its sister eyelash brush after applying 2 coats of mascara to maximize length and to blot away mascara. This product is durable and environmentally and animal friendly too.</li>
            <li> This product was terrible. The bristles started falling out within two or three days. Then the plastic cracked and the whole thing was gone in less than a week. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> As expected, decent price. Can&#x27;t find ecoTools locally.</li>
            <li> It was just as they described it. I use it everyday, would highly recomend it. The brush is nice and soft.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality product.  Eco Tools is a great name and all of their products are good.  This is not good if you wish to carry it with you as it is full sized, but great to keep in your makeup drawer.</li>
            <li> I was looking for replacement of Revlon lash and brow groomer product which fell apart and so far, so good.</li>
            <li> I am changing all my brushers to cruelty free, this is great!</li>
            <li> I have had several brow brushes break or lose their bristles, probably because they were low quality.  This one has done the job and lasted.  I have also put it in the sleeve before dumping it into my make-up bag, which could also make a difference.  I would buy again!</li>
            <li> Great brow brush doble sided and long handel makes using it easy. Love the case easy to put in make up bag.</li>
            <li> Love all ECO tools. I found this to be a great brow brush, not to stif and not to soft</li>
            <li> Basic, easy to use tool for lashes and brows with an easy to grip handle.  Find I use this regularly to tame my brows while I did not find the same for other versions I have owned with plastic handles.</li>
