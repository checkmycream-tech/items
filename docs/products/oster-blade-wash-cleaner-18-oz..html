            <li>This stuff is amazing, I love cleaning my blades with this.</li>
            <li>You have to use a good portion of it in order to fill up a reservoir to clean the blades.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s good to clean your blade.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to hear what you guys think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see myself getting more than 5-6 washings out of it.  </li>
            <li>1 had some corrosion and this wash made all 3 sparkle and removed most of the corrosion.</li>
            <li>This stuff works as advertised, but the shipping was more than the product.  </li>
            <li>Works much better than the spray cleaner does.</li>
            <li>Works like magic on our Oster Pro hair clipper.</li>
            <li>I was glad I purchased this product.</li>
            <li>Keep&#x27;em clean and oiled!</li>
            <li>Fine.</li>
            <li>This is a great blade cleaner and the only blade cleaner I use.</li>
            <li>i love this product for my clipper blades removes all those little hairs and keeps the blades moving smoothly for continuous great haircuts</li>
            <li>I have 3 clippers that I needed to clean and sharpen.</li>
            <li>keep the blades clean with this wash.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>As I use the shears, I dip the blades into the blade wash to get some of the dirt and hair out between the blades and combs to keep them clean and lubricated as I work.</li>
            <li>Clean your blades and save on hair care</li>
            <li>I shave my head once a week and use this to clean the blades once a month.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not the identical formula for trademark purposes, but I would bet it&#x27;s very similar.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really works well getting all the fine hairs out of your clipper blades.</li>
            <li>I use it on my Oster Fast Feed after every haircut, and it keeps the blades super clean.  </li>
            <li>Well worth it.   </li>
            <li>The cap is just the right size to use as a bowl for cleaning.</li>
            <li>I use it first to clean away any coatings that are on newly purchased blades and combs, then as a wash and lubricant after I finish using the shears.  </li>
            <li>it really cleans the blades!</li>
            <li>This bottle should last me many years.</li>
            <li>I clip my horses and this keeps my blades from getting hot and keeps them lubricated .  </li>
            <li>The first time I used this I cleaned my trimmer with the spray, then used this cleaner and was amazed at how much hair was still in the blades.</li>
            <li>This works really well.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>because I enjoy the butch look and feel of a short cut.  </li>
            <li>is SO much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s instructions clearly point toward detachable blades although it does not specify anywhere so for anyone looking to clean fixed blades I suggest finding alternative unless experienced with clipper on at least a novice level!</li>
            <li>if you want your investment  insurance policy renewed this will certainly help a clean blade is next to godliness</li>
            <li>Keeps your blades clean and lasting.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, if you use clippers and don&#x27;t clean them, its your personal choice....</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this wash.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Then I oil as normal.   </li>
            <li>Like using new clippers every time.</li>
            <li>If you know what this stuff is, you cant live without it, if you use electric</li>
            <li>Since I paid a fortune for my new Oster clipper, I decided to also use the cleaner.  </li>
            <li>and the work like new again.</li>
            <li>Really cleans and lubes the blades so it is ready for the next hair cut.  </li>
            <li>It has the EXACT same smell/consistency/attributes of WD40.</li>
            <li>This time, after buying some BETTER clippers than I&#x27;ve had in the past, I decided to also try this cleaner.   </li>
            <li>Ok but found it locally for a dollar less</li>
            <li>It keeps my expensive Oster clipper blades in good shape.  </li>
            <li>I recommend only for detachable blade systems not fixed blade systems where a user may submerge too much and cause fire or clipper damage!</li>
            <li>Cleans, oils the blades, no residue, no heavy grease left overs.</li>
            <li>Only way I use this on fixed blades is removing the blade from clippers and cleaning with brush!&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I cut my hair every weekend, every few weeks I run my clippers in a small dish, with a little of this stuff and it gets all the little stuff out, they work 100x better after i clean them out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just a little after each grooming cleans them up ready for next use.</li>

            <li> It should last me a long time so maybe I&#x27;ll find a local source by the time it runs out.</li>
            <li> They last 5 times as long.</li>
            <li> I have used it several times since my purchase and I will continue to buy this as long as they sell it.</li>
            <li> Been using for years - helps create very easy cutting and only needs to be used every few weeks or so.</li>
            <li> I let them soak for about 10 min then dry and oil</li>
            <li> I never used a cleaner for my previous clipper, maybe that&#x27;s why it did not cut properly.  </li>
            <li> left a little oily residue so it helps lubricate too.</li>
            <li> not much to say here in that the wash cleans the shaver blades  .. thus it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always cut my husbands hair but never really cared or worried about</li>
            <li> It will only be a few months before the savings from not going to a barber kick in, then every cut will be money in the bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I started to give it four stars, but I&#x27;m knocking it down a star for the price.  </li>
            <li> Just put a small amount in a small dish and run the blades in it for several seconds.  </li>
            <li> the way, I put a small amount in a separate container and use that over and over for several months before it gets so dirty that I need to dump it and use some new cleaner.  </li>
            <li> Then I add a few drops of lube and the razor is just like</li>
            <li> I only use very small amounts as this stuff seems like wd-40 but does its job!</li>
            <li> It can happen in other ways when we least suspect!</li>
            <li> Not what i expected, I bought the wrong thing</li>
            <li> Not sure how this works so well, but it does and I will never be without it!</li>

            <li> It cleaned my blades well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a question... Is this WD40?  It has the EXACT same smell/consistency/attributes of WD40. I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not the identical formula for trademark purposes, but I would bet it&#x27;s very similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might save money by just using WD40. I think this is overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please smell and use WD40 and tell me this blade wash is not the same thing.  I&#x27;d love to hear what you guys think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started to give it four stars, but I&#x27;m knocking it down a star for the price.  You have to use a good portion of it in order to fill up a reservoir to clean the blades.  I can&#x27;t see myself getting more than 5-6 washings out of it.  You might save money by using WD40. (I&#x27;m not a spokesperson or anything, I just don&#x27;t like getting ripped off).  Almost $13 for this stuff that smells like kerosene.</li>
            <li> I keep ordering it I like it it really cleans the blades!</li>
            <li> This works really well. I have 3 clippers that I needed to clean and sharpen. 1 had some corrosion and this wash made all 3 sparkle and removed most of the corrosion. I highly recommend this wash.</li>

            <li> Keeps your blades clean and lasting.  I also use it on those pricey disposables.  They last 5 times as long.</li>
            <li> Blade wash for washing clipper blades! I recommend only for detachable blade systems not fixed blade systems where a user may submerge too much and cause fire or clipper damage! Oster should further protect itself by adjusting the label to reflect so! Only way I use this on fixed blades is removing the blade from clippers and cleaning with brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s instructions clearly point toward detachable blades although it does not specify anywhere so for anyone looking to clean fixed blades I suggest finding alternative unless experienced with clipper on at least a novice level! The fire/damage risk for newbies and amateurs using it, is too great I feel! I have personally caught on fire &amp;#34;edgers&amp;#34; from oster spray! It can happen in other ways when we least suspect! I only use very small amounts as this stuff seems like wd-40 but does its job!</li>

            <li> Must have. Enough said if you have animals.</li>
            <li> Fine. Works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Not sure how this works so well, but it does and I will never be without it!</li>
            <li> A must have if you spend the money on a nice set of clippers. Keep&#x27;em clean and oiled!</li>
            <li> I was glad I purchased this product. It really works well getting all the fine hairs out of your clipper blades. Just remember to oil your&lt;br /&gt;blades afterwards, because this is a solvent cleaner.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because it is made by the same company of the clippers I purchased. It&#x27;s a very good blade wash and I recommend it to others. I have used it several times since my purchase and I will continue to buy this as long as they sell it. I haven&#x27;t had any problems.</li>
