            <li>I love all things Murad.</li>
            <li>I love the bottle this cleansing cream comes in, I keep it in my shower and with the flip top lid</li>
            <li>but they always took more to do the job.  </li>
            <li>Not so sure it does so well.  </li>

            <li>I have really enjoyed this</li>
            <li>My favorite product from that line was the Renewing Cleansing Cream, but I did not want to spend $36 dollars at Murad&#x27;s website just for the cleanser.  </li>

            <li>I like it, I love it</li>

            <li>it makes my skin so nice and pretty!!</li>
            <li>Great super mild cleanser for women over 50.</li>
            <li>I have clear skin and just need a good cleanser!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great for older skin.  </li>

            <li>Fabulous service too.</li>
            <li>This product makes my skin feel hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li>My skin feels fantastic, and I always get compliments on it.</li>
            <li>Imagine my delight in discovering I could get these same products individually at a greatly reduced price through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A GOOD PRODUCT.Not enough time to make a better judgment.</li>
            <li>so is good for my sensitive skin .</li>
            <li>but the results are worth it!  </li>
            <li>I can always find most anything I&#x27;m looking for on Amazon.com, and have learned to go there first in my search!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin didn&#x27;t feel clean after using it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year and it leaves my face feeling so clean and nourishing.  </li>
            <li>Rinses clean.  </li>
            <li>Face feels clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice cleansing cream for my 60+ year old skin!  </li>
            <li>I am a nurse who worked in dermatology for many years, and did not like any of the cleansers we sold as much as this one.  </li>
            <li>The sizes you get on TV are not the full sizes these are.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have to buy extra eye makeup remover, it does a good job taking that off too.  </li>
            <li>full coverage foundation: cant do w/o this production as lone as it is full coverage</li>
            <li>and it is mild</li>
            <li>I looked on Amazon and was so happy to see it here for less money.  </li>
            <li>it cleans nicely yet does not dry me out.....</li>
            <li>No only are their prices better than any place else, my order arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li>My 30 yr old daughter started using an entire line of Murad products and I noticed her skin was looking great.  </li>
            <li>I have aging yet oily skin, and this is by far my favorite cleaser.</li>
            <li>I feel it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price for the quality of the product.</li>
            <li>This cleansing cream is great for normal to dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Never dried out my skin but leave very clean feeling.</li>
            <li>It smells so clean, the consistency is so creamy and gentle, but it removes makeup like a champ.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have time to try out the many products I order, because she keeps me pretty busy ordering stuff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many cleansers expensive and or inexpensive and by far it&#x27;s the best</li>
            <li>Mild on face and cleans very well.</li>
            <li>Just because something grows in nature does not mean it is safe for all to use near their eyes and mouths.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, I found it, and also at a reasonable price!  </li>
            <li>I am 31 years old, and have pretty normal skin, a bit more oily during the summer.</li>
            <li>My face is smooth and clear with this product.</li>
            <li>I use this product daily and am pleased with the results and on line price.</li>
            <li>love the larger size and is exactly what I used when I belonged to the murad club....</li>
            <li>Thanks Murad!</li>
            <li>Check here first.</li>
            <li>It only requires a small amount (just like the instructions say) and it makes my face and neck feel so wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I love Murad Resergence, especially the  cleasing cream.  </li>
            <li>I wet my wash cloth with warm water and wash my face with it.</li>
            <li>Good product for sensitive and dry skin</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling very clean, but moisturized at the same time.</li>
            <li>My face feels completely clean but not dried out.</li>
            <li>Left my face refreshed and clean!</li>
            <li>I will definitely come back for more very soon!!</li>
            <li>It is only 2 weeks since I have been using the entire Resurgence treatment and the results are amazing.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Very hydrating and does not irritate or clog pores.</li>
            <li>I would much prefer an odorless or a fragrant scent.  </li>
            <li>very pleansat scent, etc.</li>
            <li>Thanks, I will buy again.</li>
            <li>all the products that claim to be made by dermatologists and have celebrity endorsements, Murad is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I really like this cleanser.</li>
            <li>Thanks to this seller for bringing this to us.  </li>
            <li>i really want to buy the whole face care line from murad now.</li>
            <li>I have switched over from Clinique and my face is so much cleaner now.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other name brand products</li>
            <li>, I finally found what was right there for years!</li>
            <li>I have tried several face cleanser in my travels and found most to be very drying and not cleansing enough.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Murad products in the past and have liked it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had problems with acne and thought that they would eventually go away as I got older.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this product mainly because my wife told me too.  </li>
            <li>nevertheless, I highly recommend it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Smells clean and does not leave skin feeling dry.  </li>
            <li>Never a complaint from me.</li>
            <li>I am age 47 and  have normal combination</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is nice and creamy and you only need a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>HBC Depot is my new favourite company and I&#x27;ll be ordering from them for now on.  </li>
            <li>Not perfect, but it works well for sensitive skin which makes the wife happy.</li>
            <li>After using it my face felt dry &amp; tight, I&#x27;m concerned &amp; want to return this product as I don&#x27;t believe it is an authentic Murad product!</li>
            <li>Being someone who likes to change products on a pretty regular basis, this is one product I cannot do without, and I haven&#x27;t found anything comparable.</li>
            <li>This bottle will last several months, very well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>very few wrinkles since I&#x27;m a natural redhead and used sun protection since my 20&#x27;s when I learned better how to ward off aging...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a million cleansers and this is the only one that really cleans my face completely, with no makeup residue, and no dryness afterwards.  </li>
            <li>MY 67 year old skin loves this product</li>
            <li>My acne has completely clearer up and my skin looks brighter.</li>
            <li>Not heavily perfumed or scented</li>
            <li>It cleans so well, and feels so soft.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long ways, and it feels so good when cleansing your face...not harsh, no fragrance, and ....</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product especially to women approaching menopause.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is super silky and lathers up with just a small amount.  </li>
            <li>I will say though that some of the other Murad products did not work as promised, but the Resurgence products live up to their hype.</li>

            <li> nice thing is....</li>
            <li> The cleansing cream is very calming on the skin and has a wonderful scent.  </li>
            <li> Its just a wonderful clean moisturized feeling and if you use the Resurgence day and night creams afterwards, you WILL notice a tremendous difference.</li>
            <li> It lathers good and rinses very well and leaves your skin feeling and looking great when you are done.</li>
            <li> The best cleanser for mature skin.</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful and natural.</li>

            <li> I love Murad.</li>
            <li> Love it, cleanses well</li>
            <li> Love all Murad products ...</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t afford to continue purchasing the entire package of products from Murad monthly, but I was so impressed by the Renewing Cleansing Cream,</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased.  </li>
            <li> I love the Murad Resurgence Products.  </li>
            <li> Love this face wash.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for several years and find it to be an excellent cleansing cream.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels softer and more supple after using.  </li>
            <li> Love this face cleanser</li>
            <li> Not as nice as they show on TV as they are filming through filters etc to make everyone look fabulous.  </li>
            <li> I love all things Murad.</li>
            <li> I love the bottle this cleansing cream comes in, I keep it in my shower and with the flip top lid</li>
            <li> but they always took more to do the job.  </li>
            <li> Not so sure it does so well.  </li>
            <li> i have used many different creams for cleansing over the years and Murad is the best!</li>
            <li> Love the creamy feel.</li>
            <li> Okay cleanser, but it does not remove make up well</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser....cannot do without it.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed this</li>
            <li> My favorite product from that line was the Renewing Cleansing Cream, but I did not want to spend $36 dollars at Murad&#x27;s website just for the cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I love using this cleanser during the winter months.  </li>
            <li> I like it, I love it</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for over a year and love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I love the products but not the company policy in auto shipment and their prices.  </li>
            <li> it makes my skin so nice and pretty!!</li>
            <li> Great super mild cleanser for women over 50.</li>
            <li> I have clear skin and just need a good cleanser!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great for older skin.  </li>
            <li> It is very gentle yet gives a good cleaning.  </li>
            <li> This one is a great deal not only money wise, but especially size wise.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I love this cleanser and the price is right!</li>
            <li> Hands down the best cleanser I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The delivery on this item was relatively quick, considering it was during hurricane Sandy!  </li>
            <li> Gentle and effective cleansing.</li>
            <li> Fabulous service too.</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin feel hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li> My skin feels fantastic, and I always get compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Imagine my delight in discovering I could get these same products individually at a greatly reduced price through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A GOOD PRODUCT.Not enough time to make a better judgment.</li>
            <li> so is good for my sensitive skin .</li>
            <li> but the results are worth it!  </li>
            <li> I can always find most anything I&#x27;m looking for on Amazon.com, and have learned to go there first in my search!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin didn&#x27;t feel clean after using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year and it leaves my face feeling so clean and nourishing.  </li>
            <li> Rinses clean.  </li>
            <li> Face feels clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> It is a nice cleansing cream for my 60+ year old skin!  </li>
            <li> I am a nurse who worked in dermatology for many years, and did not like any of the cleansers we sold as much as this one.  </li>
            <li> The sizes you get on TV are not the full sizes these are.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have to buy extra eye makeup remover, it does a good job taking that off too.  </li>
            <li> full coverage foundation: cant do w/o this production as lone as it is full coverage</li>
            <li> and it is mild</li>
            <li> I looked on Amazon and was so happy to see it here for less money.  </li>
            <li> it cleans nicely yet does not dry me out.....</li>
            <li> No only are their prices better than any place else, my order arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li> My 30 yr old daughter started using an entire line of Murad products and I noticed her skin was looking great.  </li>
            <li> I have aging yet oily skin, and this is by far my favorite cleaser.</li>
            <li> I feel it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price for the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> This cleansing cream is great for normal to dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Never dried out my skin but leave very clean feeling.</li>
            <li> It smells so clean, the consistency is so creamy and gentle, but it removes makeup like a champ.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have time to try out the many products I order, because she keeps me pretty busy ordering stuff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many cleansers expensive and or inexpensive and by far it&#x27;s the best</li>
            <li> Mild on face and cleans very well.</li>
            <li> Just because something grows in nature does not mean it is safe for all to use near their eyes and mouths.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, I found it, and also at a reasonable price!  </li>
            <li> I am 31 years old, and have pretty normal skin, a bit more oily during the summer.</li>
            <li> My face is smooth and clear with this product.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily and am pleased with the results and on line price.</li>
            <li> love the larger size and is exactly what I used when I belonged to the murad club....</li>
            <li> Thanks Murad!</li>
            <li> Check here first.</li>
            <li> It only requires a small amount (just like the instructions say) and it makes my face and neck feel so wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I love Murad Resergence, especially the  cleasing cream.  </li>
            <li> I wet my wash cloth with warm water and wash my face with it.</li>
            <li> Good product for sensitive and dry skin</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling very clean, but moisturized at the same time.</li>
            <li> My face feels completely clean but not dried out.</li>
            <li> Left my face refreshed and clean!</li>
            <li> I will definitely come back for more very soon!!</li>
            <li> It is only 2 weeks since I have been using the entire Resurgence treatment and the results are amazing.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating and does not irritate or clog pores.</li>
            <li> I would much prefer an odorless or a fragrant scent.  </li>
            <li> very pleansat scent, etc.</li>
            <li> Thanks, I will buy again.</li>
            <li> all the products that claim to be made by dermatologists and have celebrity endorsements, Murad is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I really like this cleanser.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this seller for bringing this to us.  </li>
            <li> i really want to buy the whole face care line from murad now.</li>
            <li> I have switched over from Clinique and my face is so much cleaner now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other name brand products</li>
            <li> , I finally found what was right there for years!</li>
            <li> I have tried several face cleanser in my travels and found most to be very drying and not cleansing enough.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Murad products in the past and have liked it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems with acne and thought that they would eventually go away as I got older.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product mainly because my wife told me too.  </li>
            <li> nevertheless, I highly recommend it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Smells clean and does not leave skin feeling dry.  </li>
            <li> Never a complaint from me.</li>
            <li> I am age 47 and  have normal combination</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is nice and creamy and you only need a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> HBC Depot is my new favourite company and I&#x27;ll be ordering from them for now on.  </li>
            <li> Not perfect, but it works well for sensitive skin which makes the wife happy.</li>
            <li> After using it my face felt dry &amp; tight, I&#x27;m concerned &amp; want to return this product as I don&#x27;t believe it is an authentic Murad product!</li>
            <li> Being someone who likes to change products on a pretty regular basis, this is one product I cannot do without, and I haven&#x27;t found anything comparable.</li>
            <li> This bottle will last several months, very well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> very few wrinkles since I&#x27;m a natural redhead and used sun protection since my 20&#x27;s when I learned better how to ward off aging...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a million cleansers and this is the only one that really cleans my face completely, with no makeup residue, and no dryness afterwards.  </li>
            <li> MY 67 year old skin loves this product</li>
            <li> My acne has completely clearer up and my skin looks brighter.</li>
            <li> Not heavily perfumed or scented</li>
            <li> It cleans so well, and feels so soft.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways, and it feels so good when cleansing your face...not harsh, no fragrance, and ....</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product especially to women approaching menopause.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is super silky and lathers up with just a small amount.  </li>
            <li> I will say though that some of the other Murad products did not work as promised, but the Resurgence products live up to their hype.</li>
            <li> As far as the quality, I keep trying other moisturizers, but always come back to the Dr Murad line.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it makes my face glow and feel so soft.</li>
            <li> I recently had a facial and since my skin tends to be dry, she recommended this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Murad is the answer to both the adult acne and keeping my skin hydrated and less wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This product has a strange, almost play dough like scent and hasn&#x27;t renewed a thing.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it that long, so hopefully will notice some improvement after a month in the quality of my skin.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to some other facial cleansers..</li>
            <li> I have tried other cleansers, but I always come back to this one.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> It cleans the face but it does dry the skin so you will need to use the products that follow it.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> It does not leave my skin dry which I like as well.  </li>
            <li> I started using Murad years ago but tried to cut costs by using only a few products and using cheaper products for my daily skin routine.  </li>
            <li> You only need a small amount of product so this bottle should last me a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> It lasts forever as only a little bit is needed.  </li>
            <li> All other product I have tried either dry out my face or cause whiteheads.</li>
            <li> But careful dont get it in your eyes because it stings.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and it&#x27;s non-drying.</li>
            <li> I will never look for any other skin care products because I don&#x27;t have to</li>
            <li> product gets a 5-Star Rating from me, and you only need a small dollop at each washing, so this large-size container lasts &#x27;forever&#x27;.</li>
            <li> No more flaked skin on my nose, and no more break outs because it&#x27;s not a heavy greasy product.  </li>
            <li> use this in the shower, and then apply the Resurgence sheer lustre day moisture (also a very small amount)</li>
            <li> typically I&#x27;ve purchased &amp; used this product for years but</li>
            <li> a little goes a along way, so even tho pricey</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money trying to &#x27;save&#x27; money.  </li>
            <li> I have thin, fragile, prone-to-broken-capillaries skin......</li>
            <li> Found this cleanser to be harsh.</li>
            <li> This stuff is VERY expensive  - instead, I&#x27;d suggest that you try other similar products to see how their results are: like Aveeno and Revitalize.  </li>
            <li> Murad&#x27;s cleansing cream cleans moderately well, but it has an odd smell that is unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> I am in my late 50&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the entire Murad Resurgence line in the past, but it became very expensive</li>
            <li> The prices are less expensive than on TV and through the Murad site.</li>
            <li> and I was getting sick and tired of trying different brands of products (not to mention spending money thinking I was saving money).</li>
            <li> Too expensive.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Murad.</li>
            <li> , I was a bit disappointed that it&#x27;s not more hydrating.  </li>
            <li> and maybe this was a bad batch, but this didn&#x27;t work out for me.</li>
            <li> you will not be disappointed.....</li>
            <li> I wainas very disappointed - will not order again.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Does a great job cleansing. Doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product, pricing and ship time. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Excellent choice if you want a cleansing cream that gets your face very clean with no need for a toner. The resurgence line products are fabulous!</li>
            <li> It SEEMS LIKE A GOOD PRODUCT.Not enough time to make a better judgment.</li>
            <li> I love Murad. I started using it three months ago. My skin looks great.</li>
            <li> Great facewash. I have clear skin and just need a good cleanser! Love it, cleanses well and you just use a tiny amount.</li>
            <li> wonderful cleanser- it&#x27;s expensive in London so usually better priced when I buy in the USA.  Does get makeup and grime off without drying out skin.</li>
            <li> I started using Murad years ago but tried to cut costs by using only a few products and using cheaper products for my daily skin routine.  Well, at 56 I just felt my skin wasn&#x27;t looking great and I was getting sick and tired of trying different brands of products (not to mention spending money thinking I was saving money). My 30 yr old daughter started using an entire line of Murad products and I noticed her skin was looking great.  That was when I decided to invest in the entire Resurgence line of products.  I started with the wash to day/night treatments, the mask etc.  It was a costly order but the results are worth it!  It is only 2 weeks since I have been using the entire Resurgence treatment and the results are amazing.  Even my husband noticed the difference.  Don&#x27;t waste money trying to &#x27;save&#x27; money.  I will never look for any other skin care products because I don&#x27;t have to, I finally found what was right there for years!</li>
            <li> This cleansing cream is great for normal to dry skin.  You only need a small amount of product so this bottle should last me a long time.  Smells clean and does not leave skin feeling dry.  I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> It cleans the face but it does dry the skin so you will need to use the products that follow it.</li>
            <li> Love all Murad products ... they make a great difference in my skin!</li>
            <li> the best skin cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Only use a tiny bit!  It is a nice cleansing cream for my 60+ year old skin!  Not drying either.</li>
            <li> The best cleanser for mature skin.</li>
            <li> Great Product&lt;br /&gt;My wife loves it.</li>
            <li> The product description says it&#x27;s for aging drying skin but I have oily skin and it still seems to work.  I like that it takes all of my makeup off so I don&#x27;t need to use a seperate makeup remover.  Best thing for my skin that I&#x27;ve found in a while.  I didn&#x27;t like the rest of the line but have continued to use this.</li>
            <li> I like the Murad products</li>
            <li> I have tried several face cleanser in my travels and found most to be very drying and not cleansing enough.  This one is here to stay, I love it!  Mild on face and cleans very well.</li>
            <li> I have always liked this product.  I am allergic to some other facial cleansers..and this one is not in that category.  It removes all grime without drying the skin out.</li>
            <li> Effectively rermoives oil and dirt with no acids.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is so good for the skin.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser and the price is right!</li>
            <li> MY 67 year old skin loves this product</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t afford to continue purchasing the entire package of products from Murad monthly, but I was so impressed by the Renewing Cleansing Cream, that I went looking for it on Amazon.com.  Sure enough, I found it, and also at a reasonable price!  I can always find most anything I&#x27;m looking for on Amazon.com, and have learned to go there first in my search!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product gets a 5-Star Rating from me, and you only need a small dollop at each washing, so this large-size container lasts &#x27;forever&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product for several years now.  I love the way it makes my skin feel. This product doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. Too expensive.</li>
            <li> Love it, and for a great price.I have been using it for years. It truly does whay it says it can do.</li>
            <li> I tried out this product and it didn&#x27;t work for me. My skin didn&#x27;t feel clean after using it. I&#x27;m a bigger fan of the Kiels cleanser.  I&#x27;ve used the Murad products in the past and have liked it and maybe this was a bad batch, but this didn&#x27;t work out for me.</li>
            <li> Nice cleanser. Not perfect, but it works well for sensitive skin which makes the wife happy.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best cleanser I have ever used. It smells so clean, the consistency is so creamy and gentle, but it removes makeup like a champ. I am 31 years old, and have pretty normal skin, a bit more oily during the summer. I use the entire resurgence line, and I&#x27;ve never been happier with my skin care regimen!</li>
            <li> typically I&#x27;ve purchased &amp; used this product for years but this recent shipment concerns me since it did not have a product seal on the tube when I opened it!  Then when I went to use it it didn&#x27;t smell anything like the current Murad cleaner (same product) that I&#x27;m using!  After using it my face felt dry &amp; tight, I&#x27;m concerned &amp; want to return this product as I don&#x27;t believe it is an authentic Murad product!</li>
            <li> My skin looks better than it has since I hit puberty! I went for a facial and the woman doing it yelled at me for what I was using to wash my face. I know these people are always trying to push the products but I was pampering myself so I bought the cleanser and the moisturizer with sunscreen. She said I would be amazed at the difference in just one week. Like I haven&#x27;t heard that before. My skin looks amazing. My acne has completely clearer up and my skin looks brighter. I look ten years younger. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems with acne and thought that they would eventually go away as I got older.  Not so!  Murad is the answer to both the adult acne and keeping my skin hydrated and less wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I had never ordered from HBC Depot before so, I placed an order with confidence because of their affiliation with Amazon.com.  I couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased.  No only are their prices better than any place else, my order arrived very quickly.  No hassle, no trip to the mall, no parking problems, no waiting to be waited on and I shopped at my convenience.  Now, I don&#x27;t know about you but that couldn&#x27;t have been easier.  HBC Depot is my new favourite company and I&#x27;ll be ordering from them for now on.  Not only should we complain about a company&#x27;s treatment of us but we should also praise the good ones and HBC Depot is a good one.  I can only attest to my experience.</li>
            <li> Great cleansing cream.</li>
            <li> I adore this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year and it leaves my face feeling so clean and nourishing.  It does not leave my skin dry which I like as well.  I highly recommend this product especially to women approaching menopause.</li>
            <li> This is the only face wash I will use. All other product I have tried either dry out my face or cause whiteheads. My face is smooth and clear with this product. This bottle lasts me a year!</li>
            <li> Gentle and effective cleansing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all I use.  Great feel, cleasing and fragrance</li>
            <li> Got a facial and this is the product the salon used. Left my face refreshed and clean! Amazon has the best price for this product.</li>
            <li> I have aging yet oily skin, and this is by far my favorite cleaser. Being someone who likes to change products on a pretty regular basis, this is one product I cannot do without, and I haven&#x27;t found anything comparable. It leaves my skin feeling very clean, but moisturized at the same time. I love this cleanser!</li>
            <li> I use this product daily and am pleased with the results and on line price.</li>
            <li> love the larger size and is exactly what I used when I belonged to the murad club.... great pricing also</li>
            <li> I love the Murad Resurgence Products.  They are the best in the Murad line.  They&#x27;re great for older skin.  They definitely improve the health and texture of the skin and make the skin look radiant.  I will say though that some of the other Murad products did not work as promised, but the Resurgence products live up to their hype.</li>
            <li> Love this face wash. I switched to all Murad products for my skin care and have seen a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for several years and find it to be an excellent cleansing cream.  I use it morning and night and have never had a pimple since.  It also exfoliates the skin.  Please continue selling the product!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I will continue to use this.  A little goes a long way, and it&#x27;s non-drying. I am a nurse who worked in dermatology for many years, and did not like any of the cleansers we sold as much as this one.  I feel it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> The delivery on this item was relatively quick, considering it was during hurricane Sandy!  As far as the quality, I keep trying other moisturizers, but always come back to the Dr Murad line.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This cleanser is super silky and lathers up with just a small amount.  This bottle will last several months, very well worth the price.  My skin feels softer and more supple after using.  Rinses clean.  Not heavily perfumed or scented so is good for my sensitive skin .</li>
            <li> Love this face cleanser</li>
            <li> Great super mild cleanser for women over 50. Very hydrating and does not irritate or clog pores.</li>
            <li> This product is great!  It cleanses your face with tiny jojoba beads.  Face feels clean and refreshed.  Especially good for women over 40 with hormonal changes.  I have T-zone face and it balances my skin out perfectly! Thanks Murad!</li>
            <li> I bought this, the Resurgence serum and also Resurgence night treatment, which has been in the mail for over 14 days (wont be buying from that seller again). The prices are less expensive than on TV and through the Murad site. Its an effective maintenance kit to keep your skin looking nice. Not as nice as they show on TV as they are filming through filters etc to make everyone look fabulous.  The sizes you get on TV are not the full sizes these are. Check here first. The cleanser I didnt think I&#x27;d like, but au contraire...it is great.I thought it would leave a film on my skin, but it doesnt. Its just a wonderful clean moisturized feeling and if you use the Resurgence day and night creams afterwards, you WILL notice a tremendous difference.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is a must have!  Wonderful on the face, but I have to admit I do not like the way it smells.  I would much prefer an odorless or a fragrant scent.  nevertheless, I highly recommend it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Good product for sensitive and dry skin</li>
            <li> My skin responds will to Murad products</li>
            <li> I love all things Murad. Never a complaint from me. My face feels wonderful and my skin looks great. Fabulous service too.</li>
            <li> this is the best cleanser for my post-menopausal skin! it cleans nicely yet does not dry me out.....very pleansat scent, etc. I have thin, fragile, prone-to-broken-capillaries skin......nice thing is....very few wrinkles since I&#x27;m a natural redhead and used sun protection since my 20&#x27;s when I learned better how to ward off aging...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyway, try this cleanser.....you will not be disappointed.....a little goes a along way, so even tho pricey, it is a good bargain. I also swear by Murad resurgance serum and their eye cream....Murad is a great company with superb products.</li>
            <li> I love the bottle this cleansing cream comes in, I keep it in my shower and with the flip top lid it&#x27;s so easy to use.  It only requires a small amount (just like the instructions say) and it makes my face and neck feel so wonderful.  I don&#x27;t even have to buy extra eye makeup remover, it does a good job taking that off too.  It cleans so well, and feels so soft.  I&#x27;ve tried many other name brand products but they always took more to do the job.  This bottle has lasted me about 6 months, and that makes it a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;I use this in the shower, and then apply the Resurgence sheer lustre day moisture (also a very small amount) and that&#x27;s it.  I&#x27;m now in my mid 40&#x27;s and was finding that nothing else would help my ever changing hormonal skin type.  No more flaked skin on my nose, and no more break outs because it&#x27;s not a heavy greasy product.  I will never change products again !!!</li>
            <li> Found this cleanser to be harsh. I have very dry skin. I am in my late 50&#x27;s. Skin at my age needs alot of hydration, this cleanser did not do that for me.</li>
            <li> Not so sure it does so well.  My wife and I have used it for a month, and not a lot of results seen.  This stuff is VERY expensive  - instead, I&#x27;d suggest that you try other similar products to see how their results are: like Aveeno and Revitalize.  That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re going to do once we are out of this product brand.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product again. This product has a strange, almost play dough like scent and hasn&#x27;t renewed a thing. I&#x27;m a skincare junky and this doesn&#x27;t make the grade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years.  It is very gentle yet gives a good cleaning.  It lasts forever as only a little bit is needed.  It does a GREAT job getting off my eye make up as well and never drying.  I am age 47 and  have normal combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many cleansers expensive and or inexpensive and by far it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend it.  Best price around is here on amazon.</li>
            <li> Murad&#x27;s cleansing cream cleans moderately well, but it has an odd smell that is unpleasant.  I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> Murad products perform as advertised.  Great cleansing cream.</li>
            <li> I have been using Murad products for several months now, upon recommendation by an esthetician.  I recently had a facial and since my skin tends to be dry, she recommended this cleanser.  This product makes my skin feel hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love Murad Resergence, especially the  cleasing cream.  This one is a great deal not only money wise, but especially size wise. Thanks, I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I use the cleanser, serum and moisturizer.  Great system.  My face looks brighter and is beautifully moisturized with this system.</li>
            <li> i have used many different creams for cleansing over the years and Murad is the best! no muss no fuss, i use it it the shower</li>
            <li> Good product for the money</li>
            <li> I ordered this product mainly because my wife told me too.  I have found it saves me a lot of future problems when I order the stuff she asks for.  She loves it and says it is really a great product, I trust her opinion.  I don&#x27;t have time to try out the many products I order, because she keeps me pretty busy ordering stuff.</li>
            <li> I started using Murad Resurgence Renewing Cleansing Cream 20 years ago because an esthetician told me that it removes oil from the pores before the oil hardens into blackheads and makes pores enlarge, or something like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that Murad Resurgence does clean perfectly without a hint of dryness or oiliness. Just perfect skin that needs no make-up and gets zillions of compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy the full-sized individual products, not the tiny sizes that come in the multi-packs. You only use a tiny amount for each washing, so it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all the products that claim to be made by dermatologists and have celebrity endorsements, Murad is the real deal. You won&#x27;t need an airbrushed model or movie star to get results on your own face!</li>
            <li> The Cleansing Cream is the only part of the Murad Resurgence line that does not cause me severe allergies - burning, watery, itchy eyes and wheezing.  Just because something grows in nature does not mean it is safe for all to use near their eyes and mouths. Ragweed is a botanical!</li>
            <li> The best cleansing cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Great wash! I use it twice a day. Love the creamy feel. Never dried out my skin but leave very clean feeling. Awesome</li>
            <li> The Murad Resurgence Cleansing Cream is one that I would not want to be without. A little goes a long ways, and it feels so good when cleansing your face...not harsh, no fragrance, and ....what can I say except...just great!</li>
            <li> I have tried other cleansers, but I always come back to this one.  My skin feels fantastic, and I always get compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Okay cleanser, but it does not remove make up well</li>
            <li> I like all of murad products.. I&#x27;m 62 and people always compliment me on my skin. They tell me I have beautiful skin. murad softens, moisturizes and tones my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I have been using it for years after having it at a spa day..it is the only product I use to wash my face .</li>
            <li> Love it. I wet my wash cloth with warm water and wash my face with it. But careful dont get it in your eyes because it stings. Just keep rinsing your eyes. Other than that it makes my face glow and feel so soft.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Murad.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser....cannot do without it.</li>
            <li> full coverage foundation: cant do w/o this production as lone as it is full coverage</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is nice and creamy and you only need a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this cleanser. It lathers good and rinses very well and leaves your skin feeling and looking great when you are done.</li>
            <li> Murad is great on my skin and for my skin</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT IT KEEPS YOUR SKING GLOWING AND WORKS WITH THE SUREM AND WELL. TRY ALL OF THEM FOR ANY ONE WHO IS EXPERSING ANTI AGING PROBLEMS HORMANS TRY IT YOU WILL NOTICE A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR POURS AND YOUR TESTURE IN YOUR SKING.</li>
            <li> Has really improved my skin -- no dryness problems (but not oily either) any longer, awful brown sun spot has all but disappeared, and skin quality and tone greatly improved.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the entire Murad Resurgence line in the past, but it became very expensive so I cancelled my Murad membership.  My favorite product from that line was the Renewing Cleansing Cream, but I did not want to spend $36 dollars at Murad&#x27;s website just for the cleanser.  I looked on Amazon and was so happy to see it here for less money.  The cleansing cream is very calming on the skin and has a wonderful scent.  I love using this cleanser during the winter months.  Thanks to this seller for bringing this to us.  I will definitely come back for more very soon!!</li>
            <li> I like it, I love it, I will be buying more of it! It is great!  Best eye cream ever!!!</li>
            <li> Always leaves my face clean and bright. Took this bottle with me to work overseas in Saudi Arabia. It literally lasted me 12 months, using it once a day. You only need the smallest drop...maybe a dime size. Definitely worth the price for the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> It was send to me from a third seemed like a private person.The product was NOT in  &amp;#34;NEW Unused Condition&amp;#34; and I was not comfortable using it because I don&#x27;t know if it was a genuine product - my money wasted. I wainas very disappointed - will not order again.</li>
            <li> the size for your money is great too. it makes my skin so nice and pretty!! i really want to buy the whole face care line from murad now.</li>
            <li> Not drying without being oily. Love it,the texture is great, have used for 3-4 years now, would not part with it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. My face feels completely clean but not dried out.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for over a year and love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a million cleansers and this is the only one that really cleans my face completely, with no makeup residue, and no dryness afterwards.  And while it&#x27;s not marketed as an eye maker remover, I use it for that as well (doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes at all).</li>
            <li> I ordered this product, because I had seen it advertised on tv.  Although I like it and it is mild, I was a bit disappointed that it&#x27;s not more hydrating.  I haven&#x27;t used it that long, so hopefully will notice some improvement after a month in the quality of my skin.</li>
            <li> I discovered this cleanser after ordering a kit off of a TV infomercial. I love the products but not the company policy in auto shipment and their prices.  Imagine my delight in discovering I could get these same products individually at a greatly reduced price through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product will last for months! It takes only a tiny bit to get a lot of lather worked up.  The smell is wonderful and natural. I have switched over from Clinique and my face is so much cleaner now.  I love this stuff!</li>
