            <li>but i still think they amazing  </li>
            <li>These fimo nail art canes are amazing.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t want to try and put some kind of nail art design on my nails, I just paint my nails one color and add a cut off piece to my ring finger.</li>
            <li>I did NOT get very many duplicates, and they are super cute!!</li>
            <li>These are so cute and so many!</li>
            <li>All the fimo sticks were great had fun using them.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it for the price and a great starter set for fimo.</li>
            <li>The blade the comes with the set is perfect for the job, and I have yet to find a bubble hidden inside the canes (this has happened a lot to me, lol).</li>
            <li>They are so easy to slice!</li>
            <li>and it should be fine!</li>
            <li>This is extremely easy to work with, we started doing our own nail art</li>
            <li>ma grand niece loves it</li>
            <li>We use nail glue to apply them &amp; also put glue around the edges &amp; on top.</li>
            <li>I Love my nail art manicure fimo canes sticks and rod gel tips.</li>
            <li>but I wish I did my homework better</li>
            <li>There are a number of cute designs here that I will use.</li>
            <li>I got a better deal on the WISH app.</li>
            <li>Everything is okay</li>
            <li>im so in love with them..</li>
            <li>thats okay.</li>
            <li>I just got these today and sliced the most of them.</li>
            <li>slices smoothly and nice.</li>
            <li>I received these fimo canes as a Christmas present, and I was so happy!</li>
            <li>There are so many designs to choose from in this set.  </li>
            <li>so it was more like 100</li>
            <li>Love them all..</li>
            <li>The designs are cute, what you would expect from any fimo cane set.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I can them having any flaws and I am sure my niece is going to love them.</li>
            <li>I really love the assortment of designs etc.</li>
            <li>While I can still use most of the cane, it still does say something about the quality control at the company.</li>
            <li>They work ok</li>
            <li>It does seem to work a lot better when acrylic is used with them instead of nail posh.</li>
            <li>much better deals out there.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>but I thought these were cute</li>
            <li>are some really cute designs.</li>
            <li>I love my fimo canes.</li>
            <li>but i did not :).</li>
            <li>I just love the variety u get ..</li>
            <li>and she loves the cute Chiks, frogs, Owls....</li>
            <li>one more thing.  </li>
            <li>one more thing.  </li>
            <li>Considering that these are mass produced, I think it excellent that out of the 200 rods, only one was &amp;</li>
            <li>I enjoyed using these fimo canes.</li>
            <li>This is a great product that was received in a decent amount of time.  </li>
            <li>They are super cute!</li>
            <li>Just like everyone says, these are super cute!  </li>
            <li>Just putting one slice on each ring finger is a nice way to give a manicure a special touch.</li>
            <li>Cute &amp; easy to cute.</li>
            <li>I cant lie but they are cute and easy too cut :)</li>
            <li>I found it best to use nail glue and also to wait for the nail polish to dry before applying the design.</li>
            <li>Super easy to cut and WAAAAy more for your money vs pre-cut!</li>
            <li>The trick is to lightly file over them before you put on a top coat.</li>
            <li>The sticks were shorter than anticipated but the product came early and was a great price.</li>
            <li>Doing this is way more exciting (and sometimes cheaper) than buying the pre cut fimo!</li>
            <li>But other than that there great!</li>
            <li>They are so easy to cut.</li>
            <li>It is not too easy to cut it</li>
            <li>Really easy to use.</li>
            <li>so they are easy to cut the way you want them to.</li>
            <li>Blade in box was easy to cut with.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>I ended converting the container they came in to organize them so it&#x27;d be easy to see them when I want to use them.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>we easily take these off when we leve from somewhere to Mach</li>
            <li>The colors were good, but not quite as vibrant as the MASH canes (the \\&quot;true\\&quot; MASH canes).  </li>
            <li>I liked it alot, it was my first time buying nail products and it makes me want to buy again.</li>
            <li>would give this more stars, but i can only go up to five :P</li>
            <li>but the product was perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>These are super cute.</li>
            <li>I received no duplicates and super cute designs.  </li>
            <li>A good investment whether you are a professional or someone saving money doing their nails at home!</li>
            <li>Cool very cool</li>
            <li>Fun to work with; I need to get a better tool to cut.</li>
            <li>my concerns were that they weren&#x27;t  gonna fit my nail</li>
            <li>These fimo canes are a great way to spruce up a simple manicure.</li>
            <li>The designs are cute and colorful.</li>
            <li>There is a great variety and it is really simple to cut (it comes with the razor).</li>
            <li>I love these so much!</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Wow.fast shipping and all the sticks look soo pretty and cute.  </li>
            <li>And i was SO Damn excited to get these things too....</li>
            <li>Me and my friends enjoyed this we are traveling around the world now in my privet jet(I&#x27;m rich;) )</li>
            <li>So cute, my daughter is going to love this, an early christmas gift.</li>
            <li>The canes arrived quickly and i enjoy the selection, but there was no cutter with the package when it arrived.</li>
            <li>I love having the large assortment of designs.</li>
            <li>whatever they have listed as if it&#x27;s something special is just a razor blade you can buy anywhere.  </li>
            <li>So Cool</li>
            <li>On top of that I realized that many were deformed (about another 6-12 sticks), so that I would not be able to used the stick in its entirely or partially.</li>
            <li>So in size wise you will only be getting 100 sticks</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s true</li>
            <li>Highly recommended! :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;200 mini fimos which in reality it was 100 fimos full size.</li>
            <li>We bought an exacto knife that works much easier and better.</li>
            <li>smaller than i thought they would be but still love them, so cute and and fun!</li>
            <li>many different cute choices.</li>
            <li>Plus, there are a lot of duplicates in the box if you needed more of a particular design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are very pretty</li>
            <li>It easy to use and very contemporary.</li>
            <li>they are only the 1in but still very cute.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s done all sorts of very pretty designs hasn&#x27;t yet done her nails with them</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and they are cute with so many different pictures.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>These are fun to use on your nails.</li>
            <li>Positves of this product is that there is lots of variety and anyone can have fun slicing fimo canes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no problem because my friend wanted to cut one up for fun, so it worked out</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fun to practice.&lt;br /&gt;There</li>
            <li>u get your monies worth..</li>
            <li>My personal preference is for hand painted nail art, but these are cute and really detailed.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a fun product!</li>
            <li>You can spend a few more dollars  get full fimos and get more for your money...</li>
            <li>These are very easy to use with a big assortment of designs.</li>
            <li>shipping was very fast..</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>thank you very much</li>
            <li>there may be 200 pieces, but many of the sticks start at 1/4 of an inch and only go up to about an inch in length.</li>
            <li>Also use a top coat for longer lasting.</li>
            <li>Would like to see more fruit and flowers next time.</li>
            <li>Really neat!</li>
            <li>At first i doubted them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m doing my acrylics tomorrow and putting a cute blue flower!</li>
            <li>more different options or more of the same.</li>
            <li>There are so many different designs!</li>
            <li>More than enough designs.</li>
            <li>when i submitted my order it was the FIRST thing I&#x27;ve bought for myself in years...</li>
            <li>It is exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I advise practicing slicing with a pattern you don&#x27;t like first.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered these rods - I always get them pre-cut.</li>
            <li>It is a much better deal than buying them pre-cut and it is the same item.</li>
            <li>I do think that there are too many sticks with the same image.</li>
            <li>However, I still love these charms and it&#x27;s not so big of a problem that I would not buy from them again,</li>
            <li>I recommend this for first time nail artists.</li>
            <li>but i did get some cute stuff, including lots of different flowers, which is what i wanted.  </li>
            <li>cute enough</li>
            <li>but she&#x27;s enjoying putting them on different things.</li>
            <li>So many different designs</li>
            <li>she really likes that part!</li>
            <li>Its my first time playing with fimo canes.</li>
            <li>As a total beginner with Fimo (Fi-who?), I consider this to be more of a sampler than anything else</li>
            <li>They are rather inexpensive and I&#x27;d recommend getting one to anyone and everyone because not only is it safer since most come with a cap over the blade, it&#x27;ll give you something to hold onto and help prevent your fingers from accidentally slipping.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It comes with so many that I still have some left over.</li>
            <li>I cut them with an exact o</li>
            <li>I love these, and had so much fun slicing then even though there are so many and it took two days, my finger is still numb: )</li>
            <li>I used the small cutter blade, worked great for me, it was not hard to cut the canes with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was soooo excited to get these fimo sticks and canes in the mail I immediately open the package to find all sorts of fun sticks to play with..</li>
            <li>Would like more unique designs as opposed to different designs in different colors.</li>
            <li>They stay on very well that way.</li>
            <li>I Do Thank You so much .</li>
            <li>The really should say razor blade.</li>
            <li>Shipping was really fast tho.</li>
            <li>so be careful.  :-)</li>
            <li>Overall, this was a fabulous product</li>
            <li>There are several repeats but there is still a fantastic variety.</li>
            <li>These things are literally so tiny in circumference that i can fit 2 designs on my 5yo&#x27;s nail without a problem.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>but they weren&#x27;t as much as in the photo</li>
            <li>haha..</li>
            <li>really recommend this fimo cane set.</li>
            <li>it wouldn&#x27;t bug me so much.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>But i loved the designs and you get at least 75 slices from one cane.</li>
            <li>However it&#x27;s easy enough to cut and use with steady hands.</li>
            <li>I did see a few I liked</li>
            <li>Other than that its cute.</li>
            <li>More than what I expected!</li>
            <li>I was so beyond excited for these to arrive, i even paid extra for faster delivery!</li>
            <li>Really recommend, although price is high.</li>
            <li>About 3 canes had defects, and one cane was shorter than the rest for some reason, but that was ok because there is such a big variety that I didn&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you have the blade straight and cut a little piece off.</li>
            <li>I had not realized that they were half the size (1\\&quot;) as most fimo sticks/brands.</li>
            <li>but they are half the length of most sticks.</li>
            <li>instead of buying a bundle, buy a small wheel from a beauty supply store first to give them a try then splurge for a bundle if you truly love them.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend blade holders that are made entirely of metal simply because most of them do not lock the blade in place while in use unless specifically mentioned.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend blade holders that are made entirely of metal simply because most of them do not lock the blade in place while in use unless specifically mentioned.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the fimo sticks, they are so little</li>
            <li>And i had assumed that since these ones were priced higher than all the other distributors that they would be the same diameter, just a shorter length and more designs</li>
            <li>Be careful though when opening the package, the razor blade (the free cutter) has no covering.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my teenage niece, who loves to do fun things with her nails.  </li>
            <li>personally say its worth it.</li>
            <li>They have great designs (though a few are rather odd and probably won&#x27;t be used).</li>
            <li>So, with that disclaimer I&#x27;ll say this:  To be perfectly honest, I do think it is a little irresponsible to have an open razor blade somewhere inside the box.  </li>
            <li>I will keep trying and buying new Shany Products.</li>
            <li>These are great for the price, 4/5 simply because there are quite a few duplicates and because some of them are very strange, though I may just use them anyway</li>
            <li>I love these little things!</li>
            <li>I receveid my order very early .</li>
            <li>and it like they took a full size cut it in half and then put them in one bundle if you want a whole bunch of diffrent ones in a pack look some ware else</li>
            <li>You have to carefully slice the tiny rods to custom fit your nails - way too much work for me</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t always use the blade to cut exactly the same sizes pieces.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>They are all so cute but really small</li>
            <li>Cute but becareful when you open the box because the blade is not wrapped nor does it have something covering the sharp end.</li>
            <li>To me they aren&#x27;t good enough for the serious type of nail artists.</li>
            <li>I like most of the canes, there are very few designs that i did not like in this set.</li>
            <li>would have like it more if it came with a tubing to guide it for easy cutting</li>
            <li>Easy to cut and comes with a cutter that is just a plain razor blade.  </li>
            <li>but the only thing is it came very lateee.</li>
            <li>and this set makes professional results even for me with no training</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the detail of these canes.  </li>
            <li>Maybe on my 12 year old cousin.</li>
            <li>but at least the ones that were are cute designs.</li>
            <li>and i got enough different stuff that it was worth it.</li>
            <li>There are 200 of these 1\\&quot; canes, so it&#x27;s the same amount of product as other sets that have 100 of the 2\\&quot; canes, which is fine, since the price is comparable.</li>
            <li>typical advertising to make something that isn&#x27;t seem special.  </li>
            <li>Each rod is a little more than one inch long.</li>
            <li>They are very small and cute.</li>
            <li>sticks were shorter than I expected but this is my first time using them</li>
            <li>that the free blade is loose, so be careful when opening.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>i was expecting the package to be a little bigger, but it was worth it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, to agree with pretty much everyone here, you really do need to be careful due to the uncovered, unwrapped  razor blade loose in the box.  </li>
            <li>I was a little concerned that I would be able to cut the sticks thin enough and was so excited that this item had a cutter.</li>
            <li>These little fimo sticks are so fun to use and to look at on your nails.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not endorsing these sellers or specific products, just giving an example of what I&#x27;m talking about:  with these, to safely store the blade, you slide it out and turn the blade upside down so that the sharp edge is inside and covered:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>that just completely ruined my online purchasing for the future....        </li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t add a photo after the review is posted apparently, either that</li>
            <li>I expected these rods to be much longer from the pictures.</li>
            <li>just a bare blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i love to cut them thin .</li>
            <li>But if you like fun, cool &amp; whimsical designs, these are for you.</li>
            <li>I keep wanting to take off the ones that I currently have on my fingernails and try some new ones for a different look.</li>
            <li>in reality you r only getting about 100 worth because they r cut in half.</li>
            <li>Although, there were a few bad sticks it was still a great find/ buy!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to have another way to decorate my nails that isn&#x27;t difficult or messy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read some reviews complaining about eh size of these fimo canes, but in the product description it does say the canes are an inch long so you shoudn&#x27;t be surprised.</li>
            <li>she is too young, she has other plans as she is only 9 years old</li>
            <li>They are easy to cut thin.</li>
            <li>They had small chunks missing out of the top.</li>
            <li>Although this set had the most variety (200 canes, only three duplicates), the size of the canes were a little too small for my taste.</li>

            <li> These are so cute and so many!</li>
            <li> All the fimo sticks were great had fun using them.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it for the price and a great starter set for fimo.</li>
            <li> The blade the comes with the set is perfect for the job, and I have yet to find a bubble hidden inside the canes (this has happened a lot to me, lol).</li>
            <li> They are so easy to slice!</li>
            <li> and it should be fine!</li>
            <li> This is extremely easy to work with, we started doing our own nail art</li>
            <li> ma grand niece loves it</li>
            <li> We use nail glue to apply them &amp; also put glue around the edges &amp; on top.</li>
            <li> I Love my nail art manicure fimo canes sticks and rod gel tips.</li>
            <li> but I wish I did my homework better</li>
            <li> There are a number of cute designs here that I will use.</li>
            <li> I got a better deal on the WISH app.</li>
            <li> Everything is okay</li>
            <li> im so in love with them..</li>
            <li> thats okay.</li>
            <li> I just got these today and sliced the most of them.</li>
            <li> slices smoothly and nice.</li>
            <li> I received these fimo canes as a Christmas present, and I was so happy!</li>
            <li> There are so many designs to choose from in this set.  </li>
            <li> so it was more like 100</li>
            <li> Love them all..</li>
            <li> The designs are cute, what you would expect from any fimo cane set.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I can them having any flaws and I am sure my niece is going to love them.</li>
            <li> I really love the assortment of designs etc.</li>
            <li> While I can still use most of the cane, it still does say something about the quality control at the company.</li>
            <li> They work ok</li>
            <li> It does seem to work a lot better when acrylic is used with them instead of nail posh.</li>
            <li> much better deals out there.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> but I thought these were cute</li>
            <li> are some really cute designs.</li>
            <li> I love my fimo canes.</li>
            <li> but i did not :).</li>
            <li> I just love the variety u get ..</li>
            <li> and she loves the cute Chiks, frogs, Owls....</li>
            <li> one more thing.  </li>
            <li> one more thing.  </li>
            <li> Considering that these are mass produced, I think it excellent that out of the 200 rods, only one was &amp;</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using these fimo canes.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that was received in a decent amount of time.  </li>
            <li> They are super cute!</li>
            <li> Just like everyone says, these are super cute!  </li>
            <li> Just putting one slice on each ring finger is a nice way to give a manicure a special touch.</li>
            <li> Cute &amp; easy to cute.</li>
            <li> I cant lie but they are cute and easy too cut :)</li>
            <li> I found it best to use nail glue and also to wait for the nail polish to dry before applying the design.</li>
            <li> Super easy to cut and WAAAAy more for your money vs pre-cut!</li>
            <li> The trick is to lightly file over them before you put on a top coat.</li>
            <li> The sticks were shorter than anticipated but the product came early and was a great price.</li>
            <li> Doing this is way more exciting (and sometimes cheaper) than buying the pre cut fimo!</li>
            <li> But other than that there great!</li>
            <li> They are so easy to cut.</li>
            <li> It is not too easy to cut it</li>
            <li> Really easy to use.</li>
            <li> so they are easy to cut the way you want them to.</li>
            <li> Blade in box was easy to cut with.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> I ended converting the container they came in to organize them so it&#x27;d be easy to see them when I want to use them.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> we easily take these off when we leve from somewhere to Mach</li>
            <li> The colors were good, but not quite as vibrant as the MASH canes (the \\&quot;true\\&quot; MASH canes).  </li>
            <li> I liked it alot, it was my first time buying nail products and it makes me want to buy again.</li>
            <li> would give this more stars, but i can only go up to five :P</li>
            <li> but the product was perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> These are super cute.</li>
            <li> I received no duplicates and super cute designs.  </li>
            <li> A good investment whether you are a professional or someone saving money doing their nails at home!</li>
            <li> Cool very cool</li>
            <li> Fun to work with; I need to get a better tool to cut.</li>
            <li> my concerns were that they weren&#x27;t  gonna fit my nail</li>
            <li> These fimo canes are a great way to spruce up a simple manicure.</li>
            <li> The designs are cute and colorful.</li>
            <li> There is a great variety and it is really simple to cut (it comes with the razor).</li>
            <li> I love these so much!</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Wow.fast shipping and all the sticks look soo pretty and cute.  </li>
            <li> And i was SO Damn excited to get these things too....</li>
            <li> Me and my friends enjoyed this we are traveling around the world now in my privet jet(I&#x27;m rich;) )</li>
            <li> So cute, my daughter is going to love this, an early christmas gift.</li>
            <li> The canes arrived quickly and i enjoy the selection, but there was no cutter with the package when it arrived.</li>
            <li> I love having the large assortment of designs.</li>
            <li> whatever they have listed as if it&#x27;s something special is just a razor blade you can buy anywhere.  </li>
            <li> So Cool</li>
            <li> On top of that I realized that many were deformed (about another 6-12 sticks), so that I would not be able to used the stick in its entirely or partially.</li>
            <li> So in size wise you will only be getting 100 sticks</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s true</li>
            <li> Highly recommended! :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;200 mini fimos which in reality it was 100 fimos full size.</li>
            <li> We bought an exacto knife that works much easier and better.</li>
            <li> smaller than i thought they would be but still love them, so cute and and fun!</li>
            <li> many different cute choices.</li>
            <li> Plus, there are a lot of duplicates in the box if you needed more of a particular design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are very pretty</li>
            <li> It easy to use and very contemporary.</li>
            <li> they are only the 1in but still very cute.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s done all sorts of very pretty designs hasn&#x27;t yet done her nails with them</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and they are cute with so many different pictures.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> These are fun to use on your nails.</li>
            <li> Positves of this product is that there is lots of variety and anyone can have fun slicing fimo canes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no problem because my friend wanted to cut one up for fun, so it worked out</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s fun to practice.&lt;br /&gt;There</li>
            <li> u get your monies worth..</li>
            <li> My personal preference is for hand painted nail art, but these are cute and really detailed.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a fun product!</li>
            <li> You can spend a few more dollars  get full fimos and get more for your money...</li>
            <li> These are very easy to use with a big assortment of designs.</li>
            <li> shipping was very fast..</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> thank you very much</li>
            <li> there may be 200 pieces, but many of the sticks start at 1/4 of an inch and only go up to about an inch in length.</li>
            <li> Also use a top coat for longer lasting.</li>
            <li> Would like to see more fruit and flowers next time.</li>
            <li> Really neat!</li>
            <li> At first i doubted them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m doing my acrylics tomorrow and putting a cute blue flower!</li>
            <li> more different options or more of the same.</li>
            <li> There are so many different designs!</li>
            <li> More than enough designs.</li>
            <li> when i submitted my order it was the FIRST thing I&#x27;ve bought for myself in years...</li>
            <li> It is exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I advise practicing slicing with a pattern you don&#x27;t like first.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered these rods - I always get them pre-cut.</li>
            <li> It is a much better deal than buying them pre-cut and it is the same item.</li>
            <li> I do think that there are too many sticks with the same image.</li>
            <li> However, I still love these charms and it&#x27;s not so big of a problem that I would not buy from them again,</li>
            <li> I recommend this for first time nail artists.</li>
            <li> but i did get some cute stuff, including lots of different flowers, which is what i wanted.  </li>
            <li> cute enough</li>
            <li> but she&#x27;s enjoying putting them on different things.</li>
            <li> So many different designs</li>
            <li> she really likes that part!</li>
            <li> Its my first time playing with fimo canes.</li>
            <li> As a total beginner with Fimo (Fi-who?), I consider this to be more of a sampler than anything else</li>
            <li> They are rather inexpensive and I&#x27;d recommend getting one to anyone and everyone because not only is it safer since most come with a cap over the blade, it&#x27;ll give you something to hold onto and help prevent your fingers from accidentally slipping.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It comes with so many that I still have some left over.</li>
            <li> I cut them with an exact o</li>
            <li> I love these, and had so much fun slicing then even though there are so many and it took two days, my finger is still numb: )</li>
            <li> I used the small cutter blade, worked great for me, it was not hard to cut the canes with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was soooo excited to get these fimo sticks and canes in the mail I immediately open the package to find all sorts of fun sticks to play with..</li>
            <li> Would like more unique designs as opposed to different designs in different colors.</li>
            <li> They stay on very well that way.</li>
            <li> I Do Thank You so much .</li>
            <li> The really should say razor blade.</li>
            <li> Shipping was really fast tho.</li>
            <li> so be careful.  :-)</li>
            <li> Overall, this was a fabulous product</li>
            <li> There are several repeats but there is still a fantastic variety.</li>
            <li> These things are literally so tiny in circumference that i can fit 2 designs on my 5yo&#x27;s nail without a problem.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> but they weren&#x27;t as much as in the photo</li>
            <li> haha..</li>
            <li> really recommend this fimo cane set.</li>
            <li> it wouldn&#x27;t bug me so much.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> But i loved the designs and you get at least 75 slices from one cane.</li>
            <li> However it&#x27;s easy enough to cut and use with steady hands.</li>
            <li> I did see a few I liked</li>
            <li> Other than that its cute.</li>
            <li> More than what I expected!</li>
            <li> I was so beyond excited for these to arrive, i even paid extra for faster delivery!</li>
            <li> Really recommend, although price is high.</li>
            <li> About 3 canes had defects, and one cane was shorter than the rest for some reason, but that was ok because there is such a big variety that I didn&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you have the blade straight and cut a little piece off.</li>
            <li> I had not realized that they were half the size (1\\&quot;) as most fimo sticks/brands.</li>
            <li> but they are half the length of most sticks.</li>
            <li> instead of buying a bundle, buy a small wheel from a beauty supply store first to give them a try then splurge for a bundle if you truly love them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend blade holders that are made entirely of metal simply because most of them do not lock the blade in place while in use unless specifically mentioned.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend blade holders that are made entirely of metal simply because most of them do not lock the blade in place while in use unless specifically mentioned.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the fimo sticks, they are so little</li>
            <li> And i had assumed that since these ones were priced higher than all the other distributors that they would be the same diameter, just a shorter length and more designs</li>
            <li> Be careful though when opening the package, the razor blade (the free cutter) has no covering.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my teenage niece, who loves to do fun things with her nails.  </li>
            <li> personally say its worth it.</li>
            <li> They have great designs (though a few are rather odd and probably won&#x27;t be used).</li>
            <li> So, with that disclaimer I&#x27;ll say this:  To be perfectly honest, I do think it is a little irresponsible to have an open razor blade somewhere inside the box.  </li>
            <li> I will keep trying and buying new Shany Products.</li>
            <li> These are great for the price, 4/5 simply because there are quite a few duplicates and because some of them are very strange, though I may just use them anyway</li>
            <li> I love these little things!</li>
            <li> I receveid my order very early .</li>
            <li> and it like they took a full size cut it in half and then put them in one bundle if you want a whole bunch of diffrent ones in a pack look some ware else</li>
            <li> You have to carefully slice the tiny rods to custom fit your nails - way too much work for me</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t always use the blade to cut exactly the same sizes pieces.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> They are all so cute but really small</li>
            <li> Cute but becareful when you open the box because the blade is not wrapped nor does it have something covering the sharp end.</li>
            <li> To me they aren&#x27;t good enough for the serious type of nail artists.</li>
            <li> I like most of the canes, there are very few designs that i did not like in this set.</li>
            <li> would have like it more if it came with a tubing to guide it for easy cutting</li>
            <li> Easy to cut and comes with a cutter that is just a plain razor blade.  </li>
            <li> but the only thing is it came very lateee.</li>
            <li> and this set makes professional results even for me with no training</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the detail of these canes.  </li>
            <li> Maybe on my 12 year old cousin.</li>
            <li> but at least the ones that were are cute designs.</li>
            <li> and i got enough different stuff that it was worth it.</li>
            <li> There are 200 of these 1\\&quot; canes, so it&#x27;s the same amount of product as other sets that have 100 of the 2\\&quot; canes, which is fine, since the price is comparable.</li>
            <li> typical advertising to make something that isn&#x27;t seem special.  </li>
            <li> Each rod is a little more than one inch long.</li>
            <li> They are very small and cute.</li>
            <li> sticks were shorter than I expected but this is my first time using them</li>
            <li> that the free blade is loose, so be careful when opening.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> i was expecting the package to be a little bigger, but it was worth it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, to agree with pretty much everyone here, you really do need to be careful due to the uncovered, unwrapped  razor blade loose in the box.  </li>
            <li> I was a little concerned that I would be able to cut the sticks thin enough and was so excited that this item had a cutter.</li>
            <li> These little fimo sticks are so fun to use and to look at on your nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not endorsing these sellers or specific products, just giving an example of what I&#x27;m talking about:  with these, to safely store the blade, you slide it out and turn the blade upside down so that the sharp edge is inside and covered:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that just completely ruined my online purchasing for the future....        </li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t add a photo after the review is posted apparently, either that</li>
            <li> I expected these rods to be much longer from the pictures.</li>
            <li> just a bare blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i love to cut them thin .</li>
            <li> But if you like fun, cool &amp; whimsical designs, these are for you.</li>
            <li> I keep wanting to take off the ones that I currently have on my fingernails and try some new ones for a different look.</li>
            <li> in reality you r only getting about 100 worth because they r cut in half.</li>
            <li> Although, there were a few bad sticks it was still a great find/ buy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to have another way to decorate my nails that isn&#x27;t difficult or messy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some reviews complaining about eh size of these fimo canes, but in the product description it does say the canes are an inch long so you shoudn&#x27;t be surprised.</li>
            <li> she is too young, she has other plans as she is only 9 years old</li>
            <li> They are easy to cut thin.</li>
            <li> They had small chunks missing out of the top.</li>
            <li> Although this set had the most variety (200 canes, only three duplicates), the size of the canes were a little too small for my taste.</li>
            <li> i love how they are really small, and how small the package is!</li>
            <li> It seemed to be laid out funny which made it hard to determine what it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing is when people order these they need to notice that it says 1 inch long rods</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t stick up cuz they wont lay flat if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Looks nice, but it is very complicated cut it and stick on your nails</li>
            <li> I was a little surprised at their size</li>
            <li> I  believe there were 4 out of the 200 that i have found with small chunks missing, usually out of the top.</li>
            <li> these are small 1 inch fimo canes not the 2 inch ones I normally buy</li>
            <li> It took me several tries to figure out how to get them to stick, but eventually it all worked out.</li>
            <li> Just be careful when you open the box they come in!</li>
            <li> long.  </li>
            <li> My only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; which isn&#x27;t even really a complaint is that I got one duplicate of a cane (it was white with black polkadots and had a hot pink trim around the edge...</li>
            <li> Pllus the included blade is scary and very sharp and does not appear to be safe.</li>
            <li> These canes did have Hello Kitty and all the Angry Birds in the set and many designs that I did not get in the previous two sets.</li>
            <li> The title that says 200pcs can be misleading if you don&#x27;t read the product description and if you&#x27;re expecting double the amount as what you get in other cane sets.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a tool I keep in my toolbox which I think makes cutting these SO much easier as well as much safer in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> very short like around and inch long...very misleading...and not worth the $.</li>
            <li> The ONLY thing I was slightly taken off guard by wad that the cutter that comes with it is just a razor blade that is loose in the box.</li>
            <li> they cut easy and u get an out 100 slices per stick.the cutting blade that comes with</li>
            <li> i got about 6 that were just tiny pieces less than 1/4&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> they are tiny like an inch and half.</li>
            <li> It does come with a single razor blade to cut with so be careful.</li>
            <li> i hope that next time i order something from this that it would be a little longer in length.</li>
            <li> However, several arrived cracked, shrunken, missing pieces or deformed.</li>
            <li> Though if you get it be careful because the blade does not have a covering</li>
            <li> : The blade comes in the bag with the canes so be careful when you pull them out of the bag so that you don&#x27;t cut your hand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really a nail person</li>
            <li> The designs are as i expected.</li>
            <li> The product is exactly as we expected.</li>
            <li> Few the same.</li>
            <li> I shared a few of them with the women in my family and still had enough to spare.</li>
            <li> The razor is loose in box, but I was careful after reading other reviews.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didnt like was the size of the sticks they were half the size of ones I had gotten somewhere else !</li>
            <li> Something that made me have to give this product 4 stars was one of the canes i got was not even half an inch long .</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re about an inch or less long each.</li>
            <li> I will give these 4 stars because they were not as i expected, too small and some came melted or smaller than the rest .</li>
            <li> The only thing that keeps it from being a 5 star rating is the fact that a few on the canes were slightly damaged.</li>
            <li> Threw away 5 designs I did not care for, other than that</li>
            <li> These were not up to pare with what I have come to expect from Shany as well as other Fimo brands.</li>
            <li> Variety, variety cut any size, make one size big, small, slanted.</li>
            <li> The reason i chose this set, instead of other sets, is because i like the animal designs in this one.</li>
            <li> i bought a small wheel and found that they are simply not my style of doing nail art.</li>
            <li> .. note that the blade is very sharp, be careful when opening the box..</li>
            <li> it was not worth the price at all.</li>
            <li> lower it down</li>
            <li> Oh how I wish there were a fimo cutting guide, but with practice most of my cuts were paper thin.</li>
            <li> the fimo i half size</li>
            <li> I will Post images of The box in comparision to my hand, what it looked like when opened and the half inch mishap.</li>
            <li> Even not considering that about half a dozen of my sticks are about a 1/4 or 1/2 an inch.</li>
            <li> I like the Angry Birds ones in particular.</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointing.</li>
            <li> Not really cool</li>
            <li> They come in a little box with a blade</li>
            <li> The package was a little banged up</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another little disclaimer here...</li>
            <li> These were tiny and very hard to work with.  </li>
            <li> it had only a very few duplicates, and just a couple were really weird Japanese designs.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t dump the box into your lap then reach down and grab a handful!  </li>
            <li> Shipping was faster than indicated, but still took a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I only had one problem the blade was broken when I openend it up.</li>
            <li> and I have few complaints.</li>
            <li> I will have to force myself to use them to feel I haven&#x27;t wasted my money.</li>
            <li> sometimes it takes a few try&#x27;s to get them to stick</li>
            <li> There were a few duplicates</li>
            <li> The blade is very sharp!</li>
            <li> I have ordered Fimo in the past, including other Shany Fimo&#x27;s (usually the 100pc bundles).</li>
            <li> there a little small the size of a toothpick</li>
            <li> I got a frog, little fruits, hello kitty, keroppi, and choco cat!</li>
            <li> Other than those two disappointments this product is priced expensively in comparision to other fimo canes.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this product they were too small and anything of what I would think it would be when it showed up</li>
            <li> Not sure what it&#x27;s supposed to be).</li>
            <li> It said 200 fimo slices but the slices where small</li>
            <li> Overall, I don&#x27;t thing ill ever use them all.</li>
            <li> but I realized that even one small 1&amp;#34; stick can do LOTS of nails.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t hard to cut them into slices.</li>
            <li> Even a little, what looks like, hamtaro!!</li>
            <li> This looks dangerous and probably should be bought and used by pros only - I thought it was a ball with the pieces stuck on that you could pull off and use as needed</li>
            <li> They come in tiny 1 inch sticks in a box with a razor blade for cutting.</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how small each \\&quot;rod\\&quot; is, but I guess I should have expected that since they go on your nails.</li>
            <li> 1 was broken, and i think 2 were used..</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know what to do with the broken and messed up ones</li>
            <li> but you have to cut them really thin</li>
            <li> Yes the blade is in there randomly</li>
            <li> sad.</li>
            <li> There were angry birds, hello kitty, hearts, stars, peace signs, a playboy bunny, lots of flowers and foods.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s see how I go on cutting.</li>
            <li> Had a blast cutting them up.</li>
            <li> , I had a blast cutting them up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try to upload a pic or two of the diameter so that nobody else gets the disappointment i just did.</li>
            <li> You might end up cutting yourself.</li>
            <li> As soon as you get the hang of cutting them they work well.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I was extremely disappointed and will never order this again.</li>
            <li> Thats false advertisement!!</li>
            <li> I hate that.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Pretty disappointing. These sticks are very short...yeah there may be 200 pieces, but many of the sticks start at 1/4 of an inch and only go up to about an inch in length. There are also a number of them in the box that are so deformed that they are not usable.</li>
            <li> Very happy, tons of designs. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> ma grand niece loves it she is very creative and will not use for nails.. she is too young, she has other plans as she is only 9 years old</li>
            <li> My daughters and I love these! They are so easy to cut. We use nail glue to apply them &amp; also put glue around the edges &amp; on top. They stay on very well that way.All the designs are very cute. I would definitely puchase again.</li>
            <li> I love these so much! The only thing though. is that they are a lot smaller than I thought they would be!</li>
            <li> This looks dangerous and probably should be bought and used by pros only - I thought it was a ball with the pieces stuck on that you could pull off and use as needed - it&#x27;s not. You have to carefully slice the tiny rods to custom fit your nails - way too much work for me - rather go to the salon or buy the glue on decals myself.Pllus the included blade is scary and very sharp and does not appear to be safe. Meh.</li>
            <li> daughter having a blast with these!!!</li>
            <li> Fun to work with; I need to get a better tool to cut. I can&#x27;t always use the blade to cut exactly the same sizes pieces.</li>
            <li> These Fimo Canes are perfect for my project! I plan on ordering a lot more , great designs , not too many repeats, just a really good product!</li>
            <li> these are amazing my concerns were that they weren&#x27;t  gonna fit my nail but the tiny enough for every one all ages i use them when i want a design that looks complected but i dont feel like doing it.they came 2 weeks before the earliest date</li>
            <li> I Love my nail art manicure fimo canes sticks and rod gel tips. There so awesome to wear on fingernails and your toenails very easy to cut them i love to cut them thin . I receveid my order very early . I Do Thank You so much .</li>
            <li> I love the variety of the shapes! It is not too easy to cut it but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> I love these, and had so much fun slicing then even though there are so many and it took two days, my finger is still numb: ) it had only a very few duplicates, and just a couple were really weird Japanese designs.</li>
            <li> I received mine 2 days ago and some were smaller then the rest, some were not properly made, and some were repeats. The shipping was fast and they are cute with so many different pictures. I found it best to use nail glue and also to wait for the nail polish to dry before applying the design. Also use a top coat for longer lasting. They are great but I would have liked to have received all of them in good conditions.</li>
            <li> Cute &amp; easy to cute. To me they aren&#x27;t good enough for the serious type of nail artists. But if you like fun, cool &amp; whimsical designs, these are for you.</li>
            <li> They are very pretty but I wish I did my homework better these are small 1 inch fimo canes not the 2 inch ones I normally buy</li>
            <li> There are a number of cute designs here that I will use. However, several arrived cracked, shrunken, missing pieces or deformed. Since they were a bargain I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I will give these 4 stars because they were not as i expected, too small and some came melted or smaller than the rest . I cant lie but they are cute and easy too cut :) and they also arrived on time.</li>
            <li> These were tiny and very hard to work with.  I bought it for my teenage niece, who loves to do fun things with her nails.  I would not buy them again.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time Prime service is awsome. great quality. I will keep trying and buying new Shany Products. Products are very easy to use and work perfectly for nail art.</li>
            <li> on time and just as expected…..very happy with the order and the quality of the product…would happily order this again</li>
            <li> Judy received my order. I was a little concerned that I would be able to cut the sticks thin enough and was so excited that this item had a cutter. The really should say razor blade. Let&#x27;s see how I go on cutting. Other than that its cute.</li>
            <li> awesome! many different cute choices. There were only like 10 out of the 200 that i didn&#x27;t like. So Cool</li>
            <li> Great variety! The razor is loose in box, but I was careful after reading other reviews.</li>
            <li> Canes are tiny for price. I got a better deal on the WISH app. I found 100 pcs (that are twice the size of SHANY&#x27;s) for $6.00.  Lesson learned. Shipping was really fast tho.</li>
            <li> Lot&#x27;s of different designs and shapes, one of the Hello Kitty&#x27;s had a defect in the face, not too noticeable. Would like more unique designs as opposed to different designs in different colors. Shipping was faster than indicated, but still took a few weeks. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Had a blast cutting them up. Counted them, had 204 pieces. Threw away 5 designs I did not care for, other than that, I had a blast cutting them up. Oh how I wish there were a fimo cutting guide, but with practice most of my cuts were paper thin. We loved them. Would like to see more fruit and flowers next time.</li>
            <li> These are very easy to use with a big assortment of designs. They come in tiny 1 inch sticks in a box with a razor blade for cutting.</li>
            <li> Everything is okay but the only thing is it came very lateee. I hate that.</li>
            <li> These are super cute. I use them for my polymer clay. The only thing is when people order these they need to notice that it says 1 inch long rods so they complain</li>
            <li> the fimo i half size and it like they took a full size cut it in half and then put them in one bundle if you want a whole bunch of diffrent ones in a pack look some ware else</li>
            <li> shipping was very fast..im so in love with them..very cute and easy to do!!!</li>
            <li> These are fun to use on your nails. It took me several tries to figure out how to get them to stick, but eventually it all worked out. The trick is to lightly file over them before you put on a top coat.</li>
            <li> This is extremely easy to work with, we started doing our own nail art and this set makes professional results even for me with no training I just watched videos online</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some reviews complaining about eh size of these fimo canes, but in the product description it does say the canes are an inch long so you shoudn&#x27;t be surprised. When opening this product there is no organization its just a box of canes, not plastic or anything. Yes the blade is in there randomly but it is covered by a cardboard sheet. You wouldnt hurt yourself if you didn&#x27;t open the package so recklessly. I did not get all the images shown in the products pictures, i got some different ones but thats okay. I did get one pair of duplicates in this item. Something that made me have to give this product 4 stars was one of the canes i got was not even half an inch long . It was my strawberry fruit Fimo cane. sad. Other than those two disappointments this product is priced expensively in comparision to other fimo canes. Positves of this product is that there is lots of variety and anyone can have fun slicing fimo canes. Doing this is way more exciting (and sometimes cheaper) than buying the pre cut fimo! I will Post images of The box in comparision to my hand, what it looked like when opened and the half inch mishap.</li>
            <li> Wow! You get a lot of designs for the price. Really neat!</li>
            <li> All the fimo sticks were great had fun using them. I only had one problem the blade was broken when I openend it up. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT WAS PERFECT AND EVEN CAME WITH A BLADE! It cme a couple days after ordered and lasts for ever1</li>
            <li> Hey! I just got these today and sliced the most of them. At first i doubted them. THEN I sliced one and loved them! You get a lot. 1 was broken, and i think 2 were used.. But other than that there great! I&#x27;m doing my acrylics tomorrow and putting a cute blue flower! The blade is very sharp! slices smoothly and nice. Really recommend, although price is high. lower it down and it should be fine! But i loved the designs and you get at least 75 slices from one cane. or 100 if your good at slicing.  I put them in stack-able containers. And love them! you should consider! there a little small the size of a toothpick but there cute! buy!!! there amazing</li>
            <li> I have ordered Fimo in the past, including other Shany Fimo&#x27;s (usually the 100pc bundles). These were not up to pare with what I have come to expect from Shany as well as other Fimo brands. I had not realized that they were half the size (1\\&quot;) as most fimo sticks/brands. Even not considering that about half a dozen of my sticks are about a 1/4 or 1/2 an inch. On top of that I realized that many were deformed (about another 6-12 sticks), so that I would not be able to used the stick in its entirely or partially. Some you cannot even make out what the image is suppose to be. Needless to say I was extremely disappointed and will never order this again.</li>
            <li> I like them there were tons of different designs in the box!  The only thing I didnt like was the size of the sticks they were half the size of ones I had gotten somewhere else !</li>
            <li> These are so cute and so many! They come in a little box with a blade so you an cut them.&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy I ordered them I used them already and look so cute!</li>
            <li> So cute, my daughter is going to love this, an early christmas gift.</li>
            <li> Wow.fast shipping and all the sticks look soo pretty and cute.  Hope to use it soon.</li>
            <li> I love the fimo sticks, they are so little and they just fit perfect on nails. Awesome for customizing cell phones covers, project and awesome for girls!!</li>
            <li> When I purchased this product they were too small and anything of what I would think it would be when it showed up and I want my money back</li>
            <li> Yes there are 200 different designs but they are half the length of most sticks. So in size wise you will only be getting 100 sticks but there are 200 designs. So you decide what you want. more different options or more of the same.</li>
            <li> They are all so cute but really small but i still think they amazing  personally say its worth it. Though if you get it be careful because the blade does not have a covering so be careful.  :-)</li>
            <li> I received these fimo canes as a Christmas present, and I was so happy! There are so many different designs! These fimo canes are a great way to spruce up a simple manicure. If I don&#x27;t want to try and put some kind of nail art design on my nails, I just paint my nails one color and add a cut off piece to my ring finger. I get so many compliments! About 3 canes had defects, and one cane was shorter than the rest for some reason, but that was ok because there is such a big variety that I didn&#x27;t really care. Overall, this was a fabulous product and I have few complaints. When I eventually do run out of these (which won&#x27;t be soon) I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Great! More than what I expected! Really easy to use. More than enough designs. A good investment whether you are a professional or someone saving money doing their nails at home!</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the detail of these canes.  I did my grandaughters nails and they were adorable! So many uses for them!</li>
            <li> My daughter received this for Christmas and she loves it.  There are several repeats but there is still a fantastic variety. It does come with a single razor blade to cut with so be careful.</li>
            <li> These fimo nail art canes are amazing. I&#x27;ve been look online for a while now and have yet to find the same quality. The blade the comes with the set is perfect for the job, and I have yet to find a bubble hidden inside the canes (this has happened a lot to me, lol). My only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; which isn&#x27;t even really a complaint is that I got one duplicate of a cane (it was white with black polkadots and had a hot pink trim around the edge... Not sure what it&#x27;s supposed to be). It&#x27;s no problem because my friend wanted to cut one up for fun, so it worked out well!&lt;br /&gt;I would give this more stars, but i can only go up to five :P well done, Shany! I will be buying again!!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve seen the \\&quot;fimo slices\\&quot; sold in stores &amp; they&#x27;re about the same diameter as the ones pictured here (the ones that are already placed on fingernails) and the sticks i received in the mail are CONSIDERABLY smaller. And about 50% of the \\&quot;sticks\\&quot; i received today are either warped or damaged beyond recognition. These things are literally so tiny in circumference that i can fit 2 designs on my 5yo&#x27;s nail without a problem. I knew that they were short but they&#x27;re kinda pricey for how tiny they are! Even all the YouTube videos I&#x27;ve watched for cutting/application of fimo slices had shown considerably larger \\&quot;sticks\\&quot;. I was so beyond excited for these to arrive, i even paid extra for faster delivery! And i had assumed that since these ones were priced higher than all the other distributors that they would be the same diameter, just a shorter length and more designs but that&#x27;s NOT the case here!!! I&#x27;m going to try to upload a pic or two of the diameter so that nobody else gets the disappointment i just did. And i was SO Damn excited to get these things too.... when i submitted my order it was the FIRST thing I&#x27;ve bought for myself in years... that just completely ruined my online purchasing for the future....        *EDIT* i can&#x27;t add a photo after the review is posted apparently, either that or i just can&#x27;t do it from my phone, idk. Either way there&#x27;s no size comparison photo, i apologize.</li>
            <li> There are so many designs to choose from in this set.  There are no duplicates but there are designs that are the same but in different colors.  Easy to cut and comes with a cutter that is just a plain razor blade.  The designs are cute and colorful.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that was received in a decent amount of time.  It is exactly as advertised.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I liked it alot, it was my first time buying nail products and it makes me want to buy again. Although, there were a few bad sticks it was still a great find/ buy!</li>
            <li> The product had no repeats at all but had a lot of similar canes (different color cupcakes or flowers). The canes are a great size and it comes with a blade so they are easy to cut the way you want them to. They have great designs (though a few are rather odd and probably won&#x27;t be used). The item is great for this price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CAUTION: The blade comes in the bag with the canes so be careful when you pull them out of the bag so that you don&#x27;t cut your hand. My blade was in the middle of the canes and couldn&#x27;t be seen from the outside and I poked around and accidentally found it that way.</li>
            <li> So many shapes! The sticks were shorter than anticipated but the product came early and was a great price. Blade in box was easy to cut with. I advise practicing slicing with a pattern you don&#x27;t like first.</li>
            <li> It said 200 fimo slices but the slices where small so it was more like 100</li>
            <li> Love them all.. Easy to use.. note that the blade is very sharp, be careful when opening the box..</li>
            <li> I expected these rods to be much longer from the pictures. They&#x27;re about an inch or less long each. However it&#x27;s easy enough to cut and use with steady hands. I like 95% of the designs. Not all you see in the pictures are what you get. I ended converting the container they came in to organize them so it&#x27;d be easy to see them when I want to use them. I&#x27;ll upload pictures to give you all an idea.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to.cut them.but they are.nice</li>
            <li> some of the canes was broke and some of there pictures was all messed up i don&#x27;t know what to do with the broken and messed up ones i prolly have 10 i can actually use the package arrived the day after the delivery date um thats about it</li>
            <li> The title that says 200pcs can be misleading if you don&#x27;t read the product description and if you&#x27;re expecting double the amount as what you get in other cane sets. There are 200 of these 1\\&quot; canes, so it&#x27;s the same amount of product as other sets that have 100 of the 2\\&quot; canes, which is fine, since the price is comparable. These even come with a cutter blade, which is great! Just be careful when you open the box they come in! The designs are cute, what you would expect from any fimo cane set.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered these rods - I always get them pre-cut. There is a great variety and it is really simple to cut (it comes with the razor). It is a much better deal than buying them pre-cut and it is the same item. I only wish they came with the option of including a container for them.</li>
            <li> I purchased the package with 200 Fimo canes, knowing that I constantly like to change up my nail styles.  I received no duplicates and super cute designs.  I definitely recommend this product and vendor!</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how small each \\&quot;rod\\&quot; is, but I guess I should have expected that since they go on your nails. Anyway, I can them having any flaws and I am sure my niece is going to love them. The ONLY thing I was slightly taken off guard by wad that the cutter that comes with it is just a razor blade that is loose in the box. Not really cool and I think the seller would want to maybe look to correct that for future sales. That&#x27;s why I gave it 3 stars...</li>
            <li> I received what the seller stated. I do think that there are too many sticks with the same image. There are some that I will never use like the one with the person face. But it is a great deal for this price.</li>
            <li> I only got 2 repeats, 2 of one and 3 of another. There were angry birds, hello kitty, hearts, stars, peace signs, a playboy bunny, lots of flowers and foods. There are some words that aren&#x27;t English (2). And one was damaged. Overall, I don&#x27;t thing ill ever use them all. But I&#x27;m glad I purchased them!</li>
            <li> Love them!!!!!! but they weren&#x27;t as much as in the photo</li>
            <li> Variety, variety cut any size, make one size big, small, slanted. It works. Like the different animals, shapes and designs. Good job</li>
            <li> This is my third set of canes (will never use all of them, I know).  Although this set had the most variety (200 canes, only three duplicates), the size of the canes were a little too small for my taste. The colors were good, but not quite as vibrant as the MASH canes (the \\&quot;true\\&quot; MASH canes).  These canes did have Hello Kitty and all the Angry Birds in the set and many designs that I did not get in the previous two sets. If you&#x27;re looking for a good variety, then this set will satisfy your needs.</li>
            <li> I love these little things! I can&#x27;t wait to use them all! I keep wanting to take off the ones that I currently have on my fingernails and try some new ones for a different look. There is a great variety in this set. I like the Angry Birds ones in particular. Each rod is a little more than one inch long. The blade that comes with it is a simple razor blade. They are easy to cut thin. Thanks for a fun product!</li>
            <li> As the title says, this order was almost perfect. I really love the assortment of designs etc. The package arrived on time as well. The only thing that keeps it from being a 5 star rating is the fact that a few on the canes were slightly damaged. They had small chunks missing out of the top. I  believe there were 4 out of the 200 that i have found with small chunks missing, usually out of the top. While I can still use most of the cane, it still does say something about the quality control at the company. However, I still love these charms and it&#x27;s not so big of a problem that I would not buy from them again,</li>
            <li> They work ok but you have to cut them really thin so they don&#x27;t stick up cuz they wont lay flat if you don&#x27;t. It does seem to work a lot better when acrylic is used with them instead of nail posh.</li>
            <li> well i would not recomend this product to anyone! in reality you r only getting about 100 worth because they r cut in half. while i did like the variety it offered it was not worth the price at all. much better deals out there.</li>
            <li> These are great for the price, 4/5 simply because there are quite a few duplicates and because some of them are very strange, though I may just use them anyway haha.. Definitely worth it for the price and a great starter set for fimo.</li>
            <li> Love it I use it all the time</li>
            <li> Not mine it&#x27;s a gift thank you very much</li>
            <li> I recommend this for first time nail artists. It easy to use and very contemporary. Be careful though when opening the package, the razor blade (the free cutter) has no covering. You might end up cutting yourself.</li>
            <li> I thought these would be bigger. I did see a few I liked but they were so tiny. I will have to force myself to use them to feel I haven&#x27;t wasted my money. Maybe on my 12 year old cousin. Not for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really a nail person but I thought these were cute and it&#x27;s easy to use. The package was a little banged up but the product was perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> Was delivered quickly.&lt;br /&gt;200 hundred different designs; there are ones that I thought were duplicates but upon closer inspection, they look similar but the design or color placement are different.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s true that the free blade is loose, so be careful when opening.&lt;br /&gt;The sticks were shorter than I expected but this is my first time using them anyway.&lt;br /&gt;It will take practice to prefect this nail art but it&#x27;s fun to practice.&lt;br /&gt;There are some really cute designs.</li>
            <li> AWESOME!got about 30 to 50 slice from each 1&amp;#34; stick. would have like it more if it came with a tubing to guide it for easy cutting</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these! would definitely recommend this product for anyone who is into nail art. They are super cute!</li>
            <li> Cute but becareful when you open the box because the blade is not wrapped nor does it have something covering the sharp end. They are not the 2in. canes they are only the 1in but still very cute.</li>
            <li> I love my fimo canes. They are so easy to slice!</li>
            <li> Arrived just on time! smaller than i thought they would be but still love them, so cute and and fun!</li>
            <li> Me and my friends enjoyed this we are traveling around the world now in my privet jet(I&#x27;m rich;) ) we easily take these off when we leve from somewhere to Mach the style were off to Cali</li>
            <li> These little fimo sticks are so fun to use and to look at on your nails. I love having the large assortment of designs. They are so cute! It wasn&#x27;t hard to cut them into slices. Just make sure you have the blade straight and cut a little piece off. They adhere well with topcoat. It&#x27;s great to have another way to decorate my nails that isn&#x27;t difficult or messy. Just putting one slice on each ring finger is a nice way to give a manicure a special touch.</li>
            <li> These are great!! I received product just as described. I did NOT get very many duplicates, and they are super cute!! I got a frog, little fruits, hello kitty, keroppi, and choco cat! Even a little, what looks like, hamtaro!! My daughter is gonna flip! Super easy to cut and WAAAAy more for your money vs pre-cut! Highly recommended! :)</li>
            <li> The canes arrived quickly and i enjoy the selection, but there was no cutter with the package when it arrived. Thats false advertisement!!</li>
            <li> Very nice came on time</li>
            <li> but i did get some cute stuff, including lots of different flowers, which is what i wanted.  i did not get alot of the sticks pictured, but i found the ones i did not get were the ones i wouldn&#x27;t have wanted anyway.  as others have mentioned, these are very short.  i got about 6 that were just tiny pieces less than 1/4&amp;#34; long.  some of the images...i can&#x27;t even tell what they&#x27;re supposed to be.  also, &amp;#34;cutting tool&amp;#34; or whatever they have listed as if it&#x27;s something special is just a razor blade you can buy anywhere.  big deal.  typical advertising to make something that isn&#x27;t seem special.  mine did have the paper on it, though, so you don&#x27;t have just a bare blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so, cute enough and i got enough different stuff that it was worth it.</li>
            <li> The designs are as i expected. They are very small and cute. I got all of the designs in the images, i was getting worried if i would get dupes but i did not :). The reason i chose this set, instead of other sets, is because i like the animal designs in this one. I wanted to get keropi, hello kitty, piggies, etc. I like most of the canes, there are very few designs that i did not like in this set. I used the small cutter blade, worked great for me, it was not hard to cut the canes with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this fimo cane set.</li>
            <li> I love it! I don&#x27;t know what would do without it! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I was soooo excited to get these fimo sticks and canes in the mail I immediately open the package to find all sorts of fun sticks to play with..they cut easy and u get an out 100 slices per stick.the cutting blade that comes with it is a excellent  tool to have.. There about 1 inch in length . I just love the variety u get .. There r some doubles but what do u expect all different ones .. no not going to happen.. but all n all its an excellent buy u get your monies worth..</li>
            <li> She started decorating her Ipod with these. She&#x27;s done all sorts of very pretty designs hasn&#x27;t yet done her nails with them yet but she&#x27;s enjoying putting them on different things. There&#x27;s not two of the same thing in the bunch and she loves the cute Chiks, frogs, Owls....So many different designs she really likes that part!</li>
            <li> i purchsed these, was given a tracking number BUT they never arrived b/c the product was damaged in transit. notified amazon and they refunded my money. instead of buying a bundle, buy a small wheel from a beauty supply store first to give them a try then splurge for a bundle if you truly love them. i bought a small wheel and found that they are simply not my style of doing nail art.</li>
            <li> Here is the issue...these are 1/2 fimos....very short like around and inch long...very misleading...and not worth the $. You can spend a few more dollars  get full fimos and get more for your money...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this was:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;200 mini fimos which in reality it was 100 fimos full size. I would NOT buy it again personally...</li>
            <li> Its my first time playing with fimo canes. My personal preference is for hand painted nail art, but these are cute and really detailed. As soon as you get the hang of cutting them they work well.</li>
            <li> Just like everyone says, these are super cute!  As a total beginner with Fimo (Fi-who?), I consider this to be more of a sampler than anything else but I have zero complaints about the product.  I was a little surprised at their size but I realized that even one small 1&amp;#34; stick can do LOTS of nails.  Plus, there are a lot of duplicates in the box if you needed more of a particular design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, to agree with pretty much everyone here, you really do need to be careful due to the uncovered, unwrapped  razor blade loose in the box.  Just don&#x27;t dump the box into your lap then reach down and grab a handful!  YIKES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, please forgive the following comments/suggestions.  I&#x27;m a nurse and worrying about others is my job!  So, with that disclaimer I&#x27;ll say this:  To be perfectly honest, I do think it is a little irresponsible to have an open razor blade somewhere inside the box.  Maybe if were taped to the inside of the box somewhere it wouldn&#x27;t bug me so much.  When you buy a pack of razor blades here in the States, each one is always individually wrapped in cardboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a tool I keep in my toolbox which I think makes cutting these SO much easier as well as much safer in my opinion.  I&#x27;m talking about a scraper that holds regular razor blades.  They are rather inexpensive and I&#x27;d recommend getting one to anyone and everyone because not only is it safer since most come with a cap over the blade, it&#x27;ll give you something to hold onto and help prevent your fingers from accidentally slipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another little disclaimer here...I&#x27;m not endorsing these sellers or specific products, just giving an example of what I&#x27;m talking about:  with these, to safely store the blade, you slide it out and turn the blade upside down so that the sharp edge is inside and covered:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Original-Mini-Razor-Scrapers-Eight/dp/B0045ZVKI2/ref&#x3D;sr_1_22?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1407100494&amp;sr&#x3D;8-22&amp;keywords&#x3D;razor+blade+scraper&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the design I use.  I like this style because the blade is snugged in with a screw-knob and also comes with a separate blade cover:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Titan-12031-Mini-Razor-Scraper/dp/B000OEDQQW/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1407100470&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;razor+blade+scraper&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sigh...one more thing.  I don&#x27;t recommend blade holders that are made entirely of metal simply because most of them do not lock the blade in place while in use unless specifically mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you find this information helpful!  Happy decorating!s is the design I use.

Happy decorating!</li>
            <li> Thank you!  Love them!</li>
            <li> i was expecting the package to be a little bigger, but it was worth it! i love how they are really small, and how small the package is! i hope that next time i order something from this that it would be a little longer in length.</li>
            <li> Looks nice, but it is very complicated cut it and stick on your nails</li>
            <li> Cool very cool sometimes it takes a few try&#x27;s to get them to stick and there is probably a knack to it but i think they are awesome</li>
            <li> The product is exactly as we expected. Considering that these are mass produced, I think it excellent that out of the 200 rods, only one was &amp;#34;messed up&amp;#34;. It seemed to be laid out funny which made it hard to determine what it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it 5 stars except for the &amp;#34;cutting tool&amp;#34;. Its just a simple razor blade. We bought an exacto knife that works much easier and better.</li>
            <li> they are tiny like an inch and half. Few the same. Good quality. And 200! Fast shipping. Good colors and patterns. Fruits, characters, flags, flowers, insects, etc</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using these fimo canes. It comes with a great variety for all occasions. It comes with so many that I still have some left over. I shared a few of them with the women in my family and still had enough to spare. I cut them with an exact o knife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you found the review helpful</li>
            <li> Great product! There were a few duplicates but at least the ones that were are cute designs. I recommend this product!</li>
