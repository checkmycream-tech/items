            <li>The product is awesome!</li>
            <li>I just swipe it on and it gives the perfect berry/wine flush to my lips and is smooth and shiny without stickiness.</li>
            <li>I have been buying this lip gloss for years, I keep a good stock on hand in case they discontinue it.  </li>
            <li>I love this gloss!  </li>
            <li>so glad I could get it here!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Good price; received in perfect, new condition.  </li>
            <li>Perfect combo of a slight tent and the smoothness of a wonderful lip balm.  </li>
            <li>Demure is non-shimmery and nice for a nude lip.</li>
            <li>It is a nice lip gloss with a hint of color to it.</li>
            <li>I was delighted to find it available from Carolina Merchandise.</li>
            <li>If you are not a heavy make-up user like myself, this is an excellent product to use.</li>
            <li>I love this lip gloss.</li>
            <li>And since I get so many compliments on the color, I quite like it, and even like the smell...</li>
            <li>Love this color.</li>
            <li>Well pleased.</li>
            <li>I love this product and it has been discontinued by Cover Girl.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>

            <li>Love the color and the amount of color it provides.</li>
            <li>Well,  yet another one of my favorite lip glosses.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sticky and it does taste okay.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty shade and tinted balm so not as bright as lipstick.</li>
            <li>It gives the right amount of color with a gloss/chapstick kind of moisture.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect gloss and a little color.</li>
            <li>reformulating the fragrance would be fantastic, because these are inexpensive, they are great colors (especially DARING) and priced well.</li>
            <li>just make them available through Prime</li>
            <li>It is smoothed on top so it looks new</li>
            <li>This is an inexpensive but effective sheer lip gloss with a hint of color.</li>
            <li>YOU VERY MUCH.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be really stoked!</li>
            <li>Perfect - a touch of red without actually being too red.  </li>
            <li>CG Lipslick is very close to my beloved black honey</li>
            <li>and I can really save my cash.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Not sticky and stays on really well.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the new formula or the color choices.  </li>
            <li>I actually like this shade better with my complexion than my former favorite.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels rich and buttery and if I wear it regularly, my lips stay soft and never crack.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It helps make this tired mommy feel a bit more girly, refreshed AND frugal ;)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, not sticky and just gives my lips a little pop.</li>
            <li>It made my lips feel soft also.</li>
            <li>I have two kids under 3 years old</li>
            <li>Oh well, at least I was able to get enough to last a while.  </li>

            <li> My product came fully sealed in a package, however when I rolled the lipstick up to see how long it is the lipstick is a third of the length it should be!</li>
            <li> Sheer coverage that adds a small tint to your natural color.</li>
            <li> lips don&#x27;t dry out during the day.</li>
            <li> Can be used alone or over other products for adding shine.</li>

            <li> only complaint is the fragrance.</li>

            <li> I love this lip gloss. It feels rich and buttery and if I wear it regularly, my lips stay soft and never crack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the fragrance. It has an odd smell, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it. And since I get so many compliments on the color, I quite like it, and even like the smell...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But listen Covergirl...reformulating the fragrance would be fantastic, because these are inexpensive, they are great colors (especially DARING) and priced well. I keep one in my purse, one in my bathroom and one in my desk (at all times)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now just make them available through Prime and I&#x27;ll be really stoked!</li>
            <li> This is an inexpensive but effective sheer lip gloss with a hint of color. Not sticky and almost tasteless. Can be used alone or over other products for adding shine.</li>
            <li> Love this color. It&#x27;s a pretty shade and tinted balm so not as bright as lipstick. It made my lips feel soft also. Would buy again!</li>
            <li> Good price; received in perfect, new condition.  Well pleased.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it has been discontinued by Cover Girl.  I was delighted to find it available from Carolina Merchandise.</li>
            <li> These are non-sticky tinted balms. Sheer coverage that adds a small tint to your natural color. Demure is non-shimmery and nice for a nude lip. Daring is a subtle wine shade with a small amount of shimmer, though I don&#x27;t really notice any shimmer when it is on. No taste, but they do smell a tad like sunscreen. They have cured my chapped lips in the past. Moisturizing. As other reviewers have mentioned, they don&#x27;t melt. Would repurchase. Demure is my holy grail everyday shade.</li>
            <li> If you like your lipstick you can keep your lipstick.  Best deal online.. period!  Would buy this every time.  I will be back.</li>
            <li> Perfect - a touch of red without actually being too red.  Moisturizing, so lips don&#x27;t dry out during the day.</li>
            <li> The product is awesome! The seller is sketchy.  My product came fully sealed in a package, however when I rolled the lipstick up to see how long it is the lipstick is a third of the length it should be! It is smoothed on top so it looks new but it is gouged out on the sides.  I definitely got ripped off on this buy and would not recommend using this seller.</li>
            <li> I purchase this product from amazon for little of nothing by way of use of a coupon amazon was offering. It is a nice lip gloss with a hint of color to it. If you are not a heavy make-up user like myself, this is an excellent product to use.</li>
            <li> I love this gloss!  I used to use Clinique&#x27;s almost lipstick in black honey but was looking for a cheaper replacement since they were about $20 a tube.  I was a hardcore department store makeup mavin before having children and am now always on the lookout for terrific buys outside the mall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This CG Lipslick is very close to my beloved black honey and I can really save my cash.  I just swipe it on and it gives the perfect berry/wine flush to my lips and is smooth and shiny without stickiness. It is not as dark as it looks in the tube. I actually like this shade better with my complexion than my former favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I adore the 2 packs sold here on amazon; I keep one in the downstairs bath and one in my purse so I can slap it on and run.  I have two kids under 3 years old and so you can imagine the lack of any time I have to spend on getting myself presentable and feeling polished when we venture out of the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It helps make this tired mommy feel a bit more girly, refreshed AND frugal ;)</li>
            <li> I have use lip slicks for about 20 years.  I love this product.  Perfect combo of a slight tent and the smoothness of a wonderful lip balm.  I only wish that cover girl would not be discontinuing it.  I really don&#x27;t like the new formula or the color choices.  Oh well, at least I was able to get enough to last a while.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Guess this color was discontinued so glad I could get it here! I bought 2 but should have gotten more.</li>
            <li> Love the color and the amount of color it provides. I use it over my long-lasting lipstick and for touch ups during the day. It&#x27;s light, not sticky and just gives my lips a little pop.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this lip gloss for years, I keep a good stock on hand in case they discontinue it.  It gives the right amount of color with a gloss/chapstick kind of moisture.  Love it!</li>
            <li> So sad they don&#x27;t sell this anymore in the stores. Not sticky and stays on really well.</li>
            <li> Well,  yet another one of my favorite lip glosses. Like I said before I will not give up on this gloss,  I will be using it&lt;br /&gt;unroll I can not find it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU VERY MUCH.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lipgloss for years.  It gives your lips just enough color to enhance your appearance and keeps your lips moist.  It was starting to be difficult to find in stores so when I saw it online ordered several to keep in stock.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years! It&#x27;s perfect gloss and a little color. It&#x27;s not sticky and it does taste okay.</li>
