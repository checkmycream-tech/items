            <li>It still looks just as good at night when I&#x27;m taking it off as it did when I put it on in the morning.</li>
            <li>Gave as a gift and recipient loved it.</li>
            <li>THIS LIGHT WEIGHT EYESHADOW PRIMER/BASE IS PERFECT.</li>
            <li>so I probably am not qualified to give a fair reveiw.  </li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>So glad I found it!</li>
            <li>I love this primer!</li>
            <li>My eyeshadow looked just as perfect as it did when I first applied it.</li>
            <li>I love this NARS primer!</li>
            <li>I love this product and hope NARS will never discontinue it!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>This stuff works &amp; is amazing.</li>
            <li>After some research I found NARs and it&#x27;s just amazing.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best eyeshadow primer I have ever used!</li>
            <li>will surely buy more.</li>
            <li>This product is ok-</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I have bought many times.</li>
            <li>When I use this primer, I am able to distinguish some color; more than I would without this product.</li>
            <li>This product is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>so I have nothing to compare it to -- however I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>The primer allowed my gel to stick where it was supposed to, without it the liner transfers to the top of my lid.  </li>
            <li>But I wish there was more products.  </li>
            <li>The wand takes up most of the tube, tricking you into thinking there&#x27;s more product than there is.  </li>
            <li>What more can I say?  </li>
            <li>I love this primer.</li>
            <li>I have oily lids &amp; even with primers, my shadows used to slide off, not this one, yes, its a bit more pricey, but very worth it!</li>
            <li>This product is AMAZING and totally worth the price!</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and helps eyeshadow stay put.  </li>
            <li>Its smooth, holds makeup all day, comes off easily with makeup remover.</li>
            <li>My eyelids get super oily and I&#x27;d basically given up on the hope of ever being able to wear eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Lancome primer for under my eye-shadow, but this is light years ahead.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a great product for me because even though my eyelids get quite oily throughout the day, this product somehow manages to keep anything I put on my eyelid in place.</li>
            <li>My new favorite product!</li>
            <li>It is an original NARS product.  </li>
            <li>The applicator is nice, and not messy.  </li>
            <li>Mac and Urban Decay are just as good.</li>
            <li>My new favorite primer.</li>
            <li>Gross (because wash your face people) but AMAZING.</li>
            <li>It truly is amazing, and I apply my eye shadow in the morning, and after an entire day, up until 8pm</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite eyelid primer.</li>
            <li>so it reallllly is worth the money, and I changed my review to 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Kind of pricey but works well and lasts.a long time.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely oily eye-lids and have been on the quest for the perfect non-smudging eyeliner only to realize that it&#x27;s really all about the primer.</li>
            <li>This eye primer seems as good as other eye primers I have tried but doesn&#x27;t really stand out in any way.</li>
            <li>i expect a lot more from NARS especially at the price!</li>
            <li>Would absolutely recommend this product!  </li>
            <li>I love this product and I am definitely buying it again.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and end up being quite clear.</li>
            <li>and it dries fast and keeps my eyeshadow in place ALL day!</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s my complete detailed comparison of the two primers:</li>
            <li>I have very oily lids and tried so many different primers.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell if this is actually the case, but it doesn&#x27;t seem very full.</li>
            <li>Due to the coloring of my skin, some shades (pinks, light pinks, light browns) do not show up.  </li>
            <li>Stops creases, keeps makeup in place, very matte finish.  </li>
            <li>and it does it very well.  </li>
            <li>But I would much rather have that issue than have streaky oily eyelids by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin &amp; all eye makeup</li>
            <li>Applies a very inconsistent amount of product when I use it.</li>
            <li>Also, it seems like there isn&#x27;t vey much product in the container.</li>
            <li>It really lacked any pigment whatsoever -</li>
            <li>one tube lasted me a whole year</li>
            <li>I had no idea how much of a difference it would make.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I got one for my coworker though she she said it didnt really work for her.</li>
            <li>So i guess it really just depends on the person.</li>
            <li>I have VERY oily eyelids.  </li>
            <li>It dries quickly (to the point of other reviews, definitely let it dry before applying shadow) and it works great with cream and powder shadows.    </li>
            <li>Works better than other bases I have tried (Laurea Mercier, Trish McEvoy, Clinique).</li>
            <li>I have tried many other primers out there, nothing holds like the NARS Primer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, not really worth the price.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to invest in a high end eyeshadow palette but it makes my drugstore shadows stick around little bit</li>
            <li>I heard great things about the primer from nars and decided to take a chance on this expensive product.  </li>
            <li>and this is my new staple.</li>
            <li>This is the first primer I have tried that actually prevents my eyeliner and eyeshadow from smudging!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I bought mine from blue mercury to ensure it&#x27;s not fake.</li>
            <li>IT NOT ONLY PRESERVES THE COLOR AND PLACEMENT OF ANY FURTHER EYE MAKE-UP, BUT ALLOWS THE \\&quot;TRUE COLORS&#x27; OF YOUR SHADOWS TO BE SEEN.....</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s clear.  </li>
            <li>It dries completely clear, no shine or color.</li>
            <li>Has prevented, completely, the smudge from my mascara.</li>
            <li>Goes on white, but you really can&#x27;t see it once it&#x27;s on.  </li>
            <li>Really makes your eye-shadows last for ages!</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I really wanted a product that I could wear without eye shadow; just eye liner.</li>
            <li>Completely solves the problem.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The only issue I have with my order, is that mine didnt come sealed and doesnt seem to be much product on the doe foot applicator during use.</li>
            <li>I have used many shadow primers over the last few years</li>
            <li>Best eyeshadow base I have ever used...</li>
            <li>I recently started wearing gel eyeliner and was disappointed at how it would rub off on my top lid, and kind of break apart throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>I used it with super heavy eyeshadow on a wild night out - no smudging, no lines, nothing!</li>
            <li>well worth the extra $$, as one tube lasts a long time!</li>
            <li>&amp; I was recently shopping for a new one when an associate suggested this one.</li>
            <li>creases and doesnt do much but dry your lids out.</li>
            <li>it is a little pricey i guess for an eyeshadow primer but its worth it.</li>
            <li>It is a little pricey, but it&#x27;s really worth it.</li>
            <li>No creasing, it dries clear and your shadows &amp; liners last until you remove them.</li>

            <li> This is an excellent product, but I think my NARS Eyeshadow Base PRO-PRIME package was a bit dry and contains little product.</li>
            <li> [...]  Overall, 5-star product and just a tiny bit needed means it will last a long time for the price!</li>
            <li> I have really oily eyelids and just a little bit of this primer will keep them dry all day.</li>
            <li> This is the only primer that keeps this area matte and dry to the touch for an entire workday.</li>
            <li> so it should last a long time.  </li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way, definitely worth the few extra $$$.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve really started to notice my eyeshadow starting to crease lately.</li>
            <li> Maybelline Superstay concealer works much better for me even though it isn&#x27;t really  shadow base.</li>
            <li> It may be possible that my prodcut was almost empty?</li>
            <li> Has lasted me a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have deep hooded eyelids that accumulates oil in the crease where my eyebrow bone partially covers my eyelid.</li>
            <li> Wish I knew about this product a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I have a medium skin tone on my eyelids, and I find that this helps to conceal this coloration on my lids, as well as provide a good base to build on.  </li>
            <li> By the middle of the day, I would have the big black oily line across me eyelids.</li>
            <li> I will be using this as long as it is offered!</li>
            <li> I left the gel liner on one eye with no primer and then primed the other lid before applying my eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> the trick is to let it dry before putting eye shadow on.</li>
            <li> It goes on thin and light, not heavy and thick and my eyeshadow stays in place all day!</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and sometimes it bothers me that my eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t stay on long due to the oil.</li>
            <li> Not really a fan.  </li>
            <li> Eye primer lasts from morning to night with absolutely no smudging.</li>
            <li> Totally rad base, it works and i&#x27;ve tried MANY.</li>
            <li> I use this eyeshadow base under NYX Milk or on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> A little expensive at $24, but definitely worth the price as it works so well and also a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> IT COMPLETELY DISAPPEARS ON YOUR LIDS AFTER APPLICATION, BUT CREATES A CANVAS, A BASE, TO INVISIBLY HOLD ALL FURTHER EYE MAKE-UP IN PLACE FOR THE WHOLE DAY....</li>
            <li> I have used other eyelid primers that discolor the color of the eyeshadow and this does not do that at all.</li>
            <li> Unlike the eyeshadow primers at the drugstore which become oily after a few hours, this one stays dry and holds eyeshadow and liner all day.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to wait a minute or two before applying makeup over this base.</li>
            <li> Non irritating to sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I actually have a hard time getting it all the way off!  </li>
            <li> the brow makeup stayed all evening and typically this fades off on me within a few hours.  </li>
            <li> Neither the tube nor the box was sealed and it seemed like it was either not a full tube or partially dried out.  </li>
            <li> ::  this primer has lasted me 5 months, and will probably last me at least another month!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and keeps the creases away and makes my eyeshadow last all day/night.</li>
            <li> I had trouble with my eye shadow melting away by noon.</li>
            <li> I use a few dabs in the morning -- then apply eyeshadow -- and my shadow lasts ALL DAY without CREASING.  </li>
            <li> Seemed a little thick.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is an issue with the product or the supplier.</li>
            <li> My liner is about 7 dollars, so I hope this product lasts me at least a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> oh and also, a little bit goes a far way with this bad boy.</li>
            <li> This product is not nearly as effective without shadow.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> WAS HESITANT TO USE AN EYE BASE BECAUSE I HAVE VERY SENSITIVE EYES.</li>
            <li> I will not buy it again, but will go back to cream based eye shadow base.</li>
            <li> I used a thin layer on each eyelid and all I have to say is</li>
            <li> I definitely notice a difference when I&#x27;m using this eyeshadow  base.  </li>
            <li> then my eyeshadow turned into an oil slick. :-(</li>
            <li> I am afraid that I might have gotten jipped by the seller.</li>
            <li> I was wrong!</li>
            <li> WON&#x27;T BE SORRY!</li>
            <li> So bad that my friends have made comments.</li>
            <li> Este es un excelente producto, pero creo que mi NARS PRO-PRIME Eyeshadow Base</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The best eyeshadow primer I&#x27;ve come across. Absolutely worth the cost. My eye makeup won&#x27;t come off with regular facewash any longer- I have to use some type of actual makeup remover each time now.</li>
            <li> Great product. Has prevented, completely, the smudge from my mascara. Love this!</li>
            <li> Best eyeshadow base I have ever used...well worth the extra $$, as one tube lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> I had trouble with my eye shadow melting away by noon. This product has corrected the problem. I will definitely buy it again and recommend it to anyone having this problem.</li>
            <li> Este es un excelente producto, pero creo que mi NARS PRO-PRIME Eyeshadow Base empaque estaba un poco seco o contiene poco producto. Puede ser posible que mi prodcuto estuviera casi vacío?    This is an excellent product, but I think my NARS Eyeshadow Base PRO-PRIME package was a bit dry and contains little product. It may be possible that my prodcut was almost empty?</li>
            <li> This is the first primer I have tried that actually prevents my eyeliner and eyeshadow from smudging! I will be using this as long as it is offered!</li>
            <li> I have used many shadow primers over the last few years &amp; I was recently shopping for a new one when an associate suggested this one. It is amazing! No creasing, it dries clear and your shadows &amp; liners last until you remove them. I have oily lids &amp; even with primers, my shadows used to slide off, not this one, yes, its a bit more pricey, but very worth it! And a little goes a long way, definitely worth the few extra $$$.</li>
            <li> Stops creases, keeps makeup in place, very matte finish.  Goes on white, but you really can&#x27;t see it once it&#x27;s on.  Has lasted me a long time.  Works better than other bases I have tried (Laurea Mercier, Trish McEvoy, Clinique).</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and sometimes it bothers me that my eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t stay on long due to the oil. So I FINALLY found a product that is reliable and will make my eyeshadow stay on longer than I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> This is one of those beauty jackpots you always hope to find.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and it does it very well.  Unlike the eyeshadow primers at the drugstore which become oily after a few hours, this one stays dry and holds eyeshadow and liner all day.  Sometimes I actually have a hard time getting it all the way off!  But I would much rather have that issue than have streaky oily eyelids by the end of the day.  Great product.</li>
            <li> The pits.  Broke before I could even use it.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and this is my new staple.</li>
            <li> Really makes your eye-shadows last for ages!</li>
            <li> i have always had a problem with my eyeshadows creating creases after a while wearing them.  so i had seen this product used by a makeup artist i decided to give it a try. this product works. my eyeshadows last all day and night without having crease lines showing up and it looks just the way i applied it on in the morning. no smudging or anything. it is a little pricey i guess for an eyeshadow primer but its worth it. will surely buy more.</li>
            <li> This stuff works &amp; is amazing. I have very oily skin &amp; all eye makeup runs underneath my eyes no matter what... this solves about 90% of the problem. So glad I found it!</li>
            <li> Best eye primer EVER!!!!! Seriously.</li>
            <li> This product is ok-the trick is to let it dry before putting eye shadow on. I will not buy it again, but will go back to cream based eye shadow base.</li>
            <li> I love this primer! It keeps my make in place all day (and I have oily skin, so eye shadows usually last maybe 2 hours maximum before creasing and smudging). Unlike Urban Decay, it&#x27;s not drying at all. I will definitely repurchase when I run out.</li>
            <li> I use this eyeshadow base under NYX Milk or on it&#x27;s own. Either way it prevents creases and makes my makeup last longer. I use it under my eyes sometimes too before I add color correcting concealer. Seems to prevent creasing there as well. Make sure to wait a minute or two before applying makeup over this base. Not a fan of the doe-foot applicator. Applies a very inconsistent amount of product when I use it.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily eye-lids and have been on the quest for the perfect non-smudging eyeliner only to realize that it&#x27;s really all about the primer. This is an awesome product. I put makeup on at 6 AM, workout at around Noon, and my eye makeup is STILL intact! The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I really wanted a product that I could wear without eye shadow; just eye liner. This product is not nearly as effective without shadow. Also, it seems like there isn&#x27;t vey much product in the container. I can&#x27;t tell if this is actually the case, but it doesn&#x27;t seem very full. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Not really a fan.  It really lacked any pigment whatsoever - it&#x27;s clear.  Not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Kind of pricey but works well and lasts.a long time.  You only need to use a tiny bit each.day.  one tube lasted me a whole year</li>
            <li> This is by far the best eyeshadow primer I have ever used! I had no idea how much of a difference it would make. I used it with super heavy eyeshadow on a wild night out - no smudging, no lines, nothing! My eyeshadow looked just as perfect as it did when I first applied it.</li>
            <li> Bummer. I have oily skin (and oily eyelids) this lasted about 30 minutes on my eyelids then my eyeshadow turned into an oil slick. :-(</li>
            <li> It goes on easy and helps eyeshadow stay put.  I love it and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Favorite primer ever!!! Keeps shadow from smudging and even liner. Really great product for the price. I have bought many times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Urban Decay eye primer for years now and I&#x27;ve really started to notice my eyeshadow starting to crease lately. I let it go for a while knowing that I have oily eyelids and thinking if this awesome eye primer can&#x27;t stop it then nothing will. I was wrong! I love this NARS primer! It goes on thin and light, not heavy and thick and my eyeshadow stays in place all day! My new favorite product!</li>
            <li> i expect a lot more from NARS especially at the price! i used it once and ended up having to buy UD primer. creases and doesnt do much but dry your lids out.</li>
            <li> Would absolutely recommend this product!  I bought it because no matter what foundation and eye shadow I was using, by the end of the day I was always getting creases in my eye shadow.  This product works so well!!!!  Completely solves the problem.  A little expensive at $24, but definitely worth the price as it works so well and also a little goes a long way so it should last a long time.  Try it!</li>
            <li> I have a medium skin tone on my eyelids, and I find that this helps to conceal this coloration on my lids, as well as provide a good base to build on.  Due to the coloring of my skin, some shades (pinks, light pinks, light browns) do not show up.  When I use this primer, I am able to distinguish some color; more than I would without this product.</li>
            <li> Great product!!! Eye primer lasts from morning to night with absolutely no smudging. This has become a staple in my makeup kit!</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING and totally worth the price! I&#x27;ve tried numerous different products and still my eyeshadow would be creased after only a couple hours. Now my eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t move the entire day! It still looks just as good at night when I&#x27;m taking it off as it did when I put it on in the morning. I love this product and I am definitely buying it again.</li>
            <li> Had this on my wish list and received it yesterday as a Christmas present. My eyelids get super oily and I&#x27;d basically given up on the hope of ever being able to wear eyeshadow. I also have to deal with the dreaded eyeliner transference on a daily basis. I used a thin layer on each eyelid and all I have to say is I went all day, all night, finally fell asleep, and woke up with my eyeshadow and eyeliner still in place. Gross (because wash your face people) but AMAZING. I&#x27;m a believer.</li>
            <li> This product is phenomenal. I have been using the Lancome primer for under my eye-shadow, but this is light years ahead. It literally leaves your eye-shadow on all day. I will never buy another primer except this one. It truly is amazing, and I apply my eye shadow in the morning, and after an entire day, up until 8pm it looks like I had just applied it. It stops all smudging, wearing away or oiliness. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift and recipient loved it.</li>
            <li> always use and eye makeup never moves</li>
            <li> My new favorite primer. It works wonders and came in time. it lasts all day for me. I got one for my coworker though she she said it didnt really work for her. So i guess it really just depends on the person. It was great for me!</li>
            <li> THIS LIGHT WEIGHT EYESHADOW PRIMER/BASE IS PERFECT. IT COMPLETELY DISAPPEARS ON YOUR LIDS AFTER APPLICATION, BUT CREATES A CANVAS, A BASE, TO INVISIBLY HOLD ALL FURTHER EYE MAKE-UP IN PLACE FOR THE WHOLE DAY....I PROMISE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WAS HESITANT TO USE AN EYE BASE BECAUSE I HAVE VERY SENSITIVE EYES. BUT ONCE I TRIED THE PRODUCT, I CAN&#x27;T DO WITHOUT IT. IT NOT ONLY PRESERVES THE COLOR AND PLACEMENT OF ANY FURTHER EYE MAKE-UP, BUT ALLOWS THE \\&quot;TRUE COLORS&#x27; OF YOUR SHADOWS TO BE SEEN.....AND NEVER SMUDGED OR WORN AWAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOU WON&#x27;T BE SORRY!</li>
            <li> The best. Keeps eyeliner and shadow in place. Non irritating to sensitive skin. Worth the price. One tube lasts a year.</li>
            <li> Seemed a little thick. Neither the tube nor the box was sealed and it seemed like it was either not a full tube or partially dried out.  Not sure if this is an issue with the product or the supplier.</li>
            <li> I have really oily eyelids and just a little bit of this primer will keep them dry all day. My eye makeup never smudges or creases anymore. It is a little pricey, but it&#x27;s really worth it.</li>
            <li> Totally rad base, it works and i&#x27;ve tried MANY.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite eyelid primer. Goes on smoothly and end up being quite clear. I have used other eyelid primers that discolor the color of the eyeshadow and this does not do that at all. Your eye make up WILL NOT BUDGE if you put it on before. I love it. Also works as a great base for liquid eyeliner. It&#x27;s such a great product for me because even though my eyelids get quite oily throughout the day, this product somehow manages to keep anything I put on my eyelid in place. oh and also, a little bit goes a far way with this bad boy. Great product.</li>
            <li> This product come to my house in perfect conditions and is an excelnte product,  my shade stays all day !</li>
            <li> I have deep hooded eyelids that accumulates oil in the crease where my eyebrow bone partially covers my eyelid. This is the only primer that keeps this area matte and dry to the touch for an entire workday. I haven&#x27;t been able to invest in a high end eyeshadow palette but it makes my drugstore shadows stick around little bit longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have with my order, is that mine didnt come sealed and doesnt seem to be much product on the doe foot applicator during use. I am afraid that I might have gotten jipped by the seller. I am buying my next tube from Sephora.</li>
            <li> I have never used eyeshadow primer before this one so I have nothing to compare it to -- however I LOVE this product.  It works.  I use a few dabs in the morning -- then apply eyeshadow -- and my shadow lasts ALL DAY without CREASING.  I think this NARS Primer is wonderful</li>
            <li> I have VERY oily eyelids.  You can fry bacon on these eyelids.  I recently started wearing gel eyeliner and was disappointed at how it would rub off on my top lid, and kind of break apart throughout the day.  I heard great things about the primer from nars and decided to take a chance on this expensive product.  I left the gel liner on one eye with no primer and then primed the other lid before applying my eyeliner.  I left it on around the house for about two hours.  The primer worked SO WELL.  It mattified my lids and kept the oiliness at bay.  The liner didn&#x27;t rub off on the primed eye and the naked eyelid was almost void of eyeliner after two hours.  The primer allowed my gel to stick where it was supposed to, without it the liner transfers to the top of my lid.  The applicator is nice, and not messy.  But I wish there was more products.  The wand takes up most of the tube, tricking you into thinking there&#x27;s more product than there is.  I took off a star because of the price, 25 dollars.  My liner is about 7 dollars, so I hope this product lasts me at least a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;::update::  this primer has lasted me 5 months, and will probably last me at least another month!  so it reallllly is worth the money, and I changed my review to 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This eye primer seems as good as other eye primers I have tried but doesn&#x27;t really stand out in any way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, not really worth the price. Mac and Urban Decay are just as good. I like to try different ones.</li>
            <li> This is the best primer I&#x27;ve found. I don&#x27;t like NARS face primer but their eyeshadow base is great. It&#x27;s very thick and keeps the creases away and makes my eyeshadow last all day/night. Great product!!</li>
            <li> I have only used this product once so I probably am not qualified to give a fair reveiw.  However, with that being said I used it and my eyemakeup did not bleed or budge all night/day.  I even used in on my brows and the brow makeup stayed all evening and typically this fades off on me within a few hours.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Wow! I have the oiliest eyelids. So bad that my friends have made comments. By the middle of the day, I would have the big black oily line across me eyelids. I&#x27;ve tried M.A.C&#x27;s primer and it never worked for me. After some research I found NARs and it&#x27;s just amazing. I even took a nap and my eyeshadow stayed in place. That never happens. I will forever have NARs in my makeup bag. I bought mine from blue mercury to ensure it&#x27;s not fake. Always check that your vendor is an approved seller of the product your buying!</li>
            <li> This primer WORKS. I have very oily lids and tried so many different primers. At one point I gave up and stopped using eyeshadow. But now that I food this!!!! Very happy with the purchase! Recommend!!!</li>
            <li> It does what it says.  It is an original NARS product.  I put it one, and my eye shadow does not budge.  I do suffer from oily eyelids.  I also use it before I put on my eyeliner as well to avoid transfer to my eyelids. This is my holy grail.  I will purchase again.  Very happy!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping to finally find something that worked with my oily skin. This product is not it.  Maybelline Superstay concealer works much better for me even though it isn&#x27;t really  shadow base.</li>
            <li> Effortless application, colorless on the lid and the shadow stays on!  What more can I say?  I love this product and hope NARS will never discontinue it!</li>
            <li> Wish I knew about this product a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Love it!  I definitely notice a difference when I&#x27;m using this eyeshadow  base.  I will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, I swipe it on each eye rub it in and it dries fast and keeps my eyeshadow in place ALL day!</li>
            <li> I had used Bareminerals cream eyeshadow primer for years and tried this last week. It will be replacing Bareminerals! It dries quickly (to the point of other reviews, definitely let it dry before applying shadow) and it works great with cream and powder shadows.    It dries completely clear, no shine or color. Here&#x27;s my complete detailed comparison of the two primers: [...]  Overall, 5-star product and just a tiny bit needed means it will last a long time for the price!</li>
            <li> I love this primer. Its smooth, holds makeup all day, comes off easily with makeup remover. I have tried many other primers out there, nothing holds like the NARS Primer. Highly recommended.</li>
