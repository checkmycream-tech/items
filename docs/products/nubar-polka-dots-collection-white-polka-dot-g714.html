            <li>but once there on it&#x27;s cute.</li>
            <li>This is really an interesting polish.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much much better.</li>
            <li>it looks more like a sparse glitter top coat.</li>
            <li>If you are skilled enough precision placement would look great.</li>
            <li>Obviously it&#x27;s not meant to be worn alone, but over a colorful cream, these semi-opaque glitter circles are beautiful.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this polish</li>
            <li>i really thought that the dots would be more as shown--but no they are not--</li>
            <li>I use this product over other color polishes and it looks great.</li>
            <li>Im very happy with this nail polish, it last tremendously longer than I expected</li>
            <li>Nubar White Polka Dot is amazing.  </li>
            <li>In my attempts to get more glitter on each nail I ended up ruining my manicure because the amount of clear polish applied as a result</li>
            <li>It looks great over a deep red, a cool silver or daring black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After one coat I was lucky if I had one large glitter piece on each nail.</li>
            <li>This and the Nubar Polka Dots (Black Polka Dot) go on nicely leaving cool speckles and dots.</li>
            <li>Love the effects of the white dots!</li>
            <li>Long lasting and looks good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy with the white polka dots that I&#x27;m going to order the black ones.</li>
            <li>The first nail color has to highly contrast because the dots are a bit translucent.</li>
            <li>Dots really don&#x27;t show up very well and it doesn&#x27;t go on evenly as the pictures show.  </li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t really pay attention to the picture.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and arrived well packed.</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable and brand name speaks for it&#x27;s self.</li>
            <li>- this has potential - but definitely needs MORE large pieces of glitter in it.</li>
            <li>I had to apply so man coats just to get a decent amount of dot coverage.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still decent. .</li>
            <li>Only wish that the big dots would be more frequent than shown in the  image.</li>
            <li>and there are barely any large hexagons at all.</li>
            <li>It even looks good on white or soft colors, I have the black too, they just add that extra olala moment</li>
            <li>I got maybe one on each nail the first try and had to manipulate the larger pieces on my nail manually</li>
            <li>Goes on clear with a bit of glitter.</li>
            <li>everything comes  out clear.</li>
            <li>it goes on like clear nail polish</li>
            <li>It softens the color enough not to be obnoxious and once people really look at your nails, they&#x27;re like</li>
            <li>The polish I received was old and yellowing.</li>
            <li>This top coat has larger hexagons and lots of small glitter.  </li>
            <li>Not as pretty as expected.</li>
            <li>These dots are barely visible.</li>
            <li>I can barely see any glitter</li>
            <li>I wore it with a soft white nail polish.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get too think which is another plus about this product, it dried quickly even after multiple layers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was my first Nubar polish, and I plan to purchase Black Polka Dot as well as 2010.    </li>
            <li>I love this over a bright blue or even a hard to wear green, black and all the other dark colors.  </li>

            <li> This polish has White large hex glitter and small white glitter throughout.  </li>
            <li> Has a certain shimmer to it in addition to the super-micro glitters and larger &amp;#34;dots&amp;#34; (which are still rather small).  </li>
            <li> This polish goes on really well and has lots of micro glitter specks, but it&#x27;s REALLY hard to get the bigger glitter pieces on your nail -</li>
            <li> The white glitter in this polish is not as opaque as I had expected.</li>
            <li> At the moment my pedicure consists of my big toes with black polish with 2 coats of this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered both the white and black polka dot polishes.</li>
            <li> Same with the black version of this.</li>
            <li> Although the glitter was sparse, It was what I expected, so I am not complaining.</li>
            <li> I expected the polish color and the glitter</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more shimmery and translucent, which is a little disappointing to me.</li>
            <li> The glitter is extremely sparse.</li>
            <li> My other toes are painted in Revlon&#x27;s \\&quot;Varnished\\&quot; with black tips.</li>
            <li> so I painted my nails black in preparation.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bothered trying the black.</li>
            <li> it would take you half dozen swipes to get the number of dots as seen in the picture.</li>
            <li> Not worth trouble trouble.</li>
            <li> to add a *little something* over spring time nudes!</li>
            <li> hard to apply it because of the glitter size.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in black and white and I&#x27;m extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t check the other reviews before I bought this.</li>
            <li> And of course I share my secret.  </li>
            <li> I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> the coverage is terrible.</li>

            <li> At the moment my pedicure consists of my big toes with black polish with 2 coats of this product. My other toes are painted in Revlon&#x27;s \\&quot;Varnished\\&quot; with black tips. I&#x27;m so happy with the white polka dots that I&#x27;m going to order the black ones.</li>
            <li> I ordered both the white and black polka dot polishes. I was excited to try this polish so I painted my nails black in preparation. I was so disappointed. The glitter is extremely sparse. After one coat I was lucky if I had one large glitter piece on each nail. In my attempts to get more glitter on each nail I ended up ruining my manicure because the amount of clear polish applied as a result was massive. I haven&#x27;t bothered trying the black. I&#x27;ll probably take it to work and mark it as \\&quot;free.\\&quot; Maybe someone else will have more luck.</li>
            <li> This polish goes on really well and has lots of micro glitter specks, but it&#x27;s REALLY hard to get the bigger glitter pieces on your nail - I got maybe one on each nail the first try and had to manipulate the larger pieces on my nail manually - this has potential - but definitely needs MORE large pieces of glitter in it. Same with the black version of this.</li>

            <li> Nubar White Polka Dot is amazing.  I love it.  This was my first Nubar polish, and I plan to purchase Black Polka Dot as well as 2010.    This polish has White large hex glitter and small white glitter throughout.  it looks like snowflakes and it a great compliment to any manicure!  Although the glitter was sparse, It was what I expected, so I am not complaining.</li>
            <li> Dots really don&#x27;t show up very well and it doesn&#x27;t go on evenly as the pictures show.  Not worth trouble trouble.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t check the other reviews before I bought this. I can barely see any glitter and there are barely any large hexagons at all. I purchased this in black and white and I&#x27;m extremely disappointed. I also didn&#x27;t really pay attention to the picture. I expected the polish color and the glitter but that was an error on my part.</li>
            <li> I use this product over other color polishes and it looks great. Goes on clear with a bit of glitter. Perfect over any color polish.</li>
            <li> i really thought that the dots would be more as shown--but no they are not--but i do like this polish</li>
            <li> It even looks good on white or soft colors, I have the black too, they just add that extra olala moment</li>
            <li> Wife enjoys it, but it takes a couple of coats..it&#x27;s still decent. .</li>
            <li> This and the Nubar Polka Dots (Black Polka Dot) go on nicely leaving cool speckles and dots. Long lasting and looks good. Only wish that the big dots would be more frequent than shown in the  image.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for someone looking for a slightly more grown-up version of glitter nails. It looks great over a deep red, a cool silver or daring black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most glitter polishes it would take you half dozen swipes to get the number of dots as seen in the picture. If you are skilled enough precision placement would look great. Doesn&#x27;t get too think which is another plus about this product, it dried quickly even after multiple layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fun for the holidays, got a ton of great compliments!</li>
            <li> i dont like it. hard to apply it because of the glitter size. it does not look like the picture w/o taking 5 minutes per nail to fish the glitter out of the bottle and push it around the nail. used it once and never used again</li>
            <li> Love the effects of the white dots! much better than pic and you get more dots. Very white. I wore it with a soft white nail polish. It just look like a snowy winter look. Adorable! Shipped fast and arrived well packed.</li>
            <li> It takes a lot of time trying to get the dots on your finger nails but once there on it&#x27;s cute. Even though it takes some doing, I still recommend it to everyone. The price was reasonable and brand name speaks for it&#x27;s self.</li>
            <li> This is really an interesting polish.  I love this over a bright blue or even a hard to wear green, black and all the other dark colors.  It softens the color enough not to be obnoxious and once people really look at your nails, they&#x27;re like did you do that??  And of course I share my secret.  Love this nail polish, quick and easy polka dots, who doesn&#x27;t love that!!</li>
            <li> Im very happy with this nail polish, it last tremendously longer than I expected, the look is amazing, I get so many people asking me where to find them, and of course! I send them to Amazon, Im a happy customer (:</li>
            <li> The polish I received was old and yellowing. Not as pretty as expected. Go with OPI Pirrouette my Whistle. It&#x27;s much much better.</li>
            <li> the coverage is terrible. everything comes  out clear. you don, see the dots. it goes on like clear nail polish</li>
            <li> This top coat has larger hexagons and lots of small glitter.  When I apply it I only get one or two hexagons.  it looks more like a sparse glitter top coat.</li>
            <li> The white glitter in this polish is not as opaque as I had expected. It&#x27;s a little more shimmery and translucent, which is a little disappointing to me.</li>
            <li> Hadn&#x27;t seen it in person, only in ads and photos online.  Has a certain shimmer to it in addition to the super-micro glitters and larger &amp;#34;dots&amp;#34; (which are still rather small).  This is a great special effect top coat for someone that is wanting to try one, without going whole-hog obnoxious.  This is office appropriate and can successfully be applied over just about any color you have...especially nice  to add a *little something* over spring time nudes!</li>
