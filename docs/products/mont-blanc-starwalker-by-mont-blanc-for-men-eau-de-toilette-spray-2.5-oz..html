            <li>Very nice, i love this fresh fragance</li>
            <li>I was AMAZED at how fresh and warm Starwalker smells!</li>
            <li>Mont Blanc always delivers great colognes and I really like this one!</li>
            <li>This is a very important consideration, as a cologne that smells pleasing on one man may not on another.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>all well and super good product</li>
            <li>IMO it kind of smells like L&#x27;Eau Par Kenzo without the strong lemon/citrus smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance</li>
            <li>I buy many perfumes by amazon</li>
            <li>Love this scent and the way it smells on my Fianc&amp;eacute;.  </li>

            <li>I have purchased many colognes in my day, but have never bought one for $30</li>
            <li>You can get better for cheaper, the scent is run of the mill.</li>
            <li>I love this cologne aroma for a men.</li>
            <li>I get the most compliments when I&#x27;m wearing this cologne.</li>

            <li>I wish that you work the more and more to improve it quality because I find the quality isn&#x27;t anough strong.</li>

            <li>Live life and be happy...</li>
            <li>I do however have to say that this has risen to the top of my list very quickly.</li>
            <li>my friend liked it so much as well, she now has her own bottle.</li>
            <li>First time buying cologne online, but very pleased with the product, and the service.</li>
            <li>i love this sprsy.very nice and good smell.i use this sprsy since long time....same quality and smell never feel any difference.</li>
            <li>Nice fragance to use in tha day dued is not that soft,,, but its really nice.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li>I like it, although it is not that strong.</li>
            <li>Cool, one of my favorite.</li>
            <li>The Eau de Toilette spray is a true favorite ....</li>
            <li>In order to have an original fragance, is much better to purchase directly at the store, this is to cheap to be good.  </li>
            <li>Ladies tell me that it&#x27;s a pleasant sexy fragrance, and all this from a cologne that I bought on groupon once on a whim and have been keeping in my personal stock since.</li>
            <li>This is great fragrance that constantly gets me compliments.  </li>
            <li>It would make a great present.</li>
            <li>cologne smells great, and is one of my favorites for the current time.</li>
            <li>Mind you he does not ever wear cologne and does not like many smells.it smells so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Many thanks!</li>
            <li>Packaged in original box.</li>
            <li>If you like Tommy Bahama original fragrance and like the cedar, sage, spice and flower line, this is for you.</li>
            <li>its an original perfume .Higly recommended</li>
            <li>its an original perfume .Higly recommended</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one if you want to impress \\&quot;yourself\\&quot; or more importantly anyone else!!!</li>
            <li>If you like clean fragrances, cool bottles, and you are a collector - buy it.  </li>
            <li>a clean semi sweet (not like candy though)</li>
            <li>and I recommend it with full responsibility</li>
            <li>It reminds me of Cool Water.</li>
            <li>FUTURES BUYING BECOME GOOD AT THE SAME WAY!!  </li>
            <li>Just buy and realize how true I am.</li>
            <li>SWEET, ORDER IT ONLINE AND</li>
            <li>but I also loved the hint of blue musk and warmth that Cool Water has.</li>
            <li>Not a bad fragrance, but nothing to say, \\&quot;wow\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend trying this in a store first, and if it works for you, I would definitely recommend Starwalker as a cologne that has a light and pleasant aroma; it is not overpowering like a lot of fragrances on the market today</li>
            <li>And the best thing is this fragrance is not as commonly used as the others I mentioned (but of no less quality), so you will stand out with a light, sexy, and unique auroma when you&#x27;re out with with your lady or your friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Polo</li>
            <li>It just smells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>It a winner to me has a clean fresh fragance.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>thank you for quick service.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is sensational had smelled in brazil and is not the same.</li>
            <li>I own and have owned many colognes including other Mont Blanc fragrances.</li>
            <li>Love the scent, is soft and unique.</li>
            <li>This cologne DOES smell amazing, but the smell doesn&#x27;t last whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>I have owned just about every popular cologne in the last 15+ years.</li>
            <li>It is worth buying.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really matter if it smells good or not if it doesn&#x27;t last</li>
            <li>It is worth trying...</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Fair price, packaged well, and came just as I expected.  </li>
            <li>The packaging is good, and exactly as I had expected.</li>
            <li>love it really good cologne,my girlfriend love it smells really expensive reasonable price</li>
            <li>Gently, everyone notices you with a special smell.</li>
            <li>The bottle is cool and well designed with the familiar Mount Blanc logo clearly visible.</li>
            <li>it is one of my best scent in cologne... and it only costs me half of the price from the first one i had purchased.</li>
            <li>The smell is so strong and masculine.</li>
            <li>The price is around half what you&#x27;d pay for a good brand name cologne in a dept. store.</li>
            <li>I like me very much.</li>
            <li>I like me very much.</li>
            <li>, thank you very much.</li>
            <li>I think the product went out of stock and the original reviews and listing went away, and they started with a new one.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I love colognes like Burberry Brit, Bulgari Pour Homme, Jean Paul Gautier Male</li>
            <li>sure why but this is the 2nd time I am posting this review.</li>
            <li>Years later its still one of my favorite colognes</li>
            <li>Love the scent - alternate with J.V. Vintage (now discontinued).</li>
            <li>most likely it turned and was expired</li>
            <li>This one does not last long on me but smells fine, I was expecting to be more &amp;#34;long-lasting&amp;#34;, but what I&#x27;m doing right now is applying twice a day!...</li>
            <li>Seems like the real thing, good price about $15 less than what I was paying at the store.</li>
            <li>I love the crisp, fresh high notes of Polo Blue</li>
            <li>Scent is very &#x27;clean&#x27; and not over powering (provided you use it properly).</li>
            <li>It offers a clean amber scent with hints of fruit and woody/oak to finish.  </li>
            <li>After not wearing any cologne for many years, I stopped in a shop and sampled several different products to find the right one that mixed with my own body chemistry.  </li>
            <li>execellent thanks very much congratulation</li>
            <li>and the fragrance was pure alcohol.</li>
            <li>All it is is pure alcohol</li>
            <li>Pure alcohol.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been a fan of fresh and \\&quot;blue\\&quot; smelling cologne like Polo Blue, D&amp;G Light Blue, and Cool Water.</li>
            <li>The scent is very fresh, clean and crisp and you can use it year round.  </li>
            <li>Very prompt delivery.  </li>
            <li>It smells like a much cheaper cologne to me.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t believe how can amazon allow this type of sellers steal our money.</li>
            <li>very disapointed.</li>
            <li>Meaning, I wouldn&#x27;t wear it with shorts and a t-shirt (check out D&amp;G Light Blue for that).</li>
            <li>Always my dirst choice cos it&#x27;s not too much to feel your existence.</li>
            <li>Mont Blanc fragrances are very versatile.</li>
            <li>it is perfect for a gift and the price is crazy.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love how crisp and low key it is.</li>
            <li>Of the Mount Blanc fragrances I have reviewed (Individuel, Presence Cool, and Starwalker), this is my least favorite.  </li>
            <li>,some high price cologne fades away buy not this one will recommend</li>
            <li>Good job by Mont Blanc curious as to what the other fragrances smell like from them (Exceptionnel,Legend)</li>
            <li>This is a delightfully masculine scent that I really appreciate.  </li>
            <li>It is a light, long lasting scent that I not only enjoy wearing but receive compliments on Often.</li>
            <li>I have no negative rate in this article</li>
            <li>However, for half the price you get a cologne that is half as strong and much more watery.</li>
            <li>With the price tag, I expected something a little more unique.</li>
            <li>would say this cologne smells young enough where it will go over well with people between 15 and 30 years old, but is manly enough to easily wear if you are in your 30&#x27;s, 40&#x27;s, or 50&#x27;s, and beyond.</li>
            <li>Bought this first time from Mont Blanc the store, big mistake as its WAY cheaper to buy it here from Amazon.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the only logical conclusion I can form.</li>
            <li>Blue as been my personal favorite for a long time,</li>
            <li>pure alcohol or fragrance does not last 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>It smells more serious like it should go with a suit or going out for the evening somewhere fancier than normal.</li>
            <li>meh, just another citrus cologne, nothing WOW about it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing it for 5 years now and it never gets old.</li>
            <li>Either this is counterfeit or old.</li>
            <li>masculine smell that you can wear everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far...</li>
            <li>Naturally, I purchased it immediately.  </li>
            <li>Its soft and acidic.</li>
            <li>So its not super versatile BUT in the right atmosphere and intention its a homerun!</li>
            <li>Definitely not Brute or Old Spice:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price/value is average at slightly over $30 with free shipping.  </li>
            <li>For comparison, these are colognes I really like: John Varvatos Artisan Black, Paco Rabanne 1 Million, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Chanel Allure, Chanel Egoiste Platinum,</li>
            <li>I can smell directly where I sprayed, and not get one single hint of the cologne smell.  </li>
            <li>A nice smell, not over powering maybe a little weak (questioning quthenticity</li>

            <li> I bought it to my father two year ago and He liked a lot, HE bought some times after</li>
            <li> and my father liked it on me</li>
            <li> Starwalker is absolutely the best smelling cologne ever.  </li>
            <li> and this is by far the best cologne I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Very nice, i love this fresh fragance</li>
            <li> I was AMAZED at how fresh and warm Starwalker smells!</li>
            <li> Mont Blanc always delivers great colognes and I really like this one!</li>
            <li> This is a very important consideration, as a cologne that smells pleasing on one man may not on another.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> all well and super good product</li>
            <li> IMO it kind of smells like L&#x27;Eau Par Kenzo without the strong lemon/citrus smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance</li>
            <li> I buy many perfumes by amazon</li>
            <li> Love this scent and the way it smells on my Fianc&amp;eacute;.  </li>
            <li> i love othe rmont blanc scents</li>
            <li> wanna purchased more from this brands</li>

            <li> I love the scent and the ladies do too.</li>
            <li> will love it.</li>
            <li> , I have not received so many compliments as I have with this one.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Also ordered Mont Blanc Legend, but this one is a lot better</li>
            <li> I have purchased many colognes in my day, but have never bought one for $30</li>
            <li> You can get better for cheaper, the scent is run of the mill.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne aroma for a men.</li>
            <li> I get the most compliments when I&#x27;m wearing this cologne.</li>
            <li> And I absolutely LOVE LOVE it on my man.....</li>
            <li> I pounce on him like a cat when he wears it : )</li>
            <li> In another store it would cost more.</li>
            <li> I Love this perfume, I used like a gift my husband love It</li>
            <li> Ever since, I have been wearing it most days.  </li>
            <li> a \\&quot;Hot Minute\\&quot;!!!</li>
            <li> I wish that you work the more and more to improve it quality because I find the quality isn&#x27;t anough strong.</li>
            <li> 100% original and this super good price</li>
            <li> Live life and be happy...</li>
            <li> I do however have to say that this has risen to the top of my list very quickly.</li>
            <li> my friend liked it so much as well, she now has her own bottle.</li>
            <li> First time buying cologne online, but very pleased with the product, and the service.</li>
            <li> i love this sprsy.very nice and good smell.i use this sprsy since long time....same quality and smell never feel any difference.</li>
            <li> Nice fragance to use in tha day dued is not that soft,,, but its really nice.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> I like it, although it is not that strong.</li>
            <li> Cool, one of my favorite.</li>
            <li> The Eau de Toilette spray is a true favorite ....</li>
            <li> In order to have an original fragance, is much better to purchase directly at the store, this is to cheap to be good.  </li>
            <li> Ladies tell me that it&#x27;s a pleasant sexy fragrance, and all this from a cologne that I bought on groupon once on a whim and have been keeping in my personal stock since.</li>
            <li> This is great fragrance that constantly gets me compliments.  </li>
            <li> It would make a great present.</li>
            <li> cologne smells great, and is one of my favorites for the current time.</li>
            <li> Mind you he does not ever wear cologne and does not like many smells.it smells so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Many thanks!</li>
            <li> Packaged in original box.</li>
            <li> If you like Tommy Bahama original fragrance and like the cedar, sage, spice and flower line, this is for you.</li>
            <li> its an original perfume .Higly recommended</li>
            <li> its an original perfume .Higly recommended</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one if you want to impress \\&quot;yourself\\&quot; or more importantly anyone else!!!</li>
            <li> If you like clean fragrances, cool bottles, and you are a collector - buy it.  </li>
            <li> a clean semi sweet (not like candy though)</li>
            <li> and I recommend it with full responsibility</li>
            <li> It reminds me of Cool Water.</li>
            <li> FUTURES BUYING BECOME GOOD AT THE SAME WAY!!  </li>
            <li> Just buy and realize how true I am.</li>
            <li> SWEET, ORDER IT ONLINE AND</li>
            <li> but I also loved the hint of blue musk and warmth that Cool Water has.</li>
            <li> Not a bad fragrance, but nothing to say, \\&quot;wow\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend trying this in a store first, and if it works for you, I would definitely recommend Starwalker as a cologne that has a light and pleasant aroma; it is not overpowering like a lot of fragrances on the market today</li>
            <li> And the best thing is this fragrance is not as commonly used as the others I mentioned (but of no less quality), so you will stand out with a light, sexy, and unique auroma when you&#x27;re out with with your lady or your friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Polo</li>
            <li> It just smells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> It a winner to me has a clean fresh fragance.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> thank you for quick service.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is sensational had smelled in brazil and is not the same.</li>
            <li> I own and have owned many colognes including other Mont Blanc fragrances.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, is soft and unique.</li>
            <li> This cologne DOES smell amazing, but the smell doesn&#x27;t last whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> I have owned just about every popular cologne in the last 15+ years.</li>
            <li> It is worth buying.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really matter if it smells good or not if it doesn&#x27;t last</li>
            <li> It is worth trying...</li>
            <li> It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Fair price, packaged well, and came just as I expected.  </li>
            <li> The packaging is good, and exactly as I had expected.</li>
            <li> love it really good cologne,my girlfriend love it smells really expensive reasonable price</li>
            <li> Gently, everyone notices you with a special smell.</li>
            <li> The bottle is cool and well designed with the familiar Mount Blanc logo clearly visible.</li>
            <li> it is one of my best scent in cologne... and it only costs me half of the price from the first one i had purchased.</li>
            <li> The smell is so strong and masculine.</li>
            <li> The price is around half what you&#x27;d pay for a good brand name cologne in a dept. store.</li>
            <li> I like me very much.</li>
            <li> I like me very much.</li>
            <li> , thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I think the product went out of stock and the original reviews and listing went away, and they started with a new one.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I love colognes like Burberry Brit, Bulgari Pour Homme, Jean Paul Gautier Male</li>
            <li> sure why but this is the 2nd time I am posting this review.</li>
            <li> Years later its still one of my favorite colognes</li>
            <li> Love the scent - alternate with J.V. Vintage (now discontinued).</li>
            <li> most likely it turned and was expired</li>
            <li> This one does not last long on me but smells fine, I was expecting to be more &amp;#34;long-lasting&amp;#34;, but what I&#x27;m doing right now is applying twice a day!...</li>
            <li> Seems like the real thing, good price about $15 less than what I was paying at the store.</li>
            <li> I love the crisp, fresh high notes of Polo Blue</li>
            <li> Scent is very &#x27;clean&#x27; and not over powering (provided you use it properly).</li>
            <li> It offers a clean amber scent with hints of fruit and woody/oak to finish.  </li>
            <li> After not wearing any cologne for many years, I stopped in a shop and sampled several different products to find the right one that mixed with my own body chemistry.  </li>
            <li> execellent thanks very much congratulation</li>
            <li> and the fragrance was pure alcohol.</li>
            <li> All it is is pure alcohol</li>
            <li> Pure alcohol.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of fresh and \\&quot;blue\\&quot; smelling cologne like Polo Blue, D&amp;G Light Blue, and Cool Water.</li>
            <li> The scent is very fresh, clean and crisp and you can use it year round.  </li>
            <li> Very prompt delivery.  </li>
            <li> It smells like a much cheaper cologne to me.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t believe how can amazon allow this type of sellers steal our money.</li>
            <li> very disapointed.</li>
            <li> Meaning, I wouldn&#x27;t wear it with shorts and a t-shirt (check out D&amp;G Light Blue for that).</li>
            <li> Always my dirst choice cos it&#x27;s not too much to feel your existence.</li>
            <li> Mont Blanc fragrances are very versatile.</li>
            <li> it is perfect for a gift and the price is crazy.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how crisp and low key it is.</li>
            <li> Of the Mount Blanc fragrances I have reviewed (Individuel, Presence Cool, and Starwalker), this is my least favorite.  </li>
            <li> ,some high price cologne fades away buy not this one will recommend</li>
            <li> Good job by Mont Blanc curious as to what the other fragrances smell like from them (Exceptionnel,Legend)</li>
            <li> This is a delightfully masculine scent that I really appreciate.  </li>
            <li> It is a light, long lasting scent that I not only enjoy wearing but receive compliments on Often.</li>
            <li> I have no negative rate in this article</li>
            <li> However, for half the price you get a cologne that is half as strong and much more watery.</li>
            <li> With the price tag, I expected something a little more unique.</li>
            <li> would say this cologne smells young enough where it will go over well with people between 15 and 30 years old, but is manly enough to easily wear if you are in your 30&#x27;s, 40&#x27;s, or 50&#x27;s, and beyond.</li>
            <li> Bought this first time from Mont Blanc the store, big mistake as its WAY cheaper to buy it here from Amazon.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only logical conclusion I can form.</li>
            <li> Blue as been my personal favorite for a long time,</li>
            <li> pure alcohol or fragrance does not last 25 minutes.</li>
            <li> It smells more serious like it should go with a suit or going out for the evening somewhere fancier than normal.</li>
            <li> meh, just another citrus cologne, nothing WOW about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing it for 5 years now and it never gets old.</li>
            <li> Either this is counterfeit or old.</li>
            <li> masculine smell that you can wear everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far...</li>
            <li> Naturally, I purchased it immediately.  </li>
            <li> Its soft and acidic.</li>
            <li> So its not super versatile BUT in the right atmosphere and intention its a homerun!</li>
            <li> Definitely not Brute or Old Spice:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price/value is average at slightly over $30 with free shipping.  </li>
            <li> For comparison, these are colognes I really like: John Varvatos Artisan Black, Paco Rabanne 1 Million, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Chanel Allure, Chanel Egoiste Platinum,</li>
            <li> I can smell directly where I sprayed, and not get one single hint of the cologne smell.  </li>
            <li> A nice smell, not over powering maybe a little weak (questioning quthenticity</li>
            <li> Since Mont Blanc makes a high end pen I thought this cologne was just a way for them to get into the cologne market with a half crappy scent, but I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> This cologne is not bad, but it&#x27;s not great.</li>
            <li> smell is almost imperceptible, just alcohol with a very soft fragance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clean subtle smell, but in my view, not worth the price.</li>
            <li> if the product is not fulfilled by Amazon, I always am cautious of 3rd Party vendors as some may sell a watered down fragrance and/or completely different product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s usually take me two months to finish it and order new perfume.</li>
            <li> I see a lot of other reviewers saying the same thing.  </li>
            <li> Happened the same as other customer that reviewed on February 16, 2013.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lasts very long and smells great!&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for the evening outing...</li>
            <li> The scent is incredibly similar to Kenneth Cole Black.  </li>
            <li> The scent does last well on my skin, I usually get about 8 hours of fragrance on my neck or wrists, assuming I do not wash my hands multiple times.</li>
            <li> What little scent there is doesn&#x27;t last</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even last few minutes.</li>
            <li> And the product came as expected</li>
            <li> ever i sprayed, fragrance wont last even for few minutes its gone.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> The descriptions given in the webpage fits as its expected.</li>
            <li> My wife prefers this over all other choices.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, I&#x27;ve never had this issue yet but YMMV</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and hope to get a replacement when this one is half way.</li>
            <li> The smell becomes faint after only about 15 minutes and a few hours later, you don&#x27;t even smell it on you.  </li>
            <li> This size bottle lasted a little over 6 months for me and routine use.</li>
            <li> Smells a little like pencils to me</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I work in retail and talk with people Everyday</li>
            <li> WASTE UR MONEY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only minus was that the packaging looked somewhat &#x27;dirty&#x27;, hence the 4 star....</li>
            <li> seems a copy and a waste of money!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a cologne that women like and</li>
            <li> This is a fragance that has been around for a while, it is hard to find some times.</li>
            <li> I wish I could leave negative star.</li>
            <li> I mean it&#x27;s almost non-existent and then disappears within a half an hour!!!</li>
            <li> This is the worst single ( for the little scent there is) cologne I&#x27;ve ever bought!!!</li>
            <li> Totally fake.</li>
            <li> If I had known I am buying fake I would have not bought it.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a fake.</li>
            <li> bought blind</li>
            <li> /&gt;Makes me think it&#x27;s fake.</li>
            <li> This is fake!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fake, Beware!</li>
            <li> Trust me you will not be disappointed</li>
            <li> worst experience,either it was fake or .?????????????????????&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed in this cologne!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a bit below mediocre!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> good product, smells good</li>
            <li> this smells good and i received a lot of compliments from this cologne, i recommend it for everyone, besides its a really good brand that&#x27;s what i heard.</li>
            <li> One of the best of Mont blanc. Recommended.</li>
            <li> i bought this as a gift for my bro he likes it</li>
            <li> After not wearing any cologne for many years, I stopped in a shop and sampled several different products to find the right one that mixed with my own body chemistry.  This is a very important consideration, as a cologne that smells pleasing on one man may not on another.  I would recommend trying this in a store first, and if it works for you, I would definitely recommend Starwalker as a cologne that has a light and pleasant aroma; it is not overpowering like a lot of fragrances on the market today (remember, you should see a gentleman before you smell him).  This size bottle lasted a little over 6 months for me and routine use.</li>
            <li> All very good excellent</li>
            <li> no dura el aroma! se evapora! parece una copia y una perdida de dinero! tengan cuidado! yo compro muchos perfumes por amazon y me he dado cuenta que si venden imitaciones!&lt;br /&gt;the scent does not last! evaporates! seems a copy and a waste of money! beware! I buy many perfumes by amazon and I&#x27;ve realized that if they sell imitations!</li>
            <li> Excellent all in perfect condition</li>
            <li> Very prompt delivery.  This is the perfume my husband loves.  Gift wrapping and message were done.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I was AMAZED at how fresh and warm Starwalker smells! It was an impluse buy for me! That is saying a lot for someone like me who is picky about cologne. I&#x27;ve always been a fan of fresh and \\&quot;blue\\&quot; smelling cologne like Polo Blue, D&amp;G Light Blue, and Cool Water. I love the crisp, fresh high notes of Polo Blue but I also loved the hint of blue musk and warmth that Cool Water has. When I tried Starwalker, I immediately knew I&#x27;ve found the PERFECT combination of these two characteristics, with the musk notes being very, very light! And the best thing is this fragrance is not as commonly used as the others I mentioned (but of no less quality), so you will stand out with a light, sexy, and unique auroma when you&#x27;re out with with your lady or your friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Polo Blue as been my personal favorite for a long time, but now I&#x27;m a Starwalker guy! Be warned; you WILL get compliments!</li>
            <li> Great price, shipped quick and my hunnie LOVES the scent!</li>
            <li> Great product delivered on time as promised.</li>
            <li> excellent product arrived in good condition and response times were good, the product met the expectations and I recommend it with full responsibility</li>
            <li> meh, just another citrus cologne, nothing WOW about it. Consider versace dreamer, CH by Carolina herrera</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a cologne that women like and not what you think smells good. A female celebrity ask Apollo Ono what he was wearing and this was it. So I gave it a shot. It&#x27;s very light and not overpowering. I can&#x27;t stand cologne that makes your eyes water and smell like a french whore. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> Excellent and good product I recommend it. I like me very much. Perfect. Excellent and good product I recommend it. I like me very much. Perfect</li>
            <li> I wish I could leave negative star. Totally fake. Didn&#x27;t even last few minutes. If I had known I am buying fake I would have not bought it.</li>
            <li> This cologne is not bad, but it&#x27;s not great. It smells like a much cheaper cologne to me. It reminds me of Cool Water. With the price tag, I expected something a little more unique. It&#x27;s a clean subtle smell, but in my view, not worth the price. For comparison, these are colognes I really like: John Varvatos Artisan Black, Paco Rabanne 1 Million, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Chanel Allure, Chanel Egoiste Platinum, Clinque Happy for men.</li>
            <li> Perfect, and very quick delivery. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to do business with this seller. Many thanks!</li>
            <li> Bought this for a Christmas gift. Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> One of My favourites colognes</li>
            <li> This is great fragrance that constantly gets me compliments.  The scent is incredibly similar to Kenneth Cole Black.  This is a great fragrance for a night out.  It is not over powering, if worn well.  It does not take a lot for the scent to come out.  The scent does last well on my skin, I usually get about 8 hours of fragrance on my neck or wrists, assuming I do not wash my hands multiple times. I would recommend this fragrance to any guy at any age.  It would make a great present.</li>
            <li> Colognes are very personal. But I really liked this one. The smell is so strong and masculine. And the product came as expected</li>
            <li> excelente.... recomendado 100 %</li>
            <li> MontBlanc fragrances are excellent and this is no exception. The scent of this perfume is perfect because you can wear day or night. simply Perfect</li>
            <li> This product is excellent meet expectations I had, was delivered on time, their specifications are correct recommend, I recommend this product 100% recommend this seller to be very correct as OFFER</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed in this cologne! I love colognes like Burberry Brit, Bulgari Pour Homme, Jean Paul Gautier Male etc...I really thought Starwalker would be just as impressive as them. Surprise!!! It&#x27;s just a bit below mediocre!!! What little scent there is doesn&#x27;t last a \\&quot;Hot Minute\\&quot;!!! What a waste of money. This is the worst single ( for the little scent there is) cologne I&#x27;ve ever bought!!! I mean it&#x27;s almost non-existent and then disappears within a half an hour!!! Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one if you want to impress \\&quot;yourself\\&quot; or more importantly anyone else!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this fragrance after I checked it out at Macy&#x27;s. I absolutely love how crisp and low key it is. It just smells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this since my best friend gave me a bottle as birthday gift three years ago. This is my third time buying it. Starwalker+ suit and tie&#x3D; a perfect day at work.</li>
            <li> Love this scent and the way it smells on my Fianc&amp;eacute;.  Amazing.  Delivered on time and in perfect condition!</li>
            <li> I rate five stars because i like this product and mont blanc starwalker is the best fragance ever for me</li>
            <li> Smells really good!! Get lots of compliments on this one. Smells a little like pencils to me</li>
            <li> This is definitely a fake. I really can&#x27;t believe how can amazon allow this type of sellers steal our money. I bought this as a present for my dad and i got so embarrassed when he open it up and the fragrance was pure alcohol. Please amazon you should do something about this.</li>
            <li> Smells like i farted and made it into a cologne. very disapointed. bought blind i love othe rmont blanc scents but this ione is horrid. i want a refund .</li>
            <li> nice perfume and good shipping. I like mint blank perfume. it&#x27;s usually take me two months to finish it and order new perfume.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing. Trust me you will not be disappointed</li>
            <li> the product exceeded my expectations</li>
            <li> i love this sprsy.very nice and good smell.i use this sprsy since long time....same quality and smell never feel any difference.</li>
            <li> Seems like the real thing, good price about $15 less than what I was paying at the store. Packaged in original box.</li>
            <li> Is a verry good perfume i always buy it for my husband And he likes it a lot And the price is good</li>
            <li> All it is is pure alcohol</li>
            <li> Nice fragance to use in tha day dued is not that soft,,, but its really nice. liked the smell. Reccommended.</li>
            <li> I am not a cologne guru but I do own a fair collection and this is by far the best cologne I have ever used. If it were food I would eat it, if it was a woman I would marry it and if it could talk it would be my best friend.</li>
            <li> IT WAS REALLY, REALLY GOOD, I WOUL LIKE FUTURES BUYING BECOME GOOD AT THE SAME WAY!!  AND PEOPLE HERE IS RESPONSABLE!!</li>
            <li> I could not be happier with this purchase! Every time I wore it girls would be after me and giving me compliments!</li>
            <li> I have owned just about every popular cologne in the last 15+ years. When I saw this cologne I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be that good. Since Mont Blanc makes a high end pen I thought this cologne was just a way for them to get into the cologne market with a half crappy scent, but I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cologne smells great, and is one of my favorites for the current time. They sell at the mall for $50 or $60 per bottle, so $28 on Amazon is a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say this cologne smells young enough where it will go over well with people between 15 and 30 years old, but is manly enough to easily wear if you are in your 30&#x27;s, 40&#x27;s, or 50&#x27;s, and beyond. Definitely not Brute or Old Spice:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure why but this is the 2nd time I am posting this review. I think the product went out of stock and the original reviews and listing went away, and they started with a new one. Years later its still one of my favorite colognes</li>
            <li> omg I cant believe this cologne smell that great my G love every time I wear this cologne&lt;br /&gt;I wanna purchased more from this brands</li>
            <li> Smells good but it doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> love it really good cologne,my girlfriend love it smells really expensive reasonable price,some high price cologne fades away buy not this one will recommend</li>
            <li> This one does not last long on me but smells fine, I was expecting to be more &amp;#34;long-lasting&amp;#34;, but what I&#x27;m doing right now is applying twice a day!...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Esta loci&amp;oacute;n no dura como esperaba, pero mi soluci&amp;oacute;n es aplic&amp;aacute;rmela dos veces al dia!...</li>
            <li> Cool, one of my favorite.Will by it again.</li>
            <li> Very nice, i love this fresh fragance</li>
            <li> Great price for this great cologne.  Can&#x27;t beat this price for this cologne. One of the best out there. A plus!!</li>
            <li> I always get compliments when I wear this scent.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for 5 years now and it never gets old.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a while n I love it!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for a friend who is very pleased with it. His wife likes it as well. Scent is very &#x27;clean&#x27; and not over powering (provided you use it properly).</li>
            <li> This might be one of my favorite colognes of all time. Mont Blanc always delivers great colognes and I really like this one!</li>
            <li> This is a delightfully masculine scent that I really appreciate.  The packaging is good, and exactly as I had expected.</li>
            <li> Recomiendo al proveedor 100 por ciento. EL perfume huele muy bien y llego como lo exige, me encantaria pedir otro. Venezuela</li>
            <li> Bought this first time from Mont Blanc the store, big mistake as its WAY cheaper to buy it here from Amazon. It smells more serious like it should go with a suit or going out for the evening somewhere fancier than normal. Meaning, I wouldn&#x27;t wear it with shorts and a t-shirt (check out D&amp;G Light Blue for that). So its not super versatile BUT in the right atmosphere and intention its a homerun!</li>
            <li> worst experience,either it was fake or .?????????????????????&lt;br /&gt;when ever i sprayed, fragrance wont last even for few minutes its gone.&lt;br /&gt;One i used before was a gift, and every body asked about this cologne</li>
            <li> Strongly recommended. You will not regret about it. Just buy and realize how true I am. It is worth buying.</li>
            <li> Either this is counterfeit or old. Fragrance lasts almost 5 minutes.  Doesn&#x27;t really matter if it smells good or not if it doesn&#x27;t last</li>
            <li> son loves it...great price!!!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. And excellent products.</li>
            <li> Pretty good !!! The best for me!! Great deal !!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend !!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and very good service, I recommend</li>
            <li> Love the scent - alternate with J.V. Vintage (now discontinued). Hope they continue to make this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I shop on Amazon - if the product is not fulfilled by Amazon, I always am cautious of 3rd Party vendors as some may sell a watered down fragrance and/or completely different product. Luckily, I&#x27;ve never had this issue yet but YMMV</li>
            <li> My cousin had a bottle of this. I love the scent and the ladies do too.</li>
            <li> My husband loves tis perfume. Is very good quality, arrived on time and original. Very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> I bought it to my father two year ago and He liked a lot, HE bought some times after that He commented it is good and that I chose correctly.</li>
            <li> This is a fragance that has been around for a while, it is hard to find some times. It a winner to me has a clean fresh fragance.&lt;br /&gt;You will love it.</li>
            <li> Thank you. no complaints</li>
            <li> The perfume arrived in perfect condition. It is a delicious aroma</li>
            <li> Always my dirst choice cos it&#x27;s not too much to feel your existence. Gently, everyone notices you with a special smell.</li>
            <li> The Eau de Toilette spray is a true favorite .... my friend liked it so much as well, she now has her own bottle. (Yes, it&#x27;s wonderful for women too...).&lt;br /&gt;The only minus was that the packaging looked somewhat &#x27;dirty&#x27;, hence the 4 star.... but all in all a great &#x27;transaction&#x27;. Thank You!</li>
            <li> smelled like 90% alcohol..most likely it turned and was expired</li>
            <li> I own and have owned many colognes including other Mont Blanc fragrances. I do however have to say that this has risen to the top of my list very quickly. It is a light, long lasting scent that I not only enjoy wearing but receive compliments on Often. I work in retail and talk with people Everyday, I have not received so many compliments as I have with this one. Ladies tell me that it&#x27;s a pleasant sexy fragrance, and all this from a cologne that I bought on groupon once on a whim and have been keeping in my personal stock since.</li>
            <li> all well and super good product</li>
            <li> Smells great , I recommend</li>
            <li> I made this rate coz this is the way it should be...</li>
            <li> Excelent product and delivery</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a girl, &amp; I actually smelled it on a guy and needed to have it for myself. That&#x27;s how good it was. Then I was wearing it and my father liked it on me so I gave it to him. Mind you he does not ever wear cologne and does not like many smells.it smells so clean and fresh. I may need to get another bottle for myself.</li>
            <li> First time buying cologne online, but very pleased with the product, and the service. Will definitely will buy similar products.</li>
            <li> very good product.....</li>
            <li> Content with the conditions in which I get this merchandise, despite having a problem with the Hugo Boss that came without the plastic protector I have no negative rate in this article, thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I like it, although it is not that strong. But still, i like it and recommend it to others. I use it every day almost:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New review: just kidding. This is fake!</li>

            <li> Best place to purchase this fragrance is through Amazon. If you like Tommy Bahama original fragrance and like the cedar, sage, spice and flower line, this is for you.</li>

            <li> excellent product,received in excellent conditions higly recommended if u want to BUY IT GO AHEAD its an original perfume .Higly recommended</li>
            <li> This perfume is gorgeous!! I bought to my brother and he loved. The smell is so good and sofisticated.</li>
            <li> excellent product excellent selling very fast and very reliable treatment very good aroma 100% original and this super good price</li>
            <li> Of the Mount Blanc fragrances I have reviewed (Individuel, Presence Cool, and Starwalker), this is my least favorite.  Not a bad fragrance, but nothing to say, \\&quot;wow\\&quot;.  It offers a clean amber scent with hints of fruit and woody/oak to finish.  The staying power or longevity is about 4 hours.  The bottle is cool and well designed with the familiar Mount Blanc logo clearly visible. The price/value is average at slightly over $30 with free shipping.  Amazon does deliver a great product/service.  If you like clean fragrances, cool bottles, and you are a collector - buy it.  It is worth trying... My final evaluation is 4.1 stars out of 5.  Live life and be happy...</li>
            <li> In order to have an original fragance, is much better to purchase directly at the store, this is to cheap to be good.  I got one, but decided not to use it. Pure alcohol.</li>
            <li> all excellent, product was as described, very good, I recommend it 100%, I do not regret having made ​​the purchase.</li>
            <li> it is one of my best scent in cologne... and it only costs me half of the price from the first one i had purchased.</li>
            <li> Awesome gift for my son for father&#x27;s day. He loves it..thank you for quick service.</li>
            <li> pure alcohol or fragrance does not last 25 minutes.The fragrance is sensational had smelled in brazil and is not the same.</li>
            <li> Great Product... I love it</li>
            <li> Just the cologne I wanted. Lasts very long and smells great!&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for the evening outing... Also ordered Mont Blanc Legend, but this one is a lot better</li>
            <li> producto de alta calidad quedo totalmente satisfecho con el recomiendo al vendedor 100% confiable despacho a tiempo todo perfectamente bien</li>
            <li> me encanta el producto es audaz, y existe una gran variedad de aromas que puedes elejir excelente opcion para un regalo</li>
            <li> PRODUCTO IMPECABLE.. ENVIO RAPIDO, 100% RECOMENDADO, GENTE SERIA. LO RECOMIENDO AMPLIAMENTE PARA HACER NEGOCIOS. SON UNA MARAVILLA DE VENDEDORES. PRODUCTO SELLADOS</li>
            <li> A nice smell, not over powering maybe a little weak (questioning quthenticity i matched serial numbers from bottom of bottle to box and they matched) this is something you might have smelled before. IMO it kind of smells like L&#x27;Eau Par Kenzo without the strong lemon/citrus smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance stays close to the skin its nothing that will blow you away yet you will not be overly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a clean semi sweet (not like candy though) masculine smell that you can wear everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sweet yet no fruit, no musk and no powder smell. Just one of those like a softer polo sportish (like kenzo without the lemon)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far...Mont Blanc fragrances are very versatile. Presence,Individual and this one starwalker smell nothing like one another and thats a good thing! Good job by Mont Blanc curious as to what the other fragrances smell like from them (Exceptionnel,Legend)</li>
            <li> Short and simple. It is well worth the money. You get a lot for a simple price and it does WORK!!! I do receive compliments and everyone appreciates it sense.</li>
            <li> I was turned onto this cologne by an ex-girlfriend, who claimed it was the greatest smelling stuff ever created, and made her horny.  Naturally, I purchased it immediately.  This cologne DOES smell amazing, but the smell doesn&#x27;t last whatsoever.  I see a lot of other reviewers saying the same thing.  The smell becomes faint after only about 15 minutes and a few hours later, you don&#x27;t even smell it on you.  I can smell directly where I sprayed, and not get one single hint of the cologne smell.  I have purchased many colognes in my day, but have never bought one for $30+ that ever wore off this quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes me think it&#x27;s fake. That&#x27;s the only logical conclusion I can form.</li>
            <li> Used this for years. Will continue.</li>
            <li> execellent thanks very much congratulation</li>
            <li> I wish that you work the more and more to improve it quality because I find the quality isn&#x27;t anough strong.</li>
            <li> Muy buen producto y llego en perfecto estado. Muchas gracias. Suerte y que sigan vendiendo mucho mas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saludos desde Venezuela</li>
            <li> good night greetings, good seller correct, timely, good product</li>
            <li> I WANT MY MONEY BACK,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOST MY TIME N MY MONEY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DONT WASTE UR MONEY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> Happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> The price is around half what you&#x27;d pay for a good brand name cologne in a dept. store. However, for half the price you get a cologne that is half as strong and much more watery. You can get better for cheaper, the scent is run of the mill.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne aroma for a men. Its soft and acidic.</li>
            <li> Starwalker is absolutely the best smelling cologne ever.  The scent is very fresh, clean and crisp and you can use it year round.  I get the most compliments when I&#x27;m wearing this cologne.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! And I absolutely LOVE LOVE it on my man..... I pounce on him like a cat when he wears it : )</li>
            <li> The product is good quality brand name.&lt;br /&gt;The product I like, I recommend excellent&lt;br /&gt;The product has excellent fragrances varidad</li>
            <li> like this item. it is perfect for a gift and the price is crazy. In another store it would cost more.</li>
            <li> excellent product, no problem or defect</li>
            <li> Love the scent, is soft and unique. My wife loves it and hope to get a replacement when this one is half way.</li>
            <li> I Love this perfume, I used like a gift my husband love It so much he&#x27;s happy and gratefull a lot</li>
            <li> This was recommended to my wife by a guy at the counter at our local outlet mall.  Ever since, I have been wearing it most days.  My wife prefers this over all other choices.  Pleasant and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Fair price, packaged well, and came just as I expected.  No complaints!</li>
            <li> Happened the same as other customer that reviewed on February 16, 2013.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is almost imperceptible, just alcohol with a very soft fragance. It&#x27;s a fake, Beware!</li>
