            <li>Why do companies throw out the good stuff we have used for years and loved, and bring in something new and more expensive, and that we can&#x27;t use?</li>
            <li>Item price was great, but product was a little too greasy for my preference.</li>
            <li>So id heard from a few friends Albolene was a GREAT product to use when trying to lose weight from around your midsection.....</li>

            <li>I like it and the price is certainly right.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it will do</li>
            <li>You can tell the difference after the first use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok for cardio but the real key to seeing results is to follow up with ab exercises to work those abdominal muscles.</li>
            <li>The First Time I Used It</li>
            <li>I have been using it since I was a teen (many years ago).  </li>
            <li>It really works!...</li>
            <li>I have tried other makeup remover products, none work as well as this, even effectively takes off waterproof makeup.</li>
            <li>I use this as a sweat enhancer under my waist belt and it will have you drenching... not sure how good it works on g he makeup remover side..</li>
            <li>I love how this takes of my make up and doesnt dry out my skin</li>
            <li>The ingredients are pure and it is unscented.</li>
            <li>Other than being a small size for the price, it&#x27;s a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>It is a little greasier than I anticipated, but does a nice job of removing makeup.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have to use much</li>
            <li>I am also worried that the it is too greasy and will cause my eyes to retain too much moisture and cause puffiness in the morning.....</li>
            <li>This cleanser really softens your face.</li>
            <li>Thanks for offering it.</li>
            <li>It Came Really Fast</li>
            <li>it makes me sweat so much with my sauna slimming belt and my ann chery workout waist cincher.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t sweat as much on my legs.</li>
            <li>But I am telling you my whole body was DRIPPING in sweat.</li>
            <li>Although it will remove all your make up it leaves you face feeling very greasy.</li>
            <li>When Mary Kay discontinued their very best cleansing cream for my skin, I was desperate.</li>
            <li>moisturize and if used for exercise get rid of water weight fast.</li>
            <li>Really works....great for the skin</li>
            <li>This stuff really makes you sweat while working out....</li>
            <li>This product is unscented which is very important for me because I have to use unscented products due to my allergy to fragrances.</li>
            <li>Maintain soft supple skin and no break outs!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hypoallergenic and softens my skin better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>its less greasy, but abolene is cheap and it does the job!</li>
            <li>I mainly use it on my belly and wrap an workout band around me.</li>
            <li>used for bigger penetrations as we have researched mixed with a water based lube it helps with larger insertions and easy to clean up</li>
            <li>wow didn&#x27;t believed it  but that albolene truly works!!</li>
            <li>so far im 3 inches lost and can see definition in my waist that I have seen in YEARS!!</li>
            <li>was surprised it was a gel, just like Vaseline gel !!</li>
            <li>You can use it to take off your make up, to clean your skin of dirt, for dry skin and to lose weight.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really made me break a sweat more than I usually would.</li>
            <li>It also leaves the skin baby soft!</li>
            <li>I was sweating more than usual.</li>
            <li>I use before bed to clean off make-up and it does leave my skin feeling softer than other creams.</li>
            <li>but I guess that could be the reason why the skin is so soft</li>
            <li>It is not harsh on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and moisturized and removes every trace of make up.</li>
            <li>I use it as a gentle daily cleanser and moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin really soft as well.</li>
            <li>At least it is better than anything in MK&#x27;s inventory for my type of skin.</li>
            <li>It was completely friendly with my make up application everyday.</li>
            <li>But my main use for it is as an aid to extra sweat in the gym.</li>
            <li>This product not only takes all the make up off of my face, it leaves it feeling really soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>it really helps to get other opinions.</li>
            <li>I do not like any of the other the new cleansers.</li>

            <li> I mainly use it on my belly and wrap an workout band around me.</li>
            <li> used for bigger penetrations as we have researched mixed with a water based lube it helps with larger insertions and easy to clean up</li>
            <li> wow didn&#x27;t believed it  but that albolene truly works!!</li>
            <li> so far im 3 inches lost and can see definition in my waist that I have seen in YEARS!!</li>
            <li> was surprised it was a gel, just like Vaseline gel !!</li>
            <li> You can use it to take off your make up, to clean your skin of dirt, for dry skin and to lose weight.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It really made me break a sweat more than I usually would.</li>
            <li> It also leaves the skin baby soft!</li>
            <li> I was sweating more than usual.</li>
            <li> I use before bed to clean off make-up and it does leave my skin feeling softer than other creams.</li>
            <li> but I guess that could be the reason why the skin is so soft</li>
            <li> It is not harsh on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and moisturized and removes every trace of make up.</li>
            <li> I use it as a gentle daily cleanser and moisturizer.</li>

            <li> At least it is better than anything in MK&#x27;s inventory for my type of skin.</li>
            <li> It was completely friendly with my make up application everyday.</li>
            <li> But my main use for it is as an aid to extra sweat in the gym.</li>
            <li> This product not only takes all the make up off of my face, it leaves it feeling really soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> it really helps to get other opinions.</li>
            <li> I do not like any of the other the new cleansers.</li>
            <li> I will purchase again but one jar will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This is  the stuff my mother used long ago.  </li>
            <li> That was strange, I thought.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the secret weapon for actors, who must clean heavy makeup off their faces constantly.</li>
            <li> It arrived earlier than I expected !</li>
            <li> then I do 10 minutes if abs, 10-15 minutes of arms or any other target areas for upper body then squats.</li>
            <li> Makes you drippin wet..</li>
            <li> Not much difference</li>
            <li> My stomach has went down some inches.</li>
            <li> is that it is a little to &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; for my taste</li>
            <li> I was not familiar with this product until I heard a guest on The Doctors recommending it.  </li>
            <li> but I found this to be a bit messy.</li>
            <li> It was reviewed by some as a cream to put on fatty areas of the body to make the area sweat and therefore lose weight.</li>
            <li> During the cold winter months, it&#x27;s the only product that soothes and softens my dry itchy skin.</li>
            <li> It is clear and thick like Vaseline!!!  </li>
            <li> I usually run for 30 minutes on the treadmill</li>
            <li> It removes my eye makeup but leaves behind some oily black smears that I have to wipe off with a wash cloth.  </li>
            <li> The secondary reason I purchased this cream, was for make-up removal.  </li>
            <li> Not really what I expected, but it does make you sweat bad...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like the way it cleanses. This is  the stuff my mother used long ago.  Her skin was wrinkle free well into her 70&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;One drawback is that it is a little to &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; for my taste but I guess that could be the reason why the skin is so soft&lt;br /&gt;after use. I will purchase again but one jar will last a long time.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it will do and you don&#x27;t have to use much</li>
            <li> Use for sweat enhancement while working out. .. does an excellent job!  Under saran wrap or sweat belt, it&#x27;s an amazing addition to your workout session!</li>
            <li> I was expecting a cream and it is not that at all!!  It is clear and thick like Vaseline!!!  I ordered the unscented and it truly is.  It removes my eye makeup but leaves behind some oily black smears that I have to wipe off with a wash cloth.  I am going to continue using it to see if it makes my skin softer like some have mentioned, but only for a week.  I have used DHC cleansing oil and I think I am going back to that.  I am also worried that the it is too greasy and will cause my eyes to retain too much moisture and cause puffiness in the morning.....</li>
            <li> So I purchased this product to use as I exerised along with a waist trimmer.  I recently did this while having a session with my trainer and boy was my waist dripping with sweat when I took it off. I have used the waist trimmer without the albolene and I definitely saw a difference (in sweat).  I am going to continue to use and see if I see a difference in my over all appearance.  The secondary reason I purchased this cream, was for make-up removal.  This definitely works great removing all my eye shadow and eyeliner!!!! and it&#x27;s also moisturizing!!! This product does what it says!!!!</li>
            <li> So glad I brought this! It works wonders!</li>
            <li> if you are using this for weight loss under a belt or whatever i like amilean better. its less greasy, but abolene is cheap and it does the job!</li>
            <li> My mother used this. I am now use it. I have tried other makeup remover products, none work as well as this, even effectively takes off waterproof makeup. I leave your eye area moisturized after use.</li>
            <li> Only took a day to get this item dilivered. It was also wrapped nicely/safely.  Thanks for the great service...</li>
            <li> i tried this product as a test from my sisters experience with this product.  I must say,it works great if you are trying to loose some extra pounds, along with the waist belt, its the best way to trim the xtra fat off your belly during your workout</li>
            <li> Albolene is a wonderful cleanser.  It is not harsh on my skin.  It keeps my skin moist.  The wonderful thing about albolene is it turns to liquid when it touches your warm skin.  It leaves my skin soft and moisturized and removes every trace of make up.</li>
            <li> So I read this article about how this is a great cleaner and lubricant, so I took a chance.  Let me tell you, this stuff is the best sex lube out there.  No oily film, no scent but last forever.  My wife and I use this a lot for those moments when we have just a few minutes, and its awesome.</li>
            <li> This cleanser really softens your face. You can tell the difference after the first use. No moisturizer needed after use.</li>
            <li> I love Albolene - it&#x27;s the secret weapon for actors, who must clean heavy makeup off their faces constantly. The ingredients are pure and it is unscented. I use it as a gentle daily cleanser and moisturizer. I was delighted to find it in the smaller size (so I can travel with it), and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I remember a friend&#x27; mom using this cream and recently I saw Marjorie Harvey suggest using it, so I decided to try it. It arrived earlier than I expected !</li>
            <li> I have used this product for year to take off my makeup using a tissue and then washing my face with water.</li>
            <li> good  stuff  for  firminng and tighting the skin thats loose crazy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been reading others&#x27; reviews on Albolene and so I thought I&#x27;d try it myself. I use before bed to clean off make-up and it does leave my skin feeling softer than other creams. So glad to read reviews before buying . . . it really helps to get other opinions.</li>
            <li> Honestly i cant say i like it wit my waist cincher it irritates my stomach ...i does make u sweat bt dats it ....</li>
            <li> I use this as a sweat enhancer under my waist belt and it will have you drenching... not sure how good it works on g he makeup remover side..</li>
            <li> I sweat a lot using this paired with a Golds Gym waistband. I usually run for 30 minutes on the treadmill then I do 10 minutes if abs, 10-15 minutes of arms or any other target areas for upper body then squats. It&#x27;s ok for cardio but the real key to seeing results is to follow up with ab exercises to work those abdominal muscles.</li>
            <li> Other than being a small size for the price, it&#x27;s a wonderful product. I have been using it since the 60&#x27;s and will continue to do so</li>
            <li> Purchase for an elderly friend. She loves the face cleaner.</li>
            <li> A GREAT cleanser, not greasy! Love the way my skin look &amp; feel after use! Glad I purchased product. I have oily skin, not as oily after use.</li>
            <li> Love it  !  Makes you sweat. great moistureizer.</li>
            <li> Love it, I use it to work out with. I rub some on my waistline, stomach, and back put some Saran Wrap&lt;br /&gt;over it and put in a waist trainer and workout. Talking about sweating, I be drenched in sweat. Love it</li>
            <li> A good light cleanser and skin moisturizer.  Most effective applied on wet skin after washing. Recommended by my dermatologist, who uses it himself.</li>
            <li> Started using Albolene many years ago.  It&#x27;s hypoallergenic and softens my skin better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried. During the cold winter months, it&#x27;s the only product that soothes and softens my dry itchy skin. [[ASIN:B000L1AY3G Albolene, Cleanser Cream Unscented - 6 oz]]</li>
            <li> GOOD STUFF YOU WILL SWEAT UP A STORM WRAPPED IN PLASTIC WRAP!! VERY EFFECTIVE WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO WORK OUT</li>
            <li> Item price was great, but product was a little too greasy for my preference. I will use remaining but probably will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have been using Albolene for years. Love the product. Thanks for offering it.</li>
            <li> This Product Is Excellent And Really Does Work Great. The First Time I Used It I Felt It Working Instantly. It Came Really Fast As Well. The Seller Was Great I Recieved This Product Two Days After It Shipped !!!!</li>
            <li> This product not only takes all the make up off of my face, it leaves it feeling really soft afterwards. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Perfect for removing makeup...</li>
            <li> i bought this after i saw bodynomics recommendtion on youtube, this cream is awesome it makes me sweat so much with my sauna slimming belt and my ann chery workout waist cincher.</li>
            <li> Albolene is an excellent product as a make up remover and cleanser cream.  This product is unscented which is very important for me because I have to use unscented products due to my allergy to fragrances.</li>
            <li> Luv This!!!! Makes you drippin wet..The sweat jus drips of my abs especially wit plastic wrap around it..</li>
            <li> This stuff removes makeup like a pro! It also leaves the skin baby soft! You can use it to produce more sweat when working out but I found this to be a bit messy.</li>
            <li> i love this it is my life line right before i workout i apply this and it really does work make sure to buy....</li>
            <li> Works great for workouts</li>
            <li> I put it on my chest, arms, legs belly, and back. I didn&#x27;t sweat as much on my legs. But I am telling you my whole body was DRIPPING in sweat. It makes your skin really soft as well. I sweat more than I would normally do with a workout. Also before I started working out I was sweating on my arms and face. It&#x27;s really awesome!</li>
            <li> I was not familiar with this product until I heard a guest on The Doctors recommending it.  I like it and the price is certainly right.</li>
            <li> Although it will remove all your make up it leaves you face feeling very greasy.</li>
            <li> It is a little greasier than I anticipated, but does a nice job of removing makeup.</li>
            <li> This is my go to product for taking off make up (especially eye make up).  It is also great in a pinch for moisturizer.</li>
            <li> When Mary Kay discontinued their very best cleansing cream for my skin, I was desperate. Nothing else worked in their line-up, either. I looked at Amazon&#x27;s offerings and found Albolene. It was reviewed by some as a cream to put on fatty areas of the body to make the area sweat and therefore lose weight. That was strange, I thought. I was reading the reviews that said that Albolene was good to take off makeup. I decided to try it for that purpose, and it is a good cleanser. At least it is better than anything in MK&#x27;s inventory for my type of skin. Why do companies throw out the good stuff we have used for years and loved, and bring in something new and more expensive, and that we can&#x27;t use?</li>
            <li> This product works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;You moisturize and if used for exercise get rid of water weight fast.</li>
            <li> I used it to remove makeup, which is effortless. But my main use for it is as an aid to extra sweat in the gym. I don&#x27;t go to the gym without my Albolene Wrap</li>
            <li> I apply this product under my waist trimmer belt, its supposed to help you sweat more, which I haven&#x27;t noticed, but it does help make my waist trainer more comfortable. The product does open pores an works great as a make-up remover. I would recommend simply because it is a multi-use product without any harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have used Mary Kay extra emollient cleansing cream for 23 years. Then the company decided to discontinue it&#x27;s basic line of cosmetics. I found this to be the closest replacement. I do not like any of the other the new cleansers. I have a fragrance allergy and this is very user friendly.</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery. Love the product</li>
            <li> does the trick!! SWEAT!!</li>
            <li> Thanks it work amazing!! I use it for the belly area when working out to burn more sweat in the area! It really work:-) very satisfied</li>
            <li> wow didn&#x27;t believed it  but that albolene truly works!!</li>
            <li> Just like Vasoline--didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> So far so good. All sealed up. I&#x27;ve not used it yet but hopeful it works. I&#x27;ll keep you posted.</li>
            <li> used for bigger penetrations as we have researched mixed with a water based lube it helps with larger insertions and easy to clean up</li>
            <li> It makes you sweat. Love it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful slick lube!</li>
            <li> It is everything it is supposed to be!  It is absorbed easily by the skin.  it has no toxic chemicals in it either.</li>
            <li> I love how this takes of my make up and doesnt dry out my skin I can totally tissue wipe my face then use my foam cleanser for the rest. Maintain soft supple skin and no break outs!!! My skin had hyperpigmantation and acne scaring. It was completely friendly with my make up application everyday. Likes it!</li>
            <li> Really works....great for the skin</li>
            <li> Very pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> Albolene cream is the best makeup remover! ... especially for mascara.  I have been using it since I was a teen (many years ago).  I could not find it in the stores anymore.  I was happy to find it online!</li>
            <li> This is good to use on your whole body... and not expensive. I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> My pores are clearer/smaller, my skin is soooo much softer, and this cleanser is so easy to use! It&#x27;s probably not necessary, but I supplement with an exfoliator once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> It really works!...just add it to any work out and your good.Just be sure to have something covering it because, it can make your clothes feel like there&#x27;s vaseline on it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for workout purposes and it works wonders! I applied some on my stomach and wrapped myself before going for a jog..&lt;br /&gt;It really made me break a sweat more than I usually would. Its original purpose is a makeup remover. It removes my mascara good but I bought this specific container for my workout and it is good</li>
            <li> This stuff really makes you sweat while working out....I mean sweat drips off of you. I mainly use it on my belly and wrap an workout band around me.</li>
            <li> Not really what I expected, but it does make you sweat bad... Got it to keep the moisture to my skin.</li>
            <li> Best product ever when losing weight</li>
            <li> This is a real fat burner,i use it when i exercise and really makes you sweat,i mostly use it on my stomach. My stomach has went down some inches.</li>
            <li> This product can be use for a lot of things I love it. You can use it to take off your make up, to clean your skin of dirt, for dry skin and to lose weight.</li>
            <li> I love this it works well with my waist cincher and made me sweat alot i lost a couple of inches about 2 but i still have mines and would buy some more when i run out</li>
            <li> This is a good product it really does work</li>
            <li> It works, I sweat alot while working out with albolene I became dehydrated</li>
            <li> So id heard from a few friends Albolene was a GREAT product to use when trying to lose weight from around your midsection.....so I will say IT DOES WORK!! it promotes sweating.....and I mean ALOT!! I have a 3 part combo im using though albolene, saran wrap, then a waist trimmer.....so far im 3 inches lost and can see definition in my waist that I have seen in YEARS!! plus its smoothing my skin too :)</li>
            <li> I used it on my stomach to make me sweat more. It worked. I put it on, put saran wrap on, and then my slimming belt. I was sweating more than usual.</li>
            <li> Awesome I lost water weight and sweated every where like never before YESSSSS DEF GOOD TO BUY AND USE !</li>
            <li> Bought it to place on love handles and tummy with neoprene shorts.... Not much difference</li>
            <li> Excellent to smooth around stomach and back prior to working out. (Use with a waist trimmer)</li>
            <li> Works well for ppl who want to lose weight and is a makeup cleanser for ppl who wear a lot of makeup</li>
            <li> I was told this cream worked for the purpose intended.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed actually, It&#x27;s very greasy, has Vaseline texture, uncomfortable, when i bought this ( and i ordered two) based on the reviews, i was so excited to get it, it toke 21 days to be delivered as i sent them to my address in US then it sent back to my current address&lt;br /&gt; ( Tripoli - Libya)  ..At first i though it is a cream .. easy absorbed and gives good feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised it was a gel, just like Vaseline gel !! tried to use it as one of the reviews said to remove makes up and all ... didn&#x27;t work ,, my skin was greasy and so oily ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t know about you ,, but i totally hated it ,,</li>
            <li> It is great for dry skin, and make-up removal</li>
