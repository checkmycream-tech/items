            <li> Works fine. Does not scratch my scalp and almost feels like a scalp massage when shampooing.</li>
            <li> not too hard, not too soft.  does the job - helps remove build up on my scalp.  colors as shown</li>

            <li> Very cheap hard plastic.  Disappointed, wouldn&#x27;t recommend purchasing.</li>
            <li> Bristles  were too sharp.  I threw all three away!</li>
            <li> I used to have one of these years ago...lost it...I have been looking to get these little shampoo brushes again for quite some time now.

            <li> not  hard and not soft.  I like them&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> THIS WORKS REALLYT GOOD ON THE SCALP</li>
            <li> I wanted a scalp brush to try and remedy my flaky scalp. So far these brushes have done nothing for my flakes (not that they claim to). I still use the brush every time I take a shower now. It feels awesome. Since it came in a 3 pack I let my family members use the other brushes and they love them too. I don&#x27;t think I would ever want to go back to just scrubbing my head by hand.</li>
            <li> My Moroccan husband was very very happy I found these for him. Most African men use these and not brushes. Goes well with coconut oil for&lt;br /&gt;African textured hair.</li>
            <li> great for short hair crew cuts,,,been looking for these long time,,,very satisfied</li>
            <li> Love it, great for combing as well as massage.</li>

            <li> not too hard not too soft. - perfect</li>
