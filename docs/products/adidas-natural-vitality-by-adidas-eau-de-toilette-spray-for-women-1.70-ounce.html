            <li>Love the scent; wish it lasted longer!</li>
            <li>cheap quality.. not up to the mark..!!</li>
            <li>I recommend excellent product thanks</li>
            <li>It was a nice smell.</li>
            <li>first lol</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect a sport clothing brand to have such a wonderful perfume</li>
            <li>I Love It.</li>
            <li>good if you is looking for a fresh scent...</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>They seemed to love it.</li>
            <li>I want more</li>
            <li>Bought this for my mom who loved the smell when I first bought it.</li>
            <li>Another Adidas scent - Natural Vitality; it has the nice floral/flowery smell.</li>
            <li>more so I can&#x27;t say much about this one.</li>
            <li>I smelled it also, and thought it was more than decent of a fragrance on a woman.</li>
            <li>great inexpensive everyday fragrance company sent coupons and samples</li>
            <li>I love the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
            <li>I think it more for a teen and gave it to  my friend&#x27;s daughter.</li>
            <li>a good present for my young daughter,smell good,good price and fast shipping...</li>
            <li>The price was low but the perfume wasn&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li>Omg it smelled so nice to be in that small bottle</li>
            <li>Its fresh and clean but the one hitch in the giddyup is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long - I can get Moves for Her and Pure Lightness and Fresh Escape to last more than 7 hours - this scent fades a lot more quickly. :(</li>
            <li>A sporty aroma, but is still able to wear for everyday life uses.</li>
            <li>I am definitely purchasing the other smell and am super excited.</li>
            <li>This fragrance has a sweet, violet fragrance that is not very strong, but is definitely pretty and understated.</li>
            <li>Was very surprised when this was delivered so soon, after ordering.</li>
            <li>but I was proved wrong and was in shock at the amazing smell.</li>

            <li> My only complain is that it that is doesn&#x27;t stay on very long.</li>
            <li> Like other Adidas fragrances, it&#x27;s not an all-day lasting fragrance, but affordable enough to reapply often!</li>
            <li> I guess not staying on to long is expected from an inexpensive body spray.</li>
            <li> but I think I like other fragrances</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an everyday use body spray this is you type.</li>
            <li> I used it as an everyday perfume.</li>
            <li> I bought these for a few of the women in my life for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Not sure what it smelled like gift for random ppl</li>

            <li> The Tube which pumps the perfume does not reach the perfume. Inherent design flaw</li>
            <li> A sporty aroma, but is still able to wear for everyday life uses. I wear this fro a jog out to the gym or a trip to Publix. My only complain is that it that is doesn&#x27;t stay on very long. I guess not staying on to long is expected from an inexpensive body spray.

            <li> I love the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
            <li> Love the scent; wish it lasted longer! After only a couple hours, can&#x27;t even smell it!  Do they make this in a perfume version to last longer?</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter. It was a nice smell. and lasted awhile.</li>
            <li> I had never smelled this Adidas fragrance before.I think it more for a teen and gave it to  my friend&#x27;s daughter. But think they are wonderful to order through as a company. They even sent me to coupon.</li>
