            <li>My skin is super sensitive and I&#x27;ve discovered that aloe vera gel is the best thing to use.</li>
            <li>However, I have been adding some jojoba oil, pure liquid glycerin, and chamomile extract to this aloe, and it has made a good combination for moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out</li>
            <li>This works fine for those purposes, but by itself it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any benefits for my skin.</li>

            <li> I use it everyday as a moisturizer on my skin and as I was using natural aloe to hydrate my face before bed, I also have use this on my face!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but as long as it&#x27;s Aloe Vera belly</li>
            <li> Came out of container easily, no stinging or anything.</li>

            <li> Hey, at least the product isn&#x27;t just chemicals.</li>
            <li> Too bad the aloe is not good enough by itself.  </li>
            <li> It does not leave an oily residue behind.</li>

            <li> The best purchase I&#x27;ve ever had. Never hesitate to buy this one.</li>
            <li> Great product, hands feel great, use it often after I wash my hands at work.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I got it fast!!!! thanks</li>
            <li> My favorite aloe vera gel. I use it everyday on my face!</li>
            <li> Ive tried every aloe vera gel in whole foods and I liked this one the best.I used these on my arms and hands to help  relieve spasms from my tendonitis.</li>
            <li> I use this Aloe gel all over my face and neck as I had an Erythema (radiation) burn around my Thyroid area since 2012. This doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel or scent.</li>
            <li> I have dry, acne prone, sensitive skin ans wanted something all natural to use.  This was not as moisturizing as I had hoped.  However, I have been adding some jojoba oil, pure liquid glycerin, and chamomile extract to this aloe, and it has made a good combination for moisturizing.  Most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out and I have seen great improvement in my skin since I stopped using other moisturizers and started using this mix that I made.  Too bad the aloe is not good enough by itself.  Oh well.</li>
            <li> I love this product. it is so smooth and dry so fast that you skin feel nice after you put it</li>
            <li> It does not leave an oily residue behind. A good moisturizer and helps soothes rash near mouth. Nearly scentless as well</li>
            <li> I have recently been open to natural organic alternatives to lotion, hair gel, insect bites, and sunburns. This aloe Vera gel does it all for me ! I never have any skin problems because the alive Vera gel soothes and replenishes the skin so that it is very soft and smooth. I love this product and works great for my skin. Hey, at least the product isn&#x27;t just chemicals.</li>
            <li> Good product and I like this size and bottle style more than the other style.  I use it as a moisturizer for my legs after shaving.  My skin is super sensitive and I&#x27;ve discovered that aloe vera gel is the best thing to use.</li>
            <li> Great product. Came out of container easily, no stinging or anything. Just instant soothing relief.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but as long as it&#x27;s Aloe Vera belly then there&#x27;s nothing to report.  I keep it in the fridge so it won&#x27;t liquify</li>
            <li> It seems to work well, but I think I want to look for something better. I was looking for a basic aloe vera gel to mix with argan oil in order to make a light lotion. This works fine for those purposes, but by itself it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any benefits for my skin. It dries to a shiny finish and seems slightly irritating. I think will shop for something with fewer ingredients.</li>
            <li> This gel is absolutely magnificent! I use it everyday as a moisturizer on my skin and as I was using natural aloe to hydrate my face before bed, I also have use this on my face! I love it, it has no smell (I get migraines several times per month, so it&#x27;s perfect!).</li>
            <li> I use this product for bed sores to keep moist.  Very organic and it keeps the wound clean and moist.</li>
            <li> The aloe vera gel was exactly what I was looking for. The gel consistency was a good thickness.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face after I shave, also burns &amp; sunburns.  It is as good as I&#x27;ve ever found.  I just stocked up on these, because it seems that whenever I find something that I like, they discontinue it.</li>
            <li> great product, great service. I only wish it came in a smaller box.</li>
            <li> The best aloe vera product I have been able to find.  High quality.  Recommended</li>
            <li> Will purchase again..... perhaps the highest review one can offer?</li>
            <li> I regularly buy this product for all sorts of health and beauty reasons and I love that I can order it online!</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE PUREST AND BEST ALOE VERA GEL I HAVE EVER FOUND. IT CAN BE USED VIRTUALLY ANYWHERE ON THE SKIN SAFELY.  I HAVE LET ALL MY FRIENDS TRY IT, AND THEY ALL AGREE THAT IT&#x27;S A SUPER PRODUCT. THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> excellent service, excellent product!</li>
