            <li>This is simply great soap.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enought great things about this shaving soap.</li>
            <li>I am now a happy camper when it comes to shaving and the cost of blades.</li>
            <li>Great shaving cream I use with my Vision razor</li>
            <li>Great soap.</li>
            <li>The soap is easier to make a consistently great lather every time you shave.</li>
            <li>I also think it smells great.</li>
            <li>Price was great on this Proraso Shaving soap.       </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>

            <li>great  </li>
            <li>This works great</li>
            <li>A great way to wake up in the morning.  </li>
            <li>but Proraso is a great balm all by itself.</li>
            <li>Not too oily and feels great on the skin.  </li>
            <li>This stuff smells great and makes a great lather.</li>
            <li>but this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>GREAT ITEM, AMAZON</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just great.</li>
            <li>product works great.</li>
            <li>It lathers up great with a brush, and it keeps the warmth of the water, which feels great on the face.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great for the price</li>
            <li>Great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a really great product.</li>
            <li>this stuff with a badger brush and a DE blade is the cleanest shave I have ever experienced.  </li>
            <li>Good lather, great scent, great shave.  </li>
            <li>IT SMELLS GREAT AND MAKES A GREAT LATHER, SO MUCH MORE PLEASANT THAN THE GILLETE FOAM SHAVING CREAM!</li>
            <li>Having used the $1.50 puck of soap for a bit longer, then trying the Proraso again, I am much more impressed with the Proraso and have thrown the puck out.</li>
            <li>Proraso has a great eucalyptus scent and it feels good on your face.</li>
            <li>There are so many wonderful things one can say about Proraso.</li>
            <li>This soap is very rich; lathers up real good</li>
            <li>In summation, this provides a great, well protected shave, for a great price, and leaves you feeling clean and smelling great!</li>
            <li>Scent is somewhat soapy, not as pleasant as its menthol and eucalyptus content would suggest, but it is my go-to now that Kiehl&#x27;s product for the brush has been discontinued.</li>
            <li>This soap lathers well and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>, I was very pleased with the soothing feeling it had on the skin, not to mention the great smell.  </li>
            <li>For years I have shaved both in and out of the shower using good quality shaving cream and the best blades available.</li>
            <li>Shaving is just a wonderful treat these days and Prorasso is a huge part of that.</li>
            <li>It is a good soap.</li>
            <li>Maybe if I can find a good deal on it</li>
            <li>I had a good lather in about 1 minute.    </li>
            <li>I think you will be as utterly delighted with the Proraso Shaving Soap as I am.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s works good.</li>
            <li>Lid was cracked but it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>Feels good to shave with it.</li>
            <li>and I have been getting good close shaves with this product.</li>
            <li>While the soaps were good</li>
            <li>This product is good.</li>
            <li>Both good products.</li>
            <li>Anyone know a good alternative?</li>
            <li>I like how the product feels on my face and it helps me get a good shave.</li>
            <li>Aside from that it smells good and works.</li>
            <li>Just as good as everyone says it is.  </li>
            <li>I heard good things about Proraso</li>
            <li>Good Lather  </li>
            <li>Proaso products are the exception, they offer good products at a fair price.</li>
            <li>The lather is quite good -</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t understand why some seem not to have gotten good results.</li>
            <li>The eucalyptus adds so much to a good shaving soap.</li>
            <li>Yes, but I like a good lather.</li>
            <li>Smell is good.</li>
            <li>Target stopped selling Proraso, but buying it online has been a good experience.</li>
            <li>Now, it&#x27;s heaven knowing I&#x27;ve been good to myself before anyone else can get to me that day.</li>
            <li>To add to the greatness that is this soap, I shave my face and head every three days and one container lasted me a good 6 months.</li>
            <li>Recommended to everyone who appreciates a good shave.</li>
            <li>A good tub of Geo.</li>
            <li>Lathers well, smells good, and makes for a good shave.</li>
            <li>Proraso is my go to shaving soap, the cream is just as good.</li>

            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>This soap is great, the scent, the richness, the feeling is outstanding.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also very glad to hear they have changed their look and are soon to launch a SANDALWOOD PRORASO line.  </li>
            <li>Nice scent and good lather.</li>
            <li>It creates a nice lather and feels good against the skin.</li>
            <li>It makes an excellent lather once you get the mix right</li>
            <li>Great lather, great smell, smooth cut, and good for many passes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lather is rich; the smell is extremely pleasant; and it does a great job protecting my skin while shaving.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best shaving product I&#x27;ve tried, it leaves your face feeling great, with almost no irritation/redness.</li>
            <li>Just a tremendously great shaving soap!Tons of lather,lubricates brilliantly without feeling oily, and a wonderfully refreshing fragrance and a mildly bracing finish.</li>
            <li>I like to lather up a rich shaving soap with a good badger brush for a great shave experience.  </li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>That looks like it has changed for the better!</li>
            <li>I will buy more when the day comes!</li>

            <li>Plus, it feels exceptionally refreshing on the face!</li>
            <li>Proraso makes incredible shaving soap products, but the problem with the tub is that it dries out quickly.  </li>
            <li>*feels* amazing.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>It lathers up creamier and has a nice scent to it.  </li>
            <li>This is a great soap that produces a nice lather and a comfortable shave.  </li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t have a nice shaving brush, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter.</li>

            <li>Lathers up nice and gives a close shave.</li>
            <li>Nice shaving soap for use with a quality badger or boar shaving brush.  </li>
            <li>Best of all it really allows you to shave closely and effortlessly.  </li>
            <li>Kind of like Goldilocks...</li>
            <li>After 2 months, i can honestly say i will never even think about buying this again, my face just couldn&#x27;t take it.</li>
            <li>It smells nice</li>
            <li>Nice scent.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll need a shave brush to get a nice lather.</li>
            <li>Using shaving cream with a good brush is by far the best way to shave.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice lather, smells great and leaves my face feeling fresh after a good, close shave.</li>
            <li>&quot; Kind of an estrogen-generated moment, I know.</li>
            <li>Loved it years ago, love it now.  </li>
            <li>This soap leaves my face nice and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>, nice smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If the day turns out to be kind of crappy, it might even be the highlight.</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent.</li>
            <li>The smell is great and clean.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not had any problems taking it on my air travels as well, but that may be because my TSA screeners have been classic shave fans as well :D</li>
            <li>I was using, has a pleasant fragrance without being really noticeable and provides a really great shave.</li>
            <li>It works great when I shave and leaves my skin feeling cool after shaving.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face cool, tingling and smells great.</li>
            <li>This is the best shaving soap I&#x27;ve used, very nice clean fresh non perfume scent and creamy, silky smooth almost Noxzema texture to it.</li>
            <li>My skin feels great, the smell is invigorating and refreshing, the lather smooth, silky and just perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Proraso is really easy to lather up, smells good, and</li>
            <li>Not as good as some and better than many.  </li>
            <li>good skin care, nice comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best lather I have had so far.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t used any aftershave, except my alum block and feel good and smooth.</li>
            <li>AND I REALLY FELT THE NEED TO GET THE WORD OUT ABOUT THIS INCREDIBLE PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best!  </li>
            <li>The menthol is strong and I find it very refreshing.     </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong!  </li>
            <li>Yes, I&#x27;m happy to see this is still the same quality great shaving soap I remember it to be.  </li>
            <li>Lathers up nicely and is very cool on the skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all about finding products that work for you and fine tuning your technique!</li>
            <li>It lasts forever, the container looks cool, it smells good, and is much better for the environment.</li>
            <li>It is good, but dries quickly.</li>
            <li>My brush is 100% pure badger hair, not the best badger or super badger or silver-tip brushes that cost a fortune</li>
            <li>It has a cooling feel, a pleasant menthol scent, and helps a blade slide right over my face.  </li>
            <li>I get a good, close comfortable shave that leaves my face feeling refreshed and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This shave cream is better.  </li>
            <li>A couple of years ago I decided to use shave soap instead of the stuff out of a can, which always irritated my skin, too many chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I received my order of Proraso in the mail yesterday and was able to give it a whirl this morning.</li>
            <li>I have been using canned shaving creams for over thirty years now and have never found one that I was completely satisfied with.</li>
            <li>NOT TO MENTION THIS IS BETTER FOR THE SKIN.</li>
            <li>I put on the proraso and immediately my skin felt better.  </li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t get a better cream out of a can, period.</li>
            <li>I get a much better shave than using the slop in the can.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this stuff-</li>
            <li>We get an excellent and close shave despite the fact that he has terribly coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>There are better soaps, yes, but for the price, Proraso is really a fantastic option!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed at all with the soap, so I went back to cans and gel while sticking with the safety razor.    </li>
            <li>Would prefer more scent and more lather.</li>
            <li>This is simply the greatest shaving soap I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>The brush and soap as opposed to the canned shaving cream makes shaving a much more enjoyable experience and also leaves you with healthier cleaner skin.</li>
            <li>Having tried many brands, including Gillette, Edge and Nivea (my favourite), among others, I was sure I was protecting my face.  </li>
            <li>I made the switch to Proraso shaving soap, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Nice soap, great price and fast, free shipping.  </li>
            <li>Proraso shaving soap works much better for me.</li>
            <li>I soon switched to Proraso in hopes that it would work better for me.  </li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li>and then I go over the top with the shaving soap.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find that the quality is any better than the $1.50 block of soap that I bought so as to have something to compare it to.</li>
            <li>Much better than some mug soap I picked up from a CVS store.</li>
            <li>This stuff comes up much more creamy and lubricating then anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I feel much better after using this product then any of the others I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>This Proraso shaving soap is better - a lot better.  </li>
            <li>I love the slickness of the lather on my beard as the razor glides over my skin</li>
            <li>This stuff is more cost efficient.</li>
            <li>The menthol smell was one of my favorite parts of the morning ritual</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>used Taylor of Bond Lavender before, much easier to create a lather and smells great.</li>
            <li>Significantly better lubrication.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many kinds of shaving soap, from the cheapest to the most pricey.</li>
            <li>I tried this on a lark and really love it.</li>
            <li>The lather wasn&#x27;t any better than my Van Der Hagen pucks.</li>
            <li>Giving 3 stars because the lather was ok.</li>
            <li>I will have to admit, I love this shaving soap.  </li>
            <li>Not my favorite shave cream, but if you want a menthol type there may not be any better offerings.</li>
            <li>but I with it had more lather.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard there are better blades on the Market</li>
            <li>it will be 2-YEARS until I need to buy any more since I change them out once a week.</li>
            <li>Since then there haven&#x27;t been any more hair-loss</li>
            <li>for many months&lt;br /&gt;Cool</li>
            <li>Lather is ok.</li>
            <li>I prefer Geo F Trumper for fragrance, lubricity and lather but you will pay more for it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months and most of the soap is still in the dish; I shave about 4 times per week.</li>
            <li>iv read its more of a manly smell,</li>
            <li>It is refreshing with the Eucalyptus Oil &amp; Menthol.  </li>
            <li>but wow, its incredible.    </li>
            <li>People seem to love this stuff</li>
            <li>But Prorasso is my go to shaving cream and has been for many years.  </li>
            <li>I love this shave soap.</li>
            <li>more \\&quot;creamy.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The more water the better.</li>
            <li>Nice light menthol feel,</li>
            <li>With this shaving soap even just using my cartridge razors I get a much better shave than I ever did using aerosol cans.</li>
            <li>I HAVE USED SO MANY SHAVE CREAMS FROM ARAMIS TO WILLIAMS AND HAVE FOUND \\&quot;PRORASO\\&quot; TO LATHER BETTER THAN ALL OTHERS</li>
            <li>I love Proraso.</li>
            <li>I love the stuff.</li>
            <li>Some lathers seem to make your skin feel like it adds moisture to your skin or makes it feel healthier, for lack of a better word.</li>
            <li>Love this soap.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the scent.  </li>
            <li>Most of the ingredients seem to be ok, as well.  </li>
            <li>I love this Proraso shaving soap.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff and will never use canned shave cream again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better luck with the Trumpers pucks.</li>
            <li>If you use a good double edge razor and shave properly, it&#x27;s great way to start the day.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic buy!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite Shaving Soap.</li>
            <li>It gives me a very fresh feeling after my morning shave, and has an amazing smell which isn&#x27;t overpowering at all.</li>
            <li>It gives me a very fresh feeling after my morning shave, and has an amazing smell which isn&#x27;t overpowering at all.</li>
            <li>Its got a comfortable weight to it, keeps its brilliant chrome finish, and clean up is quick and easy.</li>
            <li>It has a very clean soap smell to it.</li>
            <li>It smells nice-a very clean scent including eucalyptus and menthol.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very clean smell that lingers throughout the day but isn&#x27;t overpowering.  </li>
            <li>This stuff smells amazing, and is cool on your face while you shave.</li>
            <li>It got pretty good reviews</li>
            <li>I have never been able to stand the canned menthol shaving creams because they are always too strong for my skin and would burn it.</li>
            <li>Able to make three passes easily without reloading.</li>
            <li>Works very well and and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>I decided to try the Proraso Soap Cup since I liked their shaving cream so much (the kind that is in the tube).</li>
            <li>Great for softening the face, very soft light fragrance, very smooth shave when used with a quality badger-hair brush.</li>
            <li>This soap from Proraso is good, reliable, lasts a long time, and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>I use a Merker classic razor, a Vulvix pure badger brush; and this soap is the perfect compliment.</li>
            <li>Moreover, it provides for a very comfortable and smooth shave.</li>
            <li>, sometimes I just wash my face with it, even when I am not shaving to get a nice smooth, clean face.</li>
            <li>Just a few swirls with your brush puts enough soap on your brush to create some impressive lather -  and the great scent and incredible tingle of the Eucalyptus oil is pure pleasure.</li>
            <li>With a nicer brush I bet the lathering experience would be even more fantastic.</li>
            <li>It smells great, as did my shaving gels, but with natural ingredients, rather than synthetic chemicals.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s becoming her tradition.  </li>
            <li>If this is how good my face feels using a Gillette Mach5, I can&#x27;t wait to see how it feels like with a real razor.</li>
            <li>If your ready to make the switch to a superior, and cheaper, alternative then check out the products below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like others mention it has a great fragrance to it - menthol and eucalyptus, masculine, and not overly strong.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much on your brush to work up a full face lather and provides a very nice wet shave also protects and coats the skin wonderfully for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I chose the original Proraso shaving soap and pleased I did...</li>
            <li>This soap is, as many other reviewers have pointed out, the perfect balance between clean and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very clean to use, I like the consistency, and it provides great lubrication for a shave which is even more important when using a double edge razor.  </li>
            <li>Lathers extremely easy.  </li>
            <li>This was fulfilled by Amazon, so naturally, very quick shipping.  </li>
            <li>the best shave cream i&#x27;ve ever used, beats anything out of the can, left my face feeling fresh with no razor burns, cuts, or irritation.  </li>
            <li>in.&lt;br /&gt;Second, it lathers quite easily.</li>
            <li>But the eucalyptus scent is just too strong.  </li>
            <li>4 months going strong.</li>
            <li>THIS IS THE FIRST REVIEW OF ANY KIND</li>
            <li>The routine and cool refreshing after shave feeling</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>Makes shaving easy and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to old school shaving and was really impressed with this product.  </li>
            <li>It froths up well, smells great and even has its own little cup to use</li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth this made the razor work.    </li>
            <li>This soap not only helps soften your beard, it feels and smells great too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice scent, I like it, but there&#x27;s just way too much of it.</li>
            <li>Your beard (if you have a goatee or beard that you shave around) will hold this scent for a while after your shave, and that&#x27;s fantastic too).     </li>
            <li>how much is the cream, but I&#x27;ve been loving the ritual of shaving since I bought this.</li>
            <li>smooth shaving with this and</li>
            <li>and I also bought a brush and some cheap shaving soap in cake form from QFC.  </li>
            <li>It really lasts in the tube, nice for travel.</li>
            <li>It puts plenty of buffer between your skin and the razor, and washes off smoothly.</li>
            <li>I bought Proraso shaving soap some time ago as a filler item to bring my order over 25.00 to get free shipping.  </li>
            <li>it shaved so smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Used to use those canned gel&#x27;s filled with ingredients I cannot pronounce.  </li>
            <li>Not only did I get a great lather</li>
            <li>So, the great experiment is done and I will be going back to Proraso shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I gave this five stars because even though it is the only shaving soap I have used up till now, I find it to be of great quality.</li>
            <li>Feels Great on Skin, somewhat tingly initially.  </li>
            <li>There is almost no scent at all, which some people may enjoy</li>
            <li>Overall this has been a great product.</li>
            <li>Great product overall, just saying.</li>
            <li>Enjoy using</li>
            <li>and you could see theseveral light scratches across it.</li>
            <li>gp/product/B000053L6W/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2several light scratches across it.</li>
            <li>Proraso makes fantastic shaving products at affordable prices.  </li>
            <li>-lasting, so it&#x27;s a great value as well.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband along with a nice straight razor and a badger bristle brush and he loves this soap.  </li>
            <li>I have multiple products from Proraso and they are all great.</li>
            <li>This is smooth as silk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use one of the better brands of canned shaving cream which isn&#x27;t inexpensive, and the Proraso gave me a closer, cleaner, and more comfortable shave than my high end canned shaving cream!</li>
            <li>The ultra sensitive is also good.</li>
            <li>This was an unexpected feel good experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I prefer Taylor of old Bond, but this is still a good product.</li>
            <li>Never quite found one that I truly thought was far superior, until now.</li>
            <li>Then I received this for Christmas and it works great, smells great and last for a long time, you only need a little to get a great lather going and don&#x27;t forget to get a good brush too, good investment.  </li>
            <li>The smell is light and clean.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and comes off clean.</li>
            <li>I am very glad I bought this product and will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>I originally paid under $10.00, but it seems to fluctuate between $11 and $14.</li>
            <li>so the end result is quite rich.</li>
            <li>Proraso Shaving Soap works better than anything else I have used for a hot shaving experience.  </li>
            <li>The brush retains heat and I am able to use the Proraso as a hot soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll leave the original review below for the sake of accountability.</li>
            <li>ORIGINAL REVIEW FOLLOWS:  </li>
            <li>I love Speick, but Proraso smells better and possibly shaves better.  </li>
            <li>The one benefit the tub may have is it is travel friendly, not requiring removal during TSA checks at the airport.</li>
            <li>Proraso was my first shaving cream purchase and I enjoyed it,</li>
            <li>and i think its smells refreshing and crisp</li>
            <li>The original Proraso does not dry my face out and the menthol feels good.</li>
            <li>Immediately liked the cover and shaving was like I had put a new blade in my razor</li>
            <li>It has a light, menthol scent that can only be described as a soapy Vick&#x27;s vapor rub (but in a good way, mind you).</li>
            <li>I tried different shaving soaps, foams, and gels - Proraso shaving soap is the best so far.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the menthol smell and tingle, but appreciate that it dissipates fairly quickly and doesn&#x27;t linger.      </li>
            <li>and then I don&#x27;t need another thing to clean or sit on my vanity.  </li>
            <li>Gives you a clean close shave, buy it</li>
            <li>It also rinses clean.</li>
            <li>I went back to the Proraso and noticed all of the differences: the cool feeling as it sits on my face, the remarkably pleasant smell, the moisturized feel of my face after a cold-water rinse.</li>
            <li>Once it arrived I was right!</li>
            <li>Once it arrived I was right!</li>
            <li>In any case, it&#x27;s certainly worth a try by anyone wanting a product that&#x27;s a huge step up from that canned goop.</li>
            <li>This stuff is definitely a huge improvement &amp; well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I found the menthol in this soap to be quite gentle and refreshing to my skin.    </li>
            <li>This is the good stuff, simple as that.</li>
            <li>and  the jar is almost 85% full.  </li>
            <li>Many of the aerosol can shaving foams and gels spew out way too much product for the needed application.</li>
            <li>I admit Proraso is the only mug soap I have tried but for me any type of Nivea from the drug store is superior.</li>
            <li>Feels cool on the face.</li>
            <li>A splash of cool water after the shave</li>
            <li>It lathers up quick, and gives me a clean feeling after I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fresh feeling is incomparable.</li>
            <li>true</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good entry level or low end soap.</li>
            <li>A good basic shaving soap.</li>
            <li>Full disclosure</li>
            <li>Though it lathers nicely and smells good, I think it&#x27;s almost too slick.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my face from drying out and the smell is not bad.</li>
            <li>So I said, there&#x27;s got to be a better way, and I started reading blogs and other sources of information for tips on shaving and in the end getting the best shave possible.</li>
            <li>This soap is fantastic, and provides a clean, refreshing shave, and leaves your skin feeling quite soft.  </li>
            <li>This makes your face feel great - the eucalyptus and menthol give a bit of a tingly, cool sensation without being overpowering and the smell is simple, clean and masculine (no violet fragrance here!!).</li>
            <li>So long as you use the right amount of warm water when working up the Proraso in your shaving mug, it is a more than adequate soap.  </li>
            <li>lathers up quickly, but also seems to get used up rather quickly.</li>
            <li>Overall, it helps give a nice comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>is a super bowl party on your face</li>
            <li>Proraso has a good reputation among wet shavers for providing a smooth, irritation-free shave.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several different shaving soaps and creams, ranging from the excellent Arko to the over-rated (in my opinion)</li>
            <li>This stuff has kind of a harsh synthetic, kind of plasticy smell to it.  </li>
            <li>and I did, several differnt ones, but Proraso is the best I have tried and that&#x27;s why I am coming back Proraso.</li>
            <li>If you like a classic shave, you&#x27;ll love this soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll do a quick douse with Witch Hazel,</li>
            <li>Not only does this soap help provide a more enjoyable, close shave, but it is even cheaper than buying the mainstream shave gels sold today by the likes of Gillette, etc.</li>
            <li>Also, the TOBS lid has to be unscrewed and proraso just pops off quickly</li>
            <li>This was the first time I have used shaving soap and this is better than I expected, I get a close shave, it lathers very well and leaves my face feeling and smelling great.</li>
            <li>It is great if you are using a brush, but it does seem to dry pretty quick.</li>
            <li>I am a first time wet shaver and having just used this soap for the first time, it was incredible.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, for beginners into straight edge shaving I will offer this advise: you must get your badger hair brush nice and wet in order to get a nice lather.</li>
            <li>The very first day this part fell off, it didn’t seat on there, and it wasn&#x27;t glued.</li>
            <li>Been using it now for about a month really have no complaints at all Works just as promised nice shaving soap I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It develops a rich creamy lather, and the mentholation of the soap leaves you feeling awake and refreshed, with a slightly wonderful tingle in your skin (not the horrid burn of alcohol, but the refreshing song of cold mountain water splashed on your face to start your day).  </li>
            <li>The soap responds nicely to whatever type of lather you want to make - more or less water etc.  </li>
            <li>Finally, and to me, probably most importantly, my face feels nice and clean after my shaves, as opposed to slippery, as if there was some residue left over.      </li>
            <li>The menthol and eucalyptus really help cool your face and provide a unique tingle.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to try something new preferably with aloe and menthol but have not been able to find the right product</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d try this over the shaving cream I&#x27;d been using as the convenience of having its own little canister was and is appealing.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say how economical it ends up being.</li>
            <li>Wow, I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li>the price of the upgrade was worth it.</li>
            <li>I rarely post comments.</li>
            <li>For this price, you can do A LOT better.&lt;br /&gt;Taylor of Old Bond Street, and Edwin Jagger are much better products...</li>
            <li>It does not smell nearly as fresh as the cream.</li>
            <li>This is still a great soap, there&#x27;s just no need to have both this AND the Proraso creme in your rotation at the same time as the end results are nearly identical.  </li>
            <li>I shave most of the time with a double edge and some times with a straight razor (weekends, when I have a bit more time).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but for the money I expected more.</li>
            <li>I used it with a Parker silvertip brush (only brush I own) and</li>
            <li>/&gt;After Shave: Virgin Island Bay Rum by Clubman&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tested several types of Aftershave in stores but never found anything I liked.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After Shave: Virgin Island Bay Rum by Clubman&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tested several types of Aftershave in stores but never found anything I liked.</li>
            <li>Feels good, promotes healing and the minimal scent disappears in minutes.</li>
            <li>This soap is how a man should shave and well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>I added this soap on to complete an order and am I glad I did.</li>
            <li>But what is inside is worth it.</li>
            <li>To be honest, it would be nice to speak Italian too, but other than that this soap is fantastic.</li>
            <li>A nice method is to put a bit of hot water in the cup for a few minutes which really warms and loosens the soap up nicely.</li>
            <li>Use the right cream or soap.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right amount of creamy-</li>
            <li>right so it does not run off your face.</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>the right balance for unsurpassed&lt;br /&gt;shaving</li>
            <li>If you get it just right</li>
            <li>It smells crisp, refreshing, and classy as hell too.  </li>
            <li>Many years later now, I have dabbled in english creams and they really are good, as I&#x27;ve said.</li>
            <li>Great price and lasts usually a year.  </li>
            <li>The cool tingle is very refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The lather is not thick or particularly comfortable on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Lathering directly in the tub will obviously become easier as more of the soap is used leaving more space in the tub.  </li>
            <li>But this is 15% better - smoother and a little more lather.  </li>
            <li>It may cost more than what you would pay for a regular soap puck, but I think it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>The soap itself is fairly soft and charges the brush easily.  </li>
            <li>Just about everything listed below was the &amp;#34;highest price&amp;#34; but luckily these items don&#x27;t cost much.</li>
            <li>There is a rim that goes along the bottom that has (or had) a black rubber piece that ran around it to provide a good footing for the Bowl while on a counter.</li>
            <li>I have tried a few different soaps and this one is the best.</li>
            <li>It has menthol in it which really opens the pores for a super close shave.</li>
            <li>He started out with the cheap puck style soap, and didn&#x27;t really like it much.</li>
            <li>Good idea to put the container into another one to avoid making a mess</li>
            <li>I recently go into straight edge shaving and this is the  second shave soap and so far I have been impressed.</li>
            <li>It lathers VERY wells, has a nice masculine scent without being over-powering, and keeps my face feeling soft and fresh.</li>
            <li>This drastically reduces the cost of blades, and I very, very seldom have a cut or nick.</li>
            <li>Its very much just a lubricant for the blade.</li>
            <li>It gets rich and &#x27;peaky&#x27; right away.</li>
            <li>This soap gets a really nice lather pretty easily and has only a faint, pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>Absolutely recommend!</li>
            <li>i love it and use it daily.  </li>
            <li>the higher end of the price spectrum</li>
            <li>This is the first soap I&#x27;ve used for wetshaving</li>
            <li>I like this soap, but it is not that much better than the $3.00 shaving soap pucks I have been buying at my local drug store.</li>
            <li>It last&#x27;s longer and  provides a better shave.</li>
            <li>This will outlast several cans of shaving cream, and is soooo much more luxurious.</li>
            <li>I tried this stuff for the first time several weeks ago and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I use this product with a double blade razor, and I absolutely love this soap.  </li>
            <li>We really do!  </li>
            <li>I like to soak my badge hair brush in a bowl of hot water while I take my shower.</li>
            <li>When I get out, it&#x27;s nice and wet which helps create</li>
            <li>I have found that a traditional soap works better for my razor/blade.</li>
            <li>One week ago I was pretty discouraged</li>
            <li>I bought a tub of Proraso when I first switched to a safety razor.</li>
            <li>but this is my first soap.</li>
            <li>No reason why you shouldn&#x27;t buy this product unless they come out with some certified organic/natural shaving soap! ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not a big problem for most of us, but if you have difficulty using your hands from arthritis or something you might want to try the tube variety instead.  </li>
            <li>This one is only OK.  </li>
            <li>I have been a blade shaver for thirty years and during this time I have use many different shave products.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t if this is fantastic shaving soap, but it&#x27;s clearly a step up from the canned gels I&#x27;ve been using for 30 years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t invest in something like that prior to getting this soap.  </li>
            <li>I add water to my brush and make a light lather directly in the plastic tub that the soap comes in.  </li>
            <li>first thing I noticed about this handle is the quality.</li>
            <li>Where this brush looses a star is because it lost some of its bristles during the first week.</li>
            <li>As my first soap cake, I can say this shaving soap rocks.</li>
            <li>He says he loves it &amp; if it ever runs out, he will definitely be buying more of this brand.</li>
            <li>I got this as my first shaving cream with a DE and brush.</li>
            <li>When I first got the soap it STUNK.</li>
            <li>You almost definitely won&#x27;t ned more than that.</li>
            <li>First.</li>
            <li>It smells and feels refreshing on your face, it&#x27;s especially invigorating in the morning.</li>
            <li>Rinses easy and clean and lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li>Very clean and close shave, minimal irritation and cool filing and scent of eucalypt extract.</li>
            <li>Get yourself a decent shaving brush and move back a few decades to get the best shave you ever had.</li>
            <li>I have been using so many other (also great quality) products lately and suddenly decided to buy another tub of the \\&quot;Good Old PRORASO\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>The wide open top and moist product is remarkably easy to beat into a thick froth, which is ideal.  </li>
            <li>My favorite thus Far. creates a nice lather and slick surface for shaving.</li>
            <li>Also extremely cost effective for those who like me who consider that type of thing.</li>
            <li>The tub is filled to the top, so it&#x27;s tough to lather in the tub but easy to charge your brush and then lather in the bowl.  </li>
            <li>Great lather, and after 3 weeks of use I can hardly tell how much has been used.</li>
            <li>Sure, the price is cheaper from this 3rd party merchant, but who wants to wait two weeks to shave?     </li>
            <li>LEFT MY FACE FEELING FRESH AND SMOOTH.  </li>
            <li>and they all sounded positive.</li>
            <li>I am becoming a big fan of this product.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how much better my shaves were and how long one shaving soap lasted.  </li>
            <li>My razor glides over my face without snagging on hairs and gives me a very close shave on the first pass.  </li>
            <li>When I took up a straight razor to my scrawny neck the first time, this was the recommended shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I can expect to get some burn on my neck as long as I don&#x27;t let it grow for more than 3 days.</li>
            <li>In addition it has a pleasant masculine smell and noted a slight tingle on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really good soap, and I had very few problems with it.</li>
            <li>It works up into a terrific lather, is easy on my skin and LASTS FOREVER.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off getting the tube, which doesn&#x27;t dry out at all.</li>
            <li>Personally, I think that the brush method works better as it get the cream under each whisker and raises it enough for the blade to cut it cleanly.    </li>
            <li>What a tremendous value this offers.</li>
            <li>will certainly be purchasing this soap again, no doubt.</li>
            <li>Pure Badger Shaving Brush with Stand]]</li>
            <li>/&gt;Strongly recommend this to everyone who is shaving old school!&lt;br /&gt;Remember, old school, is true school!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use this every day, I still go to my more tame sandal woods for daily use, and use this just for special occasions when I want to get REALLY close for that Baby Butt Smooth shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, it has it&#x27;s own little tub</li>
            <li>wife loves the smell of this stuff and it stays in the beard (or mostache) for a little while after, giving a nice after-scent.</li>
            <li>: it&#x27;s slick, it feels good on the skin, and it makes a decent lather.  </li>
            <li>I really like Proraso shaving soap.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know what else there is to say about a soap you shave with</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong; it makes a lather that&#x27;s superior to many soaps I&#x27;ve tried, I&#x27;ve just found a few that make a bit better one.  </li>
            <li>but this still applied really well.  </li>
            <li>I had switched to a Merkur straight razor with a badger brush, and saw reviews for this soap online.</li>
            <li>THIS IS THE REAL DEAL, MADE IN FLORENCE ITALY</li>
            <li>just wish the price wouldn&#x27;t fluctuate as much.</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t cut myself very often</li>
            <li>soaps like this match really well to badger brushes-</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for the deal.</li>
            <li>This stuff just doesn&#x27;t work very well for me.  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;m not going to be very wordy.</li>
            <li>It lubricates the surface of the skin very well.</li>
            <li>This product works very well with both of types of razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I really can&#x27;t think of a \\&quot;con.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>This reputation is VERY well-deserved.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not going to do much for sharpness and blade life.  </li>
            <li>I like this soap so much</li>
            <li>It lathers your face very well and it cools your face as you shave.</li>
            <li>Very Refined.  </li>
            <li>Price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only shave soap I really enjoy.</li>
            <li>It rinses off clean and does not dry out your skin.     </li>
            <li>Ready to try a safety razor now.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s really all I can say about it.  </li>
            <li>This soap works very well with my brush</li>
            <li>Lasts much longer than a can of shave cream.</li>
            <li>It feels minty the whole time it&#x27;s on your face like Aqua Velva after shave.</li>
            <li>I was very dissappointed.</li>
            <li>This product charges the brush very well.</li>
            <li>and it really kicks it up a notch.  </li>
            <li>&quot; it&#x27;s just a very old-fashioned smell.</li>
            <li>Not CLOSE to as much as it costs to shave with Mach III Safety razors.</li>
            <li>You can tell its not your basic cheap piece of metal.</li>
            <li>Based on reviews I had a hunch I would really like this.</li>
            <li>Based on reviews I had a hunch I would really like this.</li>
            <li>Proraso products are the best, know wonder those italians have such nice skin, do yourself a favor and treat your face with Proraso, rather than the crap in the can that just drys your face up, i recommend it to all ages</li>
            <li>I do the normal prep after a hot shower, use a badger brush and work up the lather in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>However this is a ton of shave soap and it lathers up really well.</li>
            <li>Too much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it every day for two months and recently have begun using more product just to make more lather and run through it, and I still feel like I&#x27;m only just starting to make a dent in it.</li>
            <li>My husband has become an avowed shaving soap convert thanks to this item.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;ve always used it with a brush, many people simply apply it directly to their skin.</li>
            <li>The only reason I rated it 4 stars is that I ended up liking the Taylor of Old Bond Street a lot better.</li>
            <li>I like it very much, but am on the hunt for a new menthol option.</li>
            <li>Whether you are new to blade shaving, or a seasoned vet, I think you will really like the shave you get with this.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>For someone with not much experience, I was able to get a rich lather without any trouble whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;Third, smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;Fourth</li>
            <li>If you have ever experimented with creams you&#x27;ll know that this one is always consistent and lively.</li>
            <li>B003WR3QSG Escali Pure Badger Shaving Brush]]) and razor ([[ASIN:B000LY2AKI Merkur Model 178 Classic]]).  </li>
            <li>This product is great, it has a bit of a wonky smell, but it works phenomenally, and seems like it should last a long while.</li>
            <li>Also, you only need a dab in order to get a great, foamy, lather, which means that this stuff will last a long time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got an ok shave using this and feather blades, but all the other blades felt like i was pulling out</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also slower to lather than most other creams.</li>
            <li>Better than I expected!</li>
            <li>Originally I bought only one container just to try it out</li>
            <li>My face is left very smooth and not dry at all.  </li>
            <li>On economic efficiency alone, this shaving soap comes highly rated.   </li>
            <li>I enjoy using a hot shaving soap and apply the Proraso with a shaving brush that has been left under hot running water for a short time.</li>
            <li>I will, however, purchase a different  soap for special occasions.</li>
            <li>Long Handled Safety Razor]] and the 2 together work fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Just finished my old soap and tried this today for the first time, and what a delight.  </li>
            <li>The first time I shaved with Proraso, I swear, I said out loud \\</li>
            <li>I tried the Proraso Sensitive Skin version first.  </li>
            <li>I shave everyday and so not only does cans of gillete or other gels get kinda spendy, they aren&#x27;t the best smelling in the world.</li>
            <li>The better the lather, the less chance of getting cuts with razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s half the price of my favorite cream (Mr Taylors).</li>
            <li>I top it all off with a slight brushing of Clubman talc to take the shine off and give my face a smooth, dry feel.  </li>
            <li>, six months ago and it never sheds (I&#x27;m sure it will last for several years)...</li>
            <li>The Omega brand which is similar appears to have bit more lather; either one is a terrific shaving soap.</li>
            <li>Believe me, if you shave using a classic razor and brush -</li>
            <li>My second favorite being the Col Conk Bay Rum and the Van der Hagen coming in last.</li>
            <li>The only con is it doesn&#x27;t lather as quickly as others, but it does the job.</li>
            <li>Great lather from only a small amount on a shaving brush!</li>
            <li>It is very hard to find in Indiana so purchasing it on Amazon is a good value.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this shaving soap.</li>
            <li>Highly  recommend this one or the Omega brand.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This is high quality soap...</li>
            <li>any high end shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>JUST TO HIGH FIVE SOME ITALIANS FOR MAKING THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this or the tube version.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a little pricier but work better in those applications</li>
            <li>A little more effort, but</li>
            <li>I normally have a problem with face sensitivity and ingrown hairs, I started using this in September 2011 and not only have I not had any ingrown hairs, I am still on the first canister!  </li>
            <li>A first time trying shaving soap, hard to make a lather but enjoying experimenting.  </li>
            <li>Dont get me wrong, this stuff is a truly great shave.  </li>
            <li>I, much to my demise, have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Now such happenings are a rare event.   </li>
            <li>When you lather on another layer for a second shave, your freshly shaved skin will say thank you for another layer.</li>
            <li>So I have bought a few more.</li>
            <li>Only drawback is probably price, but it is really worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently switched to DE shaving and tried the drugstore and Walmart soaps with some success.  </li>
            <li>Long story short, I love it.</li>
            <li>Extremely economical though, I have a feeling it will last for a decade.</li>
            <li>I consider myself a man with normal size hands  and don&#x27;t know why this one is considered &amp;</li>
            <li>You only need to put a little on the end of your brush and it will lather up very nicely on your face and will last for 3 passes.    </li>
            <li>I find that it works extremely well with a DE blade, but also works fine with any of the cartridge systems as well.  </li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s so easy to lather up, there&#x27;s plenty left on the brush for a second pass.  </li>
            <li>I bought some other shaving stuff and bought this as well since I could get free shipping.    </li>
            <li>This is a nice soap, produces a good lather, and if you like classically scented soap with a hefty dose of menthol, you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this one.</li>
            <li>I have been a CO Bigelo user for years and decided to try something new.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s definitely new.     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly new to the DE shaving world.  </li>
            <li>I am new to shaving with s safety razor.</li>
            <li>I am new to DE safety razor shaving and decided to try this as a shove soap.</li>
            <li>New formula ruined the scent, though, IMO.  </li>
            <li>But it was such a huge step above anything I had ever tried.</li>
            <li>It does seem to dry out a bit quickly.</li>
            <li>Has a nice invigorating scent that is still subtle.  </li>
            <li>It lathers very well with a brush, the razor just glides over it, the smell reminds me of eucalyptus and menthol, and my face is left feeling very refreshed afterwards.</li>
            <li>This could be because he lathers up more than necessary or because the soap is a bit softer than expected.  </li>
            <li>The shaving cream by itself produces a subtle tingling sensation, and if you apply a thin layer of the pre and post shave cream before you lather up the sensation becomes more intense - a good thing.  </li>
            <li>My wife is very sensitive to smells</li>
            <li>My wife is very sensitive to smells</li>
            <li>Despite the higher cost, the Proraso is fantastic, and with only a few swipes of the brush, it lathers really well.</li>
            <li>too much or too little (you experienced guys know what I mean).</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I was hooked after the first shave and will never go back to those inexpensive soaps again.</li>
            <li>I am buying both the green cup and the sensitive kind also, the white cup, to see the difference.</li>
            <li>You can make great thick lather for a fraction of the price of other soaps.</li>
            <li>My first worry was that it would not last.  </li>
            <li>My first Proraso product will not be my last.</li>
            <li>I recently tried my first container of Proraso, and after learning how to use it correctly I must say this is the finest shave I&#x27;ve had in my 55 years.</li>
            <li>worth buying if you want a serious, but cheap way to enhance your shave.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t judge the new vs the old.  </li>
            <li>I have previously been using the pressurized garbage in the cans with a DE razor that does not protect or feel as smooth as this soap.</li>
            <li>One blade will now last a month (usually a lot longer) or more using this procedure, and I have a very close shave.</li>
            <li>It was a pretty flat finish for chrome</li>
            <li>Being that I&#x27;m a satisfied Proraso customer, I might as well and get something else to try just for the hell of it, because the only valid excuse I could have for not using this soap would be simply to change it up every once in a while.</li>
            <li>a fairly consistent lather and rich menthol smell, but hardly any difference in slickness or thickness</li>
            <li>Furthermore, this small canister goes a long way - and I love not spending money every couple of months on shaving cream!</li>
            <li>I detest shaving, It is very hard to find a good menthol soap,that said Proraso menthol shaving soap is the only shaving soap that I use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very excited to try this with my new Merkur Futur DE Safery Razor which should come in the mail within the next few days.</li>
            <li>and I use less since it is so rich.  </li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s hard to find in stores, I bought in bulk and have been pleasantly satisfied with Proraso.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment on whether a tub would last longer than an equally priced 5oz tube since I&#x27;ve not used enough to make a accurate comparison.    </li>
            <li>But not at anywhere near this price, however.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also got fairly sensitive, so</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>So when it came time to try a soap, this was the natural choice</li>
            <li>I think so far it has lasted me</li>
            <li>Wow, what a difference.  </li>
            <li>I debated between the Proraso shaving soap and the Proraso shaving soap for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I only use the Gillette if I&#x27;m in a real hurry.  </li>
            <li>For years I have felt that I pay way too much for the price of blades; currently using Gillette Fusion blades.</li>
            <li>if you have a really soft bristled badger brush...consider the &#x27;art of shaving&#x27; products instead.  </li>
            <li>WOW...</li>
            <li>It is a soap however and not a cream like Taylor of Old Bond Street.</li>
            <li>When you put the soap on your brush to build up lather in a container or even your hands, the soap enables you to reuse the soap on the brush at least 3 times (for those the do more than 1-2 passes).</li>
            <li>The picture makes it look like a soft cream, but I&#x27;ve used it twice now with no noticeable reduction.  </li>
            <li>I would not waste your time with it however.</li>
            <li>So Far</li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive skin</li>
            <li>And, for a final kicker - it isn&#x27;t very expensive!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My end results were nearly identical to that of the Proraso creme...  </li>
            <li>Like, why do old people smell how they do?</li>
            <li>and i dont get an old chap smell at all.</li>
            <li>I shave with a straight and finish up the last pass with a DE.</li>
            <li>TOBS felt like it lathered thicker, but my blade seemed to shudder across my face instead of gliding like it does with proraso, this resulted in frequent nicks, which I never get otherwise.</li>
            <li>AS THE OLD SAYING GOES</li>
            <li>have used a few different shaving creams, [[ASIN:B000RI8BZQ Proraso Shaving Cream With Eucalyptus Oil &amp; Menthol (5.2 oz.)]] being my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I had to develop a new technique with a wet hot brush worked on to the soaps surface but it payed off this soap</li>
            <li>The stuff in there is great--it&#x27;s not hard, but is like a partially dried cream, so it lathers easily and instantly.</li>
            <li>The soap in the container is not a solid like the other two but more of a semi solid soap.</li>
            <li>right -  how wet vs how soapy I should get my face, I have no complaints.</li>
            <li>and this soap is a huge cut above the other two I have used.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried most other wet shave products and this beats them all.</li>
            <li>You have never used anything like it before, its so cool to your skin its almost cold and its very smooth.</li>
            <li>This is the classic soft Italian shave soap.</li>
            <li>Quality is the same and offers the same consistent lather that I&#x27;ve come to expect.</li>
            <li>It also has a very fresh but subtle smell which I really like.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit off-putting initially, but you get used to it after a while, not to mention that its performance alone makes this minor setback worth putting up with.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely</li>
            <li>my facial Hair(i mainly use derby blades, but tried this with a variety pack).</li>
            <li>I have a buddy that asked if I&#x27;d tried using a brush and soap/cream, but I wasn&#x27;t interested for several months, and then out of the blue, decided to go ahead and give it a shot.  </li>
            <li>The 5.2 oz size lasts almost six months, shaving no less than six days a week.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t complain but I am also fairly new to the whole wet shaving thing.</li>
            <li>Works equally well with new world and old school razors.</li>
            <li>Almost a year for a single canister is definetely worth every penny for daily use.</li>
            <li>I have gotten the occasional razor burn but that appears to be normal with any Double-edged razor.</li>
            <li>This is the first soap I bought when I got into wet shaving.</li>
            <li>I purchased Proraso Shaving Soap [[ASIN:B001RILFDU Proraso Eucalyptus Shaving Soap for Normal Skin 5.2 oz bar]] (5.2 oz) for my husband earlier this year.</li>
            <li>I dont know how long it will last, but definitely less than can of shaving gel, but it is really better.</li>
            <li>This soap doesn&#x27;t have much an odor (good or bad), which I prefer.</li>
            <li>-more cost efficient this 9 dollar container will last twice as long as the 5.2oz 11.00 cream  -MUCH simpler to make a consistent, rich, and creamy lather  CONS: (only one)  -DOES</li>
            <li>The Proraso soothes my face like no other product i&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this in the past and it is one of my top two shaving choices, second only to the \\&quot;Maca</li>
            <li>Less work to get lather right.</li>
            <li>Thick rich lather, with all natural oils to soften beard and condition skin.</li>
            <li>Comes in a decent sized bowl and lasts for a long while!</li>
            <li>I like it in general.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving with this for around three weeks now, and can barely see the level change in the container.     </li>
            <li>The scent is a bit cleaner, but that alone is not worth the higher price.</li>
            <li>I finally gave up, ordered Taylor and old bond street again and threw this stuff in the trash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as if this soap is really just partially solidified creme in a tub.  </li>
            <li>However, it’s a night and day difference compared to those &amp;#34;Safety razors.&amp;#34; It cuts very close with minimal passes.</li>
            <li>I recently began going with the old school shaving methods, and I believe this shaving soap is just splendid.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for a week, and it barely looks like I&#x27;ve scratched the surface.</li>
            <li>and I have barely put a dent in it.</li>
            <li>When I switched back to DE (wet) shaving some months ago, Proraso was the first cream I tried.</li>
            <li>The odor is not bad, but not exactly appealing.  </li>
            <li>Been wet shaving for a couple years, switched to this soap and the first tub lasted nearly 8 months of shaving every single day.</li>
            <li>Luckily I didn&#x27;t, because after a few days whatever was causing the smell dissipated and the actual scent is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was worried I would be opening myself up to more &amp;#34;risk&amp;#34; with these but feel that I am at no more risk than any other safety blade now that I am used to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use much as  I like to shave fast and gravitated back to using my usual edge shaving gel in a can.  </li>
            <li>Those other can foams are like too much bubble bath in the tub.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t lather as much as I&#x27;d hoped, but it&#x27;s dense enough that I can see how it would last a long time if used every day.  </li>
            <li>A little too fresh for me personally.</li>
            <li>This container sells for relatively cheap, I&#x27;ve already had it for about a month, and I anticipate it will last another 5 months at least.</li>
            <li>I tried Taylor of Old Bond Street next, just to try it out - short answer, I&#x27;m tossing it under the counter and just ordered another proraso.</li>
            <li>I swirl the brush in it for a while, add a few drops of hot water to the bowl, then beat it with the brush as if it were egg whites.</li>
            <li>Wow, the lather was so thick and fresh, you can definitely fell the difference.</li>
            <li>This stuff may seem a little \\&quot;pricier\\&quot; than the other shaving soaps but it is worth EVERY PENNY!</li>
            <li>I am new to the world of wet shaving.  </li>
            <li>; all other blades have been very predictable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>My biggest complaint is that it dries out rather quickly on your face if you have a low ambient humidity.</li>
            <li>The product instructions, instead of greedily encouraging you to use up the whole tub in a week, cautions you to use just a little bit, because it goes along way.</li>
            <li>I do not use much of the pre-shaving cream at the time of shaving, only a little bit.</li>
            <li>My one complaint is that after only two uses he seems to have used a little more than I thought he would have.  </li>

            <li> Having used the $1.50 puck of soap for a bit longer, then trying the Proraso again, I am much more impressed with the Proraso and have thrown the puck out.</li>
            <li> Proraso has a great eucalyptus scent and it feels good on your face.</li>
            <li> There are so many wonderful things one can say about Proraso.</li>

            <li> In summation, this provides a great, well protected shave, for a great price, and leaves you feeling clean and smelling great!</li>
            <li> Scent is somewhat soapy, not as pleasant as its menthol and eucalyptus content would suggest, but it is my go-to now that Kiehl&#x27;s product for the brush has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> This soap lathers well and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> , I was very pleased with the soothing feeling it had on the skin, not to mention the great smell.  </li>
            <li> For years I have shaved both in and out of the shower using good quality shaving cream and the best blades available.</li>
            <li> Shaving is just a wonderful treat these days and Prorasso is a huge part of that.</li>
            <li> It is a good soap.</li>
            <li> Maybe if I can find a good deal on it</li>

            <li> To add to the greatness that is this soap, I shave my face and head every three days and one container lasted me a good 6 months.</li>

            <li> This soap leaves my face nice and moisturized.  </li>

            <li> It has a nice scent.</li>
            <li> The smell is great and clean.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had any problems taking it on my air travels as well, but that may be because my TSA screeners have been classic shave fans as well :D</li>
            <li> I was using, has a pleasant fragrance without being really noticeable and provides a really great shave.</li>

            <li> Not as good as some and better than many.  </li>
            <li> good skin care, nice comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best lather I have had so far.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t used any aftershave, except my alum block and feel good and smooth.</li>
            <li> AND I REALLY FELT THE NEED TO GET THE WORD OUT ABOUT THIS INCREDIBLE PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best!  </li>
            <li> The menthol is strong and I find it very refreshing.     </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong!  </li>
            <li> Yes, I&#x27;m happy to see this is still the same quality great shaving soap I remember it to be.  </li>
            <li> Lathers up nicely and is very cool on the skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all about finding products that work for you and fine tuning your technique!</li>
            <li> It lasts forever, the container looks cool, it smells good, and is much better for the environment.</li>
            <li> It is good, but dries quickly.</li>
            <li> My brush is 100% pure badger hair, not the best badger or super badger or silver-tip brushes that cost a fortune</li>
            <li> It has a cooling feel, a pleasant menthol scent, and helps a blade slide right over my face.  </li>
            <li> I get a good, close comfortable shave that leaves my face feeling refreshed and smooth.  </li>
            <li> This shave cream is better.  </li>
            <li> A couple of years ago I decided to use shave soap instead of the stuff out of a can, which always irritated my skin, too many chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I received my order of Proraso in the mail yesterday and was able to give it a whirl this morning.</li>
            <li> I have been using canned shaving creams for over thirty years now and have never found one that I was completely satisfied with.</li>
            <li> NOT TO MENTION THIS IS BETTER FOR THE SKIN.</li>
            <li> I put on the proraso and immediately my skin felt better.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t get a better cream out of a can, period.</li>
            <li> I get a much better shave than using the slop in the can.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this stuff-</li>
            <li> We get an excellent and close shave despite the fact that he has terribly coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> There are better soaps, yes, but for the price, Proraso is really a fantastic option!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed at all with the soap, so I went back to cans and gel while sticking with the safety razor.    </li>
            <li> Would prefer more scent and more lather.</li>
            <li> This is simply the greatest shaving soap I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> The brush and soap as opposed to the canned shaving cream makes shaving a much more enjoyable experience and also leaves you with healthier cleaner skin.</li>
            <li> Having tried many brands, including Gillette, Edge and Nivea (my favourite), among others, I was sure I was protecting my face.  </li>
            <li> I made the switch to Proraso shaving soap, and I love it.  </li>
            <li> Nice soap, great price and fast, free shipping.  </li>
            <li> Proraso shaving soap works much better for me.</li>
            <li> I soon switched to Proraso in hopes that it would work better for me.  </li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li> and then I go over the top with the shaving soap.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find that the quality is any better than the $1.50 block of soap that I bought so as to have something to compare it to.</li>
            <li> Much better than some mug soap I picked up from a CVS store.</li>
            <li> This stuff comes up much more creamy and lubricating then anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I feel much better after using this product then any of the others I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> This Proraso shaving soap is better - a lot better.  </li>
            <li> I love the slickness of the lather on my beard as the razor glides over my skin</li>
            <li> This stuff is more cost efficient.</li>
            <li> The menthol smell was one of my favorite parts of the morning ritual</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> used Taylor of Bond Lavender before, much easier to create a lather and smells great.</li>
            <li> Significantly better lubrication.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many kinds of shaving soap, from the cheapest to the most pricey.</li>
            <li> I tried this on a lark and really love it.</li>
            <li> The lather wasn&#x27;t any better than my Van Der Hagen pucks.</li>
            <li> Giving 3 stars because the lather was ok.</li>
            <li> I will have to admit, I love this shaving soap.  </li>
            <li> Not my favorite shave cream, but if you want a menthol type there may not be any better offerings.</li>
            <li> but I with it had more lather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard there are better blades on the Market</li>
            <li> it will be 2-YEARS until I need to buy any more since I change them out once a week.</li>
            <li> Since then there haven&#x27;t been any more hair-loss</li>
            <li> for many months&lt;br /&gt;Cool</li>
            <li> Lather is ok.</li>
            <li> I prefer Geo F Trumper for fragrance, lubricity and lather but you will pay more for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months and most of the soap is still in the dish; I shave about 4 times per week.</li>
            <li> iv read its more of a manly smell,</li>
            <li> It is refreshing with the Eucalyptus Oil &amp; Menthol.  </li>
            <li> but wow, its incredible.    </li>
            <li> People seem to love this stuff</li>
            <li> But Prorasso is my go to shaving cream and has been for many years.  </li>
            <li> I love this shave soap.</li>
            <li> more \\&quot;creamy.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The more water the better.</li>
            <li> Nice light menthol feel,</li>
            <li> With this shaving soap even just using my cartridge razors I get a much better shave than I ever did using aerosol cans.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED SO MANY SHAVE CREAMS FROM ARAMIS TO WILLIAMS AND HAVE FOUND \\&quot;PRORASO\\&quot; TO LATHER BETTER THAN ALL OTHERS</li>
            <li> I love Proraso.</li>
            <li> I love the stuff.</li>
            <li> Some lathers seem to make your skin feel like it adds moisture to your skin or makes it feel healthier, for lack of a better word.</li>
            <li> Love this soap.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love the scent.  </li>
            <li> Most of the ingredients seem to be ok, as well.  </li>
            <li> I love this Proraso shaving soap.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff and will never use canned shave cream again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better luck with the Trumpers pucks.</li>
            <li> If you use a good double edge razor and shave properly, it&#x27;s great way to start the day.  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic buy!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Shaving Soap.</li>
            <li> It gives me a very fresh feeling after my morning shave, and has an amazing smell which isn&#x27;t overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> It gives me a very fresh feeling after my morning shave, and has an amazing smell which isn&#x27;t overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> Its got a comfortable weight to it, keeps its brilliant chrome finish, and clean up is quick and easy.</li>
            <li> It has a very clean soap smell to it.</li>
            <li> It smells nice-a very clean scent including eucalyptus and menthol.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very clean smell that lingers throughout the day but isn&#x27;t overpowering.  </li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing, and is cool on your face while you shave.</li>
            <li> It got pretty good reviews</li>
            <li> I have never been able to stand the canned menthol shaving creams because they are always too strong for my skin and would burn it.</li>
            <li> Able to make three passes easily without reloading.</li>
            <li> Works very well and and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the Proraso Soap Cup since I liked their shaving cream so much (the kind that is in the tube).</li>
            <li> Great for softening the face, very soft light fragrance, very smooth shave when used with a quality badger-hair brush.</li>
            <li> This soap from Proraso is good, reliable, lasts a long time, and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I use a Merker classic razor, a Vulvix pure badger brush; and this soap is the perfect compliment.</li>
            <li> Moreover, it provides for a very comfortable and smooth shave.</li>
            <li> , sometimes I just wash my face with it, even when I am not shaving to get a nice smooth, clean face.</li>
            <li> Just a few swirls with your brush puts enough soap on your brush to create some impressive lather -  and the great scent and incredible tingle of the Eucalyptus oil is pure pleasure.</li>
            <li> With a nicer brush I bet the lathering experience would be even more fantastic.</li>
            <li> It smells great, as did my shaving gels, but with natural ingredients, rather than synthetic chemicals.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s becoming her tradition.  </li>
            <li> If this is how good my face feels using a Gillette Mach5, I can&#x27;t wait to see how it feels like with a real razor.</li>
            <li> If your ready to make the switch to a superior, and cheaper, alternative then check out the products below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like others mention it has a great fragrance to it - menthol and eucalyptus, masculine, and not overly strong.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take much on your brush to work up a full face lather and provides a very nice wet shave also protects and coats the skin wonderfully for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I chose the original Proraso shaving soap and pleased I did...</li>
            <li> This soap is, as many other reviewers have pointed out, the perfect balance between clean and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very clean to use, I like the consistency, and it provides great lubrication for a shave which is even more important when using a double edge razor.  </li>
            <li> Lathers extremely easy.  </li>
            <li> This was fulfilled by Amazon, so naturally, very quick shipping.  </li>
            <li> the best shave cream i&#x27;ve ever used, beats anything out of the can, left my face feeling fresh with no razor burns, cuts, or irritation.  </li>
            <li> in.&lt;br /&gt;Second, it lathers quite easily.</li>
            <li> But the eucalyptus scent is just too strong.  </li>
            <li> 4 months going strong.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE FIRST REVIEW OF ANY KIND</li>
            <li> The routine and cool refreshing after shave feeling</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> Makes shaving easy and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to old school shaving and was really impressed with this product.  </li>
            <li> It froths up well, smells great and even has its own little cup to use</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth this made the razor work.    </li>
            <li> This soap not only helps soften your beard, it feels and smells great too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice scent, I like it, but there&#x27;s just way too much of it.</li>
            <li> Your beard (if you have a goatee or beard that you shave around) will hold this scent for a while after your shave, and that&#x27;s fantastic too).     </li>
            <li> how much is the cream, but I&#x27;ve been loving the ritual of shaving since I bought this.</li>
            <li> smooth shaving with this and</li>
            <li> and I also bought a brush and some cheap shaving soap in cake form from QFC.  </li>
            <li> It really lasts in the tube, nice for travel.</li>
            <li> It puts plenty of buffer between your skin and the razor, and washes off smoothly.</li>
            <li> I bought Proraso shaving soap some time ago as a filler item to bring my order over 25.00 to get free shipping.  </li>
            <li> it shaved so smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Used to use those canned gel&#x27;s filled with ingredients I cannot pronounce.  </li>
            <li> Not only did I get a great lather</li>
            <li> So, the great experiment is done and I will be going back to Proraso shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I gave this five stars because even though it is the only shaving soap I have used up till now, I find it to be of great quality.</li>
            <li> Feels Great on Skin, somewhat tingly initially.  </li>
            <li> There is almost no scent at all, which some people may enjoy</li>
            <li> Overall this has been a great product.</li>
            <li> Great product overall, just saying.</li>
            <li> Enjoy using</li>
            <li> and you could see theseveral light scratches across it.</li>
            <li> gp/product/B000053L6W/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2several light scratches across it.</li>
            <li> Proraso makes fantastic shaving products at affordable prices.  </li>
            <li> -lasting, so it&#x27;s a great value as well.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband along with a nice straight razor and a badger bristle brush and he loves this soap.  </li>
            <li> I have multiple products from Proraso and they are all great.</li>
            <li> This is smooth as silk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use one of the better brands of canned shaving cream which isn&#x27;t inexpensive, and the Proraso gave me a closer, cleaner, and more comfortable shave than my high end canned shaving cream!</li>
            <li> The ultra sensitive is also good.</li>
            <li> This was an unexpected feel good experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I prefer Taylor of old Bond, but this is still a good product.</li>
            <li> Never quite found one that I truly thought was far superior, until now.</li>
            <li> Then I received this for Christmas and it works great, smells great and last for a long time, you only need a little to get a great lather going and don&#x27;t forget to get a good brush too, good investment.  </li>
            <li> The smell is light and clean.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and comes off clean.</li>
            <li> I am very glad I bought this product and will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> I originally paid under $10.00, but it seems to fluctuate between $11 and $14.</li>
            <li> so the end result is quite rich.</li>
            <li> Proraso Shaving Soap works better than anything else I have used for a hot shaving experience.  </li>
            <li> The brush retains heat and I am able to use the Proraso as a hot soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll leave the original review below for the sake of accountability.</li>
            <li> ORIGINAL REVIEW FOLLOWS:  </li>
            <li> I love Speick, but Proraso smells better and possibly shaves better.  </li>
            <li> The one benefit the tub may have is it is travel friendly, not requiring removal during TSA checks at the airport.</li>
            <li> Proraso was my first shaving cream purchase and I enjoyed it,</li>
            <li> and i think its smells refreshing and crisp</li>
            <li> The original Proraso does not dry my face out and the menthol feels good.</li>
            <li> Immediately liked the cover and shaving was like I had put a new blade in my razor</li>
            <li> It has a light, menthol scent that can only be described as a soapy Vick&#x27;s vapor rub (but in a good way, mind you).</li>
            <li> I tried different shaving soaps, foams, and gels - Proraso shaving soap is the best so far.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the menthol smell and tingle, but appreciate that it dissipates fairly quickly and doesn&#x27;t linger.      </li>
            <li> and then I don&#x27;t need another thing to clean or sit on my vanity.  </li>
            <li> Gives you a clean close shave, buy it</li>
            <li> It also rinses clean.</li>
            <li> I went back to the Proraso and noticed all of the differences: the cool feeling as it sits on my face, the remarkably pleasant smell, the moisturized feel of my face after a cold-water rinse.</li>
            <li> Once it arrived I was right!</li>
            <li> Once it arrived I was right!</li>
            <li> In any case, it&#x27;s certainly worth a try by anyone wanting a product that&#x27;s a huge step up from that canned goop.</li>
            <li> This stuff is definitely a huge improvement &amp; well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I found the menthol in this soap to be quite gentle and refreshing to my skin.    </li>
            <li> This is the good stuff, simple as that.</li>
            <li> and  the jar is almost 85% full.  </li>
            <li> Many of the aerosol can shaving foams and gels spew out way too much product for the needed application.</li>
            <li> I admit Proraso is the only mug soap I have tried but for me any type of Nivea from the drug store is superior.</li>
            <li> Feels cool on the face.</li>
            <li> A splash of cool water after the shave</li>
            <li> It lathers up quick, and gives me a clean feeling after I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fresh feeling is incomparable.</li>
            <li> true</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good entry level or low end soap.</li>
            <li> A good basic shaving soap.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure</li>
            <li> Though it lathers nicely and smells good, I think it&#x27;s almost too slick.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my face from drying out and the smell is not bad.</li>
            <li> So I said, there&#x27;s got to be a better way, and I started reading blogs and other sources of information for tips on shaving and in the end getting the best shave possible.</li>
            <li> This soap is fantastic, and provides a clean, refreshing shave, and leaves your skin feeling quite soft.  </li>
            <li> This makes your face feel great - the eucalyptus and menthol give a bit of a tingly, cool sensation without being overpowering and the smell is simple, clean and masculine (no violet fragrance here!!).</li>
            <li> So long as you use the right amount of warm water when working up the Proraso in your shaving mug, it is a more than adequate soap.  </li>
            <li> lathers up quickly, but also seems to get used up rather quickly.</li>
            <li> Overall, it helps give a nice comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> is a super bowl party on your face</li>
            <li> Proraso has a good reputation among wet shavers for providing a smooth, irritation-free shave.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several different shaving soaps and creams, ranging from the excellent Arko to the over-rated (in my opinion)</li>
            <li> This stuff has kind of a harsh synthetic, kind of plasticy smell to it.  </li>
            <li> and I did, several differnt ones, but Proraso is the best I have tried and that&#x27;s why I am coming back Proraso.</li>
            <li> If you like a classic shave, you&#x27;ll love this soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll do a quick douse with Witch Hazel,</li>
            <li> Not only does this soap help provide a more enjoyable, close shave, but it is even cheaper than buying the mainstream shave gels sold today by the likes of Gillette, etc.</li>
            <li> Also, the TOBS lid has to be unscrewed and proraso just pops off quickly</li>
            <li> This was the first time I have used shaving soap and this is better than I expected, I get a close shave, it lathers very well and leaves my face feeling and smelling great.</li>
            <li> It is great if you are using a brush, but it does seem to dry pretty quick.</li>
            <li> I am a first time wet shaver and having just used this soap for the first time, it was incredible.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, for beginners into straight edge shaving I will offer this advise: you must get your badger hair brush nice and wet in order to get a nice lather.</li>
            <li> The very first day this part fell off, it didn’t seat on there, and it wasn&#x27;t glued.</li>
            <li> Been using it now for about a month really have no complaints at all Works just as promised nice shaving soap I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It develops a rich creamy lather, and the mentholation of the soap leaves you feeling awake and refreshed, with a slightly wonderful tingle in your skin (not the horrid burn of alcohol, but the refreshing song of cold mountain water splashed on your face to start your day).  </li>
            <li> The soap responds nicely to whatever type of lather you want to make - more or less water etc.  </li>
            <li> Finally, and to me, probably most importantly, my face feels nice and clean after my shaves, as opposed to slippery, as if there was some residue left over.      </li>
            <li> The menthol and eucalyptus really help cool your face and provide a unique tingle.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to try something new preferably with aloe and menthol but have not been able to find the right product</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try this over the shaving cream I&#x27;d been using as the convenience of having its own little canister was and is appealing.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say how economical it ends up being.</li>
            <li> Wow, I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li> the price of the upgrade was worth it.</li>
            <li> I rarely post comments.</li>
            <li> For this price, you can do A LOT better.&lt;br /&gt;Taylor of Old Bond Street, and Edwin Jagger are much better products...</li>
            <li> It does not smell nearly as fresh as the cream.</li>
            <li> This is still a great soap, there&#x27;s just no need to have both this AND the Proraso creme in your rotation at the same time as the end results are nearly identical.  </li>
            <li> I shave most of the time with a double edge and some times with a straight razor (weekends, when I have a bit more time).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but for the money I expected more.</li>
            <li> I used it with a Parker silvertip brush (only brush I own) and</li>
            <li> /&gt;After Shave: Virgin Island Bay Rum by Clubman&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tested several types of Aftershave in stores but never found anything I liked.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After Shave: Virgin Island Bay Rum by Clubman&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tested several types of Aftershave in stores but never found anything I liked.</li>
            <li> Feels good, promotes healing and the minimal scent disappears in minutes.</li>
            <li> This soap is how a man should shave and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I added this soap on to complete an order and am I glad I did.</li>
            <li> But what is inside is worth it.</li>
            <li> To be honest, it would be nice to speak Italian too, but other than that this soap is fantastic.</li>
            <li> A nice method is to put a bit of hot water in the cup for a few minutes which really warms and loosens the soap up nicely.</li>
            <li> Use the right cream or soap.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the right amount of creamy-</li>
            <li> right so it does not run off your face.</li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> the right balance for unsurpassed&lt;br /&gt;shaving</li>
            <li> If you get it just right</li>
            <li> It smells crisp, refreshing, and classy as hell too.  </li>
            <li> Many years later now, I have dabbled in english creams and they really are good, as I&#x27;ve said.</li>
            <li> Great price and lasts usually a year.  </li>
            <li> The cool tingle is very refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lather is not thick or particularly comfortable on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Lathering directly in the tub will obviously become easier as more of the soap is used leaving more space in the tub.  </li>
            <li> But this is 15% better - smoother and a little more lather.  </li>
            <li> It may cost more than what you would pay for a regular soap puck, but I think it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> The soap itself is fairly soft and charges the brush easily.  </li>
            <li> Just about everything listed below was the &amp;#34;highest price&amp;#34; but luckily these items don&#x27;t cost much.</li>
            <li> There is a rim that goes along the bottom that has (or had) a black rubber piece that ran around it to provide a good footing for the Bowl while on a counter.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different soaps and this one is the best.</li>
            <li> It has menthol in it which really opens the pores for a super close shave.</li>
            <li> He started out with the cheap puck style soap, and didn&#x27;t really like it much.</li>
            <li> Good idea to put the container into another one to avoid making a mess</li>
            <li> I recently go into straight edge shaving and this is the  second shave soap and so far I have been impressed.</li>
            <li> It lathers VERY wells, has a nice masculine scent without being over-powering, and keeps my face feeling soft and fresh.</li>
            <li> This drastically reduces the cost of blades, and I very, very seldom have a cut or nick.</li>
            <li> Its very much just a lubricant for the blade.</li>
            <li> It gets rich and &#x27;peaky&#x27; right away.</li>
            <li> This soap gets a really nice lather pretty easily and has only a faint, pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Absolutely recommend!</li>
            <li> i love it and use it daily.  </li>
            <li> the higher end of the price spectrum</li>
            <li> This is the first soap I&#x27;ve used for wetshaving</li>
            <li> I like this soap, but it is not that much better than the $3.00 shaving soap pucks I have been buying at my local drug store.</li>
            <li> It last&#x27;s longer and  provides a better shave.</li>
            <li> This will outlast several cans of shaving cream, and is soooo much more luxurious.</li>
            <li> I tried this stuff for the first time several weeks ago and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I use this product with a double blade razor, and I absolutely love this soap.  </li>
            <li> We really do!  </li>
            <li> I like to soak my badge hair brush in a bowl of hot water while I take my shower.</li>
            <li> When I get out, it&#x27;s nice and wet which helps create</li>
            <li> I have found that a traditional soap works better for my razor/blade.</li>
            <li> One week ago I was pretty discouraged</li>
            <li> I bought a tub of Proraso when I first switched to a safety razor.</li>
            <li> but this is my first soap.</li>
            <li> No reason why you shouldn&#x27;t buy this product unless they come out with some certified organic/natural shaving soap! ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not a big problem for most of us, but if you have difficulty using your hands from arthritis or something you might want to try the tube variety instead.  </li>
            <li> This one is only OK.  </li>
            <li> I have been a blade shaver for thirty years and during this time I have use many different shave products.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t if this is fantastic shaving soap, but it&#x27;s clearly a step up from the canned gels I&#x27;ve been using for 30 years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t invest in something like that prior to getting this soap.  </li>
            <li> I add water to my brush and make a light lather directly in the plastic tub that the soap comes in.  </li>
            <li> first thing I noticed about this handle is the quality.</li>
            <li> Where this brush looses a star is because it lost some of its bristles during the first week.</li>
            <li> As my first soap cake, I can say this shaving soap rocks.</li>
            <li> He says he loves it &amp; if it ever runs out, he will definitely be buying more of this brand.</li>
            <li> I got this as my first shaving cream with a DE and brush.</li>
            <li> When I first got the soap it STUNK.</li>
            <li> You almost definitely won&#x27;t ned more than that.</li>
            <li> First.</li>
            <li> It smells and feels refreshing on your face, it&#x27;s especially invigorating in the morning.</li>
            <li> Rinses easy and clean and lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> Very clean and close shave, minimal irritation and cool filing and scent of eucalypt extract.</li>
            <li> Get yourself a decent shaving brush and move back a few decades to get the best shave you ever had.</li>
            <li> I have been using so many other (also great quality) products lately and suddenly decided to buy another tub of the \\&quot;Good Old PRORASO\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The wide open top and moist product is remarkably easy to beat into a thick froth, which is ideal.  </li>
            <li> My favorite thus Far. creates a nice lather and slick surface for shaving.</li>
            <li> Also extremely cost effective for those who like me who consider that type of thing.</li>
            <li> The tub is filled to the top, so it&#x27;s tough to lather in the tub but easy to charge your brush and then lather in the bowl.  </li>
            <li> Great lather, and after 3 weeks of use I can hardly tell how much has been used.</li>
            <li> Sure, the price is cheaper from this 3rd party merchant, but who wants to wait two weeks to shave?     </li>
            <li> LEFT MY FACE FEELING FRESH AND SMOOTH.  </li>
            <li> and they all sounded positive.</li>
            <li> I am becoming a big fan of this product.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how much better my shaves were and how long one shaving soap lasted.  </li>
            <li> My razor glides over my face without snagging on hairs and gives me a very close shave on the first pass.  </li>
            <li> When I took up a straight razor to my scrawny neck the first time, this was the recommended shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I can expect to get some burn on my neck as long as I don&#x27;t let it grow for more than 3 days.</li>
            <li> In addition it has a pleasant masculine smell and noted a slight tingle on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good soap, and I had very few problems with it.</li>
            <li> It works up into a terrific lather, is easy on my skin and LASTS FOREVER.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off getting the tube, which doesn&#x27;t dry out at all.</li>
            <li> Personally, I think that the brush method works better as it get the cream under each whisker and raises it enough for the blade to cut it cleanly.    </li>
            <li> What a tremendous value this offers.</li>
            <li> will certainly be purchasing this soap again, no doubt.</li>
            <li> Pure Badger Shaving Brush with Stand]]</li>
            <li> /&gt;Strongly recommend this to everyone who is shaving old school!&lt;br /&gt;Remember, old school, is true school!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use this every day, I still go to my more tame sandal woods for daily use, and use this just for special occasions when I want to get REALLY close for that Baby Butt Smooth shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, it has it&#x27;s own little tub</li>
            <li> wife loves the smell of this stuff and it stays in the beard (or mostache) for a little while after, giving a nice after-scent.</li>
            <li> : it&#x27;s slick, it feels good on the skin, and it makes a decent lather.  </li>
            <li> I really like Proraso shaving soap.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know what else there is to say about a soap you shave with</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong; it makes a lather that&#x27;s superior to many soaps I&#x27;ve tried, I&#x27;ve just found a few that make a bit better one.  </li>
            <li> but this still applied really well.  </li>
            <li> I had switched to a Merkur straight razor with a badger brush, and saw reviews for this soap online.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE REAL DEAL, MADE IN FLORENCE ITALY</li>
            <li> just wish the price wouldn&#x27;t fluctuate as much.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t cut myself very often</li>
            <li> soaps like this match really well to badger brushes-</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for the deal.</li>
            <li> This stuff just doesn&#x27;t work very well for me.  </li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m not going to be very wordy.</li>
            <li> It lubricates the surface of the skin very well.</li>
            <li> This product works very well with both of types of razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I really can&#x27;t think of a \\&quot;con.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> This reputation is VERY well-deserved.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not going to do much for sharpness and blade life.  </li>
            <li> I like this soap so much</li>
            <li> It lathers your face very well and it cools your face as you shave.</li>
            <li> Very Refined.  </li>
            <li> Price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only shave soap I really enjoy.</li>
            <li> It rinses off clean and does not dry out your skin.     </li>
            <li> Ready to try a safety razor now.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really all I can say about it.  </li>
            <li> This soap works very well with my brush</li>
            <li> Lasts much longer than a can of shave cream.</li>
            <li> It feels minty the whole time it&#x27;s on your face like Aqua Velva after shave.</li>
            <li> I was very dissappointed.</li>
            <li> This product charges the brush very well.</li>
            <li> and it really kicks it up a notch.  </li>
            <li> &quot; it&#x27;s just a very old-fashioned smell.</li>
            <li> Not CLOSE to as much as it costs to shave with Mach III Safety razors.</li>
            <li> You can tell its not your basic cheap piece of metal.</li>
            <li> Based on reviews I had a hunch I would really like this.</li>
            <li> Based on reviews I had a hunch I would really like this.</li>
            <li> Proraso products are the best, know wonder those italians have such nice skin, do yourself a favor and treat your face with Proraso, rather than the crap in the can that just drys your face up, i recommend it to all ages</li>
            <li> I do the normal prep after a hot shower, use a badger brush and work up the lather in a bowl.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> However this is a ton of shave soap and it lathers up really well.</li>
            <li> Too much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every day for two months and recently have begun using more product just to make more lather and run through it, and I still feel like I&#x27;m only just starting to make a dent in it.</li>
            <li> My husband has become an avowed shaving soap convert thanks to this item.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve always used it with a brush, many people simply apply it directly to their skin.</li>
            <li> The only reason I rated it 4 stars is that I ended up liking the Taylor of Old Bond Street a lot better.</li>
            <li> I like it very much, but am on the hunt for a new menthol option.</li>
            <li> Whether you are new to blade shaving, or a seasoned vet, I think you will really like the shave you get with this.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> For someone with not much experience, I was able to get a rich lather without any trouble whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;Third, smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;Fourth</li>
            <li> If you have ever experimented with creams you&#x27;ll know that this one is always consistent and lively.</li>
            <li> B003WR3QSG Escali Pure Badger Shaving Brush]]) and razor ([[ASIN:B000LY2AKI Merkur Model 178 Classic]]).  </li>
            <li> This product is great, it has a bit of a wonky smell, but it works phenomenally, and seems like it should last a long while.</li>
            <li> Also, you only need a dab in order to get a great, foamy, lather, which means that this stuff will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got an ok shave using this and feather blades, but all the other blades felt like i was pulling out</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also slower to lather than most other creams.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected!</li>
            <li> Originally I bought only one container just to try it out</li>
            <li> My face is left very smooth and not dry at all.  </li>
            <li> On economic efficiency alone, this shaving soap comes highly rated.   </li>
            <li> I enjoy using a hot shaving soap and apply the Proraso with a shaving brush that has been left under hot running water for a short time.</li>
            <li> I will, however, purchase a different  soap for special occasions.</li>
            <li> Long Handled Safety Razor]] and the 2 together work fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Just finished my old soap and tried this today for the first time, and what a delight.  </li>
            <li> The first time I shaved with Proraso, I swear, I said out loud \\</li>
            <li> I tried the Proraso Sensitive Skin version first.  </li>
            <li> I shave everyday and so not only does cans of gillete or other gels get kinda spendy, they aren&#x27;t the best smelling in the world.</li>
            <li> The better the lather, the less chance of getting cuts with razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s half the price of my favorite cream (Mr Taylors).</li>
            <li> I top it all off with a slight brushing of Clubman talc to take the shine off and give my face a smooth, dry feel.  </li>
            <li> , six months ago and it never sheds (I&#x27;m sure it will last for several years)...</li>
            <li> The Omega brand which is similar appears to have bit more lather; either one is a terrific shaving soap.</li>
            <li> Believe me, if you shave using a classic razor and brush -</li>
            <li> My second favorite being the Col Conk Bay Rum and the Van der Hagen coming in last.</li>
            <li> The only con is it doesn&#x27;t lather as quickly as others, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> Great lather from only a small amount on a shaving brush!</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find in Indiana so purchasing it on Amazon is a good value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this shaving soap.</li>
            <li> Highly  recommend this one or the Omega brand.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is high quality soap...</li>
            <li> any high end shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> JUST TO HIGH FIVE SOME ITALIANS FOR MAKING THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this or the tube version.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little pricier but work better in those applications</li>
            <li> A little more effort, but</li>
            <li> I normally have a problem with face sensitivity and ingrown hairs, I started using this in September 2011 and not only have I not had any ingrown hairs, I am still on the first canister!  </li>
            <li> A first time trying shaving soap, hard to make a lather but enjoying experimenting.  </li>
            <li> Dont get me wrong, this stuff is a truly great shave.  </li>
            <li> I, much to my demise, have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Now such happenings are a rare event.   </li>
            <li> When you lather on another layer for a second shave, your freshly shaved skin will say thank you for another layer.</li>
            <li> So I have bought a few more.</li>
            <li> Only drawback is probably price, but it is really worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently switched to DE shaving and tried the drugstore and Walmart soaps with some success.  </li>
            <li> Long story short, I love it.</li>
            <li> Extremely economical though, I have a feeling it will last for a decade.</li>
            <li> I consider myself a man with normal size hands  and don&#x27;t know why this one is considered &amp;</li>
            <li> You only need to put a little on the end of your brush and it will lather up very nicely on your face and will last for 3 passes.    </li>
            <li> I find that it works extremely well with a DE blade, but also works fine with any of the cartridge systems as well.  </li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s so easy to lather up, there&#x27;s plenty left on the brush for a second pass.  </li>
            <li> I bought some other shaving stuff and bought this as well since I could get free shipping.    </li>
            <li> This is a nice soap, produces a good lather, and if you like classically scented soap with a hefty dose of menthol, you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this one.</li>
            <li> I have been a CO Bigelo user for years and decided to try something new.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s definitely new.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly new to the DE shaving world.  </li>
            <li> I am new to shaving with s safety razor.</li>
            <li> I am new to DE safety razor shaving and decided to try this as a shove soap.</li>
            <li> New formula ruined the scent, though, IMO.  </li>
            <li> But it was such a huge step above anything I had ever tried.</li>
            <li> It does seem to dry out a bit quickly.</li>
            <li> Has a nice invigorating scent that is still subtle.  </li>
            <li> It lathers very well with a brush, the razor just glides over it, the smell reminds me of eucalyptus and menthol, and my face is left feeling very refreshed afterwards.</li>
            <li> This could be because he lathers up more than necessary or because the soap is a bit softer than expected.  </li>
            <li> The shaving cream by itself produces a subtle tingling sensation, and if you apply a thin layer of the pre and post shave cream before you lather up the sensation becomes more intense - a good thing.  </li>
            <li> My wife is very sensitive to smells</li>
            <li> My wife is very sensitive to smells</li>
            <li> Despite the higher cost, the Proraso is fantastic, and with only a few swipes of the brush, it lathers really well.</li>
            <li> too much or too little (you experienced guys know what I mean).</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I was hooked after the first shave and will never go back to those inexpensive soaps again.</li>
            <li> I am buying both the green cup and the sensitive kind also, the white cup, to see the difference.</li>
            <li> You can make great thick lather for a fraction of the price of other soaps.</li>
            <li> My first worry was that it would not last.  </li>
            <li> My first Proraso product will not be my last.</li>
            <li> I recently tried my first container of Proraso, and after learning how to use it correctly I must say this is the finest shave I&#x27;ve had in my 55 years.</li>
            <li> worth buying if you want a serious, but cheap way to enhance your shave.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t judge the new vs the old.  </li>
            <li> I have previously been using the pressurized garbage in the cans with a DE razor that does not protect or feel as smooth as this soap.</li>
            <li> One blade will now last a month (usually a lot longer) or more using this procedure, and I have a very close shave.</li>
            <li> It was a pretty flat finish for chrome</li>
            <li> Being that I&#x27;m a satisfied Proraso customer, I might as well and get something else to try just for the hell of it, because the only valid excuse I could have for not using this soap would be simply to change it up every once in a while.</li>
            <li> a fairly consistent lather and rich menthol smell, but hardly any difference in slickness or thickness</li>
            <li> Furthermore, this small canister goes a long way - and I love not spending money every couple of months on shaving cream!</li>
            <li> I detest shaving, It is very hard to find a good menthol soap,that said Proraso menthol shaving soap is the only shaving soap that I use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very excited to try this with my new Merkur Futur DE Safery Razor which should come in the mail within the next few days.</li>
            <li> and I use less since it is so rich.  </li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s hard to find in stores, I bought in bulk and have been pleasantly satisfied with Proraso.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on whether a tub would last longer than an equally priced 5oz tube since I&#x27;ve not used enough to make a accurate comparison.    </li>
            <li> But not at anywhere near this price, however.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also got fairly sensitive, so</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> So when it came time to try a soap, this was the natural choice</li>
            <li> I think so far it has lasted me</li>
            <li> Wow, what a difference.  </li>
            <li> I debated between the Proraso shaving soap and the Proraso shaving soap for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I only use the Gillette if I&#x27;m in a real hurry.  </li>
            <li> For years I have felt that I pay way too much for the price of blades; currently using Gillette Fusion blades.</li>
            <li> if you have a really soft bristled badger brush...consider the &#x27;art of shaving&#x27; products instead.  </li>
            <li> WOW...</li>
            <li> It is a soap however and not a cream like Taylor of Old Bond Street.</li>
            <li> When you put the soap on your brush to build up lather in a container or even your hands, the soap enables you to reuse the soap on the brush at least 3 times (for those the do more than 1-2 passes).</li>
            <li> The picture makes it look like a soft cream, but I&#x27;ve used it twice now with no noticeable reduction.  </li>
            <li> I would not waste your time with it however.</li>
            <li> So Far</li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin</li>
            <li> And, for a final kicker - it isn&#x27;t very expensive!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My end results were nearly identical to that of the Proraso creme...  </li>
            <li> Like, why do old people smell how they do?</li>
            <li> and i dont get an old chap smell at all.</li>
            <li> I shave with a straight and finish up the last pass with a DE.</li>
            <li> TOBS felt like it lathered thicker, but my blade seemed to shudder across my face instead of gliding like it does with proraso, this resulted in frequent nicks, which I never get otherwise.</li>
            <li> AS THE OLD SAYING GOES</li>
            <li> have used a few different shaving creams, [[ASIN:B000RI8BZQ Proraso Shaving Cream With Eucalyptus Oil &amp; Menthol (5.2 oz.)]] being my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I had to develop a new technique with a wet hot brush worked on to the soaps surface but it payed off this soap</li>
            <li> The stuff in there is great--it&#x27;s not hard, but is like a partially dried cream, so it lathers easily and instantly.</li>
            <li> The soap in the container is not a solid like the other two but more of a semi solid soap.</li>
            <li> right -  how wet vs how soapy I should get my face, I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> and this soap is a huge cut above the other two I have used.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried most other wet shave products and this beats them all.</li>
            <li> You have never used anything like it before, its so cool to your skin its almost cold and its very smooth.</li>
            <li> This is the classic soft Italian shave soap.</li>
            <li> Quality is the same and offers the same consistent lather that I&#x27;ve come to expect.</li>
            <li> It also has a very fresh but subtle smell which I really like.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit off-putting initially, but you get used to it after a while, not to mention that its performance alone makes this minor setback worth putting up with.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely</li>
            <li> my facial Hair(i mainly use derby blades, but tried this with a variety pack).</li>
            <li> I have a buddy that asked if I&#x27;d tried using a brush and soap/cream, but I wasn&#x27;t interested for several months, and then out of the blue, decided to go ahead and give it a shot.  </li>
            <li> The 5.2 oz size lasts almost six months, shaving no less than six days a week.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t complain but I am also fairly new to the whole wet shaving thing.</li>
            <li> Works equally well with new world and old school razors.</li>
            <li> Almost a year for a single canister is definetely worth every penny for daily use.</li>
            <li> I have gotten the occasional razor burn but that appears to be normal with any Double-edged razor.</li>
            <li> This is the first soap I bought when I got into wet shaving.</li>
            <li> I purchased Proraso Shaving Soap [[ASIN:B001RILFDU Proraso Eucalyptus Shaving Soap for Normal Skin 5.2 oz bar]] (5.2 oz) for my husband earlier this year.</li>
            <li> I dont know how long it will last, but definitely less than can of shaving gel, but it is really better.</li>
            <li> This soap doesn&#x27;t have much an odor (good or bad), which I prefer.</li>
            <li> -more cost efficient this 9 dollar container will last twice as long as the 5.2oz 11.00 cream  -MUCH simpler to make a consistent, rich, and creamy lather  CONS: (only one)  -DOES</li>
            <li> The Proraso soothes my face like no other product i&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this in the past and it is one of my top two shaving choices, second only to the \\&quot;Maca</li>
            <li> Less work to get lather right.</li>
            <li> Thick rich lather, with all natural oils to soften beard and condition skin.</li>
            <li> Comes in a decent sized bowl and lasts for a long while!</li>
            <li> I like it in general.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with this for around three weeks now, and can barely see the level change in the container.     </li>
            <li> The scent is a bit cleaner, but that alone is not worth the higher price.</li>
            <li> I finally gave up, ordered Taylor and old bond street again and threw this stuff in the trash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as if this soap is really just partially solidified creme in a tub.  </li>
            <li> However, it’s a night and day difference compared to those &amp;#34;Safety razors.&amp;#34; It cuts very close with minimal passes.</li>
            <li> I recently began going with the old school shaving methods, and I believe this shaving soap is just splendid.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a week, and it barely looks like I&#x27;ve scratched the surface.</li>
            <li> and I have barely put a dent in it.</li>
            <li> When I switched back to DE (wet) shaving some months ago, Proraso was the first cream I tried.</li>
            <li> The odor is not bad, but not exactly appealing.  </li>
            <li> Been wet shaving for a couple years, switched to this soap and the first tub lasted nearly 8 months of shaving every single day.</li>
            <li> Luckily I didn&#x27;t, because after a few days whatever was causing the smell dissipated and the actual scent is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was worried I would be opening myself up to more &amp;#34;risk&amp;#34; with these but feel that I am at no more risk than any other safety blade now that I am used to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use much as  I like to shave fast and gravitated back to using my usual edge shaving gel in a can.  </li>
            <li> Those other can foams are like too much bubble bath in the tub.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t lather as much as I&#x27;d hoped, but it&#x27;s dense enough that I can see how it would last a long time if used every day.  </li>
            <li> A little too fresh for me personally.</li>
            <li> This container sells for relatively cheap, I&#x27;ve already had it for about a month, and I anticipate it will last another 5 months at least.</li>
            <li> I tried Taylor of Old Bond Street next, just to try it out - short answer, I&#x27;m tossing it under the counter and just ordered another proraso.</li>
            <li> I swirl the brush in it for a while, add a few drops of hot water to the bowl, then beat it with the brush as if it were egg whites.</li>
            <li> Wow, the lather was so thick and fresh, you can definitely fell the difference.</li>
            <li> This stuff may seem a little \\&quot;pricier\\&quot; than the other shaving soaps but it is worth EVERY PENNY!</li>
            <li> I am new to the world of wet shaving.  </li>
            <li> ; all other blades have been very predictable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is that it dries out rather quickly on your face if you have a low ambient humidity.</li>
            <li> The product instructions, instead of greedily encouraging you to use up the whole tub in a week, cautions you to use just a little bit, because it goes along way.</li>
            <li> I do not use much of the pre-shaving cream at the time of shaving, only a little bit.</li>
            <li> My one complaint is that after only two uses he seems to have used a little more than I thought he would have.  </li>
            <li> With the cream it is sometimes difficult to make that fine, rich, and thick lather without adding</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other products over that time, and for a well above average shave (and feel), none have been as consistent as the Proraso line.  </li>
            <li> Usually I shave every other day unless something really special comes along.</li>
            <li> (this seems like a small thing, but I&#x27;m in the military, I don&#x27;t sleep much, and I shave at stupidly early hours of the morning</li>
            <li> As for the actual shave, I&#x27;m not sure how much of it is my razor and</li>
            <li> - I think I may have used slightly too much water so be careful.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used a DE razor I cut myself at least 10 times.  </li>
            <li> Both of the PRORSO items last a long time.</li>
            <li> This tub will last a long while.     </li>
            <li> Given that amount you can see why this will last so long.</li>
            <li> Instead of asking myself how long this is going to last, I find myself asking the question of \\&quot;When</li>
            <li> The razor burn I typically get was nearly eliminated with the Proraso Shaving Soap.    </li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t enough menthol to feel on the skin and the smell was unfortunate, like a cheap hand soap.  </li>
            <li> Previously used Old Bond, and decided to make the switch to Proraso to save $.</li>
            <li> Using this method - a tub will last a long, long time.</li>
            <li> It does last that long as long as you don&#x27;t hold it under the faucet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After being a loyal Art of Shaving shaving cream user the past few years, I decided to take a leap and see what all the craze was about with Proraso.</li>
            <li> Finally tired of the high cost of today&#x27;s cartridge razors, I went old school with the DE safety razor.</li>
            <li> only warning to prospective buyers is that it very much is a soap--it leaves behind that \\&quot;soap\\&quot; feeling on your skin that some shaving creams don&#x27;t, and you might have to wash your face a bunch of times to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> (along with a brush a DE safety razor) I was skeptical at first because this wasn&#x27;t like anything I had used before, but my expectations were far exceeded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am almost 70 and have been shaving for a long time.  </li>
            <li> This one&#x27;s relegated to permanent \\&quot;backup\\&quot; status for as long as it stays in my drawer.</li>
            <li> If not, just open it before you start getting wet</li>
            <li> I recently started wet shaving.  </li>
            <li> Still getting used to water to product ratio and how long to mix the product in a ceramic bowl to get lather</li>
            <li> Long Handled Safety Razor.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I am using a merkur model 180 long handle and a variety of blades.  </li>
            <li> it lasts exceptionally long.  </li>
            <li> I use merkur 180 long handle with this shave cream and it is def.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s going to be a long while to wait.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Smells similar to wet cardboard now.  </li>
            <li> It lathers up into a thick, lustrous mixture that coats and softens whiskers and allows for a really close shave without scalping your face.  </li>
            <li> It has been about 4 months and there is probably about 75% of it left, with shaving being every other week or so.</li>
            <li> The next star was lost due to finish.</li>
            <li> He shaves every other, or every third day.</li>
            <li> I have a very thick beard and shaving against the grain left me with a very irritated face.     </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean to be ageist or rude, and it&#x27;s a fine shaving soap, but you might want to smell this stuff before ordering.</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry either.</li>
            <li> pat dry then use an alum block.</li>
            <li> I would imagine that one container might last me a year, and I shave five days a week with heavy daily growth.  </li>
            <li> and I ended up burning through a nice size jar of expensive shave soap in one-month when it should have lasted me at least six months.  </li>
            <li> The menthol provides a mild anesthetic effect, so even if you get clumsy and cut yourself, it almost never hurts and cleans up nicely, usually clotting invisibly by the time you&#x27;re done shaving.</li>
            <li> It all comes down to three key points:    1)</li>
            <li> I have used very little soap in this time, so I feel this $10 investment might be the only shave soap I will need to buy for the entire year.</li>
            <li> Others have complained about a new formula, but I have no complaints.  </li>
            <li> I used an old Mach III blade and expected to come away with some razor burn as usual</li>
            <li> and I use them when I want something a little different</li>
            <li> But that was the learning curve I expected.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no comparison between this product, and those canned gels and foams you get at the store.  </li>
            <li> FOR  NOT DISCOVERING THIS, AND WET SHAVING WITH A DE RAZOR SOONER.  </li>
            <li> I have been shaving almost exclusively with Speick for the last few months.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Remember - no need to swirl and swirl - just a few strokes puts enough on the brush - work the lather up on your face!</li>
            <li> I have been wet shaving for about a year now</li>
            <li> Shaving everyday requires a product that not only protects skin, but hydrates as well.  </li>
            <li> only criticism I could give would be that the container is slick and can be a bit hard to open - especially with wet hands.  </li>
            <li> The dish lathers easier with less product, so a tub like this lasts twice as long for me.</li>
            <li> I usually wet the brush, swirl, then take it to my other bowl and work the lather.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to convey just how long this pot of soap will last you,</li>
            <li> but I see that the soap is going to last me at least twice as long as the tube of cream.</li>
            <li> I have to shave half my face then reapply to the rest because it is dry by then.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for about a month and shave every other day and it doesn&#x27;t even seem like I am making a dent in this product.</li>
            <li> I am just now using up the last of the soap - meaning that over the past 10 months one container of shaving soap has seen me through about 3 to 4 shaves per week.</li>
            <li> I recommend the other flavors without hesitation.  </li>
            <li> I give the other, subtler scents 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I almost wish that my hair grew faster so that I could shave every day instead of every other day.  </li>
            <li> The other bonus about this soap is the smell.  </li>
            <li> I may experiment with other shaving soaps just because I have nothing to compare this too</li>
            <li> It gave me an extremely close shave the Menthol help to reduce razor burn and it lasted quite a while too.</li>
            <li> Other than one &amp;#34;Dud&amp;#34</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll likely last a year (at least)!</li>
            <li> You use only a small bit every shave and the 5.2 oz seems like it never goes away.</li>
            <li> It also allows for a closer shave than other gels or foams.  </li>
            <li> I bought this soap when I switched to a DE razor, and it performs leaps and bounds beyond any other shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> I shave every other day (3 passes), and in two months I haven&#x27;t used but a fifth of the product.  </li>
            <li> I am not going to pay for any other brand than Proraso.</li>
            <li> It has also lasted me quite a while, compared to some other products.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a subtle masculine scent that stays with him, just a little.  </li>
            <li> I tried another brand of shave soap before buying the Proraso, and my sensitive skin / tough beard combo weren&#x27;t coming out as I&#x27;d hoped, but once I switched.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find Proraso Shaving Soap locally, but I prefer it to their shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> I like the container except it is a bit hard to open at times.</li>
            <li> This soap is just average.  </li>
            <li> The texture is also terrible, it doesn&#x27;t formulate a good lather.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was let down.  </li>
            <li> Start out with about a dime sized amount and work your way DOWN from there.  </li>
            <li> and it gets watered down and runs.</li>
            <li> The soap has a subtle but masculine scent, a &#x27;cooling&#x27; like feeling on my skin that almost tingles a bit, and puts a really slick barrier between my face and the razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the typical shaving gel \\&quot;goop\\&quot;, that comes from a can for about 10 years now, alongside my cartridge based razors.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half Filipino</li>
            <li> This was the soap I started with when I got into DE shaving a year and a half ago.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend 2 years ago &amp; he still has probably half the container.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even used half of it.</li>
            <li> Paying $9 for shaving cream seemed a bit high, but I&#x27;ve since learned that it&#x27;s one of the less expensive \\&quot;premium\\&quot; brands.    </li>
            <li> The menthol provides an intoxicatingly crisp coolness with the cold rinse after the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes me want to use the after-shave lotion, too, but that stuff&#x27;s still a little pricey.  </li>
            <li> I was getting a little scruffy).  </li>
            <li> I bought a little tub of this stuff in Rome in 2004.  </li>
            <li> Just takes a little practice.</li>
            <li> Even with drying the blade, it was of little help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a little easier on my skin in the colder months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a little over a month now</li>
            <li> And I was just awestruck about just how little you need.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE DAB WILL DO YOU.</li>
            <li> Too little</li>
            <li> Note, there is no strong or bad after smell, only a very soft face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll rinse with cold water and man that is when the real spark of Proraso goes to work.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a few weeks and can say that it is all it was advertised to be.  </li>
            <li> I found that one container lasts a few months, so even @</li>
            <li> and I had to use a gel for a few days.</li>
            <li> After a few shaves I chucked the Proraso, mug and brush in the trash</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every few days for over a year now</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t use it everyday, I use it about once a week.</li>
            <li> A few swipes or swishes in the bowl will do it to fill up my brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get the closest shaves and don&#x27;t have to worry about messy gels and cans.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky, messy, stinky or greasy.</li>
            <li> I often sit my man down to shave him as a small luxury a woman can do for a man.  </li>
            <li> I have also been unhappy with canned shaving creams because the cans don&#x27;t seem to last that long for me.</li>
            <li> You can use your hand, but I found using a small bowl works a little better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After several years of using the less expensive shave soaps, I decided to splurge on this soap.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that initially, because of the contents in the soap, your face is going to feel cold while applying the soap, as if it had mint extracts in it.</li>
            <li> for the past few months.  </li>
            <li> Due to the eucalyptus and mentol, after the shave you get a terrific cooling sensation (after splashing on a little cold water).</li>
            <li> These blades are very expensive and might have lasted me a week before becoming uncomfortable to use; the friction strip would deteriorate.</li>
            <li> the four blade systems will be a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> I will start by saying that I&#x27;ve wasted at least 20 years of my life using the canned stuff (gels and creams), along with the 2, 3, 4 and 5 blade abominations.</li>
            <li> I usually spend a bit longer than people I see on youtube charging the brush-</li>
            <li> I am doing this to perhaps be of help to those who share my past problem; now solved.</li>
            <li> I usually do about 3-5 passes with my razor and don&#x27;t have to re-soap my brush at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got the tips of my brush coated well and took a small amount of water in to my lather dish.  </li>
            <li> Used with a badger brush, I am not sure when this stuff will run out.</li>
            <li> : Not sure why its made of &amp;#34;Badger&amp;#34; hair but its working.</li>
            <li> However, the scent does take some getting used to and it does tend to \\&quot;wake up\\&quot; my skin a bit, which I&#x27;m not sure I like.    </li>
            <li> I have never felt anything so slick on my face.    </li>
            <li> Proraso is very messy and the cream went all over the sides of the container and onto the counter.</li>
            <li> It is a little expensive side (my other shave soap is a locally-made shave soap that costs one-third of the cost of the Proraso).</li>
            <li> I also pat dry my expensive blade with a towel trying to prevent blade corrosion.</li>
            <li> Based on previous reviews, it sounds like the amount of lather has significantly decreased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for two months now, and I&#x27;ve hardly made a dent in the volume of soap in the container.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also want to point out that while the soap resembles a cream or foam in the image - it is actually as hard as bar soap.</li>
            <li> And, for those who care, this is a hard soap.</li>
            <li> I am having a hard time getting the lather as thick as I would want but that could be me, not the soap.</li>
            <li> The seller, however, ships product slowly.  </li>
            <li> 2-star deduction for the slow shipping.</li>
            <li> The lather isn&#x27;t that thick, maybe it&#x27;s not supposed to be</li>
            <li> Proraso lathers thick while keeping the skin moisturized during and after shaving.  </li>
            <li> The foam this creates is thick but very slick.  </li>
            <li> If you take your shaving seriously, you have to use this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It was just getting too expensive and not very satisfying.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t as slick as I&#x27;d like and seems a bit expensive for the quality in my opinion.</li>
            <li> A little awkward opening it sometimes.</li>
            <li> I use it in combination with Shave Secret preshave oil.  </li>
            <li> the thickness of the lather was too thin for my tastes.  </li>
            <li> It sits on my beard for approximately a minute</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ve wasted product like crazy.</li>
            <li> It was horrible, my face was tight and dry.</li>
            <li> and I feel like I have maybe gone through half of this container which isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> I started out with Williams soap and was very disappointed because it was extremely difficult as a beginner to get it to lather properly plus it smells like hotel bath soap.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was no stranger to ingrown hairs, irritation and feeling unsatisfied with how my skin felt after shaving.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I can still use expensive shaving lotions or colognes without any effect on their aroma.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It has a faint scent, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this stuff.</li>
            <li> but it was too expensive.</li>
            <li> and I said no (I didn&#x27;t realize it was still sticking to me and got numb to it).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll help from cutting yourself, but thats about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M MAD AT MYSELF</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a ton of terrible hard soaps but this one lathers up like a dream.  </li>
            <li> They are worthless products in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Trumper&#x27;s to the worthless Colonel Conk&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t go three strokes with the gel crap without having razor burn.</li>
            <li> For giggles I compared the gel crap you get at the supermarket with this soap and it was awful</li>
            <li> This product smells terrible.</li>
            <li> Also, you get an insane amount in this container.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It is a good soap. Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I have used shaving soap and this is better than I expected, I get a close shave, it lathers very well and leaves my face feeling and smelling great. I have had this product for about a month and shave every other day and it doesn&#x27;t even seem like I am making a dent in this product.</li>
            <li> I really like Proraso shaving soap.  It makes a very good lather, I find it soothing on my skin and it&#x27;s quite affordable at about nine bucks for a 5-ounce tub.   I really don&#x27;t know what else there is to say about a soap you shave with: it&#x27;s slick, it feels good on the skin, and it makes a decent lather.  I&#x27;d give it five stars if it made just a bit \\&quot;thicker\\&quot; lather.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong; it makes a lather that&#x27;s superior to many soaps I&#x27;ve tried, I&#x27;ve just found a few that make a bit better one.  But not at anywhere near this price, however.  Hmmmm, maybe I should have made it five stars, after all...</li>
            <li> I wear a beard, so I&#x27;m not shaving my ENTIRE face.  I&#x27;ve also got fairly sensitive, so I try to cheat by only shaving every 2-3 days.  however, within those parameters this tub of Proraso lasts me a year.  365 days.  It works up into a terrific lather, is easy on my skin and LASTS FOREVER.  This is my second tub; Lord willin&#x27; and the creek don&#x27;t rise, I will be buying this stuff for years to come.</li>
            <li> I like to lather up a rich shaving soap with a good badger brush for a great shave experience.  This soap is very rich; lathers up real good and I use less since it is so rich.  I get a good, close comfortable shave that leaves my face feeling refreshed and smooth.  This is very good soap.</li>
            <li> I have been a CO Bigelo user for years and decided to try something new.  This shave cream is better.  It lathers up creamier and has a nice scent to it.  I am becoming a big fan of this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great soap that produces a nice lather and a comfortable shave.  I find that it works extremely well with a DE blade, but also works fine with any of the cartridge systems as well.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> lathers up quickly, but also seems to get used up rather quickly. Overall, it helps give a nice comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> It develops a rich creamy lather, and the mentholation of the soap leaves you feeling awake and refreshed, with a slightly wonderful tingle in your skin (not the horrid burn of alcohol, but the refreshing song of cold mountain water splashed on your face to start your day).  I tried another brand of shave soap before buying the Proraso, and my sensitive skin / tough beard combo weren&#x27;t coming out as I&#x27;d hoped, but once I switched.  Wow.  It makes me want to use the after-shave lotion, too, but that stuff&#x27;s still a little pricey.  Maybe if I can find a good deal on it I&#x27;ll order some, or add it to the wish list.    If you take your shaving seriously, you have to use this stuff.  Your face will thank you.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Won&#x27;t shave with anything else now. I use the shave soap when I&#x27;m on the road and the shave cream sold through Bath and Body when I&#x27;m at home. I refuse to shave with anything else. Absolutely recommend!</li>
            <li> I am a first time wet shaver and having just used this soap for the first time, it was incredible.  It was very simple to lather - I think I may have used slightly too much water so be careful.  My brush is 100% pure badger hair, not the best badger or super badger or silver-tip brushes that cost a fortune but this still applied really well.  I had a good lather in about 1 minute.    I am waiting on my double-edge, safety razor to come in but I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this out (plus I was getting a little scruffy).  I used an old Mach III blade and expected to come away with some razor burn as usual but I couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth this made the razor work.    Amazon shipped this in a timely manner so it was the usual stellar service there... All around no complaints at all, everything is above and beyond my expectations.</li>
            <li> A couple of years ago I decided to use shave soap instead of the stuff out of a can, which always irritated my skin, too many chemicals.  Found some soap at the local department store and it was an improvement over the gels.  Then I received this for Christmas and it works great, smells great and last for a long time, you only need a little to get a great lather going and don&#x27;t forget to get a good brush too, good investment.  Would recommend this soap to anyone.</li>
            <li> I received my order of Proraso in the mail yesterday and was able to give it a whirl this morning. I have been using canned shaving creams for over thirty years now and have never found one that I was completely satisfied with. I have also been unhappy with canned shaving creams because the cans don&#x27;t seem to last that long for me. That looks like it has changed for the better! Enter Proraso Shaving Soap.    I have a DE razor which I ordered from Amazon on the way, but I decided to use the Proraso with my current Schick Quattro. I was simply blown away at how a shaving soap could out perform my canned shaving cream brand. I use one of the better brands of canned shaving cream which isn&#x27;t inexpensive, and the Proraso gave me a closer, cleaner, and more comfortable shave than my high end canned shaving cream! The razor burn I typically get was nearly eliminated with the Proraso Shaving Soap.    Once I get my DE razor I have no doubt that the discomfort being caused by shaving with canned creams and the four blade systems will be a thing of the past. So, if you are on the fence about purchasing this shaving soap, then don&#x27;t hesitate any further. I think you will be as utterly delighted with the Proraso Shaving Soap as I am.    One last thing. I have never been able to stand the canned menthol shaving creams because they are always too strong for my skin and would burn it. Not so with this Proraso product. I found the menthol in this soap to be quite gentle and refreshing to my skin.    This is good stuff!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!!  It lathers up into a thick, lustrous mixture that coats and softens whiskers and allows for a really close shave without scalping your face.  I am very glad I bought this product and will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaving soap on January 3, 2011. I had switched to a Merkur straight razor with a badger brush, and saw reviews for this soap online. I am just now using up the last of the soap - meaning that over the past 10 months one container of shaving soap has seen me through about 3 to 4 shaves per week. On economic efficiency alone, this shaving soap comes highly rated.   Moreover, it provides for a very comfortable and smooth shave. Granted, when I did make the switch to the straight razor I endured quiet a few nics and cuts. But that was the learning curve I expected. Now such happenings are a rare event.   I&#x27;d highly recommend this shaving soap. It&#x27;s lather is rich; the smell is extremely pleasant; and it does a great job protecting my skin while shaving. Furthermore, this small canister goes a long way - and I love not spending money every couple of months on shaving cream!</li>
            <li> This builds a nice lather and has a nice eucalyptus smell. i love it and use it daily.  Made and imported from Italy.</li>
            <li> I bought a little tub of this stuff in Rome in 2004.  I still have it......I&#x27;ve just left it in my travel case and that&#x27;s the only time I use it.....when I travel.  I still have some left in the tub and it still works as well as the day I bought it.  It imparts a bit of a tingle to your skin and the shave is excellent.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a few weeks and can say that it is all it was advertised to be.  Smells great, feels great, and makes shaving a pleasure</li>
            <li> I had to develop a new technique with a wet hot brush worked on to the soaps surface but it payed off this soap is a super bowl party on your face..enjoy</li>
            <li> Great lather even with crummy brushes. Feels great, moisturizing coconut oil and refreshing eucalyptus. Rinses easy and clean and lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> This is the only shaving soap I have tried, and I don&#x27;t plan on branching out.  I am VERY pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a few different shaving creams, [[ASIN:B000RI8BZQ Proraso Shaving Cream With Eucalyptus Oil &amp; Menthol (5.2 oz.)]] being my favorite.  So when it came time to try a soap, this was the natural choice and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I find it leaves my face softer than their shaving cream, and it seems like it&#x27;s going to last longer too (although I have yet to prove this).  I&#x27;ve been using it for two months now, and I&#x27;ve hardly made a dent in the volume of soap in the container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will certainly be purchasing this soap again, no doubt.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE REAL DEAL, MADE IN FLORENCE ITALY IT SMELLS GREAT AND MAKES A GREAT LATHER, SO MUCH MORE PLEASANT THAN THE GILLETE FOAM SHAVING CREAM! NOT TO MENTION THIS IS BETTER FOR THE SKIN.</li>
            <li> This soap not only helps soften your beard, it feels and smells great too. Thick rich lather, with all natural oils to soften beard and condition skin. If you let it sit for a few minutes it really wakes-up the face!&lt;br /&gt;I just wish the price wouldn&#x27;t fluctuate as much. I originally paid under $10.00, but it seems to fluctuate between $11 and $14. I found that one container lasts a few months, so even @ the higher end of the price spectrum, it&#x27;s a great value. Don&#x27;t forget to buy a good Badger Hair Brush to go with it! I got an Omega (also from Italy)[[ASIN:B000JMFELY Omega 63171 Stripey 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush with Stand]], six months ago and it never sheds (I&#x27;m sure it will last for several years)...great companion for the soap!!!</li>
            <li> This is the first soap I&#x27;ve used for wetshaving so I don&#x27;t know how it compares to the others.  I use it in combination with Shave Secret preshave oil.  The Proraso soothes my face like no other product i&#x27;ve ever used.  The first time I used a DE razor I cut myself at least 10 times.  I put on the proraso and immediately my skin felt better.  Now I don&#x27;t cut myself very often but the proraso still feels great.</li>
            <li> I like this soap, but it is not that much better than the $3.00 shaving soap pucks I have been buying at my local drug store. I&#x27;ll probably not buy it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find Proraso Shaving Soap locally, but I prefer it to their shaving cream.  It last&#x27;s longer and  provides a better shave.</li>
            <li> Dont get me wrong, this stuff is a truly great shave.  I recommend the other flavors without hesitation.  But the eucalyptus scent is just too strong.  I come out of the bathroom smelling like I shaved and washed my face with a christmas tree.  It&#x27;s a nice scent, I like it, but there&#x27;s just way too much of it. I give the other, subtler scents 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have never used shaving soap and a brush before. I used a badger brush to apply this soap. I had no idea if I was doing it right -  how wet vs how soapy I should get my face, I have no complaints. I haven&#x27;t used it up yet so I can&#x27;t say how economical it ends up being. I&#x27;ll update this review when I know that. I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I will start by saying that I&#x27;ve wasted at least 20 years of my life using the canned stuff (gels and creams), along with the 2, 3, 4 and 5 blade abominations. Needless to say, I was no stranger to ingrown hairs, irritation and feeling unsatisfied with how my skin felt after shaving. I have a very thick beard and shaving against the grain left me with a very irritated face.     So I said, there&#x27;s got to be a better way, and I started reading blogs and other sources of information for tips on shaving and in the end getting the best shave possible. It all comes down to three key points:    1) Use the right cream or soap.  2) Use a DE Safety Razor.  3) Avoid shaving against the grain.    Today, I&#x27;m here to say that point #1 is taken care of. This is by far the best shaving product I&#x27;ve tried, it leaves your face feeling great, with almost no irritation/redness. This is the good stuff, simple as that. Please do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t spend another minute or dollar shaving with the canned stuff.    I&#x27;m very excited to try this with my new Merkur Futur DE Safery Razor which should come in the mail within the next few days. If this is how good my face feels using a Gillette Mach5, I can&#x27;t wait to see how it feels like with a real razor.</li>
            <li> Even if I was still using a cartridge razor, I would still use this instead of the canned stuff.     You won&#x27;t get a better cream out of a can, period. This stuff smells amazing, and is cool on your face while you shave. When you lather on another layer for a second shave, your freshly shaved skin will say thank you for another layer. Your beard (if you have a goatee or beard that you shave around) will hold this scent for a while after your shave, and that&#x27;s fantastic too).     I&#x27;ve been shaving with this for around three weeks now, and can barely see the level change in the container.     The stuff in there is great--it&#x27;s not hard, but is like a partially dried cream, so it lathers easily and instantly. I don&#x27;t have a nice shaving brush, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter. With a nicer brush I bet the lathering experience would be even more fantastic. As for the actual shave, I&#x27;m not sure how much of it is my razor and how much is the cream, but I&#x27;ve been loving the ritual of shaving since I bought this. I look forward to it. That&#x27;s definitely new.     Finally, the size of the cup this comes in is just big enough to use the brush in it, without transferring it to another container, and with the lid it&#x27;s self-contained.     This is the best shaving soap I&#x27;ve ever used--that&#x27;s counting all the canned gels and creams, which I have come to see as junk.     You won&#x27;t be sorry. This will outlast several cans of shaving cream, and is soooo much more luxurious. Just what you need in the morning.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use much as  I like to shave fast and gravitated back to using my usual edge shaving gel in a can.  with edge gel  you don&#x27;t need a brush to put it on, and it works just as well.</li>
            <li> Proraso makes incredible shaving soap products, but the problem with the tub is that it dries out quickly.  You&#x27;re better off getting the tube, which doesn&#x27;t dry out at all.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t sell it in any stores around here.  It&#x27;s not too pricey and has a nice cooling affect after the shave.  This stuff doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry either.</li>
            <li> The product (itself) rates a perfect five.  I&#x27;ve used this in the past and it is one of my top two shaving choices, second only to the \\&quot;Maca Root Shave Cream\\&quot; (from The Body Shop).    The seller, however, ships product slowly.  I chose / paid for \\&quot;expedited shipping\\&quot; and - for double the shipping fee - it still took two weeks to arrive (and no reimbursement credit for the delay). Sure, the price is cheaper from this 3rd party merchant, but who wants to wait two weeks to shave?     2-star deduction for the slow shipping.</li>
            <li> The soap is very similar to the Omega brand. I use both. The Omega brand which is similar appears to have bit more lather; either one is a terrific shaving soap. Highly  recommend this one or the Omega brand.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shaving soap.  Lathers extremely easy.  Great protection for your shave.  I just don&#x27;t care for the menthol feeling.</li>
            <li> I tried this stuff for the first time several weeks ago and I absolutely love it. I use it with a badger hair brush and DE safety razor that I also bought on Amazon. I get a much better shave than using the slop in the can. It also works just as well with a disposable razor (Mach3, Fusion, etc). Due to the eucalyptus and mentol, after the shave you get a terrific cooling sensation (after splashing on a little cold water). I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is high quality soap... it lathers up nice.. and lasts forever .. I think so far it has lasted me about 250 shaves .. (I shave about 5 times a week and i have had it for almost a year)</li>
            <li> Wonderful refined scent, lathers very well, it&#x27;a all smooth shaving with this and my merkur 180 razor!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The italians know how to make quality products!</li>
            <li> I use this product with a double blade razor, and I absolutely love this soap.  I have had it almost three months and  the jar is almost 85% full.  I would imagine that one container might last me a year, and I shave five days a week with heavy daily growth.  Great job Proraso!!!</li>
            <li> We really do!  I often sit my man down to shave him as a small luxury a woman can do for a man.  I love the scent of this stuff- it&#x27;s a subtle masculine scent that stays with him, just a little.  It&#x27;s just the right amount of creamy- so the end result is quite rich. I usually spend a bit longer than people I see on youtube charging the brush- but it&#x27;s a pleasure to do unlike some glycerine soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soft soaps like this match really well to badger brushes- I usually wet the brush, swirl, then take it to my other bowl and work the lather.  We get an excellent and close shave despite the fact that he has terribly coarse hair.  There are better soaps, yes, but for the price, Proraso is really a fantastic option!</li>
            <li> About a year ago, I switched over to safety razors and I also bought a brush and some cheap shaving soap in cake form from QFC.  I wasn&#x27;t impressed at all with the soap, so I went back to cans and gel while sticking with the safety razor.    Wow, what a difference.  The Proraso is really easy to lather up, smells good, and *feels* amazing.  I almost wish that my hair grew faster so that I could shave every day instead of every other day.  Since it&#x27;s so easy to lather up, there&#x27;s plenty left on the brush for a second pass.  I&#x27;m definitely not going back to cans.</li>
            <li> Wow, I really love this stuff. Great lather, great smell, smooth cut, and good for many passes. Wonderful! I only wish they made refill pucks for my Muehle shaving bowl. To be honest, it would be nice to speak Italian too, but other than that this soap is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This soap is just average.  Not as good as some and better than many.  I would not reorder it. Would prefer more scent and more lather.</li>
            <li> So long as you use the right amount of warm water when working up the Proraso in your shaving mug, it is a more than adequate soap.  This soap doesn&#x27;t have much an odor (good or bad), which I prefer. It does seem to dry out a bit quickly.</li>
            <li> I recently go into straight edge shaving and this is the  second shave soap and so far I have been impressed. I have only had it for a month, using it almost every day. I have used very little soap in this time, so I feel this $10 investment might be the only shave soap I will need to buy for the entire year. Not bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, for beginners into straight edge shaving I will offer this advise: you must get your badger hair brush nice and wet in order to get a nice lather. No one told me this and I ended up burning through a nice size jar of expensive shave soap in one-month when it should have lasted me at least six months.  I like to soak my badge hair brush in a bowl of hot water while I take my shower. When I get out, it&#x27;s nice and wet which helps create a nice lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to a thrift store and bought a bowl for .042 cents which I use to create the lather. You can use your hand, but I found using a small bowl works a little better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, nice shave soap. It&#x27;s works good.</li>
            <li> I have started using this soap. It&#x27;s the best lather I have had so far. No running on the face. No burning. It really lasts in the tube, nice for travel. Won&#x27;t open eastily. So I have bought a few more. I feel the price will go up I bet??  SW</li>
            <li> Great product, this is so much better then any high end shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying again. The ultra sensitive is also good.</li>
            <li> Great lather, and after 3 weeks of use I can hardly tell how much has been used. I will buy more when the day comes!</li>
            <li> This is simply the greatest shaving soap I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve been shaving for 25 years.</li>
            <li> Lid was cracked but it&#x27;s a good product. Feels good to shave with it. A little awkward opening it sometimes.</li>
            <li> This soap is fantastic, and provides a clean, refreshing shave, and leaves your skin feeling quite soft.  I often don&#x27;t use any aftershave with this soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen this on several websites and finally decided to try it. I&#x27;m glad I did, its great stuff. Lathers up nice and gives a close shave. The menthol is strong and I find it very refreshing.     Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. I started using this along with the Tweezerman badger brush about a week before I received my DE Safety Razor. Whether you decide to switch to the traditional double edge safety razor or stick with a cartridge razor, I would recommend start using shaving soap and a brush. The brush and soap as opposed to the canned shaving cream makes shaving a much more enjoyable experience and also leaves you with healthier cleaner skin.</li>
            <li> The Proraso Shaving Soap is working well. I am having a hard time getting the lather as thick as I would want but that could be me, not the soap. The smell is light and clean. It makes my face feel great during the shave and I have been getting good close shaves with this product.</li>
            <li> I decided to make the switch from Col. Conk to Proraso, and I only regret not doing it sooner. This soap is, as many other reviewers have pointed out, the perfect balance between clean and moisturizing. It has a light, menthol scent that can only be described as a soapy Vick&#x27;s vapor rub (but in a good way, mind you). It puts plenty of buffer between your skin and the razor, and washes off smoothly. My only complaint is that initially, because of the contents in the soap, your face is going to feel cold while applying the soap, as if it had mint extracts in it. It&#x27;s a bit off-putting initially, but you get used to it after a while, not to mention that its performance alone makes this minor setback worth putting up with.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely worth buying if you want a serious, but cheap way to enhance your shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the typical shaving gel \\&quot;goop\\&quot;, that comes from a can for about 10 years now, alongside my cartridge based razors.  Having tried many brands, including Gillette, Edge and Nivea (my favourite), among others, I was sure I was protecting my face.  After reading some articles about the benefits of shaving with a Double Edged razor, I decided to make the switch, and one of the things mentioned in the articles is the benefits of using a shaving soap, over the goop in a can.  I made the switch to Proraso shaving soap, and I love it.  It smells great, as did my shaving gels, but with natural ingredients, rather than synthetic chemicals.  Also, you only need a dab in order to get a great, foamy, lather, which means that this stuff will last a long time.  Finally, and to me, probably most importantly, my face feels nice and clean after my shaves, as opposed to slippery, as if there was some residue left over.      In summation, this provides a great, well protected shave, for a great price, and leaves you feeling clean and smelling great!</li>
            <li> This is simply great soap.  Great price and lasts usually a year.  I&#x27;ve tried most other wet shave products and this beats them all.</li>
            <li> Nice shaving soap for use with a quality badger or boar shaving brush.  Great lather, cooling mentol and eucalyptus oil for thhe summer with a excellent fragrance.  Nice soap, great price and fast, free shipping.  Thanks Amazon for the deal.</li>
            <li> This stuff just doesn&#x27;t work very well for me.  Though it lathers nicely and smells good, I think it&#x27;s almost too slick.  I use a Merkur adjustable safety razor on a level 4 setting and derby blades; the blade just slides over my whiskers.  I have found that a traditional soap works better for my razor/blade.</li>
            <li> I am almost 70 and have been shaving for a long time.  Have tried shaving with different kinds of lather and over the years have come to prefer the lather made with shaving soap and a brush.  I bought Proraso shaving soap some time ago as a filler item to bring my order over 25.00 to get free shipping.  Just finished my old soap and tried this today for the first time, and what a delight.  Immediately liked the cover and shaving was like I had put a new blade in my razor it shaved so smoothly.  In addition it has a pleasant masculine smell and noted a slight tingle on my skin.  I am hooked and have added it to my wishlish to add to my next order.</li>
            <li> Finally tired of the high cost of today&#x27;s cartridge razors, I went old school with the DE safety razor. I recently upgraded from Col. Conk bay rum shaving soap because I found it dried my face too much after a couple lathers. I debated between the Proraso shaving soap and the Proraso shaving soap for sensitive skin. I chose the original Proraso shaving soap and pleased I did...the price of the upgrade was worth it. The original Proraso does not dry my face out and the menthol feels good. I also bought the Proraso aftershave and recommend that as well.</li>
            <li> Proraso Shaving Soap works better than anything else I have used for a hot shaving experience.  I enjoy using a hot shaving soap and apply the Proraso with a shaving brush that has been left under hot running water for a short time. The brush retains heat and I am able to use the Proraso as a hot soap. I have never had a razor cut with this soap and it feels very good on the skin. Post-shave the soap washes off leaving the skin feeling \\&quot;relaxed\\&quot;. I use a Gillette razor with the multi blade system and battery powered vibration. The cup in which the soap arrives is convenient for use with a brush. Shaving 2 to 3 times a week with the soap, it has lasted almost a year and it looks like there is plenty of soap remaining. I just purchased another cup of this soap. The only challenge - as with all brush on soaps - is getting the water to soap ratio right so it does not run off your face. Just takes a little practice.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enought great things about this shaving soap. It lathers VERY wells, has a nice masculine scent without being over-powering, and keeps my face feeling soft and fresh. I normally have a problem with face sensitivity and ingrown hairs, I started using this in September 2011 and not only have I not had any ingrown hairs, I am still on the first canister!  I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Just a tremendously great shaving soap!Tons of lather,lubricates brilliantly without feeling oily, and a wonderfully refreshing fragrance and a mildly bracing finish.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent.  Lathers well, cools my skin between passes.  Used to use those canned gel&#x27;s filled with ingredients I cannot pronounce.  Proraso shaving soap works much better for me.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m not going to be very wordy. I tried different shaving soaps, foams, and gels - Proraso shaving soap is the best so far. Very clean and close shave, minimal irritation and cool filing and scent of eucalypt extract. I didn&#x27;t used any aftershave, except my alum block and feel good and smooth. Only drawback is probably price, but it is really worth it. I dont know how long it will last, but definitely less than can of shaving gel, but it is really better.</li>
            <li> This is excellent shaving soap.  It lathers well.  Has a nice invigorating scent that is still subtle.  Best of all it really allows you to shave closely and effortlessly.  It lubricates the surface of the skin very well. There is absolutely no comparison between this product, and those canned gels and foams you get at the store.  I will never go back to those.  They are worthless products in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use both double edge razors (I have a couple) and a Gillete Fusion razor.  I only use the Gillette if I&#x27;m in a real hurry.  This product works very well with both of types of razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I review something I often like to list pros and cons.  However, I really can&#x27;t think of a \\&quot;con.\\&quot;  Whether you are new to blade shaving, or a seasoned vet, I think you will really like the shave you get with this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to old school shaving and was really impressed with this product.  I started out with Williams soap and was very disappointed because it was extremely difficult as a beginner to get it to lather properly plus it smells like hotel bath soap.  I soon switched to Proraso in hopes that it would work better for me.  Not only did I get a great lather, I was very pleased with the soothing feeling it had on the skin, not to mention the great smell.  One week ago I was pretty discouraged and I wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d ever get a good shave with a safety razor and soap, however today I got the closest shave ever!  It&#x27;s all about finding products that work for you and fine tuning your technique!</li>
            <li> Several years ago I quite buying big cans of shaving cream and switched to shaving soaps.  I was amazed at how much better my shaves were and how long one shaving soap lasted.  While the soaps were good the thickness of the lather was too thin for my tastes.  I switched over to Proraso creams on the advice of an Internet article and i couldn&#x27;t be happier.  It lasts forever, the container looks cool, it smells good, and is much better for the environment. Get yourself a decent shaving brush and move back a few decades to get the best shave you ever had.</li>
            <li> Proraso has a good reputation among wet shavers for providing a smooth, irritation-free shave.  This reputation is VERY well-deserved.  I have tried several different shaving soaps and creams, ranging from the excellent Arko to the over-rated (in my opinion) Trumper&#x27;s to the worthless Colonel Conk&#x27;s.  Proraso unquestionably is the best that I have found.  It has a cooling feel, a pleasant menthol scent, and helps a blade slide right over my face.  I have yet to knick myself or get razor burn after starting to use Proraso.  It even seems to help with acne!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I note that I use it in conjunction with Proraso&#x27;s pre-shave cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RAZOR - 1964 Schick Krona or Edwin Jagger DE89&lt;br /&gt;BLADE - Dorco or Crystal (Israeli Personna)&lt;br /&gt;BRUSH - Tweezerman</li>
            <li> I rarely post comments. I am doing this to perhaps be of help to those who share my past problem; now solved. For years I have shaved both in and out of the shower using good quality shaving cream and the best blades available. For years I have felt that I pay way too much for the price of blades; currently using Gillette Fusion blades. These blades are very expensive and might have lasted me a week before becoming uncomfortable to use; the friction strip would deteriorate. Even with drying the blade, it was of little help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have started using PRORSO pre-shaving cream in a jar along with their shaving soap and a brush. Both of the PRORSO items last a long time. I do not use much of the pre-shaving cream at the time of shaving, only a little bit. It sits on my beard for approximately a minute and then I go over the top with the shaving soap. Usually I shave every other day unless something really special comes along. I also pat dry my expensive blade with a towel trying to prevent blade corrosion. One blade will now last a month (usually a lot longer) or more using this procedure, and I have a very close shave. This drastically reduces the cost of blades, and I very, very seldom have a cut or nick. I am now a happy camper when it comes to shaving and the cost of blades. Note, there is no strong or bad after smell, only a very soft face. I can still use expensive shaving lotions or colognes without any effect on their aroma.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0015UWUFM Proraso Shaving Soap 5.2 oz (147 g)]][[ASIN:B000RIAD0W Proraso Pre and Post Shave Cream - 3.6 oz]]</li>
            <li> if you have a really soft bristled badger brush...consider the &#x27;art of shaving&#x27; products instead.  They&#x27;re a little pricier but work better in those applications</li>
            <li> This product is good. I can&#x27;t complain but I am also fairly new to the whole wet shaving thing. It has a very clean soap smell to it. I purchased the Proraso after shave balm as well. Both good products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a ton of terrible hard soaps but this one lathers up like a dream.  The smell is very refreshing in the morning.  Think eucalyptus and menthol.</li>
            <li> FIVE STARS WITHOUT A DOUBT...INCREDIBLE SHAVING SOAP.  THIS IS THE FIRST REVIEW OF ANY KIND THAT I&#x27;VE WRITTEN ON AMAZON, AND I REALLY FELT THE NEED TO GET THE WORD OUT ABOUT THIS INCREDIBLE PRODUCT.  LEFT MY FACE FEELING FRESH AND SMOOTH.  I&#x27;M MAD AT MYSELF FOR  NOT DISCOVERING THIS, AND WET SHAVING WITH A DE RAZOR SOONER.  I&#x27;M HOOKED.  I AM CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF PLANNING A TRIP TO FLORENCE JUST TO HIGH FIVE SOME ITALIANS FOR MAKING THIS STUFF. WOW...</li>
            <li> I could use some help with using this? I swirled my brush in and tried to whip up a lather in a bowl but it did not work.  how do some of you apply this?</li>
            <li> I recently friend the Proraso shave cream in a tube and I prefer the dish.  The dish lathers easier with less product, so a tub like this lasts twice as long for me.</li>
            <li> After 20 years of using the different foams and gels. This was an unexpected feel good experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my soap ran out my replacement from Amazon took a while to come and I had to use a gel for a few days. It was horrible, my face was tight and dry. I had to vaseline on my face and head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could get the soap locally at my drugstore here. I want to try another soap. Anyone know a good alternative?</li>
            <li> Nice scent and good lather.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaving soap I&#x27;ve used, very nice clean fresh non perfume scent and creamy, silky smooth almost Noxzema texture to it. Doesn&#x27;t take much on your brush to work up a full face lather and provides a very nice wet shave also protects and coats the skin wonderfully for a smooth shave. I&#x27;ve been using a 5.2 oz tub for over a year now and still have about a quarter of it left tho I don&#x27;t always shave daily. Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll leave the original review below for the sake of accountability. Having used the $1.50 puck of soap for a bit longer, then trying the Proraso again, I am much more impressed with the Proraso and have thrown the puck out. The smell of the puck grew progressively stronger - reminding me of a flowery industrial solvent. I went back to the Proraso and noticed all of the differences: the cool feeling as it sits on my face, the remarkably pleasant smell, the moisturized feel of my face after a cold-water rinse. I also want to point out that while the soap resembles a cream or foam in the image - it is actually as hard as bar soap. This tub will last a long while.     ORIGINAL REVIEW FOLLOWS:  I bought a tub of Proraso when I first switched to a safety razor. I don&#x27;t find that the quality is any better than the $1.50 block of soap that I bought so as to have something to compare it to. The scent is a bit cleaner, but that alone is not worth the higher price.</li>
            <li> If you want to save some money then buy this product. Lathers well and has a menthol feeling on face. It is a soap however and not a cream like Taylor of Old Bond Street. I prefer Taylor of old Bond, but this is still a good product.</li>
            <li> Kind of like Goldilocks...this soap is \\&quot;just right\\&quot;. Many of the aerosol can shaving foams and gels spew out way too much product for the needed application. Using a badger brush with this product allows you to apply just enough so you can actually see your face and beard through the applied soap...that&#x27;s critical. Those other can foams are like too much bubble bath in the tub. Yah you get suds up to the ceiling but you can&#x27;t see anything and you&#x27;ve wasted product like crazy.</li>
            <li> Great shaving cream I use with my Vision razor</li>
            <li> Lathers up nicely and is very cool on the skin.  Much better than some mug soap I picked up from a CVS store.</li>
            <li> I discovered Proraso products recently and use them with a standard razor and occasionally a safety razor. I thought I&#x27;d try this over the shaving cream I&#x27;d been using as the convenience of having its own little canister was and is appealing.  I like how the product feels on my face and it helps me get a good shave. What I do not like, however, is the amount of residue I get on my blades. After rinsing the same that I do always, there is an excess of filmy residue--gunk, even--on the blade. That&#x27;s not going to do much for sharpness and blade life.  So, the great experiment is done and I will be going back to Proraso shaving cream. This one&#x27;s relegated to permanent \\&quot;backup\\&quot; status for as long as it stays in my drawer.</li>
            <li> The lather isn&#x27;t that thick, maybe it&#x27;s not supposed to be but this is my first soap. Aside from that it smells good and works.</li>
            <li> This stuff comes up much more creamy and lubricating then anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  I feel much better after using this product then any of the others I&#x27;ve used.  Big fan.</li>
            <li> I gave this five stars because even though it is the only shaving soap I have used up till now, I find it to be of great quality. It has been about 4 months and there is probably about 75% of it left, with shaving being every other week or so. My skin feels great, the smell is invigorating and refreshing, the lather smooth, silky and just perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I&#x27;d like to point out. When you put the soap on your brush to build up lather in a container or even your hands, the soap enables you to reuse the soap on the brush at least 3 times (for those the do more than 1-2 passes). I usually do about 3-5 passes with my razor and don&#x27;t have to re-soap my brush at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I&#x27;d like to point out. I like this soap so much, sometimes I just wash my face with it, even when I am not shaving to get a nice smooth, clean face. Feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short. Great soap. No reason why you shouldn&#x27;t buy this product unless they come out with some certified organic/natural shaving soap! ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers, gentlemen!</li>
            <li> Just as good as everyone says it is.  I&#x27;ve recently switched to DE shaving and tried the drugstore and Walmart soaps with some success.  This Proraso shaving soap is better - a lot better.  The picture makes it look like a soft cream, but I&#x27;ve used it twice now with no noticeable reduction.  It should last months.  The smell is great and clean.  It lathers well, and the shave is great!  The cool tingle is very refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only criticism I could give would be that the container is slick and can be a bit hard to open - especially with wet hands.  Not a big problem for most of us, but if you have difficulty using your hands from arthritis or something you might want to try the tube variety instead.  If not, just open it before you start getting wet and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> I recently started wet shaving.  I heard good things about Proraso so I decided to try it.  Immaculate.  It lathers your face very well and it cools your face as you shave. I would recommend this product over any shaving gel or cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I got the tips of my brush coated well and took a small amount of water in to my lather dish.  Wow, the lather was so thick and fresh, you can definitely fell the difference.</li>
            <li> I have tried them all.  This one is only OK.  I would not waste your time with it however. The lather is not thick or particularly comfortable on the skin.  The odor is not bad, but not exactly appealing.  For this price, you can do A LOT better.&lt;br /&gt;Taylor of Old Bond Street, and Edwin Jagger are much better products...</li>
            <li> Pros:  Good Lather  Scent is not overbearing. Very Refined.  Feels Great on Skin, somewhat tingly initially.  Price is reasonable.  Cons  None So Far</li>
            <li> I received this for christmas this year. I have used it twice since then and I may never use another soap again.  It smells nice-a very clean scent including eucalyptus and menthol.  I have been shaving almost exclusively with Speick for the last few months.  I love Speick, but Proraso smells better and possibly shaves better.  This is a wonderful shaving soap.</li>
            <li> The soap has a subtle but masculine scent, a &#x27;cooling&#x27; like feeling on my skin that almost tingles a bit, and puts a really slick barrier between my face and the razor. I have previously been using the pressurized garbage in the cans with a DE razor that does not protect or feel as smooth as this soap. I have fairly sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all. I love the slickness of the lather on my beard as the razor glides over my skin and it leaves my face feeling moisturized and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I have tried both the cream and this soap by Proraso. The soap is easier to make a consistently great lather every time you shave. With the cream it is sometimes difficult to make that fine, rich, and thick lather without adding too much or too little (you experienced guys know what I mean). With the soap I no longer have that problem. The soap also has the added benefit of savings. I have only whipped up a couple of lathers but I see that the soap is going to last me at least twice as long as the tube of cream. This stuff is more cost efficient. Now for the downside! It does not smell nearly as fresh as the cream. The menthol smell was one of my favorite parts of the morning ritual and I no longer have that. This stuff has kind of a harsh synthetic, kind of plasticy smell to it.  PROS:  -more cost efficient this 9 dollar container will last twice as long as the 5.2oz 11.00 cream  -MUCH simpler to make a consistent, rich, and creamy lather  CONS: (only one)  -DOES NOT have that same menthol smell that the cream has and to me that makes a big difference so I&#x27;m knocking off a star.</li>
            <li> My wife loves kissing my cheek after I shave with Proraso.  It&#x27;s becoming her tradition.  It&#x27;s the only shave soap I really enjoy.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with proraso products. very easy to lather and gives great protection for shaving. i like to mix the soap and cream for a \\&quot;superlather\\&quot; try it. you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> This product smells terrible. I think my co-worker (even after I washed it off without using it) walked in and immediately asked if I smelled something and I said no (I didn&#x27;t realize it was still sticking to me and got numb to it). I asked what it was and he said, it smelled like something damp. The texture is also terrible, it doesn&#x27;t formulate a good lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Taylor of Bond Lavender before, much easier to create a lather and smells great. I wanted to try something new preferably with aloe and menthol but have not been able to find the right product - Proraso isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the Proraso Soap Cup since I liked their shaving cream so much (the kind that is in the tube). I am much more happy with the soap cup. Used with a badger brush, I am not sure when this stuff will run out. You only need to put a little on the end of your brush and it will lather up very nicely on your face and will last for 3 passes.    Proraso has a great eucalyptus scent and it feels good on your face. It rinses off clean and does not dry out your skin.     It may cost more than what you would pay for a regular soap puck, but I think it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to use this shaving cream for about 2 months. It got pretty good reviews so i figured what the heck. After 2 months, i can honestly say i will never even think about buying this again, my face just couldn&#x27;t take it. It&#x27;s got an ok shave using this and feather blades, but all the other blades felt like i was pulling out my facial Hair(i mainly use derby blades, but tried this with a variety pack). I finally gave up, ordered Taylor and old bond street again and threw this stuff in the trash.</li>
            <li> I bought this, oh must have been 8 months ago and it&#x27;s still going strong!  Poraso is now my go-to foam for shaving.  The wide open top and moist product is remarkably easy to beat into a thick froth, which is ideal.  It smells crisp, refreshing, and classy as hell too.  I&#x27;ve not had any problems taking it on my air travels as well, but that may be because my TSA screeners have been classic shave fans as well :D</li>
            <li> I have been a blade shaver for thirty years and during this time I have use many different shave products.  During this time I have learned that price and quality don&#x27;t always go hand in glove.  Proaso products are the exception, they offer good products at a fair price.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff. Makes shaving easy and smooth. It is great if you are using a brush, but it does seem to dry pretty quick. I have to shave half my face then reapply to the rest because it is dry by then. I will still use it in the future though</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t if this is fantastic shaving soap, but it&#x27;s clearly a step up from the canned gels I&#x27;ve been using for 30 years.  Significantly better lubrication.  Ready to try a safety razor now.</li>
            <li> After being a loyal Art of Shaving shaving cream user the past few years, I decided to take a leap and see what all the craze was about with Proraso. Long story short, I love it. It lathers very well with a brush, the razor just glides over it, the smell reminds me of eucalyptus and menthol, and my face is left feeling very refreshed afterwards. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone using a DE razor and a shaving brush.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It works great when I shave and leaves my skin feeling cool after shaving. I also think it smells great.</li>
            <li> My favorite thus Far. creates a nice lather and slick surface for shaving.</li>
            <li> I have tried many kinds of shaving soap, from the cheapest to the most pricey. Believe me, if you shave using a classic razor and brush - nothing comes close to Prosaso Shaving soap. Just a few swirls with your brush puts enough soap on your brush to create some impressive lather -  and the great scent and incredible tingle of the Eucalyptus oil is pure pleasure. I use a Merker classic razor, a Vulvix pure badger brush; and this soap is the perfect compliment. And, for a final kicker - it isn&#x27;t very expensive!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember - no need to swirl and swirl - just a few strokes puts enough on the brush - work the lather up on your face! Using this method - a tub will last a long, long time. -- Mykal</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly new to the DE shaving world.  After I made the switch to DE shaving, I still continued to use my Barbasol in the yellow can.  It contains lanolin, so it&#x27;s a little easier on my skin in the colder months.  I have a buddy that asked if I&#x27;d tried using a brush and soap/cream, but I wasn&#x27;t interested for several months, and then out of the blue, decided to go ahead and give it a shot.  Wow!  That&#x27;s really all I can say about it.  This soap works very well with my brush ([[ASIN:B003WR3QSG Escali Pure Badger Shaving Brush]]) and razor ([[ASIN:B000LY2AKI Merkur Model 178 Classic]]).  The foam this creates is thick but very slick.  My razor glides over my face without snagging on hairs and gives me a very close shave on the first pass.  My face is left very smooth and not dry at all.  The other bonus about this soap is the smell.  Someone mentioned it somewhere before and I&#x27;ll say it again, it smells manly, but not macho.  It&#x27;s a very clean smell that lingers throughout the day but isn&#x27;t overpowering.  This was fulfilled by Amazon, so naturally, very quick shipping.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am new to shaving with s safety razor. I bought a Merkur HD safety razor, a Tweezerman badger brush, and this Proraso shaving soap. Still getting used to water to product ratio and how long to mix the product in a ceramic bowl to get lather just right. The better the lather, the less chance of getting cuts with razor. Be patient and practice will help dramatically. I like the product, but my wife also bought me the shaving cream from Art of Shaving, and it seems easier to work with out of the box. Less work to get lather right. Price was great on this Proraso Shaving soap.       I hope this helps you out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Proraso creme branded as [[ASIN:B002L03N74 CO Bigelow Premium Menthol Shave Cream]] for the past few months.  I really enjoy the menthol smell and tingle, but appreciate that it dissipates fairly quickly and doesn&#x27;t linger.      I decided to try the soap in hopes of a slicker shave without some of the thickness the creme can retain if it&#x27;s not lathered fully.  The soap itself is fairly soft and charges the brush easily.  The tub is filled to the top, so it&#x27;s tough to lather in the tub but easy to charge your brush and then lather in the bowl.  Lathering directly in the tub will obviously become easier as more of the soap is used leaving more space in the tub.  My end results were nearly identical to that of the Proraso creme...  a fairly consistent lather and rich menthol smell, but hardly any difference in slickness or thickness once applied.  It&#x27;s as if this soap is really just partially solidified creme in a tub.  I can&#x27;t comment on whether a tub would last longer than an equally priced 5oz tube since I&#x27;ve not used enough to make a accurate comparison.    This is still a great soap, there&#x27;s just no need to have both this AND the Proraso creme in your rotation at the same time as the end results are nearly identical.  The one benefit the tub may have is it is travel friendly, not requiring removal during TSA checks at the airport.</li>
            <li> I tried this on a lark and really love it. I shave most of the time with a double edge and some times with a straight razor (weekends, when I have a bit more time). This makes your face feel great - the eucalyptus and menthol give a bit of a tingly, cool sensation without being overpowering and the smell is simple, clean and masculine (no violet fragrance here!!). The lather is quite good - I swirl the brush in it for a while, add a few drops of hot water to the bowl, then beat it with the brush as if it were egg whites. It gets rich and &#x27;peaky&#x27; right away. I can&#x27;t understand why some seem not to have gotten good results. At the rate it is being consumed, I consider it a bargain.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> This is a nice soap, produces a good lather, and if you like classically scented soap with a hefty dose of menthol, you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this one.</li>
            <li> I like to make shaving as simple as possible so fiddling with soap, brush and cup is not for me. I admit Proraso is the only mug soap I have tried but for me any type of Nivea from the drug store is superior. After a few shaves I chucked the Proraso, mug and brush in the trash but if you like a shaving ritual it may be the way for you.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying this soap again. It&#x27;s ok, but for the money I expected more. It smells nice and I like the menthol feeling on my face but it isn&#x27;t as slick as I&#x27;d like and seems a bit expensive for the quality in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Gets a close shave. Feels cool on the face. Nice scent. You&#x27;ll need a shave brush to get a nice lather. Lasts much longer than a can of shave cream.</li>
            <li> The perfect soap for the perfect shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some are too oily some too soapy, this&lt;br /&gt;has the right balance for unsurpassed&lt;br /&gt;shaving comfort! I Like It!</li>
            <li> I bought some other shaving stuff and bought this as well since I could get free shipping.    I used it with a Parker silvertip brush (only brush I own) and a Edwin Jagger razor w/ a Feather blade. Proraso is very messy and the cream went all over the sides of the container and onto the counter. It feels minty the whole time it&#x27;s on your face like Aqua Velva after shave. I did not like it! The lather wasn&#x27;t any better than my Van Der Hagen pucks. For being a well-recognized and respected soap in the shaving forums I&#x27;ve cruised I was very dissappointed. I won&#x27;t be re-purchasing and will stick to pucks only from now on.     Giving 3 stars because the lather was ok. Did not like spills and minty feel.</li>
            <li> This product charges the brush very well. It looks like I&#x27;ll never run out because I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now and haven&#x27;t put a dent in the product. There is almost no scent at all, which some people may enjoy but I prefer a scent. Overall this has been a great product.</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve had it for a little over a month now and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve put a dent in it. I use it with the [[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor]] and the 2 together work fantastic.  Smells great  Works great  5 stars all the way!!!!</li>
            <li> A first time trying shaving soap, hard to make a lather but enjoying experimenting.  Good idea to put the container into another one to avoid making a mess</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a recent convert to \\&quot;safety razors\\&quot; having used a Gillette Fusion before.  I coupled this soap with a Merkur 180 model razor and a Parker blue wood handle badger bristle brush.  I&#x27;ve been using this soap for a month now and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  Like others mention it has a great fragrance to it - menthol and eucalyptus, masculine, and not overly strong.  One thing I was going back and forth on before purchasing this was whether or not I needed a mug or a dish to make a lather in.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t invest in something like that prior to getting this soap.  I add water to my brush and make a light lather directly in the plastic tub that the soap comes in.  This works great and then I don&#x27;t need another thing to clean or sit on my vanity.  The soap responds nicely to whatever type of lather you want to make - more or less water etc.  It&#x27;s very clean to use, I like the consistency, and it provides great lubrication for a shave which is even more important when using a double edge razor.  I may experiment with other shaving soaps just because I have nothing to compare this too but I&#x27;d definitely buy this again as well.</li>
            <li> After several years of using the less expensive shave soaps, I decided to splurge on this soap.  WOW!!! What a difference.  The menthol and eucalyptus really help cool your face and provide a unique tingle.  A great way to wake up in the morning.  A splash of cool water after the shave and it really kicks it up a notch.  Lathers well and lubricates just as well.  I was hooked after the first shave and will never go back to those inexpensive soaps again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean to be ageist or rude, and it&#x27;s a fine shaving soap, but you might want to smell this stuff before ordering. It&#x27;s not even that it \\&quot;stinks,\\&quot; it&#x27;s just a very old-fashioned smell. Like, why do old people smell how they do? Because they use stuff like this. Great product overall, just saying.</li>
            <li> I will have to admit, I love this shaving soap.  It lathers up quick, and gives me a clean feeling after I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem I have is not with the product, but with this vendor selling it for $20.  I went to Italy in the Summer of 2010, and bought home with me 6 cups of this soap.  I shared two with my dad...not the point of the story.  The point is, I bought it for 3 euros a cup, and with today&#x27;s exchange rate, that&#x27;s $3.75 a cup.  I don&#x27;t get why this is such a price hike.</li>
            <li> This will be my second time buying Proraso shaving cream and would recommend it to anyone. Proraso was my first shaving cream purchase and I enjoyed it, but I wanted to try others kinds and I did, several differnt ones, but Proraso is the best I have tried and that&#x27;s why I am coming back Proraso. It gave me an extremely close shave the Menthol help to reduce razor burn and it lasted quite a while too. I am buying both the green cup and the sensitive kind also, the white cup, to see the difference. Using shaving cream with a good brush is by far the best way to shave. Enjoy using Proraso.[[ASIN:B0015UWUFM Proraso Shaving Soap 5.2 oz (147 g)]]</li>
            <li> This soap is great, the scent, the richness, the feeling is outstanding. The eucalyptus adds so much to a good shaving soap. The fresh feeling is incomparable. You can make great thick lather for a fraction of the price of other soaps.</li>
            <li> It is good, but dries quickly. May be it is me, but I would prefer a glycerin cream than any soap. Extremely economical though, I have a feeling it will last for a decade. But buy a cream, not a soap or use both at the same time!</li>
            <li> Not my favorite shave cream, but if you want a menthol type there may not be any better offerings. My biggest complaint is that it dries out rather quickly on your face if you have a low ambient humidity. It&#x27;s also slower to lather than most other creams. Menthol cooling is there and the smell is not too lingering. It&#x27;s half the price of my favorite cream (Mr Taylors).</li>
            <li> Better than I expected! Great lather from only a small amount on a shaving brush! Able to make three passes easily without reloading.</li>
            <li> 4 Month Review -After switching from Mach III razors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below is the listed product I am using as part of my &amp;#34;Shaving Arsenal.&amp;#34; It took me a while to find each piece needed to bring it all together. My approach was finding all the pieces that had the best reviews vs. price. Just about everything listed below was the &amp;#34;highest price&amp;#34; but luckily these items don&#x27;t cost much. Not CLOSE to as much as it costs to shave with Mach III Safety razors. If your ready to make the switch to a superior, and cheaper, alternative then check out the products below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving Soap: Prosaro Shaving Soap&lt;br /&gt;It works but I with it had more lather. Based on previous reviews, it sounds like the amount of lather has significantly decreased. Does it work? Yes, but I like a good lather. Anyways, its been 3 months and I feel like I have maybe gone through half of this container which isn&#x27;t bad. It also has a very fresh but subtle smell which I really like.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00837YY18/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_44?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;redirect&#x3D;true&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Handle: Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor.&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed about this handle is the quality. You can tell its not your basic cheap piece of metal. Its got a comfortable weight to it, keeps its brilliant chrome finish, and clean up is quick and easy. I consider myself a man with normal size hands  and don&#x27;t know why this one is considered &amp;#34;long handled.&amp;#34; Its just a tad longer than the Mach III razor I used to use. However, it’s a night and day difference compared to those &amp;#34;Safety razors.&amp;#34; It cuts very close with minimal passes. I&#x27;ve never had a shave that was this close before.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Merkur-Model-180-Handled-Safety/dp/B000NL0T1G/ref&#x3D;sr_1_10?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1355613524&amp;sr&#x3D;8-10&amp;keywords&#x3D;double+edge+razor+handle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blades: 7a.m. Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve heard there are better blades on the Market but since I started out with a 100-pack it will be 2-YEARS until I need to buy any more since I change them out once a week. I&#x27;m half Filipino so I don&#x27;t have the thickest facial hair but definably pull off a goatee without a problem.  Other than one &amp;#34;Dud&amp;#34; all other blades have been very predictable and easy to use. I have gotten the occasional razor burn but that appears to be normal with any Double-edged razor. I was worried I would be opening myself up to more &amp;#34;risk&amp;#34; with these but feel that I am at no more risk than any other safety blade now that I am used to it.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017ZECA6/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_32&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stand: Safety Razor stand&lt;br /&gt; Once I learned that a stand was needed for the &amp;#34;Tweezerman Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush&amp;#34; I decided to go with this one. Its been 4 months and the chrome is still shining well. Its sturdy, and holds my double edged razor as well as the shaving brush as if this product was made just for them. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001XURHNY/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_42&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush: Not sure why its made of &amp;#34;Badger&amp;#34; hair but its working. Where this brush looses a star is because it lost some of its bristles during the first week. Since then there haven&#x27;t been any more hair-loss and I&#x27;ve had no problems. 4 months going strong. It creates a nice lather and feels good against the skin. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G647Y8/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_47&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soap Bowl: Guess I didn&#x27;t need this since I am using the Proraso Shaving Soap which is self contained. For as simple as it is, it lost two stars. There is a rim that goes along the bottom that has (or had) a black rubber piece that ran around it to provide a good footing for the Bowl while on a counter. The very first day this part fell off, it didn’t seat on there, and it wasn&#x27;t glued. In the garbage that piece went. The next star was lost due to finish. It was a pretty flat finish for chrome and you could see theseveral light scratches across it. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00404RI70/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_35&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Shave: Virgin Island Bay Rum by Clubman&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tested several types of Aftershave in stores but never found anything I liked. Based on reviews I had a hunch I would really like this. Once it arrived I was right!

            <li> I have tried a few different soaps and this one is the best. It keeps my face from drying out and the smell is not bad.</li>
            <li> I have been wet shaving for about a year now and I have tried multiple shaving creams and soaps.  This is by far the best!  I finish my shave feeling refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Lathers well&lt;br /&gt;Lasts for many months&lt;br /&gt;Cool and soothing feel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None</li>
            <li> If you like a classic shave, you&#x27;ll love this soap. Gives a nice lather, smells great and leaves my face feeling fresh after a good, close shave. Highly recommend this or the tube version.</li>
            <li> This is the first soap I bought when I got into wet shaving. It&#x27;s a good entry level or low end soap. Lather is ok. Smell is good. I prefer Geo F Trumper for fragrance, lubricity and lather but you will pay more for it. I would only buy this again for a travel soap.</li>
            <li> As my first soap cake, I can say this shaving soap rocks. Great for softening the face, very soft light fragrance, very smooth shave when used with a quality badger-hair brush. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months and most of the soap is still in the dish; I shave about 4 times per week. It&#x27;ll likely last a year (at least)!</li>
            <li> This product is great!! Proraso products are the best, know wonder those italians have such nice skin, do yourself a favor and treat your face with Proraso, rather than the crap in the can that just drys your face up, i recommend it to all ages iv read its more of a manly smell, im 24 and i think its smells refreshing and crisp and i dont get an old chap smell at all. i just ordered the pre/post shace cream 3.6 oz cant wait for that!</li>
            <li> When I switched back to DE (wet) shaving some months ago, Proraso was the first cream I tried. I did so based on the reviews here and the relatively low price. Paying $9 for shaving cream seemed a bit high, but I&#x27;ve since learned that it&#x27;s one of the less expensive \\&quot;premium\\&quot; brands.    Although I&#x27;ve always used it with a brush, many people simply apply it directly to their skin. Personally, I think that the brush method works better as it get the cream under each whisker and raises it enough for the blade to cut it cleanly.    The quality of the product compares favorably with TOBS, which is about 50% more expensive. However, the scent does take some getting used to and it does tend to \\&quot;wake up\\&quot; my skin a bit, which I&#x27;m not sure I like.    In any case, it&#x27;s certainly worth a try by anyone wanting a product that&#x27;s a huge step up from that canned goop.</li>
            <li> I have used this shaving soap as well as Col Conks and Van der Hagen.I am using a merkur model 180 long handle and a variety of blades.  The Proraso gives me the heaviest thickest lather of the bunch.  The soap in the container is not a solid like the other two but more of a semi solid soap. My first worry was that it would not last.  Not the case it lasts exceptionally long.  It is refreshing with the Eucalyptus Oil &amp; Menthol.  and this soap is a huge cut above the other two I have used.  My second favorite being the Col Conk Bay Rum and the Van der Hagen coming in last.</li>
            <li> This was the soap I started with when I got into DE shaving a year and a half ago. It&#x27;s a really good soap, and I had very few problems with it. The only reason I rated it 4 stars is that I ended up liking the Taylor of Old Bond Street a lot better. This soap from Proraso is good, reliable, lasts a long time, and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I was blown away instantly by the difference between this shaving soap and traditional Gillette and Nivea shaving creams. You should have a badger brush in order to use the soap but wow, its incredible.    You have never used anything like it before, its so cool to your skin its almost cold and its very smooth. I have never felt anything so slick on my face.    Also, you get an insane amount in this container. You use only a small bit every shave and the 5.2 oz seems like it never goes away. I can see months of use out of this one product container.    An instant buy.</li>
            <li> Love it, I will reorder it when this one is done! Gives you a clean close shave, buy it you&#x27;ll like it</li>
            <li> People seem to love this stuff so I had to try it.  I was let down.  There wasn&#x27;t enough menthol to feel on the skin and the smell was unfortunate, like a cheap hand soap.  It didn&#x27;t lather as much as I&#x27;d hoped, but it&#x27;s dense enough that I can see how it would last a long time if used every day.  But I&#x27;m going back to a Conk&#x27;s lime puck and will continue my search.</li>
            <li> Target stopped selling Proraso, but buying it online has been a good experience. Quality is the same and offers the same consistent lather that I&#x27;ve come to expect.</li>
            <li> I purchased Proraso Shaving Soap [[ASIN:B001RILFDU Proraso Eucalyptus Shaving Soap for Normal Skin 5.2 oz bar]] (5.2 oz) for my husband earlier this year. I head read the reviews for the product and they all sounded positive. My husband has been shaving for 30+ years and has NEVER raved about a shaving soap like he has Proraso. This stuff may seem a little \\&quot;pricier\\&quot; than the other shaving soaps but it is worth EVERY PENNY!</li>
            <li> I started using the Proraso line of shaving products about 4 years ago.  I&#x27;ve tried several other products over that time, and for a well above average shave (and feel), none have been as consistent as the Proraso line.  Excellent value.</li>
            <li> I have tried various shaving creams, gels, and soaps over the years. Never quite found one that I truly thought was far superior, until now.</li>
            <li> Well, I just keep coming back to Proasso. I have one Art of Shaving and two TOBS shaving cremes and I use them when I want something a little different and they are just great, no kidding, excellent products. But Prorasso is my go to shaving cream and has been for many years.  There are so many wonderful things one can say about Proraso. When I took up a straight razor to my scrawny neck the first time, this was the recommended shaving cream. I had just thrown out my Barbasol and Mach III. It was just getting too expensive and not very satisfying. The first time I shaved with Proraso, I swear, I said out loud \\&quot; I never knew it could be like this!\\&quot; Kind of an estrogen-generated moment, I know. But it was such a huge step above anything I had ever tried. Smoothest shave, the blade just glides on it. And I was just awestruck about just how little you need. The product instructions, instead of greedily encouraging you to use up the whole tub in a week, cautions you to use just a little bit, because it goes along way. A quality product and a quality company.  Many years later now, I have dabbled in english creams and they really are good, as I&#x27;ve said. But nothing beats the bracing and invigorating experience of a Proraso shave. I won&#x27;t say I don&#x27;t use anything else, because variety is the spice of life. But I use Prorasso ALMOST exclusively. If you have ever experimented with creams you&#x27;ll know that this one is always consistent and lively. I cannot recommend it enough.  I do the normal prep after a hot shower, use a badger brush and work up the lather in a bowl. I shave with a straight and finish up the last pass with a DE. I&#x27;ll rinse with cold water and man that is when the real spark of Proraso goes to work. Hello Mama!. I&#x27;ll do a quick douse with Witch Hazel, pat dry then use an alum block. Wait a couple of minutes then I use a tiny dab of Proraso all over my face. Feels good, promotes healing and the minimal scent disappears in minutes. Sometimes I&#x27;ll use Nivea Shaving Balm instead but Proraso is a great balm all by itself. I top it all off with a slight brushing of Clubman talc to take the shine off and give my face a smooth, dry feel.  I know, it sounds like a lot. But what a wonderful experience to pamper myself and give myself a spa treatment every morning before I head off to work. It does wonders for my attitude at work in the morning. Shaving is just a wonderful treat these days and Prorasso is a huge part of that. It used to be slip/slap/chop five minutes before heading out the door. Now, it&#x27;s heaven knowing I&#x27;ve been good to myself before anyone else can get to me that day. Honestly....\\&quot; I never knew it could be like this!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I am new to the world of wet shaving.  I use merkur 180 long handle with this shave cream and it is def. the best shave cream i&#x27;ve ever used, beats anything out of the can, left my face feeling fresh with no razor burns, cuts, or irritation.  It has a faint scent, but not overpowering. Buy it now!!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best shaving soaps I&#x27;ve used.  Not too oily and feels great on the skin.  I am never going back to shaving creams.</li>
            <li> Yes, I&#x27;m happy to see this is still the same quality great shaving soap I remember it to be.  I have been using so many other (also great quality) products lately and suddenly decided to buy another tub of the \\&quot;Good Old PRORASO\\&quot;.  Loved it years ago, love it now.  I&#x27;m also very glad to hear they have changed their look and are soon to launch a SANDALWOOD PRORASO line.  Can&#x27;t wait to try it!</li>
            <li> This soap is how a man should shave and well worth the money. For giggles I compared the gel crap you get at the supermarket with this soap and it was awful, I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference that a simple soap makes. I couldn&#x27;t go three strokes with the gel crap without having razor burn. Originally I bought only one container just to try it out and I was blown away buy luxuriousness. It has menthol in it which really opens the pores for a super close shave. To add to the greatness that is this soap, I shave my face and head every three days and one container lasted me a good 6 months. Love this soap!</li>
            <li> I love this shave soap. This container sells for relatively cheap, I&#x27;ve already had it for about a month, and I anticipate it will last another 5 months at least. What a tremendous value this offers. Not only does this soap help provide a more enjoyable, close shave, but it is even cheaper than buying the mainstream shave gels sold today by the likes of Gillette, etc. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Shaving everyday requires a product that not only protects skin, but hydrates as well.  Proraso lathers thick while keeping the skin moisturized during and after shaving.  It also allows for a closer shave than other gels or foams.  The 5.2 oz size lasts almost six months, shaving no less than six days a week.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap when I switched to a DE razor, and it performs leaps and bounds beyond any other shaving cream.  I shave every other day (3 passes), and in two months I haven&#x27;t used but a fifth of the product.  This soap leaves my face nice and moisturized.  Also, it smells awesome and women can&#x27;t stop smelling me.  So, go team.</li>
            <li> A good basic shaving soap.</li>
            <li> Been wet shaving for a couple years, switched to this soap and the first tub lasted nearly 8 months of shaving every single day. I tried Taylor of Old Bond Street next, just to try it out - short answer, I&#x27;m tossing it under the counter and just ordered another proraso. TOBS felt like it lathered thicker, but my blade seemed to shudder across my face instead of gliding like it does with proraso, this resulted in frequent nicks, which I never get otherwise. Also, the TOBS lid has to be unscrewed and proraso just pops off quickly (this seems like a small thing, but I&#x27;m in the military, I don&#x27;t sleep much, and I shave at stupidly early hours of the morning and I don&#x27;t like wasting time). Also, with proraso you can lather in the bowl, whereas TOBS you have to finger some onto your brush and lather in your hand since it&#x27;s more \\&quot;creamy.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line; I&#x27;m done experimenting, just sticking to proraso now.</li>
            <li> I detest shaving, It is very hard to find a good menthol soap,that said Proraso menthol shaving soap is the only shaving soap that I use. It is very hard to find in Indiana so purchasing it on Amazon is a good value.</li>
            <li> I am new to DE safety razor shaving and decided to try this as a shove soap. I do not have anything to compare it to except for foam in a can. This stuff smells great and makes a great lather. The more water the better.</li>
            <li> I am not going to pay for any other brand than Proraso. A nice method is to put a bit of hot water in the cup for a few minutes which really warms and loosens the soap up nicely.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve been a gel can user and recently switched to using a brush and Proraso shaving soap. I have to admit I was hestinate on the switch but this stuff is great. It last a lot longer than the gel can stuff I was using, has a pleasant fragrance without being really noticeable and provides a really great shave. One really happy guy!</li>
            <li> Proraso makes fantastic shaving products at affordable prices.  Good lather, great scent, great shave.  The menthol provides an intoxicatingly crisp coolness with the cold rinse after the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long-lasting, so it&#x27;s a great value as well.  Recommended to everyone who appreciates a good shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband along with a nice straight razor and a badger bristle brush and he loves this soap.  It froths up well, smells great and even has its own little cup to use so you don&#x27;t have to buy one.  My one complaint is that after only two uses he seems to have used a little more than I thought he would have.  This could be because he lathers up more than necessary or because the soap is a bit softer than expected.  Overall I would give this soap an A.  Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is the classic soft Italian shave soap. Nice light menthol feel, good skin care, nice comfortable shave.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have always used the various brands of shaving cream that is dispensed from an aerosol can. With this shaving soap even just using my cartridge razors I get a much better shave than I ever did using aerosol cans.This product is great, it has a bit of a wonky smell, but it works phenomenally, and seems like it should last a long while.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED SO MANY SHAVE CREAMS FROM ARAMIS TO WILLIAMS AND HAVE FOUND \\&quot;PRORASO\\&quot; TO LATHER BETTER THAN ALL OTHERS AS THE OLD SAYING GOES A LITTLE DAB WILL DO YOU. GREAT ITEM, AMAZON</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend 2 years ago &amp; he still has probably half the container. He shaves every other, or every third day. He says he loves it &amp; if it ever runs out, he will definitely be buying more of this brand. He started out with the cheap puck style soap, and didn&#x27;t really like it much. This stuff is definitely a huge improvement &amp; well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This soap gets a really nice lather pretty easily and has only a faint, pleasant smell. It has also lasted me quite a while, compared to some other products.&lt;br /&gt;My only warning to prospective buyers is that it very much is a soap--it leaves behind that \\&quot;soap\\&quot; feeling on your skin that some shaving creams don&#x27;t, and you might have to wash your face a bunch of times to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> Recently finished up my tub after almost two years. I got this as my first shaving cream with a DE and brush. Foams up rather well for a soap, for this price. A good tub of Geo. F Trumper is about $30, this is only $12!</li>
            <li> Previously used Old Bond, and decided to make the switch to Proraso to save $. Lathers well, smells good, and makes for a good shave. Since it&#x27;s hard to find in stores, I bought in bulk and have been pleasantly satisfied with Proraso. When my stock runs out I might make a switch if I can find something cheaper that is of the same quality.</li>
            <li> When I first got the soap it STUNK. I was actually going to toss it but it was too expensive. Luckily I didn&#x27;t, because after a few days whatever was causing the smell dissipated and the actual scent is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it lasts forever. I&#x27;ve been using it every few days for over a year now and I&#x27;ve maybe gone through a third of it.</li>
            <li> This product works as advertised, and in combination with a badger hair brush makes for one of the smoothest shaves around. Plus, it feels exceptionally refreshing on the face!</li>
            <li> I love Proraso. I have multiple products from Proraso and they are all great. I don&#x27;t like how they have word minimums for the reviews.</li>
            <li> I recently began going with the old school shaving methods, and I believe this shaving soap is just splendid.&lt;br /&gt;First, it has it&#x27;s own little tub so no need to find another bowl to place the soap puck in.&lt;br /&gt;Second, it lathers quite easily. For someone with not much experience, I was able to get a rich lather without any trouble whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;Third, smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, it&#x27;s just great. lol&lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommend this to everyone who is shaving old school!&lt;br /&gt;Remember, old school, is true school!</li>
            <li> This has changed my shaving experience. I love the stuff. Using this and the badger brush that I got to go with it, makes shaving a pleasure, rather then a chore. While I don&#x27;t use it everyday, I use it about once a week. The routine and cool refreshing after shave feeling makes it treat.</li>
            <li> I received this shave cream as part of a gift set from my father for christmas. (along with a brush a DE safety razor) I was skeptical at first because this wasn&#x27;t like anything I had used before, but my expectations were far exceeded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works great. I shave everyday and so not only does cans of gillete or other gels get kinda spendy, they aren&#x27;t the best smelling in the world. It lathers up great with a brush, and it keeps the warmth of the water, which feels great on the face. A few swipes or swishes in the bowl will do it to fill up my brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it about every 1 or 2 days since December 25 and I would wager I still have 6 months left of shaving. This stuff is great for the price and you&#x27;ll get your moneys worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife loves the smell of this stuff and it stays in the beard (or mostache) for a little while after, giving a nice after-scent. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Long-lasting and provides a medium weight lather. Scent is somewhat soapy, not as pleasant as its menthol and eucalyptus content would suggest, but it is my go-to now that Kiehl&#x27;s product for the brush has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> I only recently tried brush and soap to replace my Edge Gel.  I tried the Proraso Sensitive Skin version first.  Great.  But this is 15% better - smoother and a little more lather.  Nothing else to say...I&#x27;ll never go back to a can!</li>
            <li> Full disclosure I don&#x27;t use this anymore as I don&#x27;t use my safety razor.  However this is a ton of shave soap and it lathers up really well. I&#x27;ve bought a couple of these over the years as I occasionally decide to go back to the safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need a lot. Start out with about a dime sized amount and work your way DOWN from there.  You almost definitely won&#x27;t ned more than that. Given that amount you can see why this will last so long.</li>
            <li> Given all the rave reviews, I decided to give this a try. It is a little expensive side (my other shave soap is a locally-made shave soap that costs one-third of the cost of the Proraso). Despite the higher cost, the Proraso is fantastic, and with only a few swipes of the brush, it lathers really well. The menthol feels great, too! I&#x27;ve used it for a week, and it barely looks like I&#x27;ve scratched the surface.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!!! Comes in a decent sized bowl and lasts for a long while!</li>
            <li> First. I bought this 8 months ago and only now am I starting to see the bottom. I still have alot of the sides. Likely this will last another month or 2. This is also shaving EVERY weekday as well as shaving my head every 2 weeks. And, no, Im not mistyping. I read in another review that it lasted him 6 months. It does last that long as long as you don&#x27;t hold it under the faucet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now why is it 4 stars. It&#x27;s not the best lather I&#x27;ve had. You have to have a perfect amount of water in your brush. Too much and it gets watered down and runs. Too little and it doesnt lather at all. If you get it just right it&#x27;s useable. It doesn&#x27;t feel soapy or leave a film. Its very much just a lubricant for the blade. Some lathers seem to make your skin feel like it adds moisture to your skin or makes it feel healthier, for lack of a better word. This doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;ll help from cutting yourself, but thats about it. I, much to my demise, have sensitive skin. I can expect to get some burn on my neck as long as I don&#x27;t let it grow for more than 3 days. Side note: No smell from what I can tell. Though I tend not to have the best nose. And, for those who care, this is a hard soap. Not the cream style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase this again. Almost a year for a single canister is definetely worth every penny for daily use. It just doesnt run out. I will, however, purchase a different  soap for special occasions.</li>
            <li> Love this soap. Love it. With a caveat at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a really great product. It smells and feels refreshing on your face, it&#x27;s especially invigorating in the morning. It makes an excellent lather once you get the mix right and if like me you wondered when considering to buy it, if the menthol or eucalyptus will make any cuts you might give yourself sting, it doesn&#x27;t. This is smooth as silk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caveat: I don&#x27;t know if water quality or hardness has any bearing on the matter or not, but this soap dries out my skin a bit when I use it by itself. To fight this drying effect I add four drops of glycerin to every batch I make to enhance the lather and when I do it that way the lather is truly amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to convey just how long this pot of soap will last you, I&#x27;ve been using it every day for two months and recently have begun using more product just to make more lather and run through it, and I still feel like I&#x27;m only just starting to make a dent in it. Instead of asking myself how long this is going to last, I find myself asking the question of \\&quot;When the hell is it going to run out so I can justify going out and trying something different.\\&quot; Being that I&#x27;m a satisfied Proraso customer, I might as well and get something else to try just for the hell of it, because the only valid excuse I could have for not using this soap would be simply to change it up every once in a while. If you wait till you&#x27;re out that&#x27;s going to be a long while to wait.</li>
            <li> I bought this March 11, 2012.  I haven&#x27;t even used half of it.</li>
            <li> I love the scent.  Most of the ingredients seem to be ok, as well.  Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I love this Proraso shaving soap.  Others have complained about a new formula, but I have no complaints.  Having no point of reference I can&#x27;t judge the new vs the old.  Proraso is my go to shaving soap, the cream is just as good.</li>
            <li> I added this soap on to complete an order and am I glad I did. I like the container except it is a bit hard to open at times. But what is inside is worth it. This soap lathers well and has a pleasant scent. It also rinses clean. My first Proraso product will not be my last. I will be checking out others.</li>
            <li> I recently tried my first container of Proraso, and after learning how to use it correctly I must say this is the finest shave I&#x27;ve had in my 55 years. If you&#x27;re having a problem with this shaving soap then I suggest checking out YouTube and learning how to use it. It leaves my face cool, tingling and smells great. Love this stuff and will never use canned shave cream again.</li>
            <li> Well, now I think I understand why men used to go to the barber for a shave.  A little more effort, but this stuff with a badger brush and a DE blade is the cleanest shave I have ever experienced.  There&#x27;s something to be said for not tinkering with perfection...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan. It kindof burned my face. I gave it as a gift at that point, and the recipient used it all no problem, so YMMV. I&#x27;ve had better luck with the Trumpers pucks.</li>
            <li> Without question, the best shaving soap I have ever used.  I get the closest shaves and don&#x27;t have to worry about messy gels and cans.  Works equally well with new world and old school razors.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0015UWUFM Proraso Shaving Soap 5.2 oz (147 g)]][[ASIN:B000RIAD0W Proraso Pre and Post Shave Cream - 3.6 oz]]&lt;br /&gt;I found this in an Italian grocery store in Baltimore and have been recommending it ever since.  The shaving cream by itself produces a subtle tingling sensation, and if you apply a thin layer of the pre and post shave cream before you lather up the sensation becomes more intense - a good thing.  If you use a good double edge razor and shave properly, it&#x27;s great way to start the day.  If the day turns out to be kind of crappy, it might even be the highlight.</li>
            <li> Not only is this an excellent shave soap, but it smells wonderful! It goes on smooth and comes off clean. It&#x27;s not sticky, messy, stinky or greasy. In fact, I&#x27;ve often considered just using this as my go-to face soap, regardless of whether or not I&#x27;m shaving...a bit impractical, though. The menthol provides a mild anesthetic effect, so even if you get clumsy and cut yourself, it almost never hurts and cleans up nicely, usually clotting invisibly by the time you&#x27;re done shaving. My wife has even started using it, though I wish she hadn&#x27;t commandeered my shave brush for her underarms...</li>
            <li> A little too fresh for me personally. I can&#x27;t use this every day, I still go to my more tame sandal woods for daily use, and use this just for special occasions when I want to get REALLY close for that Baby Butt Smooth shave.</li>
            <li> My husband has become an avowed shaving soap convert thanks to this item. This container has lasted over one year.</li>
            <li> Good lather.  Best in its price point.  New formula ruined the scent, though, IMO.  Smells similar to wet cardboard now.  I switched to their sandalwood.  I like it very much, but am on the hunt for a new menthol option.</li>
            <li> Update: This is a fantastic buy! I have been using this for almost three years!</li>
            <li> A wonderful soap that feels great and is perfect for safety razors.</li>
            <li> I like it in general. The only con is it doesn&#x27;t lather as quickly as others, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> Been using it now for about a month really have no complaints at all Works just as promised nice shaving soap I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Bought this in the summer of 2011 and I have barely put a dent in it. Works very well and and has a pleasant scent. Also extremely cost effective for those who like me who consider that type of thing.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Shaving Soap. It has a nice scent. The container lasts about 3 months for me. That&#x27;s saying a lot since I shave my head every 2 days.</li>
    </ol>
