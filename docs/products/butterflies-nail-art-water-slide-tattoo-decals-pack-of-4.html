            <li>It was a perfect gift for my friend who likes this staff.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with these nail art stickers.</li>
            <li>This pack has all colors butterflies &amp; sizes, perfect for Butterfly Lovers like myself.</li>
            <li>Very nice product look so beautiful brights colors</li>
            <li>Great for a couple days, but then starts to crack and peel off.</li>
            <li>Very happy with my purchase :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them with and without color polish - and they look really nice!</li>
            <li>Beautiful and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and very nice</li>
            <li>Great for Art Craft....also fun too!</li>
            <li>Would love to find more of these types!</li>
            <li>Good quality, good color, easy to use very pretty.</li>
            <li>Very easy; just follow the instructions; you will want more after trying these just once</li>
            <li>and I love these.</li>
            <li>All the butterfly designs came from this pack except the one on the ring finger, I have gotten so many compliments.</li>
            <li>LOVE THEM</li>
            <li>I LOVE Butterflies</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and stays put.</li>
            <li>The colors are bright too - they show up on a natural nail with a clear top coat, but they really look great on top of a color coat!</li>
            <li>so when I saw this - i had to get it!&lt;br /&gt;These little &amp;#34;tattoo&amp;#34; stickers are beautiful!!</li>
            <li>These are water tattoo&#x27;s and very easy to use and wear very well.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what more you could want - but when you apply a clear top coat, that protects them even more.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Received quickly, easy to apply, looks great on light or dark nail polish!</li>
            <li>I would only buy this product again for a special occasion, However, they are beautiful but someone would have to completely encapsulate the product to get more wear out of it.</li>
            <li>very nice set pf water slide nail tattoos, they go on easily and can the position can be carefully reposiyioned before sponging them dry.</li>
            <li>I love that there are 4 different color sheets!</li>
            <li>And the flower &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; I received are SO pretty</li>
            <li>The only thing I wish was that they had more straight forward butterflies instead of sideways flying butterflies.</li>
            <li>a nice variety of sizes for different size nails and making different designs.</li>
            <li>so I use a UV lamp&amp;#62;, apply the sticker &amp;#60;s&amp;#62; as directed, apply clear top coat, dry</li>
            <li>Not a good candidate for just gel top coat to protect the design or even regular Top Coat.</li>
            <li>Stickers just as described, vivid colours!</li>
            <li>The colors and details are vivid.</li>
            <li>So far the stickers have lasted 6 days.</li>
            <li>slightly pricey but not bad, will purchase again</li>

            <li> a sheet for free &amp;#60;i got the one in the bottom left of the photo and had at least 50 little flowers on the sheet&amp;#62; - and for the price- you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> hard - Paint your nails with color or clear, dry &amp;#60;i</li>
            <li> so my hands/fingers/nails get wet all throughout every day, and the stickers are still there, looking like they were just applied!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not</li>
            <li> I know because I did!&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely purchase again and DO recommend to any of you who like a little decoration on your nails!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t understand the complaint with this product.</li>
            <li> It was a waste and seemed like something they just wanted to get rid of which is disappointing.</li>

I would only buy this product again for a special occasion, However, they are beautiful but someone would have to completely encapsulate the product to get more wear out of it. Not a good candidate for just gel top coat to protect the design or even regular Top Coat. NEEDS TO BE ENCAPSULATED!</li>
            <li> Great for Art Craft....also fun too!</li>
            <li> Beautiful and easy to apply. LOVE THEM</li>

            <li> I LOVE Butterflies so when I saw this - i had to get it!&lt;br /&gt;These little &amp;#34;tattoo&amp;#34; stickers are beautiful!! I love that there are 4 different color sheets! The colors are bright too - they show up on a natural nail with a clear top coat, but they really look great on top of a color coat! And the flower &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; I received are SO pretty ~ Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand the complaint with this product. These are SIMPLE to apply! So far the stickers have lasted 6 days. I take a shower/bath, do dishes, water my gardens EVERY day - so my hands/fingers/nails get wet all throughout every day, and the stickers are still there, looking like they were just applied!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not hard - Paint your nails with color or clear, dry &amp;#60;i have gel nails so I use a UV lamp&amp;#62;, apply the sticker &amp;#60;s&amp;#62; as directed, apply clear top coat, dry and you&#x27;re done. I&#x27;ve used them with and without color polish - and they look really nice! They do have a layer of protection on them, so I don&#x27;t know what more you could want - but when you apply a clear top coat, that protects them even more.&lt;br /&gt;Really - you are getting about 34 stickers on each sheet, so you&#x27;re getting about 136 stickers, PLUS a sheet for free &amp;#60;i got the one in the bottom left of the photo and had at least 50 little flowers on the sheet&amp;#62; - and for the price- you can&#x27;t beat it. You&#x27;ll pay $3 to $5 PER sheet in a beauty supply store~ I know because I did!&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely purchase again and DO recommend to any of you who like a little decoration on your nails!</li>
