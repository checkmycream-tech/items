            <li>Also, it&#x27;s great even if you have sensitive skin, like I do.</li>
            <li>I have tried many tanners and I am familiar with the preparation before you apply.  </li>
            <li>It was also easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and smooths out easily.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;QUICK AND EASY TO USE</li>
            <li>I was able to return for a full refund</li>
            <li>Worked great the only issue I had is</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly once you shake it out of the container.</li>
            <li>and if you are in a hurry and are looking white and want a great looking tan I would order Tantalize and the tan looks like a tan</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a lotion so as long as you exfoliate real good first</li>
            <li>This tanning lotion leaves my skin looking like a gorgeous, natural, bronze tan.  </li>
            <li>It moisturizes, smells nice and gives a very natural (and not overdone) appearance to my skin.</li>
            <li>I LOVE that this product produces a tan level depending on how much you use.</li>
            <li>I was very excited about receiving this product, however I was very disapointed.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work for  me - left streaks and was orangey looking - too much money for results that aren&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li>I tried this product for the first time last week and I loved it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>it blend s right into the skin</li>
            <li>Also, I remember using tanning lotions in the past that were rather stinky, but the smell of this one was great.</li>
            <li>Exfoliate first and then apply evenly so the color is uniform.</li>
            <li>I am always very hesitant to use any product on my sensative skin, but I used Tantalize and didn&#x27;t break out at all!</li>
            <li>I use to be a avid bed tanner</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used a sunless tanning product since they first came out because of the orange color and the streaking.</li>
            <li>and I was able to put my regular clothes on - all without STAINING!</li>
            <li>I love the product I am on my second bottle</li>
            <li>Tantalize delivers exactly what it claims.  </li>
            <li>This goes on smoothly and dries quickly without any streaks or lasting odor.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a quick fast tan that looks as real as &amp;#34;THE REAL THING&amp;#34; this is the product for you.  </li>
            <li>(I used a dry brush) and be sure to spread it evenly all over you shouldn&#x27;t have any problems with streaks either.</li>
            <li>Came in fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very moisturizing as well</li>
            <li>didnt really see much tan tone..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying this!</li>
            <li>It might be marginally better than the run-of-the-mill tanners but after just one application I look a bit jaundiced, just as I do with any other self-tanner.</li>
            <li>Moisturizes and locks in the color LONGER than other TOP SHELF PRODUCTS</li>
            <li>For a co-founder to ignore your feedback (it was not critical, just factual), especially after they asked for it, tells me that there&#x27;s a good possibility they will not have as premium of products as they envision having in the future.  </li>
            <li>I looked like I spent a few days at the beach and was very pleased with the results!</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m nearing 50 and starting to see my first tiny wrinkles around my eyes, it will be nice to look like I spend time in the sun without compromising my skin any further!</li>
            <li>Costs LESS than TOP SHELF PRODUCTS that can be 3 x as much!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only way to get better is to accept helpful feedback, acknowledge it and do something about it, especially when it comes from paying customers.</li>
            <li>you can not use it when you are older as it brings out brown spots on your skin</li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t stain my furniture when I sat on it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a bit older with cancer in my family history so being in the sun is out.</li>
            <li>It may simply be a matter of mastering the application technique - however, I wished it were more forgiving of human error!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>When I emailed her back to tell her that after having malignant melanoma cancer, I started using self-tanners of all kinds (areosol spray, mousse and lotions) and have for years, but that Tantalize sprayed on blotchy (it was actually very blotchy), she wrote back, did not thank me for the feedback even though she contacted me and requested it and basically told me to exfoliate and spray the right distance and use a hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Pretty simple and my skin was soooo soft after application!&lt;br /&gt;Within</li>
            <li>The best feature about it was that it truly did not smell bad after application - even on the next day.  </li>
            <li>There is no  orange coloring, so it resembles a natural tan.  </li>
            <li>It gave me a natural looking tan</li>
            <li>The color is quite natural looking.</li>
            <li>I have always gone tanning but decided that at 25 years old it&#x27;s time to smarten up and start protecting my skin.</li>
            <li>Well let me tell you, I am far from orange.</li>
            <li>Mostly natural and nourishing to my skin</li>
            <li>The results are orange-free, streak-free and natural looking.</li>
            <li>even that aside this gives me a very natural looking tan and it does not dry my skin.</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s not absorbed quickly, it has that odd self-tanner smell (milder, yes, but it&#x27;s still very much there), and it doesn&#x27;t look natural at all.</li>
            <li>It has a light smell that is not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>It provides a natural, even color and lasts much longer than I expected.</li>
            <li>I like to look like I have spent the time working on a healthy tan, but do not want the damage from the sun or the harsh chemicals from some self-tanners.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so my skin wasn&#x27;t only tan but soft too!</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to try a self tanning lotion at first because I have seen some streaky, orange results from other products.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still looks so brown and natural a week later.  </li>
            <li>(My skin is very pale and I&#x27;m guessing that, like other self-tanners, the stuff must work better on darker skin.)</li>
            <li>However, the tan result I got in some places was streaked - apparently I missed several areas.  </li>

            <li> There is no  orange coloring, so it resembles a natural tan.  </li>
            <li> It gave me a natural looking tan</li>
            <li> The color is quite natural looking.</li>
            <li> I have always gone tanning but decided that at 25 years old it&#x27;s time to smarten up and start protecting my skin.</li>
            <li> Well let me tell you, I am far from orange.</li>
            <li> Mostly natural and nourishing to my skin</li>
            <li> The results are orange-free, streak-free and natural looking.</li>
            <li> even that aside this gives me a very natural looking tan and it does not dry my skin.</li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s not absorbed quickly, it has that odd self-tanner smell (milder, yes, but it&#x27;s still very much there), and it doesn&#x27;t look natural at all.</li>
            <li> It has a light smell that is not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> It provides a natural, even color and lasts much longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> I like to look like I have spent the time working on a healthy tan, but do not want the damage from the sun or the harsh chemicals from some self-tanners.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so my skin wasn&#x27;t only tan but soft too!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try a self tanning lotion at first because I have seen some streaky, orange results from other products.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still looks so brown and natural a week later.  </li>
            <li> (My skin is very pale and I&#x27;m guessing that, like other self-tanners, the stuff must work better on darker skin.)</li>
            <li> However, the tan result I got in some places was streaked - apparently I missed several areas.  </li>
            <li> I applied it for a few days in a row and barely no color developed.  </li>
            <li> Despite what everyone else has written, I quite frankly don&#x27;t see that this is any different from any other self-tanner.</li>
            <li> Streaks leaves splotches and takes a very long time to dry.  </li>
            <li> Dry Skin</li>
            <li> it was dry</li>
            <li> I have always said, &amp;#34;tanned fat is prettier than white fat&amp;#34; as I am carrying a few extra pounds.</li>
            <li> A second spot-application on a hidden section of skin proved that subsequent applications will just darken that yellow cast to the usual orange.</li>
            <li> this past summer we had rain everyday and did not see the sun as much</li>
            <li> I was afraid the lotion itself might be very dark, but it turned out to be the same color as my skin, which is just lightly tanned.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try TANTALIZE with some reservations after experiencing oompa loompa orange results from other products.</li>
            <li> I break out from all other self Tanning products.</li>
            <li> I typically use one coat</li>
            <li> I heard it reacts with dead skin, so I didn&#x27;t want to be orange.</li>
            <li> applied this lotion (with gloves because of my skepticism) and used very little.</li>
            <li> I have used or tried many and this is one of the worst!</li>
            <li> is that the change is extremely slow and you&#x27;ll need a few weeks to get the look of a tanned body so plan accordingly.</li>
            <li> I have been using it every day for the past week</li>
            <li> Shipping was prompt as usual from amazon</li>
            <li> This is the fifth product I&#x27;ve used at least once.  </li>

            <li> I was hesitant to try a self tanning product after several bad experiences, but decided to give this one a try. So glad I did! It&#x27;s perfect! This goes on smoothly and dries quickly without any streaks or lasting odor. No staining on my clothes or hands. It provides a natural, even color and lasts much longer than I expected. The best part- after applying, my skin felt so smooth and hydrated! LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> I would recommend Tantalize as a sunless tanning solution.  Tantalize is very smooth when applying, and moisturizes the skin.  It has a light smell that is not overwhelming.  The color washes off of your hands and does not stain clothing.  The more you apply, the darker the tan. There is no  orange coloring, so it resembles a natural tan.  Exfoliate first and then apply evenly so the color is uniform. Great solution for a tan without the damaging sun rays!</li>
            <li> I am always very hesitant to use any product on my sensative skin, but I used Tantalize and didn&#x27;t break out at all! I looked like I spent a few days at the beach and was very pleased with the results! Now that I&#x27;m nearing 50 and starting to see my first tiny wrinkles around my eyes, it will be nice to look like I spend time in the sun without compromising my skin any further! Great product!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on the strength of the reviews I read here. Despite what everyone else has written, I quite frankly don&#x27;t see that this is any different from any other self-tanner. Per instructions, I exfoliated fully, and with a loofah and scruffing cleanser, before application. Still, it&#x27;s not absorbed quickly, it has that odd self-tanner smell (milder, yes, but it&#x27;s still very much there), and it doesn&#x27;t look natural at all. It might be marginally better than the run-of-the-mill tanners but after just one application I look a bit jaundiced, just as I do with any other self-tanner. A second spot-application on a hidden section of skin proved that subsequent applications will just darken that yellow cast to the usual orange. (My skin is very pale and I&#x27;m guessing that, like other self-tanners, the stuff must work better on darker skin.) The sickly-sweet odor follows me around as well. In addition, my skin remained a bit sticky for some hours after application. (Granted, it was a quite hot/humid day.) In any case, I won&#x27;t be using the rest of the bottle, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> This item is awesome. Came in fast. Worked great the only issue I had is I did not rubbed it enough all over so it left streaks.</li>
            <li> I have not use a product like this before...but it adds color that comes out good. I use to be a avid bed tanner and I love tanning...but do not tan any more at this time. dcm</li>
            <li> Great natural looking tan! Also, smells good &amp; reduces appearance of cellulite. I highly recommend this product!!! Also, it&#x27;s great even if you have sensitive skin, like I do.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use with the color guide in the lotion, smooth, with no smelly self-tanner odor:-) I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This tanner is horrible.  Streaks leaves splotches and takes a very long time to dry.  I have tried many tanners and I am familiar with the preparation before you apply.  My advice would be DON&#x27;T PURCHASE!</li>
            <li> This product produces a nice even tan for me and I like the color. However, it tends to wash away after showering.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used home tanning products in years because my last experience with them I turned a fake orange! However, I thought I&#x27;d give it another try since spray tanning at the salon can be pricey and time consuming. Well I tried this product and loved it! It gave me a natural looking tan and it actually started working instantly because there is some bronzer in the lotion. It was also easy to apply. It&#x27;s just a lotion so as long as you exfoliate real good first (I used a dry brush) and be sure to spread it evenly all over you shouldn&#x27;t have any problems with streaks either. Also, I remember using tanning lotions in the past that were rather stinky, but the smell of this one was great. It&#x27;s got a nice tropical smell and it&#x27;s not all girly smelling (my boyfriend loved the smell too) so I think it would be great for guys too (he&#x27;s thinking of trying it too now). It&#x27;s also very moisturizing as well so my skin wasn&#x27;t only tan but soft too! So I definitely recommend. It&#x27;s a great product and definitely the best tanning product I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> Gives a believable tan.  I put a double application on my legs and feet which lasted for over a week before needing another application. It is easy to apply and smooths out easily.  I have always said, &amp;#34;tanned fat is prettier than white fat&amp;#34; as I am carrying a few extra pounds.</li>
            <li> Jennifer (co-founder) sent me an email and said she would &amp;#34;really love to hear my feedback&amp;#34;.  When I emailed her back to tell her that after having malignant melanoma cancer, I started using self-tanners of all kinds (areosol spray, mousse and lotions) and have for years, but that Tantalize sprayed on blotchy (it was actually very blotchy), she wrote back, did not thank me for the feedback even though she contacted me and requested it and basically told me to exfoliate and spray the right distance and use a hair dryer.  I had already informed her that I had a lot of experience with self-tanners.  For a co-founder to ignore your feedback (it was not critical, just factual), especially after they asked for it, tells me that there&#x27;s a good possibility they will not have as premium of products as they envision having in the future.  The only way to get better is to accept helpful feedback, acknowledge it and do something about it, especially when it comes from paying customers.</li>
            <li> Terrible tanner.  I have used or tried many and this is one of the worst! Back to Tan Towels or Nuetrogena the best I have found</li>
            <li> didnt really see much tan tone.. but ingredients were good.</li>
            <li> This is all true:&lt;br /&gt;No&lt;br /&gt;-Orange Ugliness&lt;br /&gt;- Dry Skin&lt;br /&gt;- Bad Smell&lt;br /&gt;- Inconvenient Applicators that leave streaks and a fuzzy mess&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only heads up is that the change is extremely slow and you&#x27;ll need a few weeks to get the look of a tanned body so plan accordingly.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a quick fast tan that looks as real as &amp;#34;THE REAL THING&amp;#34; this is the product for you.  It&#x27;s better for you skin that the sun anyway, which leaves you with nothing but wrinkles and sagging skin.  This product has all the amazing antioxidant ingredients that will leave your skin looking healthy and silky and nourished.  Follow all the suggested tips for using this product and you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was also skeptical about buying a self tanner, but after reading the reviews I gave it a shot.  This stuff is FANTASTIC!  I used it on a Friday night, after exfoliating with a mitt I bought at the drug store, and some exfoliating scrub stuff.  Then, I watched a youtube video about how to apply self tanners.  I did what they said (e.g., putting lotion on the bendy parts, and also on inner wrists, knees, ankles, etc. so there is no darker places there) and I applied Tantalize. No awful smell.  Citrus smelling.  Nice.  Went to bed, woke up with a nice, even tan.  Applied it one more time on Sunday evening.  By Monday morning I looked like I had been at the beach for a week.  Oh, and I used it on my face, blending it with a dab of my normal moisturizer so it wouldn&#x27;t be too dark.  Lovely.  It&#x27;s still looks so brown and natural a week later.  Everyone at work asked how I got so tan over the weekend.  I recommended this to all my friends.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for  me - left streaks and was orangey looking - too much money for results that aren&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li> You need a mit to apply and it goe s on and it blend s right into the skin so you cannot  see it and it tend s to streak</li>
            <li> This product is as described by the product site. It goes on smoothly once you shake it out of the container. It is too thick for the pump mechanism. You can build up the tan in layers for the desired depth. The color is quite natural looking. Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product upon reading all the rave reviews. I&#x27;ve used it 3 days in a row NO color so disappointing.  Hoping I can get my money back.</li>
            <li> you can not use it when you are older as it brings out brown spots on your skin</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a sunless tanning product since they first came out because of the orange color and the streaking. A friend of mine convinced me that this product is different and IT IS!&lt;br /&gt;I applied this lotion (with gloves because of my skepticism) and used very little. I LOVE that this product produces a tan level depending on how much you use. (NO STREAKING!) This gives me total control of the tan level/look that I&#x27;m looking for. If I apply more or more often- my tan is darker.It&#x27;s nice to be able to apply this product a couple times throughout the day without having to sit still ,worry about stains, etc. Pretty simple and my skin was soooo soft after application!&lt;br /&gt;Within minutes of application,(which is great if I&#x27;m in a hurry) it was dry and I was able to put my regular clothes on - all without STAINING! It also didn&#x27;t stain my furniture when I sat on it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a bit older with cancer in my family history so being in the sun is out. This product allows me to look tanned without the health concerns and I LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;NO ORANGE COLOR&lt;br /&gt;NO STREAKING&lt;br /&gt;QUICK AND EASY TO USE&lt;br /&gt;DOESN&#x27;T STAIN&lt;br /&gt;GREAT SMELL&lt;br /&gt;Will use again.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for the first time last week and I loved it. I have always gone tanning but decided that at 25 years old it&#x27;s time to smarten up and start protecting my skin. I was skeptical of self tanners. I decided to try TANTALIZE with some reservations after experiencing oompa loompa orange results from other products. I took a shower, and exfoliated like crazy. I heard it reacts with dead skin, so I didn&#x27;t want to be orange. Well let me tell you, I am far from orange. It moisturizes, smells nice and gives a very natural (and not overdone) appearance to my skin. Another perk of it is that the lotion itself is colored, so you can see where it&#x27;s going to avoid streaks. I have been using it every day for the past week and I have a nice golden brown glow! I highly recommend buying this! I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I like to look like I have spent the time working on a healthy tan, but do not want the damage from the sun or the harsh chemicals from some self-tanners.&lt;br /&gt;I am on my second bottle of Tan-ta-lize for several reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Works Great--- nice Deep Bronze / No orange or streaks&lt;br /&gt;2. Healthy ingredients:  Mostly natural and nourishing to my skin&lt;br /&gt;3. Moisturizes and locks in the color LONGER than other TOP SHELF PRODUCTS&lt;br /&gt;4. Costs LESS than TOP SHELF PRODUCTS that can be 3 x as much!&lt;br /&gt;5. Smells devine....like you are at a tropical spa!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are in need of a self-tanner that really makes you look and feel great...&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T EVEN THINK OF GOING OFF OF THIS PAGE...&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS IT.  TRY IT.  YOU WILL LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I was very excited about receiving this product, however I was very disapointed.  I applied it for a few days in a row and barely no color developed.  It also had that self tannner smell to it.  I was able to return for a full refund</li>
            <li> This is the fifth product I&#x27;ve used at least once.  I was afraid the lotion itself might be very dark, but it turned out to be the same color as my skin, which is just lightly tanned.  It&#x27;s super creamy and easy to apply with just my hands, and smells nice.  The results are orange-free, streak-free and natural looking.</li>
            <li> Tantalize what a great product I live in Florida yes Florida and this past summer we had rain everyday and did not see the sun as much well I like going out and and hate being white I saw Tantalize Self Tanner on amazon I ordered it used as instructed and in a matter of minutes I had a great Tan! I love the product I am on my second bottle and if you are in a hurry and are looking white and want a great looking tan I would order Tantalize and the tan looks like a tan it DOES NOT make you look orange. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My views of this product are mixed.  The best feature about it was that it truly did not smell bad after application - even on the next day.  However, the tan result I got in some places was streaked - apparently I missed several areas.  I may try it again and see if the results come out differently.  It may simply be a matter of mastering the application technique - however, I wished it were more forgiving of human error!</li>
            <li> This was my second bottle. I have looked many years to find this product.  I break out from all other self Tanning products. I believe it is the sunscreen but even that aside this gives me a very natural looking tan and it does not dry my skin. I typically use one coat but you could go darker with additional coats. I love this product. &amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Again,</li>
            <li> stains clothes and skin</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this tanning lotion!  I was hesitant to try a self tanning lotion at first because I have seen some streaky, orange results from other products.  Tantalize delivers exactly what it claims.  This tanning lotion leaves my skin looking like a gorgeous, natural, bronze tan.  My friends couldn&#x27;t believe that my tan came from a bottle and now they are using it too.  After having excellent results on my legs and feet, I tried it on my face.  The results were great!  I don&#x27;t ever want to expose my face to harmful UV rays again.  Shipping was prompt as usual from amazon and I was tanned in time for the weekend!</li>
