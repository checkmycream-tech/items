            <li>I love the scent - the scent is the best selling point for me, although knowing I will not have a white pit stain on my shirt is a good deal as well!</li>
            <li>Smell is light and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Great wetness protection &amp; keeps me smelling fresh.</li>

            <li>What more can you ask for in a deodorant?  </li>
            <li>She is an athlete and would test it out better.  </li>
            <li>I have been in constant pursuit to find the perfect deodorant.</li>
            <li>this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I got one for free from BuzzAgent to test and bought my daughter one to get a better feel for the product.  </li>
            <li>I love the clean scent that is lingering - not overbearing, yet every now</li>
            <li>It worked fine for me.  </li>
            <li>Fine if you&#x27;re a guy, maybe, but I&#x27;m not.  </li>
            <li>Not too strong and clean smelling</li>
            <li>This is a great scent that will protect you all day long.</li>
            <li>I originally received this product as a sample in exchange for feedback on buzzagent.com</li>
            <li>so stress and appearance are always on the front--- so staying fresh is important to me.  </li>
            <li>Keeps me dry and smelling nice all day!  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t seem to hold up for long time, not like before, pleasant smell</li>
            <li>/&gt;The baby powder scent is very feint, PLUS a very strong floral scent, which I dislike, it does cover the sweat smell well, but it is far too strong that it conflicts with my perfume</li>
            <li>and I was so impressed with the long lasting feel.  </li>
            <li>I was very hesitant to try a new deodorant--- kind of like the</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using this product because even under the most stressful conditions this deodorant helped to keep my fresh and dry.  </li>
            <li>It is not always easy to find as it seems to be popular and it works very well throughout the day especially for stress sweat.  </li>
            <li>I feel that I don&#x27;t feel as fresh-- I need to put on another swipe of deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Over the years I have found Secret has the best deodorant for me.  </li>
            <li>I smell fresh all day. .</li>
            <li>I also think it has great scents that are not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I love using Subscribe&amp;Save to buy only the items I need for my household and beauty supplies.</li>
            <li>Know exactly what I am spending so</li>
            <li>Not all deodorants and antiperspirant aren&#x27;t able to back up their claims because of the lack of their products performance.</li>
            <li>This is my second favorite go to deodorant...</li>
            <li>I also like the gel because it goes on clean and dries clear.</li>
            <li>The new Secret Outlast is my new best friend!</li>
            <li>I am very particular about the smells of deodorant and</li>
            <li>Highly recommended-- both in price and in quality!</li>
            <li>I have actually been using this deodorant before I received the free sample to try.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like that it is unscented though</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t think that it was possible to get so excited about a deodorant before</li>
            <li>as most companies are actively removing ingredients that their customers are not in favor of.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give a full 5 star rate is because of the aluminum that is among the ingredients used.</li>
            <li>I am recently going through menopause and suffer from hot flashes which really tests your deodorant. .</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s long lasting!</li>
            <li>It lasts at least 24 hours and seems to be able to handle stress and high heat and humidity situations very well.  </li>
            <li>It goes on clear and does not get deodorant marks on your clothes.  </li>
            <li>I only received three and paid 33 much to dear</li>
            <li>It keeps me dry all day, even on hot summer days.  </li>
            <li>I will still use the product because it works very well, but not as much... just as the same with any other deodorant/antiperspirant that contains aluminum.</li>
            <li>Keeps me dry and fresh, not only ALL DAY, but until the next morning!!</li>
            <li>, it never dried during the entire hour walk.</li>
            <li>Hopefully in the near future, Secret will be able to create a formula that works just as well without aluminum...</li>
            <li>After my first week of using Secret Outlast I&#x27;m 100% shocked at how amazing it is!!  </li>

            <li> The only negative is that the bottle is misleading it is a large package but only about half of it is actually the deodorant.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast works well and keeps me feeling fresh.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as some of the other scented ones that I have used.</li>
            <li> I hate paying as much for deodorant than I do for a quick lunch!  </li>
            <li> It takes away all the sweat and makes me feel dry.</li>
            <li> If you want to put on your deodorant and have to stand there for minutes waiting for it dry, then this is for you.</li>
            <li> and then I get a whiff that tells me it is working to keep my dry!    </li>
            <li> It is an ooey, gooey sticky mess that is labeled a solid.</li>
            <li> My underarm area is very sensitive and I can only wear a couple of brands without irritation and Secret is one of them.  </li>
            <li> I expected 9</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that if I place a shirt on after I put on deodorant--</li>
            <li> It is not good for wearing with black tops or dresses - it will leave white marks on black clothes.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s due to the fragrance.</li>
            <li> This product combined with Sweat Block will do the trick if you are a heavy perspirer like me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I would say it works about as well as the regular secret brand, no better.</li>
            <li> Also as somebody else mentioned in a review, the knob to turn on the bottom is next to impossible if your hands are even slightly damp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not experienced any irritation with the Outlast line with the exception of the sport, it irritated my skin a little.  </li>
            <li> I usually use the Clinical Strength deodorant, both Secret and Dove--</li>
            <li> and I tried Secret Outlast--</li>
            <li> I tried Secret Outlast</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate the smell of deodorant mixed with sweat bit</li>
            <li> Unable to use product when it arrived.  </li>
            <li> Plus, I was looking like a chicken flapping its wings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff is nasty.</li>
            <li> I kept trying to raise my arms to let it get some air, but it smelled so awful that I gave up.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this one assuming it&#x27;s the same &amp;#34;powder fresh&amp;#34; scent that I always loved, but it&#x27;s not the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not their fault, this one is &amp;#34;powder&amp;#34; scent, not &amp;#34;powder fresh&amp;#34;, but in my opinion it should be renamed to Powder Floral scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The baby powder scent is very feint, PLUS a very strong floral scent, which I dislike, it does cover the sweat smell well, but it is far too strong that it conflicts with my perfume and I only applied very tiny bit of it.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to try a new deodorant--- kind of like the feeling-- why change when things are going well! I actually had the opportunity to try this product during a promotion.  Well, I took the plunge and I tried Secret Outlast-- at first I was not sure of the scent-- yes it is all about the scent.  I usually use the Clinical Strength deodorant, both Secret and Dove-- and they both last all day-- but honestly-- I hate paying as much for deodorant than I do for a quick lunch!  I tried Secret Outlast and I was so impressed with the long lasting feel.  And I did not have any deodorant marks on my shirts.  I was really impressed with the scent-- which is not the smell once you put it on-- it is a fresher smell.  The only complaint I have is that if I place a shirt on after I put on deodorant-- if I change my shirt-- I feel that I don&#x27;t feel as fresh-- I need to put on another swipe of deodorant.  I am on my feel all day and I work with many people and all kinds of people all day-- so stress and appearance are always on the front--- so staying fresh is important to me.  I was very impressed!  Highly recommended-- both in price and in quality!</li>
            <li> I received this product from Bzzagent, all opinions are my own.  I have actually been using this deodorant before I received the free sample to try.  Over the years I have found Secret has the best deodorant for me.  The Outlast is no different.  It goes on clear and does not get deodorant marks on your clothes.  It keeps me dry all day, even on hot summer days.  I also think it has great scents that are not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant and only thing that doesn&#x27;t make my under arms itch. It works wonderful! It takes away all the sweat and makes me feel dry.</li>
            <li> It is not always easy to find as it seems to be popular and it works very well throughout the day especially for stress sweat.  The price is really competitive but best to use as an add on for reaching the $35.00 free shipping minimum or if you have Prime.  The only negative is that the bottle is misleading it is a large package but only about half of it is actually the deodorant.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works pretty well, but I have to say it isn&#x27;t the best that I&#x27;ve tried.  I don&#x27;t really like that it is unscented though, I didn&#x27;t notice that part until after I had already received it in the mail so it was my fault.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as some of the other scented ones that I have used.</li>
            <li> Great wetness protection &amp; keeps me smelling fresh. Through out the corse of the day I walk the dog for an hr in the morning after my shower &amp; bike 4.8 miles to work in anything from 30-110 degree fare height weather. This stuff keeps me from having to take multipul showers in one day &amp; no pit stains to boot from it, love it!</li>
            <li> Unable to use product when it arrived.  the product in the container would not roll up to be usable.  I threw it away and cancelled further shipments</li>
            <li> I avoid Wally World. I love using Subscribe&amp;Save to buy only the items I need for my household and beauty supplies. I save a lot. Know exactly what I am spending so I can stick to a budget and it gets delivered to my front door. What could be more convenient?</li>
            <li> This deodorant is my favorite and I got a good deal through S&amp;S.  This deodorant is not too solid and not goopy.  Smell is light and pleasant.  It lasts at least 24 hours and seems to be able to handle stress and high heat and humidity situations very well.  It doesn&#x27;t leave lasting residues on clothing.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant! I wouldn&#x27;t think that it was possible to get so excited about a deodorant before but honestly this is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used. . I am recently going through menopause and suffer from hot flashes which really tests your deodorant. . I absolutely hate the smell of deodorant mixed with sweat bit this doesn&#x27;t happen with this brand. . I smell fresh all day. . I got to try this brand since I am a BzzAgent but this will be my brand from now on!</li>
            <li> I was given this product to try through BzzAgent.com.  I was not paid for this review and the ideas I am about to express are of my own opinion.  I have enjoyed using this product because even under the most stressful conditions this deodorant helped to keep my fresh and dry.  I also like the gel because it goes on clean and dries clear.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to deodorant.  It smells good, goes on clean, and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my clothes. Keeps me dry and smelling nice all day!  What more can you ask for in a deodorant?  It is not good for wearing with black tops or dresses - it will leave white marks on black clothes.</li>
            <li> This product combined with Sweat Block will do the trick if you are a heavy perspirer like me.</li>
            <li> After my first week of using Secret Outlast I&#x27;m 100% shocked at how amazing it is!!  The new Secret Outlast is my new best friend! I only have to apply it once in the morning! Keeps me dry and fresh, not only ALL DAY, but until the next morning!! Thank you Bzzagent.com for letting me test this amazing product for free!!</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast works well and keeps me feeling fresh.  My underarm area is very sensitive and I can only wear a couple of brands without irritation and Secret is one of them.  I&#x27;ve not experienced any irritation with the Outlast line with the exception of the sport, it irritated my skin a little.  This is a great scent that will protect you all day long.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t seem to hold up for long time, not like before, pleasant smell but I rely on this for protection and this is not offering it. Not sure if it&#x27;s due to the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and works great!</li>
            <li> This works great! It provided the best protection that I have used thus far. It performs just as the label indicates. Not all deodorants and antiperspirant aren&#x27;t able to back up their claims because of the lack of their products performance. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give a full 5 star rate is because of the aluminum that is among the ingredients used. It has been said that it may be a cause for breast cancer in women. I will still use the product because it works very well, but not as much... just as the same with any other deodorant/antiperspirant that contains aluminum. I have a deodorant that does not contain it and will alternate its usage and which will depend on my activity level and need. Hopefully in the near future, Secret will be able to create a formula that works just as well without aluminum...as most companies are actively removing ingredients that their customers are not in favor of.</li>
            <li> I got one for free from BuzzAgent to test and bought my daughter one to get a better feel for the product.  She is an athlete and would test it out better.  It worked fine for me.  Does not work for 48 hours.  It lasted all day and through my daughters basketball practice.  But for me, and I work at a desk, it did not last through the night to the next day.  I would say it works about as well as the regular secret brand, no better.</li>
            <li> I have been in constant pursuit to find the perfect deodorant. I had come to wear men&#x27;s deodorant to cove the smell and sweat. Before purchasing this product I would like to know if it kept the white marks on my clothes nonexistent, and low and behold it did. This is a great product!!! I recived this deoderant as a test product and all my opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> This is my second favorite go to deodorant... I love the scent - the scent is the best selling point for me, although knowing I will not have a white pit stain on my shirt is a good deal as well! I love the clean scent that is lingering - not overbearing, yet every now and then I get a whiff that tells me it is working to keep my dry!    I originally received this product as a sample in exchange for feedback on buzzagent.com</li>
            <li> If I could give it zero stars, I probably would. This stuff is nasty. It is an ooey, gooey sticky mess that is labeled a solid. And no, it&#x27;s not the gel, it is labeled a solid. If you want to put on your deodorant and have to stand there for minutes waiting for it dry, then this is for you. You will have it on your clothes too as I&#x27;ve noticed when I&#x27;m washing my clothes. Also as somebody else mentioned in a review, the knob to turn on the bottom is next to impossible if your hands are even slightly damp. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I only received three and paid 33 much to dear I expected 9</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s long lasting!</li>
            <li> great deodorant. I am very particular about the smells of deodorant and this one is my favorite. Not too strong and clean smelling</li>
            <li> Great deodorant that does the job!</li>
            <li> I did not order this Do Not charge my card again!!!</li>
            <li> I bought a pack of five of these at Costco. I put some on and then immediately took the dog for a walk in 83 degree/90% humidity weather here in Houston. It seemed sticky and gooey but I figured it would eventually dry.&lt;br /&gt;Well, it never dried during the entire hour walk. I kept trying to raise my arms to let it get some air, but it smelled so awful that I gave up. Plus, I was looking like a chicken flapping its wings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More about the scent: it smells like men&#x27;s aftershave. Fine if you&#x27;re a guy, maybe, but I&#x27;m not.  It smells nothing like the scratch-and-sniff patch on the outside of the package. In fact, my own sweat smells better than this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now have to go take a shower to get rid of the smell.</li>
