            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>the pump works great for taking out any amount of lotion I desire.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy that I found the Fiji products.</li>

            <li>The smell is so good.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion and it smells great</li>
            <li>This works great no issues for my many allergies.</li>
            <li>While this isn&#x27;t the thickest lotion available, it has a most wonderful fragrance and every time I use it</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lotion ever!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This lotion smells amazing</li>
            <li>Yes, I realize an organic product should not have that kind of adverse affect on the system.</li>
            <li>Kind of defeats the purpose of \\&quot;organic\\&quot; lotion, no?</li>
            <li>The scent when on the skin lasts a while which is nice.  </li>
            <li>This scent is fragrant and people comment how nice I smell and ask if it&#x27;s honey.</li>
            <li>It is my new best friend.</li>
            <li>Amazon is the best place to purchase them in terms of pricing because Fiji products arn&#x27;t cheap but they are worth $$.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin very soft and smells great without the chemicals!!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best lotion I have ever used!!</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product twice from Amazon.com and love it.</li>
            <li>This lotion is lovely on the skin, however,my husband and even my pets can&#x27;t stand the overwhelming scent of this product.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of pineapple and coconut which is one of the reasons for buying this product.</li>
            <li>Also why would all organic spas carry their products and the company is endorsed by Oregon Tilth and most of their products are graded USDA organic which you can&#x27;t have if the product contains parabens?</li>
            <li>I personally love their Soaps, Body Oils and Sugar Polish.</li>
            <li>Love the scent sooooo much!&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li>I love the scent, I just wish this was a cream rather than a lotion.  </li>
            <li>I really love this lotion, just wish the cost was a bit lower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not, goes on great and absorbs fast without leaving that icky-sticky residue</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments and people ask me what I am wearing.</li>
            <li>Refreshing, not greasy.</li>
            <li>Is the best cream I have found in a long time.</li>
            <li>The lotion soaks in easily and is not oily or cakey feeling.</li>
            <li>Has a strong pineapple smell.</li>
            <li>I will tell you that it STRONGLY smells of pineapple and coconut, which is a very sweet smell, actually a good thing as far as I&#x27;m concerned, but you might want to bear that in mind when ordering; oh, and the scent lingers a bit, also a plus for me.</li>
            <li>I just get the Fragrance free.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and I will re-purchase.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic and the lotion is massagable, does not clump and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>Enjoy this</li>
            <li>, it leaves the skin soft, moisturized and smelling good, there is no greasy residue and</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and goes on easily, and its not greasy.</li>
            <li>When the pump stops working, there&#x27;s still a good amount of lotion at the bottom of the bottle, so using up the last of the product is not all that easy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also a huge fan of coconut oil products -- they absorb without any residue, and have tremendous health benefits.  </li>
            <li>according to supplementwarehouse.com, this product contains MORE than just pure coconut oil.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this lotion and its sweetly fresh scent of coconut and pineapple.</li>
            <li>Nice scent and lasting moisture.</li>
            <li>It gets absorbed by the skin promptly</li>
            <li>I love to use this lotion right after a shower it leaves my skin soft and</li>
            <li>Okay, so a small village might not be in harm of collective choking, but my God the scent in this is overwhelming!  </li>
            <li>The lotion smells great, but the scent doesn&#x27;t last-I prefer the scent to last several hours.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is nice - not overpowering but enough to last lightly throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I never buy products w/o the ingredients listed, and if there are very lengthy words you can not pronounce, DON&#x27;T TRUST IT!</li>
            <li>Like all Fiji products it is what it says, all natural, organic, and works fantastic.</li>
            <li>and I like more of a butter like the Delon which I will get next time.</li>
            <li>The lotion feels good and isn&#x27;t oily or too thick, but the scent is a bit too powerful.</li>
            <li>Its lightweight, gentle, and smells delicious!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li>No smell which is important to me only organic things with no added chemicals work for me.</li>
            <li>Now sometimes organic scents can have allergic reactions to sensitive skin types so chose the Fragrance Free if you are sensitive.</li>
            <li>I end up looking like a snowman though - white all over my body because it doesn&#x27;t soak in right away.</li>
            <li>My new go to.</li>
            <li>they made an all natural body spray in this scent!</li>
            <li>I am pretty picky about only using natural ingredients for skincare and use coconut oil whenever I can.  </li>
            <li>It has the natural scent of just the ingredients.</li>
            <li>People learn to research and educate yourself, because anybody can sell a product with anything in it, and slap a label on it, and say it&#x27;s 100% natural or organic.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion and will definitely try the other fragrances, such as the jasmine.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Organic Fiji Nourishing Lotion totally moisturizes without being greasy, sticky, or slimy.  I love it!  It is my new best friend.</li>
            <li> Smells delicious; a perfect medley of pineapple and coconut! A quality product. I have purchased this product twice from Amazon.com and love it.</li>
            <li> This lotion is lovely on the skin, however,my husband and even my pets can&#x27;t stand the overwhelming scent of this product. The lotion feels good and isn&#x27;t oily or too thick, but the scent is a bit too powerful.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! Its lightweight, gentle, and smells delicious!&lt;br /&gt;Will not leave you greasy or sticky and my skin just drinks it up. Will buy again as well as other products from this brand.</li>
            <li> Okay, so a small village might not be in harm of collective choking, but my God the scent in this is overwhelming!  While I adore coconut and pineapple from now I will stick to that combo only at Baskin Robbins because this smell actually made my stomach hurt.  Yes, I realize an organic product should not have that kind of adverse affect on the system. It stumped me as well.  All I can think is there is something amiss with the ingredient label.  I have a chemical sensitivity and get stomach pains and or headaches from synthetic, non-natural products, sooo you figure it out.  Oh and the scent was difficult to get rid of even after several washings.  Ugh.  My stomach is hurting remembering that thick cloud of scent.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of pineapple and coconut which is one of the reasons for buying this product. The lotion smells great, but the scent doesn&#x27;t last-I prefer the scent to last several hours. It absorbs quickly and goes on easily, and its not greasy. I don&#x27;t recommend it if your skin is already dry as I find this lotion only moderately moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure I would order it again because of the lack of lasting scent and I feel it is also over-priced.</li>
            <li> according to supplementwarehouse.com, this product contains MORE than just pure coconut oil. specifically, it contains phenonip, which is a mix of is phenoxyethanol, methylparaben, ethylparaben, butylparaben and propylparaben. Kind of defeats the purpose of \\&quot;organic\\&quot; lotion, no?</li>
            <li> Nice scent and lasting moisture. I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> This lotion is awesome! The fragrance is nice - not overpowering but enough to last lightly throughout the day.The lotion soaks in easily and is not oily or cakey feeling. This is by far the best lotion I have ever used!!</li>
            <li> There is nothing that compares to his heavenly scent!  Not too overpowering, but enough to delight the senses.  I&#x27;m also a huge fan of coconut oil products -- they absorb without any residue, and have tremendous health benefits.  I am SOLD, I plan to use this the rest of my life!!!</li>
            <li> Great product.  It has a wonderful fresh scent and is a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Supplement warehouse knows nothing about Organic Fiji. Look at the difference in quality of the 2 companies websites! Organic Fiji products contain no parabens. Their facebook page and website clearly states this, and they constantly post about how bad and dangerous parabens are. Why would a company blog about the dangers of parabens if their products contain them? Also why would all organic spas carry their products and the company is endorsed by Oregon Tilth and most of their products are graded USDA organic which you can&#x27;t have if the product contains parabens? Their products contain the fewest and some of the purest organic skincare ingredients on the market! Now sometimes organic scents can have allergic reactions to sensitive skin types so chose the Fragrance Free if you are sensitive. It has the natural scent of just the ingredients. I personally love their Soaps, Body Oils and Sugar Polish. The soaps I like the tea tree Spearmint and cucumber melon. In the Oils and Polish I just get the Fragrance free. It spells like Coconut Oil, cause that&#x27;s all it is. The Polish is sugar and Coconut oil period.</li>
            <li> My new go to. I wish the scent lasted longer, but no worries. It smells fantastic and I will re-purchase. Love the scent sooooo much!&lt;br /&gt;Wish they made an all natural body spray in this scent!</li>
            <li> I enjoy this lotion and its sweetly fresh scent of coconut and pineapple. It gets absorbed by the skin promptly, it leaves the skin soft, moisturized and smelling good, there is no greasy residue and the pump works great for taking out any amount of lotion I desire. There is one thing I dislike, though. When the pump stops working, there&#x27;s still a good amount of lotion at the bottom of the bottle, so using up the last of the product is not all that easy.</li>
            <li> I love the scent, I just wish this was a cream rather than a lotion.  It takes forever to soak in the skin which is why I&#x27;ve rated is as I have.  The scent when on the skin lasts a while which is nice.  I end up looking like a snowman though - white all over my body because it doesn&#x27;t soak in right away.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion. It makes your skin very soft and smells great without the chemicals!!</li>
            <li> I agree with Reader 100% about this product.  It defeats the purpose...this is why I always say, you must know your ingredients, so you won&#x27;t be fooled. People learn to research and educate yourself, because anybody can sell a product with anything in it, and slap a label on it, and say it&#x27;s 100% natural or organic. I never buy products w/o the ingredients listed, and if there are very lengthy words you can not pronounce, DON&#x27;T TRUST IT! It&#x27;s a chemical.  You never know what you are rubbing into your skin.</li>
            <li> I really love this lotion, just wish the cost was a bit lower. I live in the Midwest, and our winters can be really harsh and hard on the skin. Dry heat from the furnace doesn&#x27;t help either, so when I ordered this it was desperately needed and I really hoped it would not be sticky and uncomfortable like a lot of lotions I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s not, goes on great and absorbs fast without leaving that icky-sticky residue I can&#x27;t stand. My skin feels soft and silky. I will tell you that it STRONGLY smells of pineapple and coconut, which is a very sweet smell, actually a good thing as far as I&#x27;m concerned, but you might want to bear that in mind when ordering; oh, and the scent lingers a bit, also a plus for me.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells good, works great. Like all Fiji products it is what it says, all natural, organic, and works fantastic. I love to use this lotion right after a shower it leaves my skin soft and the smell is wonderful not over powering. I&#x27;m so happy that I found the Fiji products. Amazon is the best place to purchase them in terms of pricing because Fiji products arn&#x27;t cheap but they are worth $$.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic and the lotion is massagable, does not clump and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> This scent is fragrant and people comment how nice I smell and ask if it&#x27;s honey. I like the pump feature and it does smell great.  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars as it doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin as I would like it to.  It is a thin consistency and I like more of a butter like the Delon which I will get next time.</li>
            <li> Has a strong pineapple smell. When you apply the lotion it feels sticky even after its rubbed in.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion and it smells great</li>
            <li> Is the best cream I have found in a long time. The smell is so good. I don&#x27;t even add perfume. I get so many compliments and people ask me what I am wearing. Enjoy this</li>
            <li> While this isn&#x27;t the thickest lotion available, it has a most wonderful fragrance and every time I use it I am asked what it is by those who experience the fragrance.  I checked the bottle, which is on my desk, and it does not list any of the nasty ingredients reported by another reviewer.  I love this lotion and will definitely try the other fragrances, such as the jasmine.</li>
            <li> Refreshing, not greasy. No smell which is important to me only organic things with no added chemicals work for me. I have very bad allergies. This works great no issues for my many allergies.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion ever!  I am pretty picky about only using natural ingredients for skincare and use coconut oil whenever I can.  This lotion smells amazing and I am very happy with the ingredient list.  I love it!</li>
