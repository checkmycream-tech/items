            <li>These were definitely good.</li>
            <li>I was excited to start stretching my ears with these and they worked perfectly until I got to 2g.</li>

            <li>I made sure it wasn&#x27;t just me not matching them up correctly</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>and I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>Took a bit to ship but that was ok with me.</li>
            <li>I would buy it again :)</li>
            <li>.. love em</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Pretty good for acrylic tapers.</li>
            <li>They are good and im pretty sure they will fit</li>
            <li>Perfect for sensitive ears, very comfortable, fast shipping</li>
            <li>First time stretching my ears and these are perfect and inexpensive, especially since i&#x27;m not going to be needing them when I size up.</li>
            <li>Came super early and are great</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this amazing product to my friends!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best set of tapers for someone who just wants to size up fast or just doesn&#x27;t wear it all the time.</li>
            <li>and you really can&#x27;t find any better for the price.</li>
            <li>Overall good product I would say.</li>
            <li>Overall, $5 is a good price</li>
            <li>but overall it was good</li>
            <li>For the price these are not bad at all.</li>
            <li>Other than that, they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li>It came here really quick</li>
            <li>the sizes are not labeled but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>These are the spikes you can actually wear also as they are longer than most of the metal ones.</li>
            <li>but you really cannot beat this $5 for a kit to about 00</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really get all my pieces</li>
            <li>the others on the other hand were fine.</li>
            <li>They skipped the next size (0g) and went straight to 00g</li>
            <li>yes it came with everything it said it would in a small baggie not labeled or individual plastic and broke easily</li>
            <li>Just wish they were labelled and the bands stayed on to hold tapers in place, you&#x27;re better off without wearing the rubber bands in front &amp; behind.</li>
            <li>the sizes are not labeled but other than that they work very well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never stretched my ears before, so I wanted to get a kit to help do it.</li>

            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong with these. Perfect for sensitive ears, very comfortable, fast shipping and you really can&#x27;t find any better for the price.</li>
            <li> When I got to size 10 one of them were bigger then the other. I made sure it wasn&#x27;t just me not matching them up correctly but even my friend said that one taper was smaller but bigger thn 12</li>
            <li> these was perfect for the healing proccess.</li>
            <li> Pretty good for acrylic tapers. I just wish the tapers were labeled with the gauge sizes. Overall good product I would say.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never stretched my ears before, so I wanted to get a kit to help do it. Since I would only be wearing each size for a short amount of time, I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune. This kit is awesome! Plain black matches everything, and I can&#x27;t wait to be at 00! I definitely recommend this kit!</li>
            <li> Great. It does the job. Did not come labeled but you can still figure out the sizes. Went up to 2g with these and had no problems.</li>
            <li> For the price these are not bad at all. These are the spikes you can actually wear also as they are longer than most of the metal ones. A+</li>
            <li> Ordered these a couple of weeks ago and now got them in the mail. They&#x27;re just what I wanted! the sizes are not labeled but it was worth the wait. Good price for these too. 100%!</li>
            <li> So i got these for my friend that wanted to get gauges, and since they came in the sizes that she can change to properly stretch them. They are good and im pretty sure they will fit but when i got them the smallest ones were broken so now i dont know if she can properly stretch her ears now the others on the other hand were fine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to write a review but it requires me to on this stupid phone so there we go.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 5 stars because these tapers were much to my satisfaction, great product! I would definitely recommend this amazing product to my friends!</li>
            <li> Ordered this product on May 25th and received them June 5th when the estimated delivery date was June 18th. All the pieces were in the package and I&#x27;m very happy with them. First time stretching my ears and these are perfect and inexpensive, especially since i&#x27;m not going to be needing them when I size up. Only disadvantage is them not being labeled but they have the sizes listed in the info for the product online so it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> These are working well for me, but I got 3 of one size and 1 of another.  Overall, $5 is a good price and I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> It came here really quick and it came out all perfect !</li>
            <li> Just wish they were labelled and the bands stayed on to hold tapers in place, you&#x27;re better off without wearing the rubber bands in front &amp; behind. Def. Would Recommend though,</li>
            <li> I was excited to start stretching my ears with these and they worked perfectly until I got to 2g. They skipped the next size (0g) and went straight to 00g so I couldn&#x27;t stretch them anymore. It would&#x27;ve been awesome to have received all the pieces I ordered. Other than that, they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li> thought these came with plugs and they don&#x27;t. gave them to a friend.</li>
            <li> the sizes are not labeled but other than that they work very well i am now at 4g i was at 10g when i got the kit but you really cannot beat this $5 for a kit to about 00g is amazing</li>
            <li> The sizes are mixed up and 2 pairs dont have a matching size with them. I&#x27;m going to have to do it one ear at a time.</li>
            <li> It came Feb 18th, when the estimated delivery date was March 6th. I have all sizes up to 00 and they are comfortable and the pieces are nice and sleep and the product is all around perfect! One of the BEST purchases I have gotten from Amazon</li>
            <li> yes it came with everything it said it would in a small baggie not labeled or individual plastic and broke easily the plus size was everything was there and came in two weeks of being ordered.</li>
            <li> Wish it had sizes, but it does the job. Took a bit to ship but that was ok with me.</li>
            <li> Came super early and are great but they dont label sizes so I dont know which sizes im using lol</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really get all my pieces but overall it was good I would buy it again :)</li>
            <li> They were excellent .. streched my ears using these..&lt;br /&gt;It was a painful experience but.it turned out as planned.. love em</li>
            <li> I used these to stretch my lobes and never had a single problem. These were definitely good.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best set of tapers for someone who just wants to size up fast or just doesn&#x27;t wear it all the time. It is great for the price. I love it.</li>
