            <li>This item is excellent!</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved it!  </li>
            <li>A good wig brush is the best.</li>
            <li>hair itself works great</li>
            <li>i thought it would be like 10 inches or atleast the picture length, but the hair was felt good.</li>
            <li>Not so good quality as I thought being.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this hair!  </li>
            <li>The product was very smooth and silky and has a good sheen.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would buy 2 packs for full look but the hair is beautiful</li>
            <li>It was the perfect length for me as I usually weave and then cut, so this worked out perfectly.  </li>
            <li>It is the best hair I love the styles and the texture, it is soft and it does not brake off.</li>
            <li>This in 8 inch hair and my bundles looked layered so I would say more like 7 1/2 inches.</li>
            <li>It would look more like the senior woman who wear the layered bob wigs.</li>
            <li>and I am sure I will be able to reuse it once or twice.</li>
            <li>Love it,nice...</li>

            <li>I absolutely love this</li>
            <li>It was ok when I took it out the Box ...</li>
            <li>All in all my bob was ok</li>
            <li>I love this hair.</li>
            <li>love the way it swings around when I turn my head.</li>
            <li>You will be able to run your fingers through it to straightened it out.  </li>
            <li>So I decide go online to my favorite online shopping store Amazon and this is how I find this hair .</li>
            <li>I may start wearing more weaves now and this will be my brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This hair is pretty good for the price.  </li>
            <li>I love it and it is easy to manage.</li>
            <li>and I loved it so much</li>
            <li>It is so easy to care for.</li>
            <li>Weft easy to sew through.</li>
            <li>The hair was fine</li>
            <li>Silky smooth.</li>
            <li>but when I received it I was excited with what I got.</li>
            <li>Others are depending on your reviews to purchase the product give true reviews people.  </li>
            <li>The hair is short but good quality.</li>
            <li>but you must buy 2 for a full head.</li>
            <li>I would buy this again just to make a quick wig</li>
            <li>I would suggest this to any woman wanting a really straight smooth look.</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of hair in the past and this is by far one of the best for the money!!!!  </li>
            <li>Cute, if you want a short layered look but it would not look like the woman&#x27;s hair in the picture.</li>
            <li>I tried this for the first time.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time ordering this hair</li>
            <li>so we know exactly what we are getting.</li>
            <li>I made a wig out of this hair and it was lovey at first.</li>
            <li>but i only purchased one pack, and&lt;br /&gt;i wished someone would&#x27;ve posted needing more than the one pack since the&lt;br /&gt;Duby</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another thing is make sure whoever does the hair, does it right because I can imagine someone doing a poor job to such a high quality good hair..</li>
            <li>It was nice for a little while, then it started falling out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very manageable.  </li>
            <li>It was also very speedy delivery.  </li>
            <li>This hair has too much tangling going on at the nape area.</li>
            <li>Even my stylist wants one since she claims its 45 for each one at the store.</li>
            <li>The hair is very versible.  </li>
            <li>You can wear it curly or straight.</li>
            <li>What you pay, is what you get, after about 2-3 weeks, the hair started to get really tangled at the nape.</li>
            <li>It was soft, but then the hair came of the weft in huge amounts, and it wasn&#x27;t able to hold curls or a bump since it&#x27;s short enough for a bob style, also there wasn&#x27;t much hair in the box..</li>
            <li>I love it, I never like wearing weaves until I decided to go natural and needed something to do with my hair until it grows  in without doing the big cut.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s OK hair.</li>
            <li>style looks similar to picture and I am sure it will last</li>
            <li>But it does look and feel realistic.</li>
            <li>I have had it in for over 2 weeks and the hair is still soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>But apparently everyone knows that Duby is short.  </li>
            <li>I was a little upset at first thinking that the description didn&#x27;t say how short the hair is.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Long story short i returned it.</li>
            <li> it is pretty thick</li>
            <li> It looks natural and it&#x27;s a little pass my shoulders.</li>
            <li> Meaasured between 6-8 inches long not what i thought.</li>
            <li> Not as long as the photo suggestions.</li>
            <li> It is not as long as the model in the pic tho.  </li>
            <li> It was pretty thin....  </li>
            <li> I am a sew-in fanatic and when I want a short hairstyle, this is the only product I will use.  </li>
            <li> The hair was shorter than expected.</li>
            <li> but it was shorter than what i expected.</li>
            <li> The hair is nice except I thought I was getting 10 inch but received 8 inch a little disappointed</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it does lose color when washed or rinsed.</li>
            <li> I cut it a little and from here on, this is what I will always wear.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll have to buy the closure as it is separate, but all I have to do is add a little oil since I wash often.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a little shorter.  </li>
            <li> but, if you put a little hair grease and heat on it, it keeps it from tangling.  </li>
            <li> too short poor quality</li>
            <li> but I had to keep curling it everyday and cleaning up a lot of hair after.</li>
            <li> It sheds very little and does slightly tangle after about a week....</li>
            <li> Very little shedding.</li>
            <li> It is just as pictured in the photo, the length was past my neck.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why everyone is so confused with the length when is says 8 inch on the package!!</li>
            <li> just wrong length.</li>
            <li> So I decided to try a weave to keep me from getting mad and perming it again.</li>

            <li> I can recommend this hair anyone who need a excellent quality hair.  I love it and it is easy to manage.I only wish it was a big longer.</li>
            <li> This in 8 inch hair and my bundles looked layered so I would say more like 7 1/2 inches. Cute, if you want a short layered look but it would not look like the woman&#x27;s hair in the picture. It would look more like the senior woman who wear the layered bob wigs. After buying it, 2 hair stylists showed me wigs that they made with it. It looked just like my neighbors wig and she is 70.</li>
            <li> Not sure why everyone is so confused with the length when is says 8 inch on the package!! Others are depending on your reviews to purchase the product give true reviews people.  The hair is short but good quality. I do like it, it does curl it is pretty thick but you must buy 2 for a full head. style looks similar to picture and I am sure it will last and I am sure I will be able to reuse it once or twice.</li>
            <li> Love it,nice...thank you</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hair!  I use it all the time and I will continue to use it.  I am a sew-in fanatic and when I want a short hairstyle, this is the only product I will use.  It&#x27;s very manageable.  I work out a lot and I don&#x27;t have time to do my hair and get to work on time.  This hair allows me to just bump the edges and go!  It was also very speedy delivery.  Will continue to buy from this company!</li>
            <li> i thought the hair would touch my shoulders since i was getting a a-symetrical bob done. but the hair was to short to do so. Meaasured between 6-8 inches long not what i thought. i thought it would be like 10 inches or atleast the picture length, but the hair was felt good. just wrong length.</li>
            <li> Love it. It looks natural and it&#x27;s a little pass my shoulders. It does not shed and affordable. I only needed one box.</li>
            <li> This hair has too much tangling going on at the nape area. The cut was perfect, but the quality sucked.</li>
            <li> too short poor quality</li>
            <li> The Bomb! The best hair and I have the best stylist in the San Diego County California area! It is so easy to care for.</li>
            <li> I love this hair. I have short dreads so I have this sewn on top and I love it. Even my stylist wants one since she claims its 45 for each one at the store.</li>
            <li> Not as long as the photo suggestions. The front bang will only reach to your cheekbone maybe. Other than that, it&#x27;s OK hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality item, texture, color .. I recommend.</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time.  I was a little upset at first thinking that the description didn&#x27;t say how short the hair is.  It appears to be between 10 - 12 inches.. But apparently everyone knows that Duby is short.  I absolutely loved it!  It was the perfect length for me as I usually weave and then cut, so this worked out perfectly.  It is just as pictured in the photo, the length was past my neck.  I cut it a little and from here on, this is what I will always wear.  For Remi, the price is wonderful.  I am tempted to buy several, so that I would have some in stock, in case the price should go up.  I absolutely love this hear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will not shed.  I have washed it 3 times now and it is still in tact.  I wash once a week.  you&#x27;ll have to buy the closure as it is separate, but all I have to do is add a little oil since I wash often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing is make sure whoever does the hair, does it right because I can imagine someone doing a poor job to such a high quality good hair..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As stated earlier, when I opened the package, I was thinking it was short, but it is just as pictured.  It is absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li> Would definitely purchase again.  Does not shed, does not knot.  It is not as long as the model in the pic tho.  It is a little shorter.  But it does look and feel realistic.</li>
            <li> Silky smooth. 8in. Weft easy to sew through. Very little shedding. Do not need to style once it is sewn in. Will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> The hair was shorter than expected. i thought It was 10 in by the Q&amp;As but its only 8</li>
            <li> This was my first time ordering this hair and I loved it so much i ordered it for a second time!!!!</li>
            <li> The hair was fine but it was shorter than what i expected. I was expecting to get the 10&amp;#34;-12&amp;#34; one and i received the 8&amp;#34; one. I wish the seller would have put it in the description so we know exactly what we are getting. Long story short i returned it.</li>
            <li> It was ok when I took it out the Box ... It was soft, but then the hair came of the weft in huge amounts, and it wasn&#x27;t able to hold curls or a bump since it&#x27;s short enough for a bob style, also there wasn&#x27;t much hair in the box.. It was pretty thin....  All in all my bob was ok but I had to keep curling it everyday and cleaning up a lot of hair after.</li>
            <li> I love this hair. The product was very smooth and silky and has a good sheen.&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it swings around when I turn my head. I would suggest this to any woman wanting a really straight smooth look. My only complaint is that it does lose color when washed or rinsed. I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of hair in the past and this is by far one of the best for the money!!!!  I have had it in for over 2 weeks and the hair is still soft and manageable.  I have even washed it twice.  It sheds very little and does slightly tangle after about a week....but, if you put a little hair grease and heat on it, it keeps it from tangling.  You will be able to run your fingers through it to straightened it out.  A good wig brush is the best. The hair is very versible.  You can wear it curly or straight. I would definitely get it again and will.</li>
            <li> I love it, I never like wearing weaves until I decided to go natural and needed something to do with my hair until it grows  in without doing the big cut. So I decided to try a weave to keep me from getting mad and perming it again. I have gone to the beauty supply store and brought a different weave style. It was nice for a little while, then it started falling out. So I decide go online to my favorite online shopping store Amazon and this is how I find this hair . It is the best hair I love the styles and the texture, it is soft and it does not brake off. I may start wearing more weaves now and this will be my brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> The hair is nice except I thought I was getting 10 inch but received 8 inch a little disappointed</li>
            <li> This hair is pretty good for the price.  However, I found that the ends would get tangled when it touched my clothes and coat.</li>
            <li> I made a wig out of this hair and it was lovey at first. What you pay, is what you get, after about 2-3 weeks, the hair started to get really tangled at the nape. I would buy this again just to make a quick wig</li>
            <li> This item is excellent! I love everything about the hair; initially I was skeptical buying hair product from Amazon but when I received it I was excited with what I got.</li>
            <li> I would buy 2 packs for full look but the hair is beautiful</li>
            <li> Not so good quality as I thought being.</li>
            <li> You will need two packs of this hair definitely for fullness&lt;br /&gt;The hair itself works great but i only purchased one pack, and&lt;br /&gt;i wished someone would&#x27;ve posted needing more than the one pack since the&lt;br /&gt;Duby packs you only need one, but in this type of pack you need two.</li>
