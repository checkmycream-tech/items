            <li>I LOVE THID PRODUCT AND WILL ALWAYS USE IT</li>
            <li>I was a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic for my face, I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year.</li>
            <li>Use it for about a month to see result, if you want something cheap that works, I guess.</li>

            <li>i absolutely would recommend this for anyone who has battled with acne for years as i have!</li>
            <li>It makes my skin face feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li>this stuff doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>I have used this product and it seems to really refresh the face</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really see a difference -</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just a normal face wash.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get a lot of acne normally though, just one or two pimples around my chin and forehead.</li>
            <li>In the past I have used products that work great for a few days and then my skin gets use to it and it stops working but not this cleanser.</li>
            <li>This stuff doesn&#x27;t exactly clear up anything.</li>
            <li>So I was hoping this would help get rid of my blackheads and clear up the flesh colored bumps I have had on my temples</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin at all so for this to do that to my face</li>
            <li>The blackheads are leaving and my grandson&#x27;s face has cleared up considerably in just one month.</li>
            <li>I used the whole tube, lasted a long time using it with the Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li>Now everybody has a different face with different problems but if yours is blackheads (mainly on the nose) like mine</li>
            <li>I found the old version for this in the back of my closet.</li>
            <li>I started applying it to my entire face about three days ago, and my face feels so soft, and not gressy..</li>
            <li>So first of all, I always got bumps on my forehead during the summer, they normally went way in the winter and late fall days.</li>
            <li>I just use it to clear my acne and as long as I use it once a day, it works.</li>

            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an exfoliator tough enough for oily skin, but wont cause redness, this is it.</li>
            <li> My blackheads were no better for having used it.  </li>
            <li> I looked up Proactive to find out that if you stop using it you skin goes crazy because of some addictive drug in it.</li>

            <li> is stop my face from breaking out like crazy like it was.</li>
            <li> I was so shocked, so I applied it again.</li>
            <li> This product did nothing but BREAK my skin out in a terrible rash that lady over a week.</li>
            <li> was terrible.</li>
            <li> But it seem like my outbreaks were getting worst.</li>
            <li> I tried Deja Vu, by being swindled at the mall for it, and it was horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I almost never review products but I had to write something for this. Not only has it reduced the size of the pores on my nose, but it has also helped with under-the-skin whiteheads I tend to get, as well as whiteheads I get overnight from sleeping in a more humid house (skin gets clammy when I wake up). With my old cleanser I would go to bed clear and wake up with small whiteheads in my T-zone. This stuff has eliminated those now. Works great. I have combination skin and it helped a lot.</li>
            <li> This product did nothing but BREAK my skin out in a terrible rash that lady over a week. I do not have sensitive skin at all so for this to do that to my face was terrible. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> This product works great. Within 2 uses I could tell a difference. It is effective at clearing up blackheads and leaves skin feeling soft and clean. It is good for people of all skin types and I would recommend anyone having a blackhead problem to use this product.</li>
            <li> wife uses this 3 times a week and sure enough follow the directions and bam bye bye blackheads her face cleared up in two weeks to no blackheads period.</li>
            <li> Was not that impressed with it. It did not help to clear my skin, only dried it up. I am happier with my current acne soap.</li>
            <li> Package arrived on time and in good condition. This stuff doesn&#x27;t exactly clear up anything. I already knew that blackheads are super hard to keep away unless you give yourself a facial at least once a week. But, I was hoping it would help. It doesn&#x27;t. Maybe it&#x27;s because I wear make up but even with facials this stuff doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> It cleans your face, but that&#x27;s about it.  I used the whole tube, lasted a long time using it with the Clarisonic.  My blackheads were no better for having used it.  I still broke out.  It basically didn&#x27;t improve anything, but seemed to clean well.  Warning: burns like the dickens if you get it in your eyes!  Finding a product that ACTUALLY tackles blackheads is a continuing, life-long search...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got finicky skin, so when I find a product that works, I sing it to the hills!  This is one of them.  If you&#x27;re looking for an exfoliator tough enough for oily skin, but wont cause redness, this is it. I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year and it still works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> So first of all, I always got bumps on my forehead during the summer, they normally went way in the winter and late fall days. But it seem like my outbreaks were getting worst. I looked up Proactive to find out that if you stop using it you skin goes crazy because of some addictive drug in it. I tried Deja Vu, by being swindled at the mall for it, and it was horrible. I found the old version for this in the back of my closet. I had nothing to lose so I tried it. I put it on at night and washed it off and went to sleep. I did not wash my face anymore until the next night. When I looked in the mirror I was a HUGE difference. I was so shocked, so I applied it again. From that day to now it has been a week and 85% of the bumps on my forehead are gone. I started applying it to my entire face about three days ago, and my face feels so soft, and not gressy.. I LOVE THID PRODUCT AND WILL ALWAYS USE IT</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic for my face, I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year. It makes my skin face feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I have used this product and it seems to really refresh the face but I havent seen any visible results as of yet...I guess I should&lt;br /&gt;have a little patience and wait a while longer.</li>
            <li> I have been using blackhead cleansers for years trying to get rid of blackheads on my nose and I thought I would give this one a try but unfortunantely it hasn&#x27;t been that great.  My face had a wierd bumpy reaction after the first few uses and although my blackheads appear less noticable i have been using it daily with the clearskin deep treatment mask for about three weeks and the blackheads are still there-i will continue use until the product runs out but will not be purchasing again</li>
            <li> My face feels clean after using it but I don&#x27;t really see a difference - it&#x27;s just a normal face wash.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this as a blackhead remover. I just use it to clear my acne and as long as I use it once a day, it works. I don&#x27;t get a lot of acne normally though, just one or two pimples around my chin and forehead. If your face is like mine, I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It works well.  I have noticed fewer blackheads with continued use.  My next step is to find an avon rep.</li>
            <li> The blackheads are leaving and my grandson&#x27;s face has cleared up considerably in just one month. It&#x27;s working for his sister too.</li>
            <li> this stuff works really great on my skin. i absolutely would recommend this for anyone who has battled with acne for years as i have! definitely a good buy! packaging was good, even received samples of other avon products from this seller!</li>
            <li> So I was hoping this would help get rid of my blackheads and clear up the flesh colored bumps I have had on my temples but all this facial wash has done is stop my face from breaking out like crazy like it was. Which isn&#x27;t a bad thing but any facial wash I use can do that. Its alright but doesn&#x27;t do what it says.</li>
            <li> Use it for about a month to see result, if you want something cheap that works, I guess.</li>
            <li> BEAUTIFUL PRODUCT TO USE</li>
            <li> The product is okay, mainly for cleaning your face.  It does not get rid of blackheads, but it does exfoliate the skin nicely.  I don&#x27;t think there is any product that can expel blackheads out of your skin.</li>
            <li> I received this product a while ago but I decided to wait till I&#x27;ve used it all to do a proper review. The shipping on this was GREAT I got it in 2 days which was awesome. Now acne hasn&#x27;t ever been my problem but blackheads have. So I was looking for something that focused entirely on that and this worked. It leaves my face soft and doesn&#x27;t have that residue that leaves it feeling stiff afterwords. In the past I have used products that work great for a few days and then my skin gets use to it and it stops working but not this cleanser. I have used it every night for a month along with the Body Shop tea tree toner and tea tree blemish lotion. Now everybody has a different face with different problems but if yours is blackheads (mainly on the nose) like mine I&#x27;d def recommend this cleanser.</li>
