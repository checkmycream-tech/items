            <li>This stuff is absolutely AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing</li>
            <li>It was wonderful to have it arrive so fast.  </li>
            <li>Nice job.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s mind and be one kind of curly, but</li>
            <li>It curls my hair nicely, and keeps it well hydrated.</li>
            <li>The cream smells nice and hold curl/waves in well without a lot of stiffness.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own thing here in this climate.  </li>

            <li>This is a nice curl cream.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the best leave-in that I have ever tried for my very curly hair.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it just kind of smooths your hair which is still nice but</li>
            <li>It helps keep your hair in a nice curl or wave and helps with frizziness.</li>
            <li>I was using Aveda&#x27;s curl spray that I liked a lot</li>
            <li>It does do a nice job shaping my curls without having that crispy/crunchy effect that gel has.</li>
            <li>Gives me nice curls without the frizz.</li>
            <li>If you rub between your hands and get it warm, it does apply easier.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice and does not leave my hair greasy.</li>
            <li>Manages my curls nicely-</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have to use heat or a diffuser anymore to make the curls look nice.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair at night and fall asleep with the curl control cream in my hair and when I wake up my hair has beautiful soft curls that i cant stop being happy about.</li>
            <li>It keeps their hair perfect all day even on days with high humidity or rain.</li>
            <li>I have found my new best friend!</li>

            <li>I think it is a good fit for curly, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>So far, all the Morrocan Oil stuff I&#x27;ve used has been the best.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own for most of my life, it never seems to do what I want it to do.</li>

            <li>I HAVE VERY FINE  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li>This version of their many curl creams works best in higher humidity with fine curly hair.</li>
            <li>my naturally curly  hair feels good and looks great.</li>
            <li>perfect curl without any of the crunch that you get from most of the other curling products you see - smells amazing too!</li>
            <li>Not crazy about their shampoo, but this is an amazing product!</li>
            <li>This has a strong but nice scent.  </li>
            <li>This was easy to buy and I am loving the product.</li>
            <li>Until this product came along I was lucky to have one good hair day a month.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and am always getting compliments.</li>
            <li>I have tried to get my hair stylist to get me more to no avail.</li>
            <li>Been using it for 2-3 years now and still love it.</li>
            <li>(I think), and I tried out that method of handling my hair and it worked like magic.  </li>
            <li>I love this product on my curly hair.</li>

            <li>, they&#x27;re much more manageable, and my Sweetheart loves the smell.</li>
            <li>Love this product, but my review is for the fulfilment.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many curl products</li>
            <li>comb some more.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)    </li>
            <li>My hairdressers always ask me how my hair stays so healthy even though I dye it, the answer is this product.</li>
            <li>, maybe some hairspray if I&#x27;m going out on the town and want a more controlled defined look.</li>
            <li>I love it as well.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love my curls now.</li>
            <li>favorite part about this product is the way it smells.</li>
            <li>It helps control frizz better than anything else I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>this moroccaoil curl control is ok.</li>
            <li>a bit greasy but ok.</li>
            <li>product, but could be better.</li>
            <li>I give this one 6 stars, its fantastic!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love the way it smells too.</li>
            <li>I have healthy hair.  </li>
            <li>I really love the way</li>
            <li>- you don&#x27;t need to add more product until you wash again.</li>
            <li>I love the Moroccanoil Treatment</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>It has a nice light smell that is not cloying or overpowering.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>Is this the magic bullet?</li>
            <li>I used to have frizzy hair, but now it is a lot more controlled.</li>
            <li>However, this product would be better named \\&quot;curl control cream\\&quot; because I wouldn&#x27;t say it \\&quot;defined\\&quot; my curls.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I have recommended this product to a lot of people and most decided to buy it for themselves.  </li>
            <li>love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my hair smell</li>
            <li>I love this curl cream.  </li>
            <li>The awesome scent is not present.</li>
            <li>This is NOT an AUTHENTIC Moroccan Oil product.  </li>
            <li>I am die-hard MO fan, but have encountered a lot of bogus MO products on Amazon that claim to be authentic.  </li>
            <li>This leaves my curls looking moisturized and healthy.</li>
            <li>I received so many compliments on my hair &amp; the scent.</li>
            <li>really love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the volume it adds and the fact that it does bring out my curls.  </li>
            <li>I love how the product holds my curls, but I cannot stand the smell of the product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Take the time to apply it well and it will keep most of the frizz away for up to 4 days.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>It was just ok.</li>
            <li>This curl defining cream is my favorite curl cream product-</li>
            <li>the smell is really lovely and the texture just seems to work with my hair.</li>
            <li>I have mostly wavy hair and have tried for years to find something that enhanced my curls and controlled frizz.</li>
            <li>What I love about this product is it enhances curls without adding any of that dreaded crunch.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s favorite product for her curly hair...</li>
            <li>It also smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>But I do LOVE there hair spray and serum.</li>
            <li>Use the arms to tie it on do-rag style. :-)</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love the results.</li>
            <li>Air drying doesn&#x27;t cause frizz unlike some interesting magazine articles I&#x27;ve read.     </li>
            <li>Our hairdresser used this, and we fell in love with it, both its smell and</li>
            <li>Plus, it smells phenomenal.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m satisfied with the product itself.</li>
            <li>I love this this product.</li>
            <li>I combine it with leave in conditioner and a tiny bit of gel and my hair looks and smells awesome.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m totally pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I love this hair cream.  </li>
            <li>Spend more and get the Kevin Murphy product...</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love the product for the scent but also because my hair feels and looks healthier and bouncy.</li>
            <li>Before buying this, make sure you know what type of curly hair you have.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product for my curls.</li>

            <li>I love love love this product.  </li>
            <li>This product is OK...</li>
            <li>It is magic when it comes to reducing, if not eliminating frizz.  </li>
            <li>I thought this product would be more of a curl and define product,.</li>
            <li>so I was OK with price.</li>
            <li>Works very well, great for curly hair, minimizes frizz, and maintains curl</li>
            <li>and i absolutly love it.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>Not so sure I like the scent.</li>
            <li>my hairdresser turned me on to this stuff, at a whole lot more $$ - great to find it on amazon.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>so I was able to replace it</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>my hair was more bent than curled.  </li>
            <li>becomes more of a lotion.</li>
            <li>GLAD,MY HAIE LOOK BETTER.</li>
            <li>Love the Moroccanoil line.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Also, I love Moroccanoil products for their smell.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>Lovely aroma, too.  </li>
            <li>I love this curl cream.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I flip my head over and use a diffuser for more volume.</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>It makes my curls bouncy and my curls will hold for most of the day.</li>
            <li>curls right is like finding a good recipe and sticking with it.  </li>
            <li>super quick shipping, I have bought this product in a salon for much more and it is a great product</li>
            <li>I love this curl cream, my hair is super stubborn, but this stuff works like magic!</li>
            <li>For those of you who love the original Moroccanoil scent, you will adore this product!  </li>
            <li>torn on the pump mechanism: On the one hand, it seems to do a pretty good job getting a lot of the product out of the container.</li>
            <li>This however, is one of my favorites because it seems to soothe my scalp as well as my hair, and by first use you can tell its a good quality product.</li>
            <li>After searching for a really long time, I found this and its perfect.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t say this made my hair MORE curly, but it really does a great job at keeping my curls intact and smooth.</li>
            <li>I got complimented on my hair smelling good the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>The new Curl Control Cream has a great texture.</li>
            <li>The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because the fragrance, while pleasant, is really over powering to me.  </li>
            <li>This product works very well on both curly and straight hair, but the best feature is its scent...</li>
            <li>Even my boyfriend commented that after using it my hair looked curlier, smelled great, and was very soft.  </li>
            <li>Great product for naturally curly hair!</li>
            <li>Smells great and makes my hair so soft!</li>
            <li>Great for my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>keeps my hair soft, and smells great.  </li>
            <li>It works the best when applied to completely wet hair.</li>
            <li>Gives her great soft curls</li>
            <li>and it makes her hair smell fantastic :)</li>
            <li>and it defines my curls and leaves it soft and smelling great.</li>
            <li>Curly, soft, great smelling.</li>
            <li>The most beautiful curls develope and last until washing.  </li>
            <li>Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream does a great job controlling my curls and leaving my hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li>This bottle will last you ages aswell, it lasts me a good 3-4 months even with my teenager \\&quot;sharing\\&quot;!</li>
            <li>In tandem with Moroccan Oil original treatment her hair has never been better.</li>
            <li>so it frizzes easily.</li>
            <li>I wish the container wasn&#x27;t as easy to break...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best curl cream I&#x27;ve found, really defines curls and leaves your hair soft, and controls frizz.</li>
            <li>I felt the product has too strong of a smell.</li>
            <li>It is a strong smell, if you are looking for something unscented, this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li>It is way too strong and chemical smelling for me to want to wear or submit those around me to.  </li>
            <li>This product has a strong scent that everyone can smell around me.</li>
            <li>Smells are one of my triggers, and if you also suffer from any sort of head pain/migraines/odor allergies, I strongly encourage you NOT to buy this product.</li>
            <li>The smell is really strong though</li>
            <li>The odor was too strong.</li>
            <li>He says &amp;#34;it is strong when first applied, but it does smell nice after it sits a while.&amp;#34; (he&#x27;s quite blunt so not just being kind)--GOOD</li>
            <li>First off, this product smells amazing.  </li>
            <li>I have fine color treated hair that curls easily.</li>
            <li>Additionally, it makes your hair feel soft and smells AMAZING!</li>
            <li>So perfect for my wavy/curly hair which is fine and easily weighed down by product.  </li>
            <li>This is hands down the best product on the market for curly hair.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling weighed down and all the curls look great without that frizzy look!</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length wavy and fine hair.</li>
            <li>but I have fine hair strands.</li>
            <li>made my fine hair too crunchy</li>
            <li>I have fine curly hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine, curly hair</li>
            <li>I only made this mistake the first time I used it though, and ever since it has been great!  </li>
            <li>I have fine, wavy hair, but a lot of it.</li>
            <li>In the winter, the product does hold some curl, but doesn&#x27;t plump up fine hair as well.</li>
            <li>Too oily (LEAVES A STICKY FEELING) for fine hair.  </li>
            <li>If you have baby fine hair try another product.</li>
            <li>and I actually enjoy putting it on my hair because I know that yummy smell will last all day as I bounce around from the gym to work to happy hour and home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but nothing has ever made me happy to the point that I would wear my hair curly on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>product gives me fantastic curls.  </li>
            <li>My hair remained smooth, wavy &amp; frizz free.  </li>
            <li>And it makes my hair smell wonderful everyday.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>I use it with a Pro-L leave in conditioner and it takes my troll-hair and tames it into smooth curls.  </li>
            <li>I have coarse, curly, frizzy hair and this product works great for controlling it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight but mighty in it&#x27;s de-frizzing and curling capabilities.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a cream that would just help it along while also keeping it frizz free.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy and it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>Fantastic stuff.  </li>
            <li>9 times out of 10, I get out of the shower, smooth this over my hair, and go.</li>
            <li>It works so well that I can wake up the next morning, spritz it with water, scrunch and it looks great again.  </li>
            <li>I never use shampoo(hairdresser&#x27;s suggestion), because it robs my hair of its natural oils, but I always use a good conditioner and the Control Cream when my hair is still damp.  </li>
            <li>love it the product is so good, my whole life looking for a product that really helps with my rebel curls.  </li>
            <li>Leave my curls soft, and smelling really good.</li>
            <li>This product is far superior to any styling product.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps your hair frizz free and soft.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>I love this curl cream, it works really well for people like me with wavy hair that needs better definition.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous, soft curls.  </li>
            <li>Smells sooo good and leaves her hair silky soft.</li>
            <li>best product to tame frizzy and curly hair, people always complimented my curls</li>
            <li>and I have very frizzy hair!!!</li>
            <li>It would be cool if I could use it to touch up, or calm the frizzies that pop up on top of your head, but it makes it greasy instead.</li>
            <li>and you will also fall in love with it ;)</li>
            <li>Product is authentic and shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>but it is so worth it!</li>
            <li>Well worth it!</li>
            <li>Curly hair is as unique as one&#x27;s fingerprint...</li>
            <li>It is well worth the cost!</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about the scent...</li>
            <li>I originally purchased it for my wavy hair</li>
            <li>Love it, would buy again, it was much cheaper than the salon!</li>
            <li>The smell is however unnecessarily strong and disagreeable sweet, and now that I became pregnant</li>
            <li>This is great for me on days when I just want to towel dry my hair and let it just be curly.  </li>
            <li>I was going to purchase at beauty store for 37 dollars and that is the store that has everything super cheap all the time</li>
            <li>I think there are better, more natural products on the market.</li>
            <li>Lol but the next day I guess the smell absorbed into my hair because it wasn&#x27;t as stronge.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue (like silicone containing products), doesn&#x27;t leave it stiff and crunchy (yuck!), and best of all, it works!  </li>
            <li>(scent can be a little strong if you use too much, but still awesome).</li>
            <li>It really works well with my fine curly hair!  </li>
            <li>I use the pure Moroccan Oil in the Winter as well and love it.  </li>
            <li>Best hair product on the market for hard to manage curly hair.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and need very little for great curl definition.</li>
            <li>I first used it in Virginia while visiting family, the humid winter there created different curls than here in Colorado but still a great result.</li>
            <li>this product is amazing for naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this for the second time because I was so happy with my first purchase.</li>
            <li>My hair looks styled, natural, and holds on its own.</li>
            <li>It holds really well and just seems to make the hair curl better.  </li>
            <li>I have tried every product that I can find to control my very curly hair, and have a cupboard filled with rejects to prove it!</li>
            <li>I wanted straight cute cuts like todays styles.</li>
            <li>Too much will make the top of my hair greasy</li>
            <li>My hair has never been this soft before and my curls are nicely managed.</li>
            <li>He finally told me it was because he loved my perfume.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure not to put too much around your scalp...as it made my hair look oily.  </li>
            <li>and I loved this stuff the last time I ordered it</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been trying different products to try and find something that will do a good job of enhancing the curls I still have.</li>
            <li>Nice soft curls and waves without any stiffness.  </li>
            <li>I love this product because it smells fantastic and leaves my hair very soft and curly.</li>
            <li>I have extremely curly hair and this stuff works great with it.</li>
            <li>My hair looks natural not stiff but the product prevents frizz for a great hold.</li>
            <li>This way, my hair seriously looks and feels awesome.</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly and was priced well below what I have purchased it in hair salons.  </li>
            <li>Packaged well and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Thanks for such great service.</li>
            <li>This also doesn&#x27;t add much volume, which is great for those of us who have enough volume.</li>
            <li>Super curly.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice light musky/lovely fragrant yumminess that will last in your hair for a couple of days before needing to re-shower or reapply the product!</li>
            <li>Works great, I do have to use a lot since my hair is pretty long.</li>
            <li>I have super curly hair.</li>
            <li>And I really like the light, fresh fragrance it has!</li>
            <li>, a normal store must carry this product for way more.</li>
            <li>very fast shipping!</li>
            <li>The actual product works fairly well, but I like the old curl cream better.</li>
            <li>I love curling my hair with this product i dont live without it</li>
            <li>My dry, fine, frizzy hair is looking amazing - shiny, curly, no frizz.</li>
            <li>Made my hair super soft and eliminated all or most frizziness.</li>
            <li>Putting too much near the roots can cause your hair to get greasy more quickly.</li>
            <li>but I find that it also works great for straight styles I blow dry.  </li>
            <li>only thing I don&#x27;t love is the smell, it is a rather strong scent; however, to have the curls it is worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I think if you are looking for a more natural curly look (less structured) and frizz reducing serum, this is a GREAT product.  </li>
            <li>It smells like a mixture of a men&#x27;s aftershave and Moroccan Oil, very strong and barely airs out throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Works great for my curls but a little on the thicket side.</li>
            <li>The only reason why I gave it two stars was because it smelled amazing.</li>
            <li>If you have combination hair you will continue to have combination hair, but you will not hate it as much as you used to.</li>
            <li>It smells great and isn&#x27;t too heavy.  </li>
            <li>I recieved this in a few days from ordering, which was great.</li>
            <li>Fabulous hair product for my son&#x27;s very curly hair.......thesoapmaker.net</li>
            <li>Worth every penny</li>
            <li>It produces soft curls and the scent is wonderful/ exotic.</li>
            <li>Totally worth</li>
            <li>It has a strong, clean scent that isn&#x27;t too intrusive if you go for those kinds of soapy natural scents.</li>
            <li>Its well worth the money.</li>
            <li>But the main reason I would never buy it again is the strong scent this product has.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money?</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>it wish it was cheaper but worth it</li>
            <li>This is fully worth the price.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>Moroccan Oil is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m not crazy about it but don&#x27;t mind it either.</li>
            <li>This is worth the money for me.</li>
            <li>and like I said, worth the splurge.</li>
            <li>Product is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>my favorite product for my naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>This is my favorite by far.  </li>
            <li>Much better holding, soft curls, than Arrojo cream and lasts forever.  </li>
            <li>She said this product was better for my hair than the mousse I had been using, and so being a professional, I listened/followed her advice.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money if you&#x27;re someone like me who has struggled with unmanageable hair.</li>
            <li>Pricey but worth it</li>
            <li>Used it last night for work and it held my curls nicely</li>
            <li>Luckily I still had the nozzle from my first bottle</li>
            <li>a long life for sure!</li>
            <li>just right</li>
            <li>Try it you will love it and the price through amazon is very good (as long as you get a low shipping rate); in my local salon this product costs $32.</li>
            <li>I have very fine short hair.</li>
            <li>I put it on after the shower and sleep on it to give me more curls, then re-wet my hair in the morning and add a little more.  </li>
            <li>I should probably only give it 4 stars, because frankly, as far as curly hair products go, I swear by Ouidad and find it superior for taming frizz and keeping curls intact.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t really hold my curl at all, and left my hair kind of greasy.</li>
            <li>Apply to towel dry hair to give you a nice wavy beach look without the frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for taking a temporary break from TIGI&#x27;s curls rock which I really like, and it works OK as far as shaping the curls goes.</li>
            <li>You need just a small amount applied mostly on the ends of the hair and it dries in gorgeous soft ringlets.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other Moroccanoil products before and have been very pleased.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic if you have naturally curly hair!  </li>
            <li>Best to only use on the ends, avoid scalp, as it can leave the hair stiff and &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; feeling.</li>
            <li>Very highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>My hair is very unruly so the fact that it makes such a huge dent is good enough for</li>
            <li>, so intense cream would be great if you have very tight course curls.</li>
            <li>The best part is you only need very little of the cream.  </li>
            <li>I was concerned about the smell when I first used it because it&#x27;s pretty perfume-y.  </li>
            <li>Pretty embarrassing to give a gift without a cap.</li>
            <li>my \\&quot;northern\\&quot; hair products just wouldn&#x27;t work in the higher heat and humidity.  </li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t, I just dampen my hair gently (using my hands) and voila!</li>
            <li>So, I spend most of my day under a computer room floor with hundreds of server fans blowing my hair in numerous directions.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>: I accidentally dropped this bottle outside as I was loading my gym bag in the car, and the top broke off and the spring came out...</li>
            <li>Appreciated the cost and convenience capability!</li>
            <li>I love this product and use it a lot especially during the summer.  </li>
            <li>product did exactly what it said it would -</li>
            <li>This curl cream is fantastic for wild curly/frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>It is expensive, but it is wonderful.</li>
            <li>and ive tried so many different products for her hair.</li>
            <li>I have used it ever since I tried it the first time.  </li>
            <li>Cover you head lightly with an old cotton tshirts.</li>
            <li>of this Moroccan Oil Curl Cream and starting from the back (since your hands have the most product, there is the most hair in the back) scrunch hair toward top of head.</li>
            <li>This was first used on my hair by a hairdresser in Ireland</li>
            <li>I have used this stuff for years and it never fails me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got 2A/2B curly hair, and Moroccan Oil Curl Defining Cream works pretty well for me.</li>
            <li>and they even refused to refund the first time.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different products and none have worked as well as Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream.  </li>
            <li>Would definitely buy more of this again.  </li>
            <li>This arrived with the bottle all scratched up and cheap looking, with the nozzle completely dysfunctional.</li>
            <li>Will use more next time</li>
            <li>Tends to be heavier to rinse out but overall pleased.</li>
            <li>It really helps define the curls!</li>
            <li>I waited a few weeks to get a good sense of the product before I posted this review.  </li>
            <li>maybe smooth down the top a bit.</li>
            <li>This great for soft curls to wavy hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>This product is definitely worth it, leaves my hair super soft and curly.</li>
            <li>There is no other product on the market as good as this one, at least I have not found one that is better.</li>
            <li>I have fine natural, wavy hair and this product does absolutely nothing for my waves.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for thick, wavy, curly hair-- that is unruly and coarse!</li>
            <li>I brushed this aside, and went ahead and squeezed some of the product into my palm -- and of course, the smell became more intense.</li>
            <li>However the THIS line, along with the intense curl cream, and hydrating cream made my curls light, the smell is AMAZING!, and it actually conditioned my curls, without weighing them down, no flakes, no hard crunchy feeling!</li>
            <li>The best part is, you only need a small amount per day and it lasts FOREVER!</li>
            <li>Did make my curls soft, but nothing special.</li>
            <li>Other reviewers kept saying they loved the fragrance but the main drawback (not a deal breaker yet) for me is that this fragrance is not subtle and</li>
            <li>easy to use, works great and makes curly hair look terrific, not dried out and frizzy...and lasts for a few days.  </li>
            <li>This made my hair very curly (maybe a bit too much!)</li>
            <li>It has made my time to get ready so much faster!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s exactly what I got, the real McCoy.  </li>
            <li>I have long medium-thick hair and maybe this product is better for people with thinner hair?</li>
            <li>Helps curly gray hair behave - pretty much</li>
            <li>I have long blond hair and this is like magic on it.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, in itself, this curl cream is very light, smells nice and just a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I think once people can accept that your hair pretty much does whatever it wants, they&#x27;d be happier with what the product can do.</li>
            <li>but it also helps it to dry in a more controlled manner.  </li>
            <li>I have gone back to Bumble &amp; Bumble curl products, since the smell isn&#x27;t so strong.</li>
            <li>I have used curl enhancing products by Rusk, Label M, many drugstore brands and this one wins, hands down.</li>
            <li>I had to remove all of the contents and put into a new dispenser!!</li>
            <li>Love this products has really helped out with my dry hair ..</li>
            <li>Her hair is fine not coarse, but she has a lot of hair.</li>
            <li>Not to mention the price is pretty high.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually spent most of my life with boy-short hair because I couldn&#x27;t manage it.  </li>
            <li>I use this product, along with the actual morrocan oil, and it is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to use too much.  </li>
            <li>I may use a squirt of Morrocanoil if it&#x27;s going to be humid, and just gently work it into the tips of my hair-</li>
            <li>and it is absolutely counterfeit.  </li>
            <li>I think I may have handled it too much while drying it with a diffuser.  </li>
            <li>I have curly hair that can be really unruly.</li>
            <li>Did&#x27;t do much for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Not much works for my &#x27;curls,&#x27; but this is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>My curls look and feel very lightweight.</li>
            <li>so I know the real deal.  </li>
            <li>and I have really curly hair</li>
            <li>It really takes the hassle out of dealing with curly hair..</li>
            <li>it is very beat up.  </li>
            <li>works really well, but one thing</li>
            <li>I still really like this product</li>
            <li>Ha, thanks bae.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly hair &amp; this product acts as a mousse &amp; hairspray.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair that can get frizzy fast depending on humidity.  </li>
            <li>shipper was very reliable.</li>
            <li>This product works very well for curly hair.  </li>
            <li>But what I have found that it&#x27;s really all about the serum you use before a curl cream, the serum is what controls the frizz.</li>
            <li>Slide the tshirt off gently.</li>
            <li>I really like this--and my husband does too.</li>
            <li>Really like this product.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t stand it, will have to get rid of this product.</li>
            <li>While my hair was wet, it looked OK.  </li>
            <li>Received it fast.</li>
            <li>I really like this cream.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping also.</li>
            <li>My hair is straight</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think it enhances the curl too much either</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what I really like about the Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and find this product helps with shine and softness.</li>
            <li>and it behaves very well with this product.</li>
            <li>very manageable  </li>
            <li>I have mid-length very curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Really did not like this product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m probably going to have to toss the whole thing.</li>
            <li>I really do like this product</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length hair and use about two dime sized pumps for my whole head</li>
            <li>Very unmanageable, lets put it that way.  </li>
            <li>It really does transform my hair from a lion&#x27;s mane to well defined curls.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair and am 53 years old (so often it&#x27;s more like naturally frizzy hair).  </li>
            <li>One of the more expensive but effective curl defining products I have used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not real crazy about the scent</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair &amp; have used too many products to count over the years with only so-so results!</li>
            <li>She says it makes her hair curl better, but feel soft at the same time.</li>
            <li>smells is nice, but I may revert back to Kerastis, or 10 product for similar, yet softer results.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Love it for my once straight hair that has suddenly become naturally curly...</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly and the curls I get with this hair product are smooth and soft without the crunch.</li>
            <li>This smells great, and is thick but not heavy.  </li>
            <li>Make sure the top isn&#x27;t tight and flat.</li>
            <li>I have soft waves and curls without stiffness, frizz is controlled, and since I no longer use a blow dryer or flat iron, my hair is really healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>Great product, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I was excited when it finally arrived to see how it would work for my hair.</li>
            <li>I was told that I would find this product much easier to use with better results (advised not to use too much because it tends to be oily/weight hair down).  </li>
            <li>I have long, curly/wavy hair that seems to have a mind of its own, and came across this product (Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream) after doing extensive research online.</li>
            <li>One a regular day I reach from my shea moisture products, but on special occasions when I want my hair to look</li>
            <li>I have a thinner hair strand, with loose curls that are disturbed easily.  </li>
            <li>but since my hair is so dry I prefer to let it finish drying naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product makes my hair smell AMAZING as if I just came back from the hair dresser.</li>
            <li>First curl creme that works in my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>Loose, natural curlsm, plus my hair smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li>I let my hair dry naturally and was overall very pleased.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this product!  </li>
            <li>I live in Florida o humidity and curly hair are always an issue!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new way of doing my hair!</li>
            <li>and I live in South with very humid weather.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very humid where I live and</li>
            <li>I live in really humid weather and oils</li>
            <li>Less is more with this product.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something to make my hair more presentable and less out of control, and that&#x27;s what I got.</li>
            <li>And the frizz control was a main reason I purchased</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s be realistic, you cannot change your hair type.</li>
            <li>so I could actually use it for the moisturizing benefits but the smell is worth it alone haha.</li>
            <li>She has been back to get more multiple times.</li>
            <li>Though I didn&#x27;t tell them to buy the same 3 bottle is only for one person to use, one bottle for one person to use in 3 months is still too much mostly.</li>
            <li>I find it works particularly well with a diffuser.  </li>
            <li>Very strong perfumed smell, unfortunately too strong for me.  </li>
            <li>i highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone with curly hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Moroccan Oil Curl Defining Cream.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for anyone with curly hair</li>
            <li>The smell is a little overwhelming.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty heavy cream that gives good definition and prevents a lot of frizz, but doesn&#x27;t leave the crispy crunchy feeling that other heavier curl creams do.</li>
            <li>My hair tends to go flat too quickly.</li>
            <li>Not to mention the smell is addictive and leaves hair super soft!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much to manage frizz keeps hair soft</li>
            <li>You put it on wet &amp; it keeps curls frizz free.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair, and I can usually get a nice curl with mouse.</li>
            <li>After just a few uses, I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>In addition to not washing the heck out of my hair every day with harsh shampoos, this cream is making my hair look better than it ever has.</li>
            <li>This is so worth the extra bucks!</li>
            <li>I rarely bother posting reviews on Amazon (although I read them religiously!)</li>
            <li>This cream only does that if you apply heat to your hair, which I rarely do to prevent damage to my hair.</li>
            <li>Normally I use leave in conditioner and then light/wavy gel.  </li>
            <li>I did my normal routine of shampooing and conditioning and towel drying my hair.  </li>
            <li>It is very greasy and your hair stay white after the first application.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok the first day, but seems to weigh down my curls the second day.</li>
            <li>and I live in a place where there is high humidity</li>
            <li>I have very long hair and found that using max 3-4 pumps while your hair damp is more than enough.</li>
            <li>It not only defines the curls, it gives them a soft, natural look that is silky and calm, NOT frizzy!  </li>
            <li>It provides just the right amount of hold I need especially during the friz prone months.</li>
            <li>I decided to order some right away, and chose the curl cream rather than the regular oil.  </li>
            <li>Most products make may hair feel stiff or crunchy, this cream leaves it feeling like curly hair should fee.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t try to put your hands on the very top of your head because it will make your scalp greasy (at least in my case!)</li>
            <li>I use mine every day and maybe have to buy a new one twice a year?</li>
            <li>Allergist advised me to eliminate use of any new products I was using.</li>
            <li>It DOES define the curls where they are but does not create new curls.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>This product was used on me and recommended by my new hair stylist who loves the Moroccan Oil line of products.   </li>
            <li>Neither one of us can live without this product.</li>
            <li>Another thing, while I do have curly hair it is fine hair and this product doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  </li>
            <li>and very soft and took the frizz away.</li>
            <li>Luv the smell and it makes my course hair very soft to the touch</li>
            <li>very soft, reduces frizz.</li>
            <li>She loves the product, its not too heavy, smells great and helps form curls, controls frizz and doesnt make hair stiff.</li>
            <li>Soft curls!</li>
            <li>My curls are bouncy, curly (not stringy) and so soft!  </li>
            <li>and it keeps my curls soft as well!</li>
            <li>This product defines the natural curl in my hair and reduces frizz!</li>
            <li>My curls are big and this defines them pretty well.</li>
            <li>it keeps it defined but soft and not crunchy!</li>
            <li>If they pay the international shipping fee, I am willing to change the review stars.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t know if this was a woman&#x27;s product or universal but speaking from a man&#x27;s perspective</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s worth the price to keep buying, but we&#x27;ll see how long it lasts me -- I&#x27;m thinking quite a while since it&#x27;s a pretty big bottle</li>
            <li>Definitely would recommend if you&#x27;re willing to splurge.</li>
            <li>I normally love Moroccan Oil products that I have purchased from a salon in the past, but what I received from Perfumes World appeared to be a counterfeit product.  </li>
            <li>The two bottles came quickly and they were brand new, as to be expected.</li>
            <li>My hair is just past shoulder length, layered, and very curly, but it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li>However, for half dry hair or when I don&#x27;t know if I have time to blow out or just go curly, this will do both nicely.</li>
            <li>Love this product to control and tame my overly curly hair!  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need very much, I use a little larger than a pea size dot of it throughout my slightly above shoulder length hair, much more</li>
            <li>I took a chance on this product recently because the reviews were so positive.  </li>
            <li>I was not sure even it was refill or the original!</li>
            <li>Too heavy for fine hair.</li>
            <li>To ensure my hair does not get too used a certain product,  I alternate between the curl defining cream and Aveda Phomollient with a dab of Aveda Confixor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do think the curl cream provides a little more frizz control than the regular oil</li>
            <li>Came in a reasonable amount of time, a little less than if I purchased it in store, and seriously one if not THE BEST product I found for curls.</li>
            <li>Clear, defined curls with a non-greasy application.</li>
            <li>Curls are soft &amp; bouncy.</li>
            <li>The curl cream lets me work with my natural hair</li>
            <li>Brings out my natural curls.</li>
            <li>As far as performance goes, this product gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>Its a bit pricey and doesn&#x27;t really keep the hair in order especially when it humid and the scent is a bit overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>The only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t really work in humidity.  </li>
            <li>makes my hair really soft to the touch--SOFT HAIR&lt;</li>
            <li>Soft textured curls.</li>
            <li>this \\&quot;mousse/cream\\&quot; creates soft bouncy curls, but the smell is overpowering.  </li>
            <li>is natural.  </li>
            <li>but it lasts at least more than 4 months.</li>
            <li>Keeps hair soft while still holding the curl.  </li>
            <li>wow.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>A young man started hitting on this old woman.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and touchable with curls intact.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair.</li>
            <li>At my sisters suggestion, we both have natural curly hair, I decided to try the Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream.  </li>
            <li>It makes my curly hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>My hair is curly/wavy, and my husband&#x27;s hair is soft curls.</li>
            <li>Reduces the frizz &amp; defines the curls into soft tendrils.</li>
            <li>It tames the frizz and keeps hair soft.</li>
            <li>The MoroccanOil Curl Defining Cream has been the closest &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; hair product I have found so far.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend that people with naturally hydrated hair apply it at the roots.</li>
            <li>My husband has naturally wavy/ curly hair.</li>
            <li>Also, it leaves your hair extremely soft and controllable...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural curl without the frizz .</li>
            <li>As far as products go believe me when I say I have tried them all.</li>
            <li>The product is pricey but a bottle this size has lasted me around 5 - 6 months so far.</li>
            <li>My granddaughters are mixed race and have very curly hair.</li>
            <li>so if you are sensitive to smells</li>
            <li>My sis recommended this product for my 3 year old&#x27;s curly hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Makes hair soft and dries it quicker as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Tames the frizz and makes my curls soft and manageable</li>
            <li>Only need a pea size squirt for the whole head.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what happened or how, but the bottom of the bottle COMPLETELY disintegrated.</li>
            <li>The most common word people use now to describe my curls-defined.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair &amp; have tried all types of products.</li>
            <li>This product has really brought my damaged curls back to life with just a littlr bit of this product on my strands.</li>
            <li>The only thing that is missing for me is slightly more hydration and frizz control.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff for my thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li>Not too oily, like pink oil, but just right.</li>
            <li>I have always gone agains my natural hair wave and used a flat iron to make it straight.</li>
            <li>More expensive than other products in stores, but definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li>However, this is the first product I have used that I would actually consider wearing my hair curly on a daily basis with this stuff.</li>
            <li>Back to the search for the perfect product for my curls :(</li>
            <li>Maybe if you have tight, coil-y hair this will work better, but if you have relaxed and loose waves</li>
            <li>I have really curly hair, so this product is much lighter in feel and less sticky than the gel products I used to use to combat frizz.</li>
            <li>a side note: my boyfriend likes things very natural, and doesnt like most perfumes, He is addicted to the smell of this product.</li>
            <li>not sure if they were used, but appeared to be mostly filled.</li>
            <li>However, it works really well on the hair and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>It separates the curls and defines them really well with minimal amount of product (so a bottle will last a while) and FINALLY my hair is smooth instead of dry at the ends.</li>
            <li>I have really thin  fine hair and not that much of it</li>
            <li>This cream is nice, but a little heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li>The product is in a new dispenser, which is opaque, so I can&#x27;t see how much is there, and the dispensing unit is not compatible with other pump-type ones, so hope it doesn&#x27;t break.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I use more that the directions call for and other times less.</li>
            <li>I recently moved from New York to South Carolina and</li>
            <li>I only buy a new bottle every 6-8 months or so.</li>
            <li>Before I found Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream, I would give up trying to style my waves and just blow dry my hair straight.  </li>
            <li>This is the only stuff that really works for me, and people compliment me on my &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; (which is actually just the scent of this product) all the time.</li>
            <li>Second, I apply a small amount near the roots and top half of my head but not too much.</li>
            <li>No other products needed.</li>
            <li>A major, major bonus.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair just right to wear natural air dried or blown out.</li>
            <li>before this I had a bottle of the Moroccanoil intense hydrating cream witch weighed my hair down, I have naturally curly hair but its so soft that I can straighten it by just wrapping it in a bun</li>
            <li>Sadly, it doesn&#x27;t smell great like the shampoo and other products do.</li>
            <li>I let my hair dry naturally, brush through with a big comb, and it is ready to go.</li>
            <li>Too bad because this is a great product for my hair.</li>
            <li>It makes my curls look soft and gives just enough volume.</li>
            <li>Hair must be very damp to wet.</li>
            <li>naturally curly , it is a must have for daily hair routine.</li>
            <li>I use about 2-3 pumps o fthis on my wet hair and gently scrunch.  </li>
            <li>There is a perpetual wasteland of barely used products in my cabinet as I write this.</li>
            <li>Fantastic cream for curly, thick hair.</li>
            <li>Maybe I haven&#x27;t figured out what the right amount is, but it tends to be a little sticky feeling, and doesn&#x27;t help with volume at all.</li>
            <li>Liberal is sure to mean different things to different people.</li>
            <li>Its exactly the same as their other curl cream.</li>
            <li>favorite product, I have long thick hair and this bottle lasts me several months.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair to the middle of my back, so I require two pumps of the product to get all of my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently embraced my natural curls and; therefore, have been trying out different products.  </li>
            <li>I did notice that if I put too little, my hair dries funny and get fuzzy.</li>
            <li>I was a little concerned the first time I used it because it felt somewhat oily.</li>
            <li>Now the more practical facts: does NOT make hair greasy, stiff or heavy.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that is long and quit unruly at times.</li>
            <li>The first day my hair was so dried out it felt like straw.  </li>
            <li>I have long thick but fine hair.</li>
            <li>and I think it would weigh my hair down too much.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy again due to the high price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the first time I use this product, sometimes it&#x27;s not easy to find</li>
            <li>I get compliments every day on my tame and pretty curls.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is easy to apply without being too thick, and helps me create soft tight curls with spring and shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then a new stylist applied the regular Moroccan Oil to my curls after a cut and sent me on my way with my hair still wet.  </li>
            <li>sort of does what it says it will, but only half as well as many other products that typically cost a quarter of the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the same as what my hair dresser uses, however, it is equally as good and a lot less expensive.</li>
            <li>I have never had curly hair and used to try to blow out straight the little wave I did have.  </li>
            <li>It leaves a really gross-feeling residue on my hair and does little to &amp;#34;define&amp;#34; my curls.</li>
            <li>It is highly concentrated so they only have to use maybe the size of a quarter for hair that reaches mid-way down their backs.</li>

            <li> This smells amazing.  </li>

            <li> smells amazing and works well on my ntural curls</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t build up, is a great weight for me (on the heavier side) and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have curly 3b/c hair type and this product has an amazing effect on my hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing item</li>
            <li> Oh, it also smells AMAZING</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> This product is amazing</li>
            <li> It was wonderful to have it arrive so fast.  </li>
            <li> Nice job.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s mind and be one kind of curly, but</li>
            <li> It curls my hair nicely, and keeps it well hydrated.</li>
            <li> The cream smells nice and hold curl/waves in well without a lot of stiffness.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own thing here in this climate.  </li>
            <li> If you get this play around with it to figure out how much works best for your hair.  </li>
            <li> Love this product, makes my hair nice and curly, it does not make my hair oily, and it smell good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice curl cream.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the best leave-in that I have ever tried for my very curly hair.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it just kind of smooths your hair which is still nice but</li>
            <li> It helps keep your hair in a nice curl or wave and helps with frizziness.</li>
            <li> I was using Aveda&#x27;s curl spray that I liked a lot</li>
            <li> It does do a nice job shaping my curls without having that crispy/crunchy effect that gel has.</li>
            <li> Gives me nice curls without the frizz.</li>
            <li> If you rub between your hands and get it warm, it does apply easier.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice and does not leave my hair greasy.</li>
            <li> Manages my curls nicely-</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have to use heat or a diffuser anymore to make the curls look nice.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair at night and fall asleep with the curl control cream in my hair and when I wake up my hair has beautiful soft curls that i cant stop being happy about.</li>
            <li> It keeps their hair perfect all day even on days with high humidity or rain.</li>
            <li> I have found my new best friend!</li>
            <li> Great for curly hair leaves hair soft and smells great</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a bit strong, but if it gives me a good hair day, I&#x27;ll cope....</li>
            <li> shipping was quick and packaging was great</li>
            <li> , it smells good but the smell is soooooo strong</li>
            <li> Love your hair and it&#x27;s many personalities!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my naturally curly hair!</li>
            <li> This is the best product for naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> as a 26 year old woman who has embraced her curly hair since the age of 15, this is single-handedly the best hair product for my curls that I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome for my naturally &#x27;S&#x27; wave hair and controls the frizz like nothing else I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> So far, this is the best I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li> Smells amazing, doesn&#x27;t make your hair crispy and curls look fantastic!</li>
            <li> By far the BEST product I&#x27;ve found after years of searching!</li>
            <li> I think it made my hair really soft but the smell is very strong!!!!</li>
            <li> A friend recommened this product and I love it, holds the curl nicely and helps keep the frizz away all day.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money for a great product.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I can use this cream and a bit of oil and my curls are frizz free and bouncy!</li>
            <li> I think it is a good fit for curly, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> So far, all the Morrocan Oil stuff I&#x27;ve used has been the best.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own for most of my life, it never seems to do what I want it to do.</li>
            <li> quick delivery, much better price, great product.</li>
            <li> I HAVE VERY FINE  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> This version of their many curl creams works best in higher humidity with fine curly hair.</li>
            <li> my naturally curly  hair feels good and looks great.</li>
            <li> perfect curl without any of the crunch that you get from most of the other curling products you see - smells amazing too!</li>
            <li> Not crazy about their shampoo, but this is an amazing product!</li>
            <li> This has a strong but nice scent.  </li>
            <li> This was easy to buy and I am loving the product.</li>
            <li> Until this product came along I was lucky to have one good hair day a month.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and am always getting compliments.</li>
            <li> I have tried to get my hair stylist to get me more to no avail.</li>
            <li> Been using it for 2-3 years now and still love it.</li>
            <li> (I think), and I tried out that method of handling my hair and it worked like magic.  </li>
            <li> I love this product on my curly hair.</li>
            <li> also love the smell.</li>
            <li> Soooo gooood :)</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> For that reason love the curl control</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with how my hair looks...</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love my curls now</li>
            <li> , they&#x27;re much more manageable, and my Sweetheart loves the smell.</li>
            <li> Love this product, but my review is for the fulfilment.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many curl products</li>
            <li> comb some more.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)    </li>
            <li> My hairdressers always ask me how my hair stays so healthy even though I dye it, the answer is this product.</li>
            <li> , maybe some hairspray if I&#x27;m going out on the town and want a more controlled defined look.</li>
            <li> I love it as well.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love my curls now.</li>
            <li> favorite part about this product is the way it smells.</li>
            <li> It helps control frizz better than anything else I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> this moroccaoil curl control is ok.</li>
            <li> a bit greasy but ok.</li>
            <li> product, but could be better.</li>
            <li> I give this one 6 stars, its fantastic!</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love the way it smells too.</li>
            <li> I have healthy hair.  </li>
            <li> I really love the way</li>
            <li> - you don&#x27;t need to add more product until you wash again.</li>
            <li> I love the Moroccanoil Treatment</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> It has a nice light smell that is not cloying or overpowering.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> Is this the magic bullet?</li>
            <li> I used to have frizzy hair, but now it is a lot more controlled.</li>
            <li> However, this product would be better named \\&quot;curl control cream\\&quot; because I wouldn&#x27;t say it \\&quot;defined\\&quot; my curls.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I have recommended this product to a lot of people and most decided to buy it for themselves.  </li>
            <li> love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my hair smell</li>
            <li> I love this curl cream.  </li>
            <li> The awesome scent is not present.</li>
            <li> This is NOT an AUTHENTIC Moroccan Oil product.  </li>
            <li> I am die-hard MO fan, but have encountered a lot of bogus MO products on Amazon that claim to be authentic.  </li>
            <li> This leaves my curls looking moisturized and healthy.</li>
            <li> I received so many compliments on my hair &amp; the scent.</li>
            <li> really love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love the volume it adds and the fact that it does bring out my curls.  </li>
            <li> I love how the product holds my curls, but I cannot stand the smell of the product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Take the time to apply it well and it will keep most of the frizz away for up to 4 days.</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> It was just ok.</li>
            <li> This curl defining cream is my favorite curl cream product-</li>
            <li> the smell is really lovely and the texture just seems to work with my hair.</li>
            <li> I have mostly wavy hair and have tried for years to find something that enhanced my curls and controlled frizz.</li>
            <li> What I love about this product is it enhances curls without adding any of that dreaded crunch.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite product for her curly hair...</li>
            <li> It also smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> But I do LOVE there hair spray and serum.</li>
            <li> Use the arms to tie it on do-rag style. :-)</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love the results.</li>
            <li> Air drying doesn&#x27;t cause frizz unlike some interesting magazine articles I&#x27;ve read.     </li>
            <li> Our hairdresser used this, and we fell in love with it, both its smell and</li>
            <li> Plus, it smells phenomenal.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m satisfied with the product itself.</li>
            <li> I love this this product.</li>
            <li> I combine it with leave in conditioner and a tiny bit of gel and my hair looks and smells awesome.</li>
            <li> I was purchasing it at the beauty supply for a lot more money.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this hair cream.  </li>
            <li> Spend more and get the Kevin Murphy product...</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love the product for the scent but also because my hair feels and looks healthier and bouncy.</li>

            <li> super quick shipping, I have bought this product in a salon for much more and it is a great product</li>
            <li> I love this curl cream, my hair is super stubborn, but this stuff works like magic!</li>
            <li> For those of you who love the original Moroccanoil scent, you will adore this product!  </li>
            <li> torn on the pump mechanism: On the one hand, it seems to do a pretty good job getting a lot of the product out of the container.</li>
            <li> This however, is one of my favorites because it seems to soothe my scalp as well as my hair, and by first use you can tell its a good quality product.</li>
            <li> After searching for a really long time, I found this and its perfect.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say this made my hair MORE curly, but it really does a great job at keeping my curls intact and smooth.</li>
            <li> I got complimented on my hair smelling good the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> The new Curl Control Cream has a great texture.</li>
            <li> The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because the fragrance, while pleasant, is really over powering to me.  </li>
            <li> This product works very well on both curly and straight hair, but the best feature is its scent...</li>
            <li> Even my boyfriend commented that after using it my hair looked curlier, smelled great, and was very soft.  </li>
            <li> Great product for naturally curly hair!</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes my hair so soft!</li>
            <li> Great for my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> keeps my hair soft, and smells great.  </li>
            <li> It works the best when applied to completely wet hair.</li>
            <li> Gives her great soft curls</li>
            <li> and it makes her hair smell fantastic :)</li>
            <li> and it defines my curls and leaves it soft and smelling great.</li>
            <li> Curly, soft, great smelling.</li>
            <li> The most beautiful curls develope and last until washing.  </li>
            <li> Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream does a great job controlling my curls and leaving my hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> This bottle will last you ages aswell, it lasts me a good 3-4 months even with my teenager \\&quot;sharing\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> In tandem with Moroccan Oil original treatment her hair has never been better.</li>
            <li> so it frizzes easily.</li>
            <li> I wish the container wasn&#x27;t as easy to break...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best curl cream I&#x27;ve found, really defines curls and leaves your hair soft, and controls frizz.</li>
            <li> I felt the product has too strong of a smell.</li>
            <li> It is a strong smell, if you are looking for something unscented, this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> It is way too strong and chemical smelling for me to want to wear or submit those around me to.  </li>
            <li> This product has a strong scent that everyone can smell around me.</li>
            <li> Smells are one of my triggers, and if you also suffer from any sort of head pain/migraines/odor allergies, I strongly encourage you NOT to buy this product.</li>
            <li> The smell is really strong though</li>
            <li> The odor was too strong.</li>
            <li> He says &amp;#34;it is strong when first applied, but it does smell nice after it sits a while.&amp;#34; (he&#x27;s quite blunt so not just being kind)--GOOD</li>
            <li> First off, this product smells amazing.  </li>
            <li> I have fine color treated hair that curls easily.</li>
            <li> Additionally, it makes your hair feel soft and smells AMAZING!</li>
            <li> So perfect for my wavy/curly hair which is fine and easily weighed down by product.  </li>
            <li> This is hands down the best product on the market for curly hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling weighed down and all the curls look great without that frizzy look!</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length wavy and fine hair.</li>
            <li> but I have fine hair strands.</li>
            <li> made my fine hair too crunchy</li>
            <li> I have fine curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine, curly hair</li>
            <li> I only made this mistake the first time I used it though, and ever since it has been great!  </li>
            <li> I have fine, wavy hair, but a lot of it.</li>
            <li> In the winter, the product does hold some curl, but doesn&#x27;t plump up fine hair as well.</li>
            <li> Too oily (LEAVES A STICKY FEELING) for fine hair.  </li>
            <li> If you have baby fine hair try another product.</li>
            <li> and I actually enjoy putting it on my hair because I know that yummy smell will last all day as I bounce around from the gym to work to happy hour and home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but nothing has ever made me happy to the point that I would wear my hair curly on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> product gives me fantastic curls.  </li>
            <li> My hair remained smooth, wavy &amp; frizz free.  </li>
            <li> And it makes my hair smell wonderful everyday.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and not greasy.  </li>
            <li> I use it with a Pro-L leave in conditioner and it takes my troll-hair and tames it into smooth curls.  </li>
            <li> I have coarse, curly, frizzy hair and this product works great for controlling it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight but mighty in it&#x27;s de-frizzing and curling capabilities.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cream that would just help it along while also keeping it frizz free.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy and it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> Fantastic stuff.  </li>
            <li> 9 times out of 10, I get out of the shower, smooth this over my hair, and go.</li>
            <li> It works so well that I can wake up the next morning, spritz it with water, scrunch and it looks great again.  </li>
            <li> I never use shampoo(hairdresser&#x27;s suggestion), because it robs my hair of its natural oils, but I always use a good conditioner and the Control Cream when my hair is still damp.  </li>
            <li> love it the product is so good, my whole life looking for a product that really helps with my rebel curls.  </li>
            <li> Leave my curls soft, and smelling really good.</li>
            <li> This product is far superior to any styling product.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps your hair frizz free and soft.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> I love this curl cream, it works really well for people like me with wavy hair that needs better definition.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous, soft curls.  </li>
            <li> Smells sooo good and leaves her hair silky soft.</li>
            <li> best product to tame frizzy and curly hair, people always complimented my curls</li>
            <li> and I have very frizzy hair!!!</li>
            <li> It would be cool if I could use it to touch up, or calm the frizzies that pop up on top of your head, but it makes it greasy instead.</li>
            <li> and you will also fall in love with it ;)</li>
            <li> Product is authentic and shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> but it is so worth it!</li>
            <li> Well worth it!</li>
            <li> Curly hair is as unique as one&#x27;s fingerprint...</li>
            <li> It is well worth the cost!</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about the scent...</li>
            <li> I originally purchased it for my wavy hair</li>
            <li> Love it, would buy again, it was much cheaper than the salon!</li>
            <li> The smell is however unnecessarily strong and disagreeable sweet, and now that I became pregnant</li>
            <li> This is great for me on days when I just want to towel dry my hair and let it just be curly.  </li>
            <li> I was going to purchase at beauty store for 37 dollars and that is the store that has everything super cheap all the time</li>
            <li> I think there are better, more natural products on the market.</li>
            <li> Lol but the next day I guess the smell absorbed into my hair because it wasn&#x27;t as stronge.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue (like silicone containing products), doesn&#x27;t leave it stiff and crunchy (yuck!), and best of all, it works!  </li>
            <li> (scent can be a little strong if you use too much, but still awesome).</li>
            <li> It really works well with my fine curly hair!  </li>
            <li> I use the pure Moroccan Oil in the Winter as well and love it.  </li>
            <li> Best hair product on the market for hard to manage curly hair.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and need very little for great curl definition.</li>
            <li> I first used it in Virginia while visiting family, the humid winter there created different curls than here in Colorado but still a great result.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing for naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for the second time because I was so happy with my first purchase.</li>
            <li> My hair looks styled, natural, and holds on its own.</li>
            <li> It holds really well and just seems to make the hair curl better.  </li>
            <li> I have tried every product that I can find to control my very curly hair, and have a cupboard filled with rejects to prove it!</li>
            <li> I wanted straight cute cuts like todays styles.</li>
            <li> Too much will make the top of my hair greasy</li>
            <li> My hair has never been this soft before and my curls are nicely managed.</li>
            <li> He finally told me it was because he loved my perfume.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure not to put too much around your scalp...as it made my hair look oily.  </li>
            <li> and I loved this stuff the last time I ordered it</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been trying different products to try and find something that will do a good job of enhancing the curls I still have.</li>
            <li> Nice soft curls and waves without any stiffness.  </li>
            <li> I love this product because it smells fantastic and leaves my hair very soft and curly.</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair and this stuff works great with it.</li>
            <li> My hair looks natural not stiff but the product prevents frizz for a great hold.</li>
            <li> This way, my hair seriously looks and feels awesome.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and was priced well below what I have purchased it in hair salons.  </li>
            <li> Packaged well and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Thanks for such great service.</li>
            <li> This also doesn&#x27;t add much volume, which is great for those of us who have enough volume.</li>
            <li> Super curly.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice light musky/lovely fragrant yumminess that will last in your hair for a couple of days before needing to re-shower or reapply the product!</li>
            <li> Works great, I do have to use a lot since my hair is pretty long.</li>
            <li> I have super curly hair.</li>
            <li> And I really like the light, fresh fragrance it has!</li>
            <li> , a normal store must carry this product for way more.</li>
            <li> very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> The actual product works fairly well, but I like the old curl cream better.</li>
            <li> I love curling my hair with this product i dont live without it</li>
            <li> My dry, fine, frizzy hair is looking amazing - shiny, curly, no frizz.</li>
            <li> Made my hair super soft and eliminated all or most frizziness.</li>
            <li> Putting too much near the roots can cause your hair to get greasy more quickly.</li>
            <li> but I find that it also works great for straight styles I blow dry.  </li>
            <li> only thing I don&#x27;t love is the smell, it is a rather strong scent; however, to have the curls it is worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I think if you are looking for a more natural curly look (less structured) and frizz reducing serum, this is a GREAT product.  </li>
            <li> It smells like a mixture of a men&#x27;s aftershave and Moroccan Oil, very strong and barely airs out throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Works great for my curls but a little on the thicket side.</li>
            <li> The only reason why I gave it two stars was because it smelled amazing.</li>
            <li> If you have combination hair you will continue to have combination hair, but you will not hate it as much as you used to.</li>
            <li> It smells great and isn&#x27;t too heavy.  </li>
            <li> I recieved this in a few days from ordering, which was great.</li>
            <li> Fabulous hair product for my son&#x27;s very curly hair.......thesoapmaker.net</li>
            <li> Worth every penny</li>
            <li> It produces soft curls and the scent is wonderful/ exotic.</li>
            <li> Totally worth</li>
            <li> It has a strong, clean scent that isn&#x27;t too intrusive if you go for those kinds of soapy natural scents.</li>
            <li> Its well worth the money.</li>
            <li> But the main reason I would never buy it again is the strong scent this product has.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money?</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> it wish it was cheaper but worth it</li>
            <li> This is fully worth the price.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> Moroccan Oil is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m not crazy about it but don&#x27;t mind it either.</li>
            <li> This is worth the money for me.</li>
            <li> and like I said, worth the splurge.</li>
            <li> Product is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> my favorite product for my naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> This is my favorite by far.  </li>
            <li> Much better holding, soft curls, than Arrojo cream and lasts forever.  </li>
            <li> She said this product was better for my hair than the mousse I had been using, and so being a professional, I listened/followed her advice.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money if you&#x27;re someone like me who has struggled with unmanageable hair.</li>
            <li> Pricey but worth it</li>
            <li> Used it last night for work and it held my curls nicely</li>
            <li> Luckily I still had the nozzle from my first bottle</li>
            <li> a long life for sure!</li>
            <li> just right</li>
            <li> Try it you will love it and the price through amazon is very good (as long as you get a low shipping rate); in my local salon this product costs $32.</li>
            <li> I have very fine short hair.</li>
            <li> I put it on after the shower and sleep on it to give me more curls, then re-wet my hair in the morning and add a little more.  </li>
            <li> I should probably only give it 4 stars, because frankly, as far as curly hair products go, I swear by Ouidad and find it superior for taming frizz and keeping curls intact.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t really hold my curl at all, and left my hair kind of greasy.</li>
            <li> Apply to towel dry hair to give you a nice wavy beach look without the frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for taking a temporary break from TIGI&#x27;s curls rock which I really like, and it works OK as far as shaping the curls goes.</li>
            <li> You need just a small amount applied mostly on the ends of the hair and it dries in gorgeous soft ringlets.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Moroccanoil products before and have been very pleased.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic if you have naturally curly hair!  </li>
            <li> Best to only use on the ends, avoid scalp, as it can leave the hair stiff and &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; feeling.</li>
            <li> Very highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> My hair is very unruly so the fact that it makes such a huge dent is good enough for</li>
            <li> , so intense cream would be great if you have very tight course curls.</li>
            <li> The best part is you only need very little of the cream.  </li>
            <li> I was concerned about the smell when I first used it because it&#x27;s pretty perfume-y.  </li>
            <li> Pretty embarrassing to give a gift without a cap.</li>
            <li> my \\&quot;northern\\&quot; hair products just wouldn&#x27;t work in the higher heat and humidity.  </li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t, I just dampen my hair gently (using my hands) and voila!</li>
            <li> So, I spend most of my day under a computer room floor with hundreds of server fans blowing my hair in numerous directions.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> : I accidentally dropped this bottle outside as I was loading my gym bag in the car, and the top broke off and the spring came out...</li>
            <li> Appreciated the cost and convenience capability!</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it a lot especially during the summer.  </li>
            <li> product did exactly what it said it would -</li>
            <li> This curl cream is fantastic for wild curly/frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but it is wonderful.</li>
            <li> and ive tried so many different products for her hair.</li>
            <li> I have used it ever since I tried it the first time.  </li>
            <li> Cover you head lightly with an old cotton tshirts.</li>
            <li> of this Moroccan Oil Curl Cream and starting from the back (since your hands have the most product, there is the most hair in the back) scrunch hair toward top of head.</li>
            <li> This was first used on my hair by a hairdresser in Ireland</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff for years and it never fails me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got 2A/2B curly hair, and Moroccan Oil Curl Defining Cream works pretty well for me.</li>
            <li> and they even refused to refund the first time.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different products and none have worked as well as Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream.  </li>
            <li> Would definitely buy more of this again.  </li>
            <li> This arrived with the bottle all scratched up and cheap looking, with the nozzle completely dysfunctional.</li>
            <li> Will use more next time</li>
            <li> Tends to be heavier to rinse out but overall pleased.</li>
            <li> It really helps define the curls!</li>
            <li> I waited a few weeks to get a good sense of the product before I posted this review.  </li>
            <li> maybe smooth down the top a bit.</li>
            <li> This great for soft curls to wavy hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely worth it, leaves my hair super soft and curly.</li>
            <li> There is no other product on the market as good as this one, at least I have not found one that is better.</li>
            <li> I have fine natural, wavy hair and this product does absolutely nothing for my waves.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for thick, wavy, curly hair-- that is unruly and coarse!</li>
            <li> I brushed this aside, and went ahead and squeezed some of the product into my palm -- and of course, the smell became more intense.</li>
            <li> However the THIS line, along with the intense curl cream, and hydrating cream made my curls light, the smell is AMAZING!, and it actually conditioned my curls, without weighing them down, no flakes, no hard crunchy feeling!</li>
            <li> The best part is, you only need a small amount per day and it lasts FOREVER!</li>
            <li> Did make my curls soft, but nothing special.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers kept saying they loved the fragrance but the main drawback (not a deal breaker yet) for me is that this fragrance is not subtle and</li>
            <li> easy to use, works great and makes curly hair look terrific, not dried out and frizzy...and lasts for a few days.  </li>
            <li> This made my hair very curly (maybe a bit too much!)</li>
            <li> It has made my time to get ready so much faster!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s exactly what I got, the real McCoy.  </li>
            <li> I have long medium-thick hair and maybe this product is better for people with thinner hair?</li>
            <li> Helps curly gray hair behave - pretty much</li>
            <li> I have long blond hair and this is like magic on it.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, in itself, this curl cream is very light, smells nice and just a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I think once people can accept that your hair pretty much does whatever it wants, they&#x27;d be happier with what the product can do.</li>
            <li> but it also helps it to dry in a more controlled manner.  </li>
            <li> I have gone back to Bumble &amp; Bumble curl products, since the smell isn&#x27;t so strong.</li>
            <li> I have used curl enhancing products by Rusk, Label M, many drugstore brands and this one wins, hands down.</li>
            <li> I had to remove all of the contents and put into a new dispenser!!</li>
            <li> Love this products has really helped out with my dry hair ..</li>
            <li> Her hair is fine not coarse, but she has a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> Not to mention the price is pretty high.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually spent most of my life with boy-short hair because I couldn&#x27;t manage it.  </li>
            <li> I use this product, along with the actual morrocan oil, and it is fabulous.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to use too much.  </li>
            <li> I may use a squirt of Morrocanoil if it&#x27;s going to be humid, and just gently work it into the tips of my hair-</li>
            <li> and it is absolutely counterfeit.  </li>
            <li> I think I may have handled it too much while drying it with a diffuser.  </li>
            <li> I have curly hair that can be really unruly.</li>
            <li> Did&#x27;t do much for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Not much works for my &#x27;curls,&#x27; but this is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly hair</li>
            <li> My curls look and feel very lightweight.</li>
            <li> so I know the real deal.  </li>
            <li> and I have really curly hair</li>
            <li> It really takes the hassle out of dealing with curly hair..</li>
            <li> it is very beat up.  </li>
            <li> works really well, but one thing</li>
            <li> I still really like this product</li>
            <li> Ha, thanks bae.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly hair &amp; this product acts as a mousse &amp; hairspray.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that can get frizzy fast depending on humidity.  </li>
            <li> shipper was very reliable.</li>
            <li> This product works very well for curly hair.  </li>
            <li> But what I have found that it&#x27;s really all about the serum you use before a curl cream, the serum is what controls the frizz.</li>
            <li> Slide the tshirt off gently.</li>
            <li> I really like this--and my husband does too.</li>
            <li> Really like this product.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t stand it, will have to get rid of this product.</li>
            <li> While my hair was wet, it looked OK.  </li>
            <li> Received it fast.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping also.</li>
            <li> My hair is straight</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think it enhances the curl too much either</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what I really like about the Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and find this product helps with shine and softness.</li>
            <li> and it behaves very well with this product.</li>
            <li> very manageable  </li>
            <li> I have mid-length very curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Really did not like this product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m probably going to have to toss the whole thing.</li>
            <li> I really do like this product</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair and use about two dime sized pumps for my whole head</li>
            <li> Very unmanageable, lets put it that way.  </li>
            <li> It really does transform my hair from a lion&#x27;s mane to well defined curls.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair and am 53 years old (so often it&#x27;s more like naturally frizzy hair).  </li>
            <li> One of the more expensive but effective curl defining products I have used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not real crazy about the scent</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair &amp; have used too many products to count over the years with only so-so results!</li>
            <li> She says it makes her hair curl better, but feel soft at the same time.</li>
            <li> smells is nice, but I may revert back to Kerastis, or 10 product for similar, yet softer results.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Love it for my once straight hair that has suddenly become naturally curly...</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and the curls I get with this hair product are smooth and soft without the crunch.</li>
            <li> This smells great, and is thick but not heavy.  </li>
            <li> Make sure the top isn&#x27;t tight and flat.</li>
            <li> I have soft waves and curls without stiffness, frizz is controlled, and since I no longer use a blow dryer or flat iron, my hair is really healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> Great product, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I was excited when it finally arrived to see how it would work for my hair.</li>
            <li> I was told that I would find this product much easier to use with better results (advised not to use too much because it tends to be oily/weight hair down).  </li>
            <li> I have long, curly/wavy hair that seems to have a mind of its own, and came across this product (Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream) after doing extensive research online.</li>
            <li> One a regular day I reach from my shea moisture products, but on special occasions when I want my hair to look</li>
            <li> I have a thinner hair strand, with loose curls that are disturbed easily.  </li>
            <li> but since my hair is so dry I prefer to let it finish drying naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product makes my hair smell AMAZING as if I just came back from the hair dresser.</li>
            <li> First curl creme that works in my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> Loose, natural curlsm, plus my hair smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I let my hair dry naturally and was overall very pleased.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product!  </li>
            <li> I live in Florida o humidity and curly hair are always an issue!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new way of doing my hair!</li>
            <li> and I live in South with very humid weather.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very humid where I live and</li>
            <li> I live in really humid weather and oils</li>
            <li> Less is more with this product.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to make my hair more presentable and less out of control, and that&#x27;s what I got.</li>
            <li> And the frizz control was a main reason I purchased</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be realistic, you cannot change your hair type.</li>
            <li> so I could actually use it for the moisturizing benefits but the smell is worth it alone haha.</li>
            <li> She has been back to get more multiple times.</li>
            <li> Though I didn&#x27;t tell them to buy the same 3 bottle is only for one person to use, one bottle for one person to use in 3 months is still too much mostly.</li>
            <li> I find it works particularly well with a diffuser.  </li>
            <li> Very strong perfumed smell, unfortunately too strong for me.  </li>
            <li> i highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone with curly hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Moroccan Oil Curl Defining Cream.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for anyone with curly hair</li>
            <li> The smell is a little overwhelming.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty heavy cream that gives good definition and prevents a lot of frizz, but doesn&#x27;t leave the crispy crunchy feeling that other heavier curl creams do.</li>
            <li> My hair tends to go flat too quickly.</li>
            <li> Not to mention the smell is addictive and leaves hair super soft!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much to manage frizz keeps hair soft</li>
            <li> You put it on wet &amp; it keeps curls frizz free.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair, and I can usually get a nice curl with mouse.</li>
            <li> After just a few uses, I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> In addition to not washing the heck out of my hair every day with harsh shampoos, this cream is making my hair look better than it ever has.</li>
            <li> This is so worth the extra bucks!</li>
            <li> I rarely bother posting reviews on Amazon (although I read them religiously!)</li>
            <li> This cream only does that if you apply heat to your hair, which I rarely do to prevent damage to my hair.</li>
            <li> Normally I use leave in conditioner and then light/wavy gel.  </li>
            <li> I did my normal routine of shampooing and conditioning and towel drying my hair.  </li>
            <li> It is very greasy and your hair stay white after the first application.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok the first day, but seems to weigh down my curls the second day.</li>
            <li> and I live in a place where there is high humidity</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and found that using max 3-4 pumps while your hair damp is more than enough.</li>
            <li> It not only defines the curls, it gives them a soft, natural look that is silky and calm, NOT frizzy!  </li>
            <li> It provides just the right amount of hold I need especially during the friz prone months.</li>
            <li> I decided to order some right away, and chose the curl cream rather than the regular oil.  </li>
            <li> Most products make may hair feel stiff or crunchy, this cream leaves it feeling like curly hair should fee.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try to put your hands on the very top of your head because it will make your scalp greasy (at least in my case!)</li>
            <li> I use mine every day and maybe have to buy a new one twice a year?</li>
            <li> Allergist advised me to eliminate use of any new products I was using.</li>
            <li> It DOES define the curls where they are but does not create new curls.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> This product was used on me and recommended by my new hair stylist who loves the Moroccan Oil line of products.   </li>
            <li> Neither one of us can live without this product.</li>
            <li> Another thing, while I do have curly hair it is fine hair and this product doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> and very soft and took the frizz away.</li>
            <li> Luv the smell and it makes my course hair very soft to the touch</li>
            <li> very soft, reduces frizz.</li>
            <li> She loves the product, its not too heavy, smells great and helps form curls, controls frizz and doesnt make hair stiff.</li>
            <li> Soft curls!</li>
            <li> My curls are bouncy, curly (not stringy) and so soft!  </li>
            <li> and it keeps my curls soft as well!</li>
            <li> This product defines the natural curl in my hair and reduces frizz!</li>
            <li> My curls are big and this defines them pretty well.</li>
            <li> it keeps it defined but soft and not crunchy!</li>
            <li> If they pay the international shipping fee, I am willing to change the review stars.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t know if this was a woman&#x27;s product or universal but speaking from a man&#x27;s perspective</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s worth the price to keep buying, but we&#x27;ll see how long it lasts me -- I&#x27;m thinking quite a while since it&#x27;s a pretty big bottle</li>
            <li> Definitely would recommend if you&#x27;re willing to splurge.</li>
            <li> I normally love Moroccan Oil products that I have purchased from a salon in the past, but what I received from Perfumes World appeared to be a counterfeit product.  </li>
            <li> The two bottles came quickly and they were brand new, as to be expected.</li>
            <li> My hair is just past shoulder length, layered, and very curly, but it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li> However, for half dry hair or when I don&#x27;t know if I have time to blow out or just go curly, this will do both nicely.</li>
            <li> Love this product to control and tame my overly curly hair!  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need very much, I use a little larger than a pea size dot of it throughout my slightly above shoulder length hair, much more</li>
            <li> I took a chance on this product recently because the reviews were so positive.  </li>
            <li> I was not sure even it was refill or the original!</li>
            <li> Too heavy for fine hair.</li>
            <li> To ensure my hair does not get too used a certain product,  I alternate between the curl defining cream and Aveda Phomollient with a dab of Aveda Confixor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do think the curl cream provides a little more frizz control than the regular oil</li>
            <li> Came in a reasonable amount of time, a little less than if I purchased it in store, and seriously one if not THE BEST product I found for curls.</li>
            <li> Clear, defined curls with a non-greasy application.</li>
            <li> Curls are soft &amp; bouncy.</li>
            <li> The curl cream lets me work with my natural hair</li>
            <li> Brings out my natural curls.</li>
            <li> As far as performance goes, this product gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> Its a bit pricey and doesn&#x27;t really keep the hair in order especially when it humid and the scent is a bit overpowering.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t really work in humidity.  </li>
            <li> makes my hair really soft to the touch--SOFT HAIR&lt;</li>
            <li> Soft textured curls.</li>
            <li> this \\&quot;mousse/cream\\&quot; creates soft bouncy curls, but the smell is overpowering.  </li>
            <li> is natural.  </li>
            <li> but it lasts at least more than 4 months.</li>
            <li> Keeps hair soft while still holding the curl.  </li>
            <li> wow.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> A young man started hitting on this old woman.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and touchable with curls intact.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair.</li>
            <li> At my sisters suggestion, we both have natural curly hair, I decided to try the Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream.  </li>
            <li> It makes my curly hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> My hair is curly/wavy, and my husband&#x27;s hair is soft curls.</li>
            <li> Reduces the frizz &amp; defines the curls into soft tendrils.</li>
            <li> It tames the frizz and keeps hair soft.</li>
            <li> The MoroccanOil Curl Defining Cream has been the closest &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; hair product I have found so far.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend that people with naturally hydrated hair apply it at the roots.</li>
            <li> My husband has naturally wavy/ curly hair.</li>
            <li> Also, it leaves your hair extremely soft and controllable...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural curl without the frizz .</li>
            <li> As far as products go believe me when I say I have tried them all.</li>
            <li> The product is pricey but a bottle this size has lasted me around 5 - 6 months so far.</li>
            <li> My granddaughters are mixed race and have very curly hair.</li>
            <li> so if you are sensitive to smells</li>
            <li> My sis recommended this product for my 3 year old&#x27;s curly hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Makes hair soft and dries it quicker as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tames the frizz and makes my curls soft and manageable</li>
            <li> Only need a pea size squirt for the whole head.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened or how, but the bottom of the bottle COMPLETELY disintegrated.</li>
            <li> The most common word people use now to describe my curls-defined.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair &amp; have tried all types of products.</li>
            <li> This product has really brought my damaged curls back to life with just a littlr bit of this product on my strands.</li>
            <li> The only thing that is missing for me is slightly more hydration and frizz control.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for my thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> Not too oily, like pink oil, but just right.</li>
            <li> I have always gone agains my natural hair wave and used a flat iron to make it straight.</li>
            <li> More expensive than other products in stores, but definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li> However, this is the first product I have used that I would actually consider wearing my hair curly on a daily basis with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Back to the search for the perfect product for my curls :(</li>
            <li> Maybe if you have tight, coil-y hair this will work better, but if you have relaxed and loose waves</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair, so this product is much lighter in feel and less sticky than the gel products I used to use to combat frizz.</li>
            <li> a side note: my boyfriend likes things very natural, and doesnt like most perfumes, He is addicted to the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> not sure if they were used, but appeared to be mostly filled.</li>
            <li> However, it works really well on the hair and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> It separates the curls and defines them really well with minimal amount of product (so a bottle will last a while) and FINALLY my hair is smooth instead of dry at the ends.</li>
            <li> I have really thin  fine hair and not that much of it</li>
            <li> This cream is nice, but a little heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> The product is in a new dispenser, which is opaque, so I can&#x27;t see how much is there, and the dispensing unit is not compatible with other pump-type ones, so hope it doesn&#x27;t break.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I use more that the directions call for and other times less.</li>
            <li> I recently moved from New York to South Carolina and</li>
            <li> I only buy a new bottle every 6-8 months or so.</li>
            <li> Before I found Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream, I would give up trying to style my waves and just blow dry my hair straight.  </li>
            <li> This is the only stuff that really works for me, and people compliment me on my &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; (which is actually just the scent of this product) all the time.</li>
            <li> Second, I apply a small amount near the roots and top half of my head but not too much.</li>
            <li> No other products needed.</li>
            <li> A major, major bonus.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair just right to wear natural air dried or blown out.</li>
            <li> before this I had a bottle of the Moroccanoil intense hydrating cream witch weighed my hair down, I have naturally curly hair but its so soft that I can straighten it by just wrapping it in a bun</li>
            <li> Sadly, it doesn&#x27;t smell great like the shampoo and other products do.</li>
            <li> I let my hair dry naturally, brush through with a big comb, and it is ready to go.</li>
            <li> Too bad because this is a great product for my hair.</li>
            <li> It makes my curls look soft and gives just enough volume.</li>
            <li> Hair must be very damp to wet.</li>
            <li> naturally curly , it is a must have for daily hair routine.</li>
            <li> I use about 2-3 pumps o fthis on my wet hair and gently scrunch.  </li>
            <li> There is a perpetual wasteland of barely used products in my cabinet as I write this.</li>
            <li> Fantastic cream for curly, thick hair.</li>
            <li> Maybe I haven&#x27;t figured out what the right amount is, but it tends to be a little sticky feeling, and doesn&#x27;t help with volume at all.</li>
            <li> Liberal is sure to mean different things to different people.</li>
            <li> Its exactly the same as their other curl cream.</li>
            <li> favorite product, I have long thick hair and this bottle lasts me several months.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair to the middle of my back, so I require two pumps of the product to get all of my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently embraced my natural curls and; therefore, have been trying out different products.  </li>
            <li> I did notice that if I put too little, my hair dries funny and get fuzzy.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned the first time I used it because it felt somewhat oily.</li>
            <li> Now the more practical facts: does NOT make hair greasy, stiff or heavy.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that is long and quit unruly at times.</li>
            <li> The first day my hair was so dried out it felt like straw.  </li>
            <li> I have long thick but fine hair.</li>
            <li> and I think it would weigh my hair down too much.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy again due to the high price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the first time I use this product, sometimes it&#x27;s not easy to find</li>
            <li> I get compliments every day on my tame and pretty curls.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is easy to apply without being too thick, and helps me create soft tight curls with spring and shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then a new stylist applied the regular Moroccan Oil to my curls after a cut and sent me on my way with my hair still wet.  </li>
            <li> sort of does what it says it will, but only half as well as many other products that typically cost a quarter of the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the same as what my hair dresser uses, however, it is equally as good and a lot less expensive.</li>
            <li> I have never had curly hair and used to try to blow out straight the little wave I did have.  </li>
            <li> It leaves a really gross-feeling residue on my hair and does little to &amp;#34;define&amp;#34; my curls.</li>
            <li> It is highly concentrated so they only have to use maybe the size of a quarter for hair that reaches mid-way down their backs.</li>
            <li> when it is really damp out i do add a little oil to this product, but i only need a bit and this product lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> but after a week it was apparent that I had wasted 31 bucks and would be going back to the old routine.</li>
            <li> I can get the cream out if I open it up, but it is pretty hard without a pump.</li>
            <li> It really brought out the natural curl, added some volume, but didn&#x27;t get hard or sticky or dry feeling.  </li>
            <li> and it has decent hold but doesn&#x27;t result in stiff hair at all.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it does, for my hair, at least.  </li>
            <li> The 8.5 ounce bottle is going to last a LONG time.</li>
            <li> Product will last a long time.    </li>
            <li> Their hair is long and curly and this product is the only product we have found that defines and tames their curls, while leaving it flowy.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair (  botticelli curls vs. corkscrew) and this stuff adds much needed oil to the natural dryness of curly hair without weighing it down or making it look like an oil slick.</li>
            <li> I do have some natural curl and this cream doesn&#x27;t way down my hair</li>
            <li> [All you curly beauties will know exactly what I mean.]</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have found that doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair or leave it frizzy.</li>
            <li> I like that I can just wet my curls a bit in the morning and add some curl defining cream, and do the same thing the next day without having product buildup in my hair.  </li>
            <li> A few days later I got another compliment on my &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34;  I asked the young lady to smell my hair.  </li>
            <li> Only 1 pump for my long hair means this lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I expected to be a poofy mess by the time I got home in the humid DC summer, but lo and behold my hair dried into reasonably shiny soft ringlets with just a hint of frizz.  </li>
            <li> That was the first thing I notice and the subtle fragrance lasts in your hair.  </li>
            <li> With my coarse texture and tightly coiled curls, this cream allows me to maintain third and even fourth day hair.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to find something that really works on curly hair</li>
            <li> higher heat settings and heavy blowing really create a ton of frizz), 5) leave a little bit of the hair slightly wet (meaning, don&#x27;t blow dry it until the hair is crispy dry) and let it air dry a little bit.</li>
            <li> This curl defining cream is a fabulous product, but expensive.  </li>
            <li> When my hair is shorter, it&#x27;s not much of an issue, but now that my hair is longer, my curls were starting to look stringy and frizzy.    </li>
            <li> This was for my daughter who has long medium curly hair.  </li>
            <li> and I have long hair.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time for me.  </li>
            <li> So far has made my hair heavy and doesn&#x27;t keep all the frizzies away.</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Moroccanoil has made me a believer and a long term customer.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this product as long as they continue to produce it.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and have long embraced it.</li>
            <li> but this bottle was so completely different and worse compared to the first one I received.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly thick hair</li>
            <li> My hair is very curly and thick</li>
            <li> and now I can finally wear my hair down on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> I did just get a keratin treatment so hard to tell how it would actually work without that, but so far, like it and as mentioned the smell reminds me of being at my salon!</li>
            <li> it leaves my hair soft and moisturized without the stiff feel and look of gel.</li>
            <li> Not only that, because there was no cap, it leaked all over my other gifts as well.</li>
            <li> so I was unable to use the product in its original bottle.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m really big on consistency and how a product works with other products...</li>
            <li> Similar to other moroccanoil products.  </li>
            <li> While expensive worth every cent!</li>
            <li> No different than any other curl cream.</li>
            <li> But on the other hand, because of how the pump and the bottle are constructed, it&#x27;s a pain to scrape the last bits of product out before you recycle the bottle.</li>
            <li> None of that hard wet looking hair that no one wants to even touch.</li>
            <li> I use it along with a light gel to give enough control so my hair doesn&#x27;t go crazy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always running in the morning and just apply and let it air dry</li>
            <li> I am 40 and have had curly dry hair for years.  </li>
            <li> hair is no longer dry and damaged, and no longer looks oily -</li>
            <li> Then I air dry.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s already dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t straiten or blow-dry my hair, just moroccanoil and air dry</li>
            <li> It does NOT work well applied to dry hair.</li>
            <li> With this product, all I do is towel dry my hair, apply the Defining Cream, scrunch my hair and air dry.  </li>
            <li> and I have noticed that my hair has lost a lot of moisture and has become dry.  </li>
            <li> I scrunch it in my damp hair and let air dry.  </li>
            <li> Let dry.</li>
            <li> It allows me to wash my hair and then put this in and style it with a brush (no dryer) and let it dry.  </li>
            <li> I use it: After showering, I carefully dry my hair by scrunching it with a towel.</li>
            <li> Now I put this cream in my shampooed hair, blow dry</li>
            <li> and then let it air dry.  </li>
            <li> It can even be applied to dry hair to refreshen curls.  </li>
            <li> I am biracial(white&amp;black) and have dry medium textured curly hair, so when it comes to my locks</li>
            <li> She prefers to keep her hair long and this product helps keep loose curls when the weight of the length can loose form of the curls.</li>
            <li> I have waist length, thick curly hair in a combination of tight, loose, wavy and almost straight (at the back of my neck).  </li>
            <li> So to give my hair a break from the flat irons, curling irons, and other hair tools, I decided to let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> Keep it loose and airy.</li>
            <li> This product keeps my curls even, especially if I flip my hair over and apply it while my hair is upside down.</li>
            <li> (the blow dryer won&#x27;t straighten it down here) for a low frizz look.</li>
            <li> Helps to eliminate frizz but for my coarse and curly hair I find a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I will try again, with less handling next time.    </li>
            <li> Put on wet hair and let it air dry or use diffuser.</li>
            <li> You only have to use just a little each time, so it lasts for a really long time!</li>
            <li> , 4) blow dry with diffuser on a medium heat setting with minimal blowing power (</li>
            <li> They are bi-racial (Black &amp; White)</li>
            <li> They are very similar but this one is slightly lighter.  </li>
            <li> I had recently bought some oil in the black hair section</li>
            <li> This product may seem less miraculous to people who actually know what they are doing with their hair, but it&#x27;s changed my life.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry hard like a gel and softens considerably throughout the day.</li>
            <li> The products are a little expensive, but last a long time and are worth the cost.  </li>
            <li> If I want a little extra control, I will use the Moroccanoil Curl Control Mousse as well.  </li>
            <li> I have wavy/curly hair and my type of hair gets very very very dry, I used mouse before and that made my dryness even worse, with this product my hais has changed so much.</li>
            <li> It held my natural waves in place and added some shine to my normally dull hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad because I really enjoyed the smell.</li>
            <li> Using a round bristle brush on dampish hair I can actually make ringlets by twisting the hair pieces.  </li>
            <li> So use it on wet hair.</li>
            <li> and my curls feel rough.  </li>
            <li> The curls are defined and hold until I wet my hair again.</li>
            <li> I usually spent five dollars at stuff at the drugstore...</li>
            <li> I use it after I condition my hair while it&#x27;s still wet.  </li>
            <li> 1) wash and condition hair, 2) while hair is still relatively wet, comb it the way I want it took post blow-drying (meaning, part it where I want it and layer it</li>
            <li> My hair was not as curly as I expected.</li>
            <li> Product and shipping as expected from seller.</li>
            <li> I have thick frizz-prone naturally curly hair, that quite frankly I&#x27;ve never figured out how to handle.</li>
            <li> I was using Silk Infusion by Chi, but with the summer heat and constant washing my hair was looking dull and my waves were flat.</li>
            <li> CAN NOT LIVE WITH OUT THIS STUFF!!</li>
            <li> It is not strong to me though, just enough.</li>
            <li> Only thing I&#x27;ve found to tame my mane without making it frizzy or crunchy.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for several years, adds body and extreme curling &amp; shine when hair dried and scrunched.</li>
            <li> You only need to use a little bit if not your curls will come down.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on how this product would work on very tight coarse curly hair.</li>
            <li> It gives a slightly sticky texture if you apply it to dry hair, so I always apply it when my hair is still damp.</li>
            <li> I decided to splurge on this because for some reason my hair has lost some of its natural curl over the past few years</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Just to reiterate, I find a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that I don&#x27;t need to use any other product either (mousse or hairspray) which is another plus.</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly, frizzy hair</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly, frizzy, and generally unmanageable hair.</li>
            <li> I prefer other curl cremes to this one.</li>
            <li> , it makes you want to give up every other perfume or scent</li>
            <li> When it dries, it does not feel crunchy like other curl creams I have used.  </li>
            <li> WAY heavier than if I use mousse or gel or other curling creams.</li>
            <li> My hair is 2 sizes larger than it usually is and there are no curls to be seen.  </li>
            <li> You only need a small amount</li>
            <li> sister on the other hand has CURLY hair and it keeps her curls defined.</li>
            <li> I get tons of compliments on my hair, which I&#x27;ve been wearing in a ponytail for years due to styling ineptitude, now.  </li>
            <li> Given that this is pretty expensive</li>
            <li> This and a little spray will keep my hair all day once it is dry.  </li>
            <li> I twist my hair into small curls with my fingers and either blow it dry or let it air dry.</li>
            <li> It is super-heavy and almost \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; on the hair and seems to drag the hair down.  </li>
            <li> Holy cow.  </li>
            <li> I finally feel like I can tame this hair of mine!</li>
            <li> And I only need a little, compared to other leave-ins that I used in the past.</li>
            <li> Anyway, just for background information, I have long moderate-thickness crazy hair; its a combination of tight curls, loose curls, wavy, and pin straight hair.  </li>
            <li> I have dark think wavy hair</li>
            <li> only Negative Side</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Asian man with thick wavy hair and this product provides my hair with moisture for ease of styling.  </li>
            <li> have thick, unruly blonde hair that was never anything but frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, wavy/curly/frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, waist long hair that&#x27;s a combo of tight curls, loose curls and waves.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair and this relaxes it so that it&#x27;s not as tight curls.  </li>
            <li> I rub 2-3 pumps (I have long hair past my shoulders) between my palms and scrunch the product into my hair from halfway down to the ends.</li>
            <li> All my curly-haired friends apply gel and let their hair air dry, and that never worked for me despite trying a myriad of curl gels and creams--I always ended up with a stiff frizzy mess.  </li>
            <li> The only cream I use for my thin, dry curly hair.</li>
            <li> If you have thinner hair, it will weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> (If I don&#x27;t my curls start 1/4 of the way down my head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Beware, don&#x27;t use a lot all at once, it weighs your hair down and makes it look oily.</li>
            <li> it tones down the frizz and defines the curls without weighing them down or feeling crunchy.</li>
            <li> just leave my hair weighed down and sticky.  </li>
            <li> It supports the curl without weighing down your hair and minimizes frizz.</li>
            <li> this product allows for me to wear my hair down without the frizz.</li>
            <li> But it seemed to weigh them down and not take away the frizz.</li>
            <li> cuts down the need for a curl lotion and moroccan oil as separate items.</li>
            <li> Weighed my hair down, felt sticky and greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy or sticky &amp; doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> I use a little balm or putty to really fluff afterwards!</li>
            <li> No more maintenance or standing in front of the mirror for so long!  </li>
            <li> :  Defines my curls without looking wet or feeling crunchy and stiff</li>
            <li> It has no control over frizz, which is disappointing, because it was advertised to do so right on the bottle</li>
            <li> Not sure how I haven&#x27;t found out about this product sooner, as I have very long curly hair.</li>
            <li> Delivery as expected, however both bottles were missing their lids and had a little product running down the sides...</li>
            <li> Ever since I can remember, I&#x27;ve had trouble with one side of my hair being curlier than the other side as well as being frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I have half straight/frizzy half wavy hair....</li>
            <li> I have less frizz</li>
            <li> Then I slightly scrunch (over scrunching creates frizz).</li>
            <li> But still leaves my hair slightly frizzy.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer noted the product does not appear as in the photograph or like previous bottles I have purchased from my hair stylist.</li>
            <li> I usually flip my head upside down and blow-dry with a diffuser for a few minutes to help my hair dry faster.</li>
            <li> this seems to weigh down curls no matter how much or little product is used</li>
            <li> This product was a huge disappointment!  </li>
            <li> By days end, my hair is a frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly long frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I am Caucasian and have long brown hair that is thick, frizzy, curly, and puffy.</li>
            <li> I have thick, culy, long hair.</li>
            <li> I have long thick curls</li>
            <li> Ihave long thick friz.  </li>
            <li> I wish the cream wasn&#x27;t so heavy, because it weighs my hair down and makes it look oily after my school day.</li>
            <li> What I have found is that a product either makes my hair oily and heavy and slightly greasy looking or</li>
            <li> I still have a little frizz, but that seems to be par for the course with my hair.  </li>
            <li> It is a little bit oily/greasy feeling to the touch</li>
            <li> , it makes me headache a little bit.</li>
            <li> A little cheaper here than in the salon.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little...</li>
            <li> It is a little pricy though.</li>
            <li> it just a little while scrunching</li>
            <li> Just a little amount is needed.  </li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t look like new, it&#x27;s scratched on blue label and the really bad thing</li>
            <li> and it seems very hard to get the money back.</li>
            <li> Redken, Paul Mitchell, Quidad, Carol&#x27;s Daughter and all the products either made my hair flake, made my hair too crunchy, or weighed down my curls!</li>
            <li> I am black and filipino, so my hair type ranges from curls to TIGHT curls (and I have coarse/thick hair)!</li>
            <li> A bit expensive , I think more people would use it if it were less expensive !</li>
            <li> The cream is a bit heavy.</li>
            <li> After my hair dried it didn&#x27;t feel oily at all.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few creams that works for me.</li>
            <li> For me, it does need to be refreshed with a few spritzes of water after a day or so, but that&#x27;s it</li>
            <li> Not cheap</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and this keeps the frizz away without making my hair look wet or being crunchy.</li>
            <li> so basically i wasted my money on bull s</li>
            <li> but it is not too heavy.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel SO greasy and heavy.</li>
            <li> It would take me an hour to straighten everyday.  </li>
            <li> It does not smooth hair at all.</li>
            <li> It was too heavy for my hair</li>
            <li> Within a few minutes, I could tell I was either going to have a headache or a full-blown migraine all day.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair heavy.</li>
            <li> and I wasted triple times products fee the shipping fee to get them and to return.</li>
            <li> even when it dried, I could smell my hair throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> This product is not too heavy for people with lighter wavy curls.</li>
            <li> Can be too heavy on hair.</li>
            <li> It is too heavy for mine.  </li>
            <li> was so heavy</li>
            <li> It took me a few washes to figure out that my hair needs 3 pumps.</li>
            <li> I hate to be negative, but I have to use mousse on top of the curl cream to manage the frizz.</li>
            <li> a wide tooth comb, 3) take just a blot (very little truly!)</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that is difficult to tame, this cream works wonders.  </li>
            <li> Never crunchy or stiff.</li>
            <li> This product defines and maintains curls without making hair stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li> This product helps bring wavy curls out but does not make hair look stiff like a gel product would.</li>
            <li> I gave this 4 stars because it did help diminish frizz and encourage curl without being crunchy or stiff looking.  </li>
            <li> I have tight curls and this works wonders on keeping them tamed all day!</li>
            <li> I use an average of at least 4 to 5 pumps on my hair.</li>
            <li> Will buy more..just a little pricey!</li>
            <li> My daughter has thin curly hair that is frizzy and very dry.</li>
            <li> Maybe I can  start saving my money for other things now!!!</li>
            <li> The smell dissipated within a few minutes after putting it on and I forgot about it!  </li>
            <li> I have purchased this product in the past at my salon which no longer carried this line.  </li>
            <li> It is also a very expensive hair product which made it all the more disappointing.</li>
            <li> and whenever I apply it, even in small amounts, my hair just feels greasy.  </li>
            <li> Although product works as advertised, the scent can be devastating for many people.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that the cream is heavy and thick.</li>
            <li> , personally, feel it&#x27;s expensive for the amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even straighten it this past weekend.  </li>
            <li> I have wavy hair with a small amount of curl.  </li>
            <li> Not sticky, heavy, or greasy!</li>
            <li> In the past I had to use a leave-in conditioner then gel</li>
            <li> I like the smell, but it does not really have the curl effect on my natural wavy/curly hair. :(</li>
            <li> No more sticky, crunchy curls or unmanageable frizz.</li>
            <li> I purchased this at the salon because the product that I usually use was not in stock.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s usually still damp here and there</li>
            <li> This seller is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too heavy or greasy, too thick or crunchy.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this for the past 30 years.</li>
            <li> The major disappointment with me, is the perfume they add into the product.  </li>
            <li> Left hair feeling very heavy and dirty.</li>
            <li> Gives definition without that hard crunchy after feel.  </li>
            <li> I Iove how it doesn&#x27;t give it the hard crunchy look that I dread.</li>
            <li> Duh.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be too thick for my hair.  </li>
            <li> The product isn&#x27;t as thick.  </li>
            <li> My hair is extremely thick and wavy and this product does the trick..</li>
            <li> I have thick corse hair with waves and curls and it works well on my hair.</li>
            <li> I have wavy, thick hair.</li>
            <li> You have to use it sparingly, and I have VERY thick hair, otherwise my hair becomes stiff with product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean, it was my fault, but</li>
            <li> The label says use a &amp;#34;liberal&amp;#34; amount, what does that even mean?</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the price is a little steep given that I usually use 3-5 pumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more frizz for me!</li>
            <li> Makes hair look greasy, even in very small portions.  </li>
            <li> A very small amount of this product keeps the frizz away and helps the curls keep their shape.</li>
            <li> However, be wary of buying it from unauthorized dealers online -- mine was either watered down or expired.</li>
            <li> This is for seriously curly hair.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny when you dont have to listen to a teenager complain about bad hair days!!</li>
            <li> One challenge is that it is difficult to see where you have already applied, I tend to miss a few spots.</li>
            <li> It is not good for curly hair at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very impressed with the Moroccan Oil line.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and does the job.  </li>
            <li> No touching anything!!</li>
            <li> Would give 4 stars, but my container came broken and I have to move heaven and earth to get the cream out of the tube.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with the results</li>
            <li> I cant really hold this against the product considering that may hair isnt just one type of curl or wave, but an insane combo of everything.  </li>
            <li> Moreover, out of the 3 or 4 bottles I&#x27;ve purchased, the pumps have broken on two, so the dispenser leaves something to be desired.</li>
            <li> This stuff works SO well for my thick, curly hair!!</li>
            <li> geat for very thick curly hair !</li>
            <li> Company ended up sending the wrong product.  </li>
            <li> It was really expensive and works, but they&#x27;ve got to change the overpowering powdery smell for me to buy it again.</li>
            <li> The scent is faint.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I did not read the review before I purchased the item.</li>
            <li> I always thought Morrocan Oil was overhyped and expensive, but now I think this is the miracle hair product I have been waiting for all my life.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s expensive)...</li>
            <li> If you have dry, wavy or curly hair, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed!</li>
            <li> or it will itch your scalp bad</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed with how I received this item.</li>
            <li> Because every curly-haired woman knows that the wrong combo of products can make a horrible and crunchy hair day!</li>
            <li> it is very inconvenient to use it.</li>
            <li> I hate the price, but once you&#x27;ve found a product that works, you have to stick with it.</li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>
            <li> Plus very bad customer service</li>
            <li> Very bad attitude</li>
            <li> Very bad product, it is the worst thing i ever used.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with the results I got from this product.  </li>
            <li> I cannot pump out the cream, and  felt very disappointed about the purchase.</li>
            <li> So mad it didn&#x27;t work for the price I paid!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fake product!!!</li>
            <li> but I felt compelled to write on this one because I SO hated this product!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love curling my hair with this product i dont live without it</li>
            <li> Sadly, it doesn&#x27;t smell great like the shampoo and other products do. The cream is a bit heavy.</li>
            <li> Love this product! If you have curly hair I strongly recommend this product, best I&#x27;ve  ever used! A bit expensive , I think more people would use it if it were less expensive !</li>
            <li> This smells amazing.  My hair is wavy and does a great job on it.  If you have thinner hair, it will weigh it down.  I have very thick hair and does the job.  I did notice that if I put too little, my hair dries funny and get fuzzy.</li>
            <li> Styles the curls, smells great, adds body, isn&#x27;t greay</li>
            <li> This stuff works SO well for my thick, curly hair!! I use it along with a light gel to give enough control so my hair doesn&#x27;t go crazy. The smell is amazing. I love it! Soft curls!</li>
            <li> Ever since I can remember, I&#x27;ve had trouble with one side of my hair being curlier than the other side as well as being frizzy.  This product keeps my curls even, especially if I flip my hair over and apply it while my hair is upside down.</li>
            <li> Company ended up sending the wrong product.  They did re-mail the correct one.  I felt the product has too strong of a smell. Plus it does have silicone in it, which I&#x27;ve read in the &amp;#34;Curly Girl&amp;#34; book, you want to avoid.  Hence why I did not keep it.</li>
            <li> Great product for naturally curly hair!</li>
            <li> People hug me just to smell my hair.  This keeps it sassy and curly and smelling delicious!  I love it.</li>
            <li> Moroccanoil is all you should ever use on your hair.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair and am 53 years old (so often it&#x27;s more like naturally frizzy hair).  This made my hair very curly (maybe a bit too much!) and very soft and took the frizz away. I was concerned about the smell when I first used it because it&#x27;s pretty perfume-y.  The smell dissipated within a few minutes after putting it on and I forgot about it!  Love it.</li>
            <li> Came in a reasonable amount of time, a little less than if I purchased it in store, and seriously one if not THE BEST product I found for curls. I even use it to straighten my hair along with some blow out cream and it works like a charm. Plus this product lasts and lasts. My last container I had for 2 years and yes, I used it weekly.</li>
            <li> Love it, smells great and enhances my curls!</li>
            <li> Great product for those with curly or wavy hair. My stylist recommended this to me one of the last times I went for a cut and she uses this stuff on her hair as well.  I have very long hair and found that using max 3-4 pumps while your hair damp is more than enough. I&#x27;m always running in the morning and just apply and let it air dry and my curls start to take form shortly thereafter. I&#x27;ve found that I don&#x27;t need to use any other product either (mousse or hairspray) which is another plus. I love the smell and am always getting compliments. At the salon I&#x27;ve bought it for close to 40.00 so buying it on here for about 1/2 price is a good steal.</li>
            <li> I have half straight/frizzy half wavy hair....I have always gone agains my natural hair wave and used a flat iron to make it straight. I tried alot of different jells and curl products but nothing has ever made me happy to the point that I would wear my hair curly on a regular basis. This is hands down the best product on the market for curly hair. It smells and feels amazing!!!! None of that hard wet looking hair that no one wants to even touch. I wash my hair at night and fall asleep with the curl control cream in my hair and when I wake up my hair has beautiful soft curls that i cant stop being happy about. It has made my time to get ready so much faster! Its the besssttt!</li>
            <li> I received this item without a cap. It is a gift. Pretty embarrassing to give a gift without a cap. Not only that, because there was no cap, it leaked all over my other gifts as well. Extremely disappointed with how I received this item. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product in the past at my salon which no longer carried this line.  It was wonderful to have it arrive so fast.  This item is great for a leave in conditioner that enhances your curl as well as adding that shine you expect from this line.  Your hair feels so silky.  A wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that is difficult to tame, this cream works wonders.  I have less frizz and my curls are defined and stay all day.  A penny-nickel size amount is all I need for my shoulder length hair. This bottle will last you ages aswell, it lasts me a good 3-4 months even with my teenager \\&quot;sharing\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> I am 40 and have had curly dry hair for years.  What I have found is that a product either makes my hair oily and heavy and slightly greasy looking or it frizzes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product gives me fantastic curls.  I use it with the moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, and it is excellent.  Best money I have ever spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t love is the smell, it is a rather strong scent; however, to have the curls it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this on towel damp hair and work it in, and the scrunch.  (If I don&#x27;t my curls start 1/4 of the way down my head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is no longer dry and damaged, and no longer looks oily - I just have great curls!!!!</li>
            <li> Thank you for the prompt service. I have tried to get my hair stylist to get me more to no avail. Thank you for having this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried hundreds of products in my lifetime....a long life for sure! I have used leave- in  conditioners, with gel, or styling creme, and hairspray. This product is so wonderful all I need is the Moroccanoil curl control cream. I put  a tiny dab into my hands, rub my hands together to emulsify, and spread product through hair. Then comb it through and style...No other products needed. My hair looks styled, natural, and holds on its own. Never crunchy or stiff. Love it! Maybe I can  start saving my money for other things now!!!</li>
            <li> Great for my naturally curly hair. Been using it for 2-3 years now and still love it.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and I have been at war with it since I can remember.  I&#x27;ve actually spent most of my life with boy-short hair because I couldn&#x27;t manage it.  My mother in law tivo-ed a clip about curly hair on the View (I think), and I tried out that method of handling my hair and it worked like magic.  (I think it is similar to the curly girl system.)  Basically it involves no shampoo etc.  You can google it.  I use this product, along with the actual morrocan oil, and it is fabulous.  Using a round bristle brush on dampish hair I can actually make ringlets by twisting the hair pieces.  Who knew!?  This stuff doesn&#x27;t seem too oily and I have a ton of hair and I don&#x27;t have to use too much.  It holds really well and just seems to make the hair curl better.  It only took me 30+ years and now I can finally wear my hair down on a regular basis.  Worth every penny, I bought some for my sister over the holidays as well.</li>
            <li> I love this product on my curly hair.</li>
            <li> loveeeeee it....thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I have dark think wavy hair and I trust me this is the best product you can get.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it over a year now and I live in South with very humid weather. My hair hasn&#x27;t looked any better.&lt;br /&gt;I also love the smell. Soooo gooood :)&lt;br /&gt;Try it once and you will also fall in love with it ;)</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! It produces soft curls and the scent is wonderful/ exotic. You don&#x27;t need very much, I use a little larger than a pea size dot of it throughout my slightly above shoulder length hair, much more and I think it would weigh my hair down too much. The 8.5 ounce bottle is going to last a LONG time. I first used it in Virginia while visiting family, the humid winter there created different curls than here in Colorado but still a great result.</li>
            <li> The cream is great even if not wearing hair curly. But it does provide the perfect curl control. Curls are soft &amp; bouncy.</li>
            <li> Love this product for my hair!</li>
            <li> The best curl cream on the market.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I recently moved from New York to South Carolina and my \\&quot;northern\\&quot; hair products just wouldn&#x27;t work in the higher heat and humidity.  The curl cream lets me work with my natural hair (the blow dryer won&#x27;t straighten it down here) for a low frizz look.</li>
            <li> Amazon.com is great! Nice job.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that is long and quit unruly at times. This cream works wonderfully to moisturize my hair, form the curls and keep frizz at bay. Very highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have fine natural, wavy hair and this product does absolutely nothing for my waves. It doesn&#x27;t enhance them at all, just makes my hair smell sooooo good. I wish the cream wasn&#x27;t so heavy, because it weighs my hair down and makes it look oily after my school day. The only reason why I gave it two stars was because it smelled amazing. Maybe if you have tight, coil-y hair this will work better, but if you have relaxed and loose waves this product does not help them keep their shape. So mad it didn&#x27;t work for the price I paid!!</li>
            <li> When it comes to my hair- I want it as low maintenance as possible. My hair is just past shoulder length, layered, and very curly, but it&#x27;s fine so it frizzes easily. For that reason love the curl control cream.&lt;br /&gt;I shower at night, and after squeezing out my hair and wrapping it in a towel for a few, I just pump 2 pumps of the Curl Control Cream onto my hands, rub them together, and gently work the cream into my damp hair; I let it air dry.&lt;br /&gt;My hair still looks good in the AM. If it doesn&#x27;t, I just dampen my hair gently (using my hands) and voila! done. I may use a squirt of Morrocanoil if it&#x27;s going to be humid, and just gently work it into the tips of my hair- maybe smooth down the top a bit. The two products work well together. I recommend buying them both.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance- mmmm. Love it. Totally worth the price- I promise.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair that needs to be coaxed into curling and this product does it quite well. I was a little concerned the first time I used it because it felt somewhat oily. After my hair dried it didn&#x27;t feel oily at all. And I really like the light, fresh fragrance it has!</li>
            <li> I used to use Bumble Bumble and still do sometimes. However, for half dry hair or when I don&#x27;t know if I have time to blow out or just go curly, this will do both nicely. Love it!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much to manage frizz keeps hair soft</li>
            <li> This product was a huge disappointment!  It is super-heavy and almost \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; on the hair and seems to drag the hair down.  It is also a very expensive hair product which made it all the more disappointing.</li>
            <li> I purchased this with Prime shipping from Camrose Trading Inc. DBA Fragrance Express and it is absolutely counterfeit.  No smell, no texture to the product, and definitely does not work.  I still have some from the one I purchased at a local beauty salon, and it is completely different.  Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> Been using this some time now. Works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> super quick shipping, I have bought this product in a salon for much more and it is a great product</li>
            <li> This product is definitely worth it, leaves my hair super soft and curly. Brings out my natural curls.</li>
            <li> Fantastic cream for curly, thick hair. Love it!</li>
            <li> One of the more expensive but effective curl defining products I have used. One a regular day I reach from my shea moisture products, but on special occasions when I want my hair to look just right I use this one. It has a strong, clean scent that isn&#x27;t too intrusive if you go for those kinds of soapy natural scents.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have waist length, thick curly hair in a combination of tight, loose, wavy and almost straight (at the back of my neck).  I think I have tried just about every product known to mankind for my curls.  When my hair is shorter, it&#x27;s not much of an issue, but now that my hair is longer, my curls were starting to look stringy and frizzy.    That is, until I tried this stuff.  Holy cow.  My curls haven&#x27;t looked this good in a L-O-N-G time!  My curls are bouncy, curly (not stringy) and so soft!  I still have a little frizz, but that seems to be par for the course with my hair.  I think I may have handled it too much while drying it with a diffuser.  I will try again, with less handling next time.    I am so pleased with how my hair looks...I would definately recommend this product!  I&#x27;m not real crazy about the scent, it&#x27;s a bit strong, but if it gives me a good hair day, I&#x27;ll cope....LOL  :)</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have naturally curly hair to the middle of my back, so I require two pumps of the product to get all of my hair. Put on wet hair and let it air dry or use diffuser. Reduces frizz and fly aways.</li>
            <li> While I like the product, the dispenser that it came in was damaged so I was unable to use the product in its original bottle.  I had to remove all of the contents and put into a new dispenser!!</li>
            <li> Love this product. It makes my hair realy curly..shipping was quick and packaging was great</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair, and I can usually get a nice curl with mouse. This product did not create curls and it felt sticky. I gave it to my sister.</li>
            <li> I use this product often.  When I ran out, I went to my salon and they were out so I was told to order it on line at Amazon.  I like the curl enhancee and it smells good too.</li>
            <li> Delivery as expected, however both bottles were missing their lids and had a little product running down the sides...not sure if they were used, but appeared to be mostly filled.</li>
            <li> I have tried every product that I can find to control my very curly hair, and have a cupboard filled with rejects to prove it! My hairdresser, which took me years to find, suggested I try the Curl Control Cream. I love it!  I never use shampoo(hairdresser&#x27;s suggestion), because it robs my hair of its natural oils, but I always use a good conditioner and the Control Cream when my hair is still damp.  I love my curls now, they&#x27;re much more manageable, and my Sweetheart loves the smell.</li>
            <li> Love this product, but my review is for the fulfilment.  It arrived without a cap at all, and some of the product got out.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I have extremely curly, frizzy hair and I use this when my hair is damp and just out of the shower. My hair doesn&#x27;t frizz and the curls are defined.</li>
            <li> I have thick, waist long hair that&#x27;s a combo of tight curls, loose curls and waves.  I wished my hair would make up it&#x27;s mind and be one kind of curly, but I&#x27;d also like to shed 10lbs in my sleep (not gonna happen).    I&#x27;ve tried many curl products and I think this one works the best for me.  I use it after I use the oil treatment and finger comb my hair.  Then I apply the curl control cream starting from the ends and finger comb some more. Then I slightly scrunch (over scrunching creates frizz). Then I air dry. Do not touch your hair while it dries.  My curls have never been so bouncy and springy.  I actually see cork screw curls I never knew I had.  I&#x27;ve accepted that my hair will never be PERFECT no matter how great the product is.  Curly hair is just that way. Some days it&#x27;s good, some day&#x27;s it&#x27;s not.  I think once people can accept that your hair pretty much does whatever it wants, they&#x27;d be happier with what the product can do. Love your hair and it&#x27;s many personalities! &#x3D;)    What I like about this product:  Defines my curls without looking wet or feeling crunchy and stiff (ew!)  Adds softness, shine and bounce.  Smells wonderful and clean.  Product will last a long time.    What I don&#x27;t like:  Does not work well with hair that&#x27;s already dry. It would be cool if I could use it to touch up, or calm the frizzies that pop up on top of your head, but it makes it greasy instead. So use it on wet hair.</li>
            <li> The only cream I use for my thin, dry curly hair. It makes my curls look soft and gives just enough volume.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for naturally curly hair.  Smells great, no frizz and lasts 2-3 days.  My daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> I use this daily, I also dye my hair, a lot. My hairdressers always ask me how my hair stays so healthy even though I dye it, the answer is this product. I don&#x27;t straiten or blow-dry my hair, just moroccanoil and air dry, maybe some hairspray if I&#x27;m going out on the town and want a more controlled defined look. It curls my hair nicely, and keeps it well hydrated. I have a lot of hair and I only use 2 pumps to get through all of it. Beware, don&#x27;t use a lot all at once, it weighs your hair down and makes it look oily. Less is more with this product. I use mine every day and maybe have to buy a new one twice a year? Its well worth the money. I hope this helps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note: my boyfriend likes things very natural, and doesnt like most perfumes, He is addicted to the smell of this product. I love it as well. It does have a smell to it. It is a strong smell, if you are looking for something unscented, this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be too thick for my hair.  I have very curly thick hair and whenever I apply it, even in small amounts, my hair just feels greasy.  But the main reason I would never buy it again is the strong scent this product has.  It smells like a mixture of a men&#x27;s aftershave and Moroccan Oil, very strong and barely airs out throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Very strong perfumed smell, unfortunately too strong for me.  The product itself works well for curls.</li>
            <li> Excellent product to enhance and style curly hair.  i have tried many curl defining products and this is the very best.  thank you</li>
            <li> As far as performance goes, this product gets the job done.  I have shoulder length wavy and fine hair. I work with servers. So, I spend most of my day under a computer room floor with hundreds of server fans blowing my hair in numerous directions. By days end, my hair is a frizzy mess. This product kept my hair looking great all day. My hair remained smooth, wavy &amp; frizz free.  However, the scent is not for nasal allergy sufferers. I sneezed uncontrollably for a week. I couldn&#x27;t determine what was happening. Neither my prescription drugs nor over counter drugs were working. Allergist advised me to eliminate use of any new products I was using. This was the only product. I stopped usage, washed hair and sneezing subsided.  Allergy sufferers beware.  Too bad because this is a great product for my hair. Wish they could eliminate the scent.   Can only give one star. Although product works as advertised, the scent can be devastating for many people. Thus, I can not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly, frizzy, and generally unmanageable hair. This is one of the few creams that works for me. Keep in mind that the cream is heavy and thick. If you are looking for something lightweight this wouldn&#x27;t be for you. This is for seriously curly hair. ;)</li>
            <li> love it the product is so good, my whole life looking for a product that really helps with my rebel curls.  Leave my curls soft, and smelling really good.</li>
            <li> My hair is very curly and thick but I have fine hair strands. Even when I only used a tiny bit of this, it made my hair oily. I prefer other curl cremes to this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Asian man with thick wavy hair and this product provides my hair with moisture for ease of styling.  Product is authentic and shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> I have short hair and have always fought curls. I wanted straight cute cuts like todays styles. My hair stylist tried this on me and I absolutely love my curls now. The frizz is gone and the curls are everywhere, without a perm. Won&#x27;t go a day with out my curl control cream!!!! Did I say I love it!</li>
            <li> as a 26 year old woman who has embraced her curly hair since the age of 15, this is single-handedly the best hair product for my curls that I&#x27;ve ever purchased. it tones down the frizz and defines the curls without weighing them down or feeling crunchy. so good!!</li>
            <li> I have tried every curly hair product out there, and this Moroccanoil Curl Cream is a favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really big on consistency and how a product works with other products...Because every curly-haired woman knows that the wrong combo of products can make a horrible and crunchy hair day! The consistency is easy to apply without being too thick, and helps me create soft tight curls with spring and shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part about this product is the way it smells. It is divine and I actually enjoy putting it on my hair because I know that yummy smell will last all day as I bounce around from the gym to work to happy hour and home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only Negative Side: I accidentally dropped this bottle outside as I was loading my gym bag in the car, and the top broke off and the spring came out...And I tried putting it back together, but it still doesn&#x27;t work. I can get the cream out if I open it up, but it is pretty hard without a pump. I wish the container wasn&#x27;t as easy to break...I mean, it was my fault, but still...A costly accident...Both for my hair that day and my wallet.</li>
            <li> Speedy shipping and competitive price.  Very happy with the product. Will order again soon.  Appreciated the cost and convenience capability!</li>
            <li> The cream smells nice and hold curl/waves in well without a lot of stiffness. Keeps frizz to a minimum - great for my humid climate! Would give 4 stars, but my container came broken and I have to move heaven and earth to get the cream out of the tube.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a product to keep curly hair shiny...this seems to weigh down curls no matter how much or little product is used</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t do anything for my curls.  In fact, left them frizzy.  I had used the Curl Mousse before and loved it.  Should have stuck with that instead.</li>
            <li> I should probably only give it 4 stars, because frankly, as far as curly hair products go, I swear by Ouidad and find it superior for taming frizz and keeping curls intact. BUT, the moroccanoil cream smells so insanely good, it makes you want to give up every other perfume or scent just so you can smell this in your hair. I&#x27;ve gotten plenty of compliments on the scent when people get close. I wish they made a travel size version of the bottle.</li>
            <li> This was for my daughter who has long medium curly hair.  Her hair is fine not coarse, but she has a lot of hair. She loves the product, its not too heavy, smells great and helps form curls, controls frizz and doesnt make hair stiff. She prefers to keep her hair long and this product helps keep loose curls when the weight of the length can loose form of the curls. The product arrived quickly and was priced well below what I have purchased it in hair salons.  She uses it almost every day and this size lasts her for months. It does have a fragrance, but both her and I think it is pleasant. Similar to other moroccanoil products.  I can&#x27;t comment on how this product would work on very tight coarse curly hair. Worth every penny when you dont have to listen to a teenager complain about bad hair days!!</li>
            <li> This has a strong but nice scent.  It leaves curly hair in defined curls without making them crunchy.  It helps control frizz better than anything else I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that can be really unruly. This product doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy like some others do and definitely keeps the frizz under control. And it makes my hair smell wonderful everyday.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very humid where I live and my curly hair does it&#x27;s own thing here in this climate.  This is great for me on days when I just want to towel dry my hair and let it just be curly.  It definitely does define the curl but it also helps it to dry in a more controlled manner.  I love this product and use it a lot especially during the summer.  Another thing, while I do have curly hair it is fine hair and this product doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  If you get this play around with it to figure out how much works best for your hair.  Sometimes I use more that the directions call for and other times less. (Who knows why that is!!!)</li>
            <li> I do not like this product. My beautician recommended if. I prefer Kerastase and regret that I ordered Moraccan oil.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with the results I got from this product.  Its a bit pricey and doesn&#x27;t really keep the hair in order especially when it humid and the scent is a bit overpowering.  Did&#x27;t do much for my hair.  I&#x27;v tried cheaper products that did a better job!</li>
            <li> this moroccaoil curl control is ok. it stops the frizzies. a bit greasy but ok. you get a lot for the money.</li>
            <li> Not much works for my &#x27;curls,&#x27; but this is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and I was told this would help control the frizz and curls.  I was not happy with the results</li>
            <li> This curl defining cream is a fabulous product, but expensive.  However, it works really well on the hair and lasts a long time.  I&#x27;ve not found any product on the market that compares to this one.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I like that I can just wet my curls a bit in the morning and add some curl defining cream, and do the same thing the next day without having product buildup in my hair.  The only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t really work in humidity.  I still have to use gel when it&#x27;s humid out.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;  1) this product does wonders giving my curls GOOD DEFINITION&lt;br /&gt;  2) makes my hair really soft to the touch--SOFT HAIR&lt;br /&gt;  3) and my husband and both I enjoy the scent. He says &amp;#34;it is strong when first applied, but it does smell nice after it sits a while.&amp;#34; (he&#x27;s quite blunt so not just being kind)--GOOD SCENT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;  1) NO FRIZZ CONTROL: It has no control over frizz, which is disappointing, because it was advertised to do so right on the bottle let alone the description. I hate to be negative, but I have to use mousse on top of the curl cream to manage the frizz. And the frizz control was a main reason I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;  2) PRICE, I, personally, feel it&#x27;s expensive for the amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product, but could be better.</li>
            <li> Love this product, makes my hair nice and curly, it does not make my hair oily, and it smell good.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for curly wavy hair, adds conditioner and hold without stiffness. My hair looks natural not stiff but the product prevents frizz for a great hold. There is no other product on the market as good as this one, at least I have not found one that is better. Try it you will love it and the price through amazon is very good (as long as you get a low shipping rate); in my local salon this product costs $32. I give this one 6 stars, its fantastic!</li>
            <li> The best curl cream for frizzy hair I have ever found!</li>
            <li> Product arrived and was as described. Love this product! Seller was helpful</li>
            <li> Soft textured curls. No crunch. Excellent. Smells good also</li>
            <li> very fast shipping excellent  product</li>
            <li> Love it. Helps to eliminate frizz but for my coarse and curly hair I find a little goes a long way. Too much will make the top of my hair greasy so I focus on the ends.</li>
            <li> This product defines and maintains curls without making hair stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I live in really humid weather and oils just leave my hair weighed down and sticky.  This cream is lightweight and it only takes about a dime size to get my hair in shape.  Love the way it smells too.</li>
            <li> My hair felt great for about 2 days.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and my curls feel rough.  The definition is there but the texture is not.  I couldn&#x27;t even straighten it this past weekend.  I washed my hair before I straightened it and my hair looked like straw. It hasn&#x27;t happened to me before.  I have healthy hair.  It&#x27;s too bad because I really enjoyed the smell.</li>
            <li> I really love the way this \\&quot;mousse/cream\\&quot; creates soft bouncy curls, but the smell is overpowering.  My husband complains that it smells like baby powder, so I&#x27;m reluctant to wear it.  It was really expensive and works, but they&#x27;ve got to change the overpowering powdery smell for me to buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love this product, works great &amp; has the best smell ever!  I was going to purchase at beauty store for 37 dollars and that is the store that has everything super cheap all the time, a normal store must carry this product for way more. could not believe when I bought this for this amazing price.</li>
            <li> Not sure how I haven&#x27;t found out about this product sooner, as I have very long curly hair. It separates the curls and defines them really well with minimal amount of product (so a bottle will last a while) and FINALLY my hair is smooth instead of dry at the ends. For me, it does need to be refreshed with a few spritzes of water after a day or so, but that&#x27;s it - you don&#x27;t need to add more product until you wash again. Also, if I put it too close to my roots, my hair can end up looking just a smidge oily, since it is oil-based.Oh yeah...and it smells awesome (scent can be a little strong if you use too much, but still awesome). Even my boyfriend commented that after using it my hair looked curlier, smelled great, and was very soft.  After just a few uses, I love this stuff. Definitely hooked and looking forward to trying others from the line.</li>
            <li> I love the Moroccanoil Treatment so I decided to try this product.  I&#x27;m African American and my hair is natural.  I cut it to a 4&amp;#34; afro and began using the Curl Defining Cream.  It&#x27;s nice.  When I wash or dampen my hair I add a good amount to my hair. I twist my hair into small curls with my fingers and either blow it dry or let it air dry. I then loosen the curls. The curls are defined and hold until I wet my hair again. It doesn&#x27;t dry hard like a gel and softens considerably throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the first time I use this product, sometimes it&#x27;s not easy to find or it&#x27;s more expensive in the stores. You only need to use a little bit if not your curls will come down. It&#x27;s not greasy and works great. Not cheap but it lasts at least more than 4 months.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and this is the only product that keeps my curls from frizzing, keeps my hair soft, and smells great.  It is not greasy and is truly the answer to curly haired girlsâ€™ prayers.</li>
            <li> Love this. My daughter has thin curly hair that is frizzy and very dry. In tandem with Moroccan Oil original treatment her hair has never been better. You need just a small amount applied mostly on the ends of the hair and it dries in gorgeous soft ringlets. It has a nice light smell that is not cloying or overpowering. Been using this on her hair for 5 months and will continue using.</li>
            <li> best product to tame frizzy and curly hair, people always complimented my curls it leaves my hair soft and moisturized without the stiff feel and look of gel. i highly recommend it</li>
            <li> product did exactly what it said it would - and I have very frizzy hair!!!</li>
            <li> I like this product, but didn&#x27;t feel like it held my curls as well as -- say -- Curls Rock.  The product isn&#x27;t as thick.  However, I think if you are looking for a more natural curly look (less structured) and frizz reducing serum, this is a GREAT product.  Also, it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I debated on buying it because of price but I&#x27;m so glad I did. My curls look and feel very lightweight. It works the best when applied to completely wet hair.</li>
            <li> I have curly/wavy/straight/frizz and everything in between on my Irish/Native American head. Is this the magic bullet? No, it&#x27;s not. Let&#x27;s be realistic, you cannot change your hair type. However, this is the first product I have used that I would actually consider wearing my hair curly on a daily basis with this stuff. Now the more practical facts: does NOT make hair greasy, stiff or heavy. Period. It does NOT work well applied to dry hair. Hair must be very damp to wet. You do NOT need a ton, like using gel. It DOES define the curls where they are but does not create new curls. Duh. If you have combination hair you will continue to have combination hair, but you will not hate it as much as you used to. Worth the money? Yes.</li>
            <li> This curl cream is fantastic for wild curly/frizzy hair. In addition to not washing the heck out of my hair every day with harsh shampoos, this cream is making my hair look better than it ever has. Packaged well and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Lasts about 2-3 months and I have long hair. Best to only use on the ends, avoid scalp, as it can leave the hair stiff and &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; feeling.</li>
            <li> Best cream, pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I buy this product locally so I know the real deal.  That&#x27;s exactly what I got, the real McCoy.  It&#x27;s awesome for my naturally &#x27;S&#x27; wave hair and controls the frizz like nothing else I&#x27;ve used.  Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> This product worked great and was a good size for the price. I used to have frizzy hair, but now it is a lot more controlled. Tons of compliments this week already. However, this product would be better named \\&quot;curl control cream\\&quot; because I wouldn&#x27;t say it \\&quot;defined\\&quot; my curls. Made my hair super soft and eliminated all or most frizziness. Would purchase again. I was looking for something to make my hair more presentable and less out of control, and that&#x27;s what I got. I would recommend buying this product at a salon so you don&#x27;t have to pay shipping.</li>
            <li> No kidding this stuff smells great and I have really curly hair so I could actually use it for the moisturizing benefits but the smell is worth it alone haha.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I get compliments every day on my tame and pretty curls.  I have recommended this product to a lot of people and most decided to buy it for themselves.  It really takes the hassle out of dealing with curly hair..</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for my thick, curly hair. It lasts a long time for me.  I&#x27;ve ordered it twice.  Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This was easy to buy and I am loving the product. Thanks for such great service. My hair has never been this soft before and my curls are nicely managed. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently embraced my natural curls and; therefore, have been trying out different products.  So far, this is the best I&#x27;ve found.  It supports the curl without weighing down your hair and minimizes frizz.</li>
            <li> This is a nice curl cream.  It&#x27;s light and not greasy.  When it dries, it does not feel crunchy like other curl creams I have used.  The scent is faint.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not subscribed to this stuff but I should be, I won&#x27;t use anything else! It&#x27;s the best curl cream I&#x27;ve found, really defines curls and leaves your hair soft, and controls frizz. Good stuff</li>
            <li> Finally, discovered a product that works for my curly hair.  It smells great and isn&#x27;t too heavy.  Keeps hair soft while still holding the curl.  Works great!</li>
            <li> wow.  love this product.  it works, makes my hair behave and smells delish. I use it every time I wash my hair</li>
            <li> This is curl cram is great.  My daughter loves it.  Gives her great soft curls</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I use it with a Pro-L leave in conditioner and it takes my troll-hair and tames it into smooth curls.  It is a little bit oily/greasy feeling to the touch but it is so worth it!</li>
            <li> Great all around buy. The two bottles came quickly and they were brand new, as to be expected. I would recommend using this product and vendor.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my hair smell and it keeps my curls soft as well!</li>
            <li> I love this curl cream.  This is the second time I have purchased it.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because of the condition of the container.  There was no cap and can came damaged.  I can still get product out of the container but it is very beat up.  It looks like it fell off the truck into oncoming traffic.</li>
            <li> Love the texture and smell of my hair!</li>
            <li> My husband and I both use this!!  We have wavy hair and this leaves our curls in perfect condition without looking like we have product in at all.  Prepare to get many compliments, b/c it smells great too</li>
            <li> I have to question the authenticity of this product.  Although it seems to be working the same as the moroccanoil curl defining cream I purchased at the salon. The awesome scent is not present.</li>
            <li> works really well, but one thing, it smells good but the smell is soooooo strong, it makes me headache a little bit.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair product ever!  I have thick curly hair and this keeps the frizz away without making my hair look wet or being crunchy.</li>
            <li> With my mop of curly hair, I&#x27;ve been through tons of products.  This is the only stuff that really works for me, and people compliment me on my &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; (which is actually just the scent of this product) all the time.</li>
            <li> If you already have wavy hair and you&#x27;re looking to define your waves and curls as well as prevent frizz and dryness, this is the product for you! The best part is, you only need a small amount per day and it lasts FOREVER! I only buy a new bottle every 6-8 months or so. I use in conjunction with Argan oil shampoo and conditioner and it&#x27;s great. I will never blowdry my hair again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very impressed with the Moroccan Oil line. I tried this and it didn&#x27;t really hold my curl at all, and left my hair kind of greasy. I think there are better, more natural products on the market. Not to mention the price is pretty high.</li>
            <li> The best stuff out there. Period. Smells amazing, doesn&#x27;t make your hair crispy and curls look fantastic! I usually spent five dollars at stuff at the drugstore... This is so worth the extra bucks!</li>
            <li> I have thick curly long frizzy hair. With 2 quarter size amounts, it holds my hair without feeling I have gel or mousse. Well worth it!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want the crunchy look on my curly hair.  this product allows for me to wear my hair down without the frizz.</li>
            <li> I have fine, curly hair and this fluffs and defines my curls beautifully. I have found my new best friend!</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair with a small amount of curl.  With this product, I have more defined waves and a lot of curl!  Before I found Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream, I would give up trying to style my waves and just blow dry my hair straight.  With this product, all I do is towel dry my hair, apply the Defining Cream, scrunch my hair and air dry.  I have soft waves and curls without stiffness, frizz is controlled, and since I no longer use a blow dryer or flat iron, my hair is really healthy and shiny. If I want a little extra control, I will use the Moroccanoil Curl Control Mousse as well.  The products are a little expensive, but last a long time and are worth the cost.  They smell great, too.</li>
            <li> This is NOT an AUTHENTIC Moroccan Oil product.  It lacks the signature MO scent, does not perform well at all, and the QR code has been scratched off the bottle.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM THIS SELLER.  Amazon will not refund this product, it has to be approved by the seller (going through that process now, will update if/when it has been resolved).  I am die-hard MO fan, but have encountered a lot of bogus MO products on Amazon that claim to be authentic.  Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, frizzy hair. This leaves my curls looking moisturized and healthy. It gives a slightly sticky texture if you apply it to dry hair, so I always apply it when my hair is still damp. Moroccan oil is very good for your hair&#x27;s health! I suggest all of MoroccanOil&#x27;s products!</li>
            <li> smells amazing and works well on my ntural curls</li>
            <li> made my fine hair too crunchy</li>
            <li> Best curly hair product smells amazing</li>
            <li> While expensive worth every cent! I have naturally curly hair &amp; have used too many products to count over the years with only so-so results! I used 1 pump on my chin length damp hair &amp; my hair looked amazing all day! Beautiful defined curls! Not sticky, heavy, or greasy! I received so many compliments on my hair &amp; the scent.</li>
            <li> Update 6/22/2015&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for about a month and I have noticed that my hair has lost a lot of moisture and has become dry.  I cut back to using this product to only 3-4 times a week and will probably have to do an overnight conditioning (I use Joico moisture recovery conditioner) once a month vs once every 3-4 months to counter balance this.  I still really like this product and I am waiting for the moroccanoil to come in and maybe that will help fight against it sucking out all the moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original:&lt;br /&gt;I really love this product.  I waited a few weeks to get a good sense of the product before I posted this review.  First off, this product smells amazing.  That was the first thing I notice and the subtle fragrance lasts in your hair.  Ha, I used this product in the morning after I showered, and went out with the guy that I have been dating for a while that evening. He doesnt always put things eloquently, but said &amp;#34;Your hair smells really good today&amp;#34;.  Ha, thanks bae.  Anyway, just for background information, I have long moderate-thickness crazy hair; its a combination of tight curls, loose curls, wavy, and pin straight hair.  This product helps to bring out the curls and the waves I have in my hair.  A little bit goes a long way.  It adds some shine, but I would like to try the moroccanoil oil as well to help with this.  The one thing that it doesnt do for me is control the frizz.  I cant really hold this against the product considering that may hair isnt just one type of curl or wave, but an insane combo of everything.  I love the volume it adds and the fact that it does bring out my curls.  Plus it keeps your hair soft and doesnt do that wet affect, which I am personally not a fan of.  Just to reiterate, I find a little goes a long way (My hair goes below my chest and about 3/4 of a pump works well for me).  I would highly recommend this product to anyone with curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have tight curls and this works wonders on keeping them tamed all day! By far the BEST product I&#x27;ve found after years of searching!</li>
            <li> Great product for curly girls</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok the first day, but seems to weigh down my curls the second day.</li>
            <li> I love how the product holds my curls, but I cannot stand the smell of the product. I have gone back to Bumble &amp; Bumble curl products, since the smell isn&#x27;t so strong. If you can stand the overpowering smell, then this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best leave-in that I have ever tried for my very curly hair. It is expensive, but it is wonderful. And I only need a little, compared to other leave-ins that I used in the past. Use in combination with the oil for a non frizz, shiny and defined curls hair!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have very curly hair &amp; this product acts as a mousse &amp; hairspray. It provides just the right amount of hold I need especially during the friz prone months.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this stuff. She says it makes her hair curl better, but feel soft at the same time. A little bit goes a long way and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Take the time to apply it well and it will keep most of the frizz away for up to 4 days.</li>
            <li> Love this products has really helped out with my dry hair .. Hair looks great! Will keep using !! Try it!</li>
            <li> My daughter is mixed and ive tried so many different products for her hair. this product is the best! and it makes her hair smell fantastic :)</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t the best with curl lifting, but was wonderful with controlling my frizz.  I let my hair dry naturally and was overall very pleased.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who has curly hair and it works really good, her curls look real nice.</li>
            <li> Love the product and the price!</li>
            <li> This product is great! I used to use the MoroccanOil Intense Curl Cream, but it was too heavy for my hair. The new Curl Control Cream has a great texture. I have long thick but fine hair. This cream gives me great waves.</li>
            <li> I love this it wish it was cheaper but worth it it&#x27;s hard to find something that really works on curly hair</li>
            <li> A young man started hitting on this old woman.  He finally told me it was because he loved my perfume.  I told him I wasn&#x27;t wearing any perfume.  He couldn&#x27;t believe it.  A few days later I got another compliment on my &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34;  I asked the young lady to smell my hair.  She did and said it was a beautiful scent.  I told her it was Moroccanoil.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! But still leaves my hair slightly frizzy. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again due to the high price</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product!  I have been using it for a couple of years now and it&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve ever used on my curly hair...and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of different products.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue (like silicone containing products), doesn&#x27;t leave it stiff and crunchy (yuck!), and best of all, it works!  It leaves my hair soft and touchable with curls intact.  People often comment about how great it smells.  People also ask what I am using to keep my curls from flying away.  I highly recommend Moroccan Oil Curl Defining Cream.  It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> I love this product because it smells fantastic and leaves my hair very soft and curly. Good price as well.</li>
            <li> Love this product to control and tame my overly curly hair!  I scrunch it in my damp hair and let air dry.  Loose, natural curlsm, plus my hair smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> Best hair product on the market for hard to manage curly hair.</li>
            <li> It was just ok. No different than any other curl cream. Did make my curls soft, but nothing special. Great size for the money.</li>
            <li> Smells incredible and defines the curls in my sons hair while also keeps my frizzy wavy hair looking more well kept!!</li>
            <li> I have coarse, curly, frizzy hair and this product works great for controlling it.  I use it after I condition my hair while it&#x27;s still wet.  In the past I had to use a leave-in conditioner then gel but now I only use the curl control cream and it defines my curls and leaves it soft and smelling great.</li>
            <li> This curl defining cream is my favorite curl cream product- the smell is really lovely and the texture just seems to work with my hair. It&#x27;s lightweight but mighty in it&#x27;s de-frizzing and curling capabilities.</li>
            <li> Great product. Will buy more..just a little pricey!</li>
            <li> Great for curly hair leaves hair soft and smells great</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair. So to give my hair a break from the flat irons, curling irons, and other hair tools, I decided to let my hair air dry. I used this product with a diffuser and without, and both times I had excellent results! It&#x27;s not sticky, or stinky, or overly fragranced. It held my natural waves in place and added some shine to my normally dull hair. Wonderful product by Moroccan Oil!</li>
            <li> Great product. Apply to towel dry hair to give you a nice wavy beach look without the frizzy hair.  Works well and smells good too.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy don&#x27;t buy, and don&#x27;t buy!!! It&#x27;s a fake product!!!</li>
            <li> I have mostly wavy hair and have tried for years to find something that enhanced my curls and controlled frizz. What I love about this product is it enhances curls without adding any of that dreaded crunch. I put it on after the shower and sleep on it to give me more curls, then re-wet my hair in the morning and add a little more.  Voila, beautiful curls. This also doesn&#x27;t add much volume, which is great for those of us who have enough volume.</li>
            <li> Want to feel (and look) like you just came from the salon?  Buy this stuff!  I did just get a keratin treatment so hard to tell how it would actually work without that, but so far, like it and as mentioned the smell reminds me of being at my salon!</li>
            <li> I came across this product in a yard sale!  I have curly hair that can get frizzy fast depending on humidity.  I have used it ever since I tried it the first time.  It tames the frizz AND it smells great.  If you have dry, wavy or curly hair, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and I swear by morrocanoil products. I have wavy/curly hair and my type of hair gets very very very dry, I used mouse before and that made my dryness even worse, with this product my hais has changed so much. I use it with the curl hydrating cream and I love them both!</li>
            <li> At my sisters suggestion, we both have natural curly hair, I decided to try the Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream.  Love it.  Wash my hair, finger in the cream and off I go.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite product for her curly hair... As she says, it&#x27;s the only thing that tames it</li>
            <li> You have to use it sparingly, and I have VERY thick hair, otherwise my hair becomes stiff with product.&lt;br /&gt;It  smells is nice, but I may revert back to Kerastis, or 10 product for similar, yet softer results.&lt;br /&gt;The shipper was very reliable.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing for naturally curly hair.  It not only defines the curls, it gives them a soft, natural look that is silky and calm, NOT frizzy!  AND it smells absolutely beautiful!  I get compliments on the smell of my hair ever since I started using it. I Love this product and intend to purchase it over and over from AMAZON! â™¥</li>
            <li> This product works well. I do have to mix it with a hair serum to avoid the crunchy texture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Moroccanoil products before and have been very pleased.  My hairdresser suggested this product,so I bought it.  The product is in a new dispenser, which is opaque, so I can&#x27;t see how much is there, and the dispensing unit is not compatible with other pump-type ones, so hope it doesn&#x27;t break.  The major disappointment with me, is the perfume they add into the product.  It is way too strong and chemical smelling for me to want to wear or submit those around me to.  The actual product works fairly well, but I like the old curl cream better.</li>
            <li> This product works very well for curly hair.  You put it on wet &amp; it keeps curls frizz free.  It also smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> This product helps bring wavy curls out but does not make hair look stiff like a gel product would. The scent is great.</li>
            <li> Luv the smell and it makes my course hair very soft to the touch</li>
            <li> The smell is a little overwhelming. The label says use a &amp;#34;liberal&amp;#34; amount, what does that even mean? Liberal is sure to mean different things to different people. So far has made my hair heavy and doesn&#x27;t keep all the frizzies away. Back to the search for the perfect product for my curls :(</li>
            <li> My hairstylist recommended this and I couldnt wait to get it in. While it does style the hair well it starts to itch at the end of the day and you cannot leave it in overnight or it will itch your scalp bad</li>
            <li> I love this curl cream, my hair is super stubborn, but this stuff works like magic! You only have to use just a little each time, so it lasts for a really long time!</li>
            <li> Great purchase, leaves hair nice and curly!</li>
            <li> Very bad product, it is the worst thing i ever used. Plus very bad customer service because i contacted them to return it, they refused  with no refund so basically i wasted my money on bull s*** product</li>
            <li> I have fine curly hair. This gives my hair body thickness and a perfect style with no effort on my part. This is fully worth the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from my hair dresser thinking this will solve my frizzy curls. But it seemed to weigh them down and not take away the frizz. I have long medium-thick hair and maybe this product is better for people with thinner hair? But what I have found that it&#x27;s really all about the serum you use before a curl cream, the serum is what controls the frizz. But I do LOVE there hair spray and serum. I will always purchase those..but I will need to keep looking for a curling cream.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for my hair.  It helps to hold my curls in place but it is not too heavy.  I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it. I&#x27;ve searched year after year after frizzy year until I landed on this line or products. Even if I&#x27;m stuck somewhere using crummy shampoo or conditioner, I can save the day by gobbing on the curl defining cream. Here&#x27;s my trick:&lt;br /&gt;Enough cream to cover all strands. Comb it through. Don&#x27;t skimp. Invert your head and comb through this way too. Cover you head lightly with an old cotton tshirts. Use the arms to tie it on do-rag style. :-) Make sure the top isn&#x27;t tight and flat. Keep it loose and airy. Leave on 10-20 minutes. Slide the tshirt off gently. Invert head and shake once. Let dry. No touching anything!! You&#x27;ll love the results. Curly, soft, great smelling. You&#x27;re welcome!</li>
            <li> Best thing for curly frizz pone hair! I live in Florida o humidity and curly hair are always an issue!  This is the best product I have ever used!  Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> This product was used on me and recommended by my new hair stylist who loves the Moroccan Oil line of products.   I have fine, curly hair and I get frizz like NO tomorrow in any climate.    She recommended I use this in this regimen: 1) wash and condition hair, 2) while hair is still relatively wet, comb it the way I want it took post blow-drying (meaning, part it where I want it and layer it how I want it to fall) with a wide tooth comb, 3) take just a blot (very little truly!) of this Moroccan Oil Curl Cream and starting from the back (since your hands have the most product, there is the most hair in the back) scrunch hair toward top of head. Don&#x27;t try to put your hands on the very top of your head because it will make your scalp greasy (at least in my case!), 4) blow dry with diffuser on a medium heat setting with minimal blowing power (higher heat settings and heavy blowing really create a ton of frizz), 5) leave a little bit of the hair slightly wet (meaning, don&#x27;t blow dry it until the hair is crispy dry) and let it air dry a little bit. Air drying doesn&#x27;t cause frizz unlike some interesting magazine articles I&#x27;ve read.     This way, my hair seriously looks and feels awesome. I think it&#x27;s not only the product, but HOW you use it.    Otherwise, in itself, this curl cream is very light, smells nice and just a little bit goes a long way. It&#x27;s my new way of doing my hair!</li>
            <li> This product is far superior to any styling product.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps your hair frizz free and soft.&lt;br /&gt;With naturally curly , it is a must have for daily hair routine.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair...so it accentuates the curl without feeling crunchy or frizzy.  I use a little balm or putty to really fluff afterwards!</li>
            <li> Really great product and it arrived the next day after I placed the order. I have really curly hair, so this product is much lighter in feel and less sticky than the gel products I used to use to combat frizz.</li>
            <li> I use about 2-3 pumps o fthis on my wet hair and gently scrunch.  It really works well with my fine curly hair!  Just make sure not to put too much around your scalp...as it made my hair look oily.  I only made this mistake the first time I used it though, and ever since it has been great!  Smells amazing just like the rest of the line!</li>
            <li> This was first used on my hair by a hairdresser in Ireland and I don&#x27;t want to use anything else.  It allows me to wash my hair and then put this in and style it with a brush (no dryer) and let it dry.  It holds well and can keep the wetter look or become fluffier if you use a brush after it dries.</li>
            <li> This was a gift to our daughter and when she uses it...vavoom!  Super curly.  Works just great. She loves it.</li>
            <li> I really like this--and my husband does too. It makes my curly hair soft and manageable. I can tell that the effect of the product is progressive. I can tell when I do not use it. My hair is curly/wavy, and my husband&#x27;s hair is soft curls. Our hairdresser used this, and we fell in love with it, both its smell and how well it works.</li>
            <li> great product! very fast shipping! I also received a vet lovely hair bag, thank you!</li>
            <li> I love this curl cream, it works really well for people like me with wavy hair that needs better definition. It also smells great!</li>
            <li> Defines curls without looking &#x27;crunchy&#x27;. Plus, it smells phenomenal.</li>
            <li> geat for very thick curly hair ! my go to product all the time.&lt;br /&gt;and it smells great. not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Love what it does for my curls!</li>
            <li> Too greasy for my hair. My hair was not as curly as I expected. Will try with lesser amount.</li>
            <li> Really like this product.  I have extremely curly hair and this stuff works great with it. Try it you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> I received my items in a timely manner and I&#x27;m satisfied with the product itself.</li>
            <li> I think it made my hair really soft but the smell is very strong!!!! It smells like argan oil + aftershave x10000. Lol but the next day I guess the smell absorbed into my hair because it wasn&#x27;t as stronge.</li>
            <li> This is the curl-defining stuff I have been looking for all my life. A tiny amount in damp hair releases my curls and keeps them frizz-free all day. A miracle. So grateful a curly co-worker told me about it. One bottle lasts for months. I just wish they had a travel size!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 7/14/2015: I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a year now. My dry, fine, frizzy hair is looking amazing - shiny, curly, no frizz. I will never run out of this stuff. It&#x27;s a miracle.</li>
            <li> Best product on the market for curly hair!</li>
            <li> I love this this product. I combine it with leave in conditioner and a tiny bit of gel and my hair looks and smells awesome. I was purchasing it at the beauty supply for a lot more money.  The shipping was fast. I&#x27;m totally pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Very good product it does the Job. I Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, but it does not really have the curl effect on my natural wavy/curly hair. :(</li>
            <li> I love this hair cream.  I have extremely curly hair and this relaxes it so that it&#x27;s not as tight curls.  Living in Texas, humidity is an ongoing battle and this keeps it in tact without the frizz.  Not too mention the smell is delicious.  It&#x27;s not the same as what my hair dresser uses, however, it is equally as good and a lot less expensive.</li>
            <li> Great feel. Works well.</li>
            <li> Great product, a little goes a long way. Product and shipping as expected from seller.</li>
            <li> I rarely bother posting reviews on Amazon (although I read them religiously!) but I felt compelled to write on this one because I SO hated this product!!! It makes my hair feel SO greasy and heavy. WAY heavier than if I use mousse or gel or other curling creams. Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for taking a temporary break from TIGI&#x27;s curls rock which I really like, and it works OK as far as shaping the curls goes. The smell is however unnecessarily strong and disagreeable sweet, and now that I became pregnant I really can&#x27;t stand it, will have to get rid of this product.</li>
            <li> Reduces the frizz &amp; defines the curls into soft tendrils.</li>
            <li> Makes hair look greasy, even in very small portions.  Spend more and get the Kevin Murphy product...it&#x27;s awesome and nongreasy, though pricey</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I have shoulder length, wavy/curly, color treated hair. This doesn&#x27;t build up, is a great weight for me (on the heavier side) and smells fantastic. I tried the next lighter version of their curling products and it didn&#x27;t work for me, so this is the winner!</li>
            <li> did the smell the same</li>
            <li> Use this after washing and finger curl my hair. It tames the frizz and keeps hair soft. Does not eliminate the frizz but it helps.</li>
            <li> This product defines the natural curl in my hair and reduces frizz! No need to style whatsoever.  It is perfect for thick, wavy, curly hair-- that is unruly and coarse! I love it!</li>
            <li> This product has a strong scent that everyone can smell around me. It is not strong to me though, just enough. Everyone thinks it&#x27;s a perfume and everyone likes it. I love the product for the scent but also because my hair feels and looks healthier and bouncy. My curls are big and this defines them pretty well. Love this product!</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff for years and it never fails me</li>
            <li> Curly hair is as unique as one&#x27;s fingerprint...everyone&#x27;s is slightly different.  Before buying this, make sure you know what type of curly hair you have.  I have a thinner hair strand, with loose curls that are disturbed easily.  A very small amount of this product keeps the frizz away and helps the curls keep their shape.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, this works really good for my grandsons hair, makes the curls look really good and not frizzy or staticity.  Love this product the best around for curly hair.</li>
            <li> A friend recommened this product and I love it, holds the curl nicely and helps keep the frizz away all day.</li>
            <li> I have fine color treated hair that curls easily. I was looking for a cream that would just help it along while also keeping it frizz free. This cream only does that if you apply heat to your hair, which I rarely do to prevent damage to my hair. Otherwise it just kind of smooths your hair which is still nice but not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect conditioning, curl enhancing product on the market.  I am never without it now and will never give it up!!  I am addicted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, unruly blonde hair that was never anything but frizzy.  It would take me an hour to straighten everyday.  When my salon started carrying this product, I tried it, and voila!  Gorgeous, soft curls.  No more maintenance or standing in front of the mirror for so long!  Wash and go.  Worth every penny.  (And this size bottle does last quite awhile.)</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel greasy! Too heavy for fine hair.</li>
            <li> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;d9lYRwqOGEI</li>
            <li> Works great for my curls but a little on the thicket side. Love the smell and need very little for great curl definition.</li>
            <li> It definitely helps define the curls and not look like a mop! Great product.</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter with curly hair. Keeps the curls in and throughout the day. Tames the frizz also. Well worth the money for a great product.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product for my curls. I hate the price, but once you&#x27;ve found a product that works, you have to stick with it. Honestly, I can use this cream and a bit of oil and my curls are frizz free and bouncy! No more sticky, crunchy curls or unmanageable frizz.</li>
            <li> I purchased this at the salon because the product that I usually use was not in stock.  I was told that I would find this product much easier to use with better results (advised not to use too much because it tends to be oily/weight hair down).  Normally I use leave in conditioner and then light/wavy gel.  I was told I would just need this one product. I have curly hair/ringlets, but not thick/dry hair. I did my normal routine of shampooing and conditioning and towel drying my hair.  I then put in the product as directed.  While my hair was wet, it looked OK.  I am now at work and just looked in the mirror.  My hair is 2 sizes larger than it usually is and there are no curls to be seen.  I will be returning this - not work $32 for sure.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my daughters. They are bi-racial (Black &amp; White) so they have a mix between silky and ethnic hair. Their hair is long and curly and this product is the only product we have found that defines and tames their curls, while leaving it flowy. It is highly concentrated so they only have to use maybe the size of a quarter for hair that reaches mid-way down their backs. It keeps their hair perfect all day even on days with high humidity or rain. It is well worth the cost!</li>
            <li> Works great, smells great!</li>
            <li> I love this product. However, be wary of buying it from unauthorized dealers online -- mine was either watered down or expired. Somehow, it just didn&#x27;t work like the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; thing from my salon.</li>
            <li> I didnt like it. It does not smooth hair at all.</li>
            <li> I already have wavy/curly hair and since I used the Moroccanoil products I decided to try this curl defining cream.  It was too heavy for my hair so I changed products.</li>
            <li> I like this cream. It&#x27;s light and does a nice job of defining curls. I just seem to need to use it in conjunction with a gel product.</li>
            <li> Love this product, arrived on time which is always a plus when going on vacation. Will always order this product!</li>
            <li> As another reviewer noted the product does not appear as in the photograph or like previous bottles I have purchased from my hair stylist. Unfortunately I did not read the review before I purchased the item.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! My hair has gotten stronger and stays so hydrated. It&#x27;s even great to use when I blow out my hair and it smells so good!</li>
            <li> I have now bought this twice. I like it a lot. Helps with curling but i still have to use gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got 2A/2B curly hair, and Moroccan Oil Curl Defining Cream works pretty well for me. It&#x27;s a pretty heavy cream that gives good definition and prevents a lot of frizz, but doesn&#x27;t leave the crispy crunchy feeling that other heavier curl creams do. Unfortunately, the price is a little steep given that I usually use 3-5 pumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m torn on the pump mechanism: On the one hand, it seems to do a pretty good job getting a lot of the product out of the container. But on the other hand, because of how the pump and the bottle are constructed, it&#x27;s a pain to scrape the last bits of product out before you recycle the bottle. Moreover, out of the 3 or 4 bottles I&#x27;ve purchased, the pumps have broken on two, so the dispenser leaves something to be desired.</li>
            <li> perfect curl without any of the crunch that you get from most of the other curling products you see - smells amazing too!</li>
            <li> Received it fast. Great product at a lower cost. Would buy again. More expensive at salons. Great to keep your curls looking nice.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely thick and wavy and this product does the trick..it keeps it defined but soft and not crunchy! It&#x27;s like a lotion consistency and melts into your hair...the other perfect benefit of this product is it smells amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this cream. It helps keep your hair in a nice curl or wave and helps with frizziness. I have thick corse hair with waves and curls and it works well on my hair. Fast shipping also.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. Best one I could find for my curls. I also love the Moroccanoil dehydrating mask .</li>
            <li> Great product. Pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t look like new, it&#x27;s scratched on blue label and the really bad thing is expiration date is April 2013....</li>
            <li> I have curly 3b/c hair type and this product has an amazing effect on my hair. Bouncy, hydrated and defined curls. It worths the price. Love this product!!!</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;ve tried every curl cream on the market. Moroccan Oil is by far my favorite. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy and it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> More expensive than other products in stores, but definitely worth it!! This is a great styling product for curly and wavy hair. And it smells AMAZINGGG!!</li>
            <li> The MoroccanOil Curl Defining Cream has been the closest &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; hair product I have found so far. I am Caucasian and have long brown hair that is thick, frizzy, curly, and puffy. I tend to look for products that are hydrating and help with frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use it: After showering, I carefully dry my hair by scrunching it with a towel. My hair will be damp/wet but not dripping. I rub 2-3 pumps (I have long hair past my shoulders) between my palms and scrunch the product into my hair from halfway down to the ends. Second, I apply a small amount near the roots and top half of my head but not too much. Putting too much near the roots can cause your hair to get greasy more quickly. I don&#x27;t recommend that people with naturally hydrated hair apply it at the roots. I usually flip my head upside down and blow-dry with a diffuser for a few minutes to help my hair dry faster. It&#x27;s usually still damp here and there but since my hair is so dry I prefer to let it finish drying naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product makes my hair smell AMAZING as if I just came back from the hair dresser. It smooths a lot of my frizz, turns many of my lose curls into spirals and helps them stick together! The only thing that is missing for me is slightly more hydration and frizz control. My hair is very unruly so the fact that it makes such a huge dent is good enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently tried the Styling Cream by Deva Curl and it doesn&#x27;t even compare. It does nothing for my poof or frizz and doesn&#x27;t seem to enhance my curls at all. I&#x27;m switching back to Moroccanoil as soon as I finish the tube!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 2 years now. I think it is a good fit for curly, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> My husband has naturally wavy/ curly hair. He found this product in a salon in Kansas City on vacation a year ago. When he ran out he kept griping about his hair. I looked it up and found it on Amazon! He swears by this product for managing his hair. I swear by this product because it smells SO GOOD! My hair is straight so I don&#x27;t use it but he says it&#x27;s the best product he&#x27;s ever used.</li>
            <li> If you are a migraine sufferer, this product is NOT for you. I have long, curly/wavy hair that seems to have a mind of its own, and came across this product (Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream) after doing extensive research online. Upon its arrival, I opened the box and popped off the cap -- and the smell hit me immediately. I brushed this aside, and went ahead and squeezed some of the product into my palm -- and of course, the smell became more intense. Within a few minutes, I could tell I was either going to have a headache or a full-blown migraine all day. Smells are one of my triggers, and if you also suffer from any sort of head pain/migraines/odor allergies, I strongly encourage you NOT to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! A little cheaper here than in the salon.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, well worth the money.  I like alternating this product with the Morracanoil Curl Cream.  They are very similar but this one is slightly lighter.  Great buy.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little...hmmm...greasy feeling the second day.  I don&#x27;t rewet my hair to reactivate it, so maybe that would make a difference.  The mousse version does better with my hair.  But mileage varies.</li>
            <li> Helps curly gray hair behave - pretty much</li>
            <li> Love it. First curl creme that works in my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> This product works very well on both curly and straight hair, but the best feature is its scent... It has a nice light musky/lovely fragrant yumminess that will last in your hair for a couple of days before needing to re-shower or reapply the product! Also, it leaves your hair extremely soft and controllable... I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Really good. I love this product</li>
            <li> This product controls frizz and helps define curls. Additionally, it makes your hair feel soft and smells AMAZING! A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she is very happy with it. She has been back to get more multiple times. It is a little pricy though.</li>
            <li> So far, all the Morrocan Oil stuff I&#x27;ve used has been the best. Just a tiny dab of this, cocktailed with the Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment, will make your hair feel great and shine like the north star! I won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> All of the Moroccan oil products are great. I have fine, wavy hair, but a lot of it. This cream is nice, but a little heavy for my hair.My hair tends to go flat too quickly.</li>
            <li> It seems like the ingredients changed because it doesn&#x27;t seem to work on my hair the same and I loved this stuff the last time I ordered it</li>
            <li> This cream was recommended by my hair stylist. I have wavy, thick hair. This is the only product I have found that doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair or leave it frizzy. You only need a small amount so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair heavy. I wash my hair every 2 days but the second day it feels gross. Don&#x27;t think it enhances the curl too much either</li>
            <li> This seller is unbelievable. Though I didn&#x27;t tell them to buy the same 3 bottle is only for one person to use, one bottle for one person to use in 3 months is still too much mostly. They just sent 3 bottles the expiration date are all in 3 months. I am in Taiwan and I wasted triple times products fee the shipping fee to get them and to return. They refused to pay any of these shipping fee. I am in the process of A-to-Z guarantee complain and it seems very hard to get the money back. Even the Amazon can&#x27;t have good tool to deal with this seller. Very bad attitude and they even refused to refund the first time. If they pay the international shipping fee, I am willing to change the review stars.</li>
            <li> I took a chance on this product recently because the reviews were so positive.  I was using Aveda&#x27;s curl spray that I liked a lot but while it added volume and curl, I didn&#x27;t like the the feel.  That&#x27;s what I really like about the Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream.  It really brought out the natural curl, added some volume, but didn&#x27;t get hard or sticky or dry feeling.  The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because the fragrance, while pleasant, is really over powering to me.  Other reviewers kept saying they loved the fragrance but the main drawback (not a deal breaker yet) for me is that this fragrance is not subtle and even when it dried, I could smell my hair throughout the day.  The product is really a good one with regards to effect.</li>
            <li> Love this curl cream! I have very fine short hair. I do have some natural curl and this cream doesn&#x27;t way down my hair and it gives it the curl boost I need! Also, being I color my hair, the Moroccanoil hydrates my ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister on the other hand has CURLY hair and it keeps her curls defined. Neither one of us can live without this product.</li>
            <li> love the scent and the softness of my hair</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t use anything else on my hair!  Makes my hair Keep it&#x27;s natural curl without the frizz .</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. My curls are gorgeous now</li>
            <li> didnt work that well on my hair.</li>
            <li> This product is not too heavy for people with lighter wavy curls. It helps to control frizz and gives definition.</li>
            <li> I must say I have waited 35 years for this product to come out! I have thick, culy, long hair. My hair has had a mind of it&#x27;s own for most of my life, it never seems to do what I want it to do. Until this product came along I was lucky to have one good hair day a month. Now I seem to have them all of the time. I use an average of at least 4 to 5 pumps on my hair. This leaves my hair looking and smelling great. As far as products go believe me when I say I have tried them all. There is a perpetual wasteland of barely used products in my cabinet as I write this. Moroccanoil has made me a believer and a long term customer. I will continue to buy this product as long as they continue to produce it. The product is pricey but a bottle this size has lasted me around 5 - 6 months so far. I feel the benefits outweigh the negatives. Happy shopping! This product has my vote!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It smells good and keeps my curls in place, even when there is a lot of humidity.</li>
            <li> I use this each morning and it helps manage my hair.  At first I didn&#x27;t know if this was a woman&#x27;s product or universal but speaking from a man&#x27;s perspective this works great.  I use this each morning after towel drying my hair and before using product.  This is great for curly hair.  At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about the scent... and I guess I&#x27;m still not - I&#x27;m not crazy about it but don&#x27;t mind it either.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Good value.</li>
            <li> Can be too heavy on hair. Smells great.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> So good perfect seller thank you</li>
            <li> Smoother curls, happier me!  I use this as my leave in.  Not crazy about their shampoo, but this is an amazing product!</li>
            <li> I really love the smell of this product and how light-weight it is. It does do a nice job shaping my curls without having that crispy/crunchy effect that gel has. I have very curly hair and find this product helps with shine and softness.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Smells delightful!</li>
            <li> This version of their many curl creams works best in higher humidity with fine curly hair. In the winter, the product does hold some curl, but doesn&#x27;t plump up fine hair as well. Works better in winter with diffuser, but in summer months best with air drying.</li>
            <li> my hairdresser recommended this product. i love it. my naturally curly  hair feels good and looks great. i will recommend it to everybody.</li>
            <li> This hair product is awesome for curly and wavy hair. It doe not stick hair together or make it greasy. After using this cream my hair is bouncy, it smells beautifully and curls look amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I love love love this product.  I originally purchased it for my wavy hair but I find that it also works great for straight styles I blow dry.  My husband loves the fragrance too.</li>
            <li> This product is OK...&lt;br /&gt;It sort of does what it says it will, but only half as well as many other products that typically cost a quarter of the price. It also gives off a hugely potent chemical vapor that may irritate your eyes! I am not, &amp; never have been, allergic to anything, but I stopped using this because the vapors it gave off would constantly irritate my eyes,mac using constant redness &amp; itching.</li>
            <li> This is worth the money for me. I have curly hair and have long embraced it. I am a devoted fan of the Deva Curl products, as well as the Shea Butter. This however, is one of my favorites because it seems to soothe my scalp as well as my hair, and by first use you can tell its a good quality product. It lasts a couple months and like I said, worth the splurge.</li>
            <li> I have used curl enhancing products by Rusk, Label M, many drugstore brands and this one wins, hands down. It isn&#x27;t too heavy or greasy, too thick or crunchy. It leaves my hair just right to wear natural air dried or blown out. I have almost medium length, wavy-to-curly hair and it behaves very well with this product. Definitely will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love it! It kills the frizz and makes my hair look wonderful. I highly recommend it for anyone with curly hair</li>
            <li> I have curly hair (  botticelli curls vs. corkscrew) and this stuff adds much needed oil to the natural dryness of curly hair without weighing it down or making it look like an oil slick. It is magic when it comes to reducing, if not eliminating frizz.  A major, major bonus. Shiny hair, with well defined curls. I use the pure Moroccan Oil in the Winter as well and love it.  To ensure my hair does not get too used a certain product,  I alternate between the curl defining cream and Aveda Phomollient with a dab of Aveda Confixor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting curls right is like finding a good recipe and sticking with it.  Curl defining cream is a keeper in my &#x27;managing the insanity of curly hair&#x27; toolkit.</li>
            <li> Best way to control my curls without lots of product on my hair. Can&#x27;t even tell it is in my hair but it does the job. Gives me nice curls without the frizz.</li>
            <li> I thought this product would be more of a curl and define product,. Its exactly the same as their other curl cream. Its good for conditioning and hydrating, but not for hold.....</li>
            <li> I have never had curly hair and used to try to blow out straight the little wave I did have.  Now I put this cream in my shampooed hair, blow dry it just a little while scrunching and then let it air dry.  The most beautiful curls develope and last until washing.  It can even be applied to dry hair to refreshen curls.  Fantastic stuff.  You don&#x27;t even know it&#x27;s in your hair once it drys.  I looked it up on youtube before ordering and saw a video showing how to use it.  I was sold.  It works just like they showed.  A must try!</li>
            <li> before this I had a bottle of the Moroccanoil intense hydrating cream witch weighed my hair down, I have naturally curly hair but its so soft that I can straighten it by just wrapping it in a bun, so intense cream would be great if you have very tight course curls. But this one is for me!!! This great for soft curls to wavy hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I color my hair and I live in a place where there is high humidity so this product is a must for me.  I have tried so many different products and none have worked as well as Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream.  It helps me keep the curl without the frizz and the best part of all it smells soooooo good!  I would definately recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My granddaughters are mixed race and have very curly hair. This product tames the curls and allows it to be styled easily and it smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> Leaves curls flexible but holds well. Just what I was looking for. It smells soooo good! The smell is really strong though so if you are sensitive to smells that is one thing to consider.</li>
            <li> Just a little amount is needed.  Product is well worth the price. non greasy formula.  Would recommend to any one with culy hair.</li>
            <li> My sis recommended this product for my 3 year old&#x27;s curly hair.  She said it lasted her a year so I was OK with price. Smells sooo good and leaves her hair silky soft.</li>
            <li> Works very well, great for curly hair, minimizes frizz, and maintains curl definition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes hair soft and dries it quicker as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite product, I have long thick hair and this bottle lasts me several months.</li>
            <li> Only thing I&#x27;ve found to tame my mane without making it frizzy or crunchy. Great product!</li>
            <li> CAN NOT LIVE WITH OUT THIS STUFF!! &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Thank you it&#x27;s amazing item</li>
            <li> love this stuff!  easy to use, works great and makes curly hair look terrific, not dried out and frizzy...and lasts for a few days.  great stuff</li>
            <li> i purchased this product through a local salon and i absolutly love it. I am biracial(white&amp;black) and have dry medium textured curly hair, so when it comes to my locks I need somethng that is oil based. After searching for a really long time, I found this and its perfect. Not too oily, like pink oil, but just right.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE this product.  Would definitely buy more of this again.  Helps to buy in bulk to save on shipping costs.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe that for the LONGEST time I had refused to try this item because of the price! and within that timeline I have gone through SEVERAL products like: Redken, Paul Mitchell, Quidad, Carol&#x27;s Daughter and all the products either made my hair flake, made my hair too crunchy, or weighed down my curls! However the THIS line, along with the intense curl cream, and hydrating cream made my curls light, the smell is AMAZING!, and it actually conditioned my curls, without weighing them down, no flakes, no hard crunchy feeling! I am black and filipino, so my hair type ranges from curls to TIGHT curls (and I have coarse/thick hair)! This is soooo awesome and the price is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo worth it!</li>
            <li> Best product I have ever used for curly hair! I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has curly hair.</li>
            <li> Works great on my sister&#x27;s hair.  It is too heavy for mine.  Smells great.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Feels great! Smells great! Tames the frizz and makes my curls soft and manageable</li>
            <li> Great product! Holds curl with softness.</li>
            <li> Best curl defining cream I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li> Smells great and applies easy.  The best part is you only need very little of the cream.  It makes your hair shine and smells so good.  It also helps define your curls.  Excellent product, I love it.</li>
            <li> great stuff.  finally found a product both I and my hair like.  very manageable  I have been looking for this for the past 30 years.</li>
            <li> I have mid-length very curly hair.  The cream does help with dryness, but I would not use it alone.  I still need gel to hold my curls in place.  Not so sure I like the scent.</li>
            <li> my hairdresser turned me on to this stuff, at a whole lot more $$ - great to find it on amazon. quick delivery, much better price, great product. cuts down the need for a curl lotion and moroccan oil as separate items. when it is really damp out i do add a little oil to this product, but i only need a bit and this product lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I never feel like my hair is sticky and tames the frizz.</li>
            <li> Love it, would buy again, it was much cheaper than the salon!</li>
            <li> why there is no straw in the bottle???  it is very inconvenient to use it. I cannot pump out the cream, and  felt very disappointed about the purchase.</li>
            <li> my favorite product for my naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve had one bottle for 2 years. Just got my second. Only need a pea size squirt for the whole head. Definitely get this!!!!!</li>
            <li> This works well in my daughters curly hair.  Helps with tangled hair and the smell is great.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> Really did not like this product. Left hair feeling very heavy and dirty.</li>
            <li> EDIT: I purchased this for the second time because I was so happy with my first purchase. However this time was a disaster. This arrived with the bottle all scratched up and cheap looking, with the nozzle completely dysfunctional. It didn&#x27;t pump any product out. Luckily I still had the nozzle from my first bottle so I was able to replace it and it worked okay. A couple of weeks later, I pick up the bottle and product just starts falling out of the bottom. I don&#x27;t know what happened or how, but the bottom of the bottle COMPLETELY disintegrated. So now it is completely open and exposed and I&#x27;m probably going to have to toss the whole thing. I don&#x27;t know what happened but this bottle was so completely different and worse compared to the first one I received.  I decided to splurge on this because for some reason my hair has lost some of its natural curl over the past few years and I&#x27;ve been trying different products to try and find something that will do a good job of enhancing the curls I still have. I won&#x27;t say this made my hair MORE curly, but it really does a great job at keeping my curls intact and smooth. I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s worth the price to keep buying, but we&#x27;ll see how long it lasts me -- I&#x27;m thinking quite a while since it&#x27;s a pretty big bottle and I only use a couple pumps each time I use it. Oh, it also smells AMAZING so there&#x27;s that. I really do like this product and it actually makes my hair feel thicker and softer when I use it. Definitely would recommend if you&#x27;re willing to splurge.</li>
            <li> I should have read the ingredient list before buying.  The second is alcohol, the fifth is hydrolyzed vegetable protein.  I fought with it for a week.  The first day my hair was so dried out it felt like straw.  I had recently bought some oil in the black hair section so the next day I used that before this product and that helped with the dryness but the consistency-which is like crisco- was so heavy my hair was more bent than curled.  I was hoping for a one step solution to replace my having to mix zero-frizz and freida&#x27;s straightening cream every morning but after a week it was apparent that I had wasted 31 bucks and would be going back to the old routine.</li>
            <li> This curl cream is amazing! I finally feel like I can tame this hair of mine!</li>
            <li> works great on kinky curly hair</li>
            <li> Too oily (LEAVES A STICKY FEELING) for fine hair.  If you have baby fine hair try another product.</li>
            <li> Does not pump as there was no tube included in bottle</li>
            <li> I always thought Morrocan Oil was overhyped and expensive, but now I think this is the miracle hair product I have been waiting for all my life.  I have thick frizz-prone naturally curly hair, that quite frankly I&#x27;ve never figured out how to handle. All my curly-haired friends apply gel and let their hair air dry, and that never worked for me despite trying a myriad of curl gels and creams--I always ended up with a stiff frizzy mess.  Then a new stylist applied the regular Moroccan Oil to my curls after a cut and sent me on my way with my hair still wet.  I expected to be a poofy mess by the time I got home in the humid DC summer, but lo and behold my hair dried into reasonably shiny soft ringlets with just a hint of frizz.  I decided to order some right away, and chose the curl cream rather than the regular oil.  I do think the curl cream provides a little more frizz control than the regular oil and it has decent hold but doesn&#x27;t result in stiff hair at all.  I have shoulder length hair and use about two dime sized pumps for my whole head (is that like a nickel?).  All I do is untangle my hair with my fingers and twist my hair back into ringlets, apply the cream and go.  I get tons of compliments on my hair, which I&#x27;ve been wearing in a ponytail for years due to styling ineptitude, now.  This product may seem less miraculous to people who actually know what they are doing with their hair, but it&#x27;s changed my life.</li>
            <li> Clear, defined curls with a non-greasy application. Not to mention the smell is addictive and leaves hair super soft!</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes my hair so soft!</li>
            <li> Staple product in my curly hair routine.  For those of you who love the original Moroccanoil scent, you will adore this product!  With my coarse texture and tightly coiled curls, this cream allows me to maintain third and even fourth day hair.  [All you curly beauties will know exactly what I mean.] Gives definition without that hard crunchy after feel.  For a get up and go style in the morning, I spruce up curls with a spritz of water and scrunch in some curl defining cream. I always carry the travel sized cream in my purse.</li>
            <li> Came just as delivered. Love this cream!</li>
            <li> I have long thick curls and if I don&#x27;t put some sort of product in my hair Ihave long thick friz.  This is my favorite by far.  Most products make may hair feel stiff or crunchy, this cream leaves it feeling like curly hair should fee.</li>
            <li> I received an open one, was not sealed , and even without a cap! I was not sure even it was refill or the original! I returned it instantly.</li>
            <li> Much better holding, soft curls, than Arrojo cream and lasts forever.  Though it feels oily going on it becomes more of a lotion.</li>
            <li> I HAVE VERY FINE  HAIR ,I TRIED THIS PRODUCT AND NOW MY HAIR LOOKS WAVY .i&#x27;M GLAD,MY HAIE LOOK BETTER.</li>
            <li> Favorite product! Love the Moroccanoil line.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for several years, adds body and extreme curling &amp; shine when hair dried and scrunched.</li>
            <li> Smell awesome. Good product. For curly hair only.</li>
            <li> Best stuff out there for defining curls.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic if you have naturally curly hair!  Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling weighed down and all the curls look great without that frizzy look!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Moroccanoil Curl Definining Cream upon recommendation by my hair dresser. She said this product was better for my hair than the mousse I had been using, and so being a professional, I listened/followed her advice. I did not purchase the product from her salon and instead found it cheaper on Amazon. I was excited when it finally arrived to see how it would work for my hair. I hate it. I tried it a second, and then third time, using differing amounts of the product to see if it would make a difference. No such luck. It leaves a really gross-feeling residue on my hair and does little to &amp;#34;define&amp;#34; my curls. Never buying this product again</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, wavy/curly/frizzy hair. Very unmanageable, lets put it that way.  I have tried everything under the sun in terms of shampoos, conditioners, creams, mouses, etc.  This stuff is absolutely AMAZING.  The most common word people use now to describe my curls-defined. It does exactly what it says it does, for my hair, at least.  I don&#x27;t even bother straightening my hair anymore. 9 times out of 10, I get out of the shower, smooth this over my hair, and go. I get compliments everywhere I go now, because it is so bouncy and free-moving and defined ringlets. I love it. Definitely worth the money if you&#x27;re someone like me who has struggled with unmanageable hair.</li>
            <li> Love it for my once straight hair that has suddenly become naturally curly...whatsup????</li>
            <li> Works great, I do have to use a lot since my hair is pretty long. If you rub between your hands and get it warm, it does apply easier.  Also, I love Moroccanoil products for their smell. One challenge is that it is difficult to see where you have already applied, I tend to miss a few spots.</li>
            <li> Love it.  It really does transform my hair from a lion&#x27;s mane to well defined curls.  It works so well that I can wake up the next morning, spritz it with water, scrunch and it looks great again.  I find it works particularly well with a diffuser.  If you&#x27;re comparing products, I&#x27;d recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I normally love Moroccan Oil products that I have purchased from a salon in the past, but what I received from Perfumes World appeared to be a counterfeit product.  Moroccan Oil is awesome, but don&#x27;t try to buy it from Perfumes World.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  So perfect for my wavy/curly hair which is fine and easily weighed down by product.  Only 1 pump for my long hair means this lasts a long time.  Given that this is pretty expensive it is great that it lasts me about 6 months or so.</li>
            <li> Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream does a great job controlling my curls and leaving my hair feeling soft. No more frizz for me!</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and the curls I get with this hair product are smooth and soft without the crunch.</li>
            <li> It is not good for curly hair at all. It is very greasy and your hair stay white after the first application.</li>
            <li> Great for my curly hair! Nice soft curls and waves without any stiffness.  Lovely aroma, too.  Pricey but worth it</li>
            <li> I love this curl cream. It is the only one I use when I want to &amp;#34;go natural&amp;#34; with my curly hair. It had a good scent as well</li>
            <li> Weighed my hair down, felt sticky and greasy. The odor was too strong.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair that falls about mid back when wet. I was using Silk Infusion by Chi, but with the summer heat and constant washing my hair was looking dull and my waves were flat. This is the best! I am so happy to have made the switch. It took me a few washes to figure out that my hair needs 3 pumps. It smells nice and does not leave my hair greasy. Instead it is shiny with great waves. I let my hair dry naturally, brush through with a big comb, and it is ready to go. I will buy this again (and again.. ..)</li>
            <li> Great for curly hair and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Great stuff I love it ... it works for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair &amp; have tried all types of products. This is now my one &amp; only product I use. It&#x27;s not greasy or sticky &amp; doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. And It smells wonderful!! Just wish they sold it in a bigger size! I go through a bottle every 6-8 weeks.</li>
            <li> Before buying I watched a lot of you tube videos and each person used this plus another product together (Made me feel leary buying it bc no one used this product alone and it&#x27;s expensive)... I recieved this in a few days from ordering, which was great. Used it last night for work and it held my curls nicely and I didn&#x27;t have to use another product with it. Will use more next time bc it didn&#x27;t hold my curls underneath at all. The smell is great. I got complimented on my hair smelling good the first time I used it. Every time I turned my head, I could smell it. Definitely scrunch your hair after you&#x27;ve applied it to your hair. I flip my head over and use a diffuser for more volume.</li>
            <li> Fabulous hair product for my son&#x27;s very curly hair.......thesoapmaker.net</li>
            <li> Love the scent! Manages my curls nicely- very soft, reduces frizz.</li>
            <li> Used this product before and was happy to find it non Amazon. Love this product, great for curly hair.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff. Great for curls and it smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my naturally curly hair! I have really thin  fine hair and not that much of it either so even though I thought this product was a bit pricey I decided to try it out and I&#x27;m really happy I did. This product has really brought my damaged curls back to life with just a littlr bit of this product on my strands. I don&#x27;t even have to use heat or a diffuser anymore to make the curls look nice. This product makes my hair look fuller and has a wonderful scent. I Iove how it doesn&#x27;t give it the hard crunchy look that I dread. I will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I have super curly hair. I love the way this keeps the curl from frizzing and the smell is divine as are all Moroccanoil products!</li>
            <li> I really like this product, I have curly hair and wear it short.  This smells great, and is thick but not heavy.  This and a little spray will keep my hair all day once it is dry.  Tends to be heavier to rinse out but overall pleased.</li>
            <li> I gave this 4 stars because it did help diminish frizz and encourage curl without being crunchy or stiff looking.  Maybe I haven&#x27;t figured out what the right amount is, but it tends to be a little sticky feeling, and doesn&#x27;t help with volume at all.</li>
            <li> I use this before I curl my hair and it works like a dream. I have long blond hair and this is like magic on it.</li>
            <li> The best product offered by Moroccanoil! Will buy again. It makes my curls bouncy and my curls will hold for most of the day.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and I thought the price was good for 8.5 ounces.  It really helps define the curls!</li>
