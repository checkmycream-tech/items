            <li>It is lightweight and great at transforming my coarse, curly hair into sleek, shiny, and straight hair in a short amount of time.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this dryer as it comes highly recommended by professional stylists.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve been able to cut out having to use a flat iron or curling iron when in a rush.</li>
            <li>After buying one as a gift for $125 at a local store, I was thrilled to find it on Amazon for $85 when my old one died after over 15 years.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, and dries my long thick hair very fast.</li>
            <li>Very long cord too and so light!</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s easy to put back on.</li>
            <li>I have had the dryer for a few weeks, and so far I am loving it!</li>
            <li>and I was able to dry all of my hair (without styling) in 60 seconds!</li>
            <li>Dries hair more quickly than any other dryer - by far!  </li>
            <li>very inexpensively.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it drys your hair fast &amp; is lightweight.  </li>
            <li>that the old one that I had!!!</li>
            <li>I originally started thinking about paying the big bucks for a pro dryer after reading an article on Jezebel.</li>
            <li>I used it twice, it dried my hair quickly and somewhat smooth using a ceramic ion brush.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>I realized a bit too late in my adult life that a good blow-dryer makes all the difference in the look and feel of your hair.</li>
            <li>I had this thing on my wish list for a few months, not quite sure I wanted to spend so much for hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>We had and older  one that lasted for almost 10 years.</li>
            <li>This one was on the list, and honestly, given the relatively lower price point versus the other professional dryers, I was willing to try it out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hairdresser recommended it highly.  </li>
            <li>say it&#x27;s worth the wait because you either have to save up enough money to purchase an item of this caliber and also because it is manufactured in Italy and takes about two weeks to arrive</li>
            <li>They last a long time and makes my job as a stylist satisfying.  </li>
            <li>Worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>Now she can dry her hair completely at night and wake up to smooth hair in the morning.</li>
            <li>This is definitely the right dryer.</li>
            <li>It took forever to come and then didn&#x27;t live up to expectation.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how fast it dried my hair and how  smooth and silky my hair felt.  </li>
            <li>She said the dryer is powerful enough but not hot enough to damage hair will leaving smooth hair and preventing split ends from fraying from the intense heat of a competitor.  </li>
            <li>It makes your hair soft and silky without drying or damaging it!</li>
            <li>it is my second twin turbo, the first lasted for years  </li>
            <li>I have paid 2-3 times more for hairdryers in the past only to have them lose the ability to stay hot.  </li>
            <li>I simply could not figure out why my hair was always kind of &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; and not quite fully dry when I got out of the shower and tried to dry my hair with my 5+ year old Conair that I bought at CVS</li>
            <li>Professional dryer</li>
            <li>I have dry, curly hair and this hair dryer is powerful enough to straighten my hair without burning it...</li>
            <li>I had ,my first twinturbo for about 10 years roughly</li>
            <li>Then I visited my mother who recently purchased a new drier, the rusk w8less.  </li>
            <li>It is powerful and dries my hair in much less time than others I have used.</li>
            <li>If you have a significant other with delicate hair this is definitely worth the price and wait.  </li>
            <li>If he loves the product in a high volume salon, then I look forward to owning mine for a long time to come.</li>
            <li>I would have never guessed that owning a professional hair dryer could make such a difference.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve dyed my hair for the last 15 years and style it frequently</li>
            <li>I have used it now about 3 times, and it is hard to believe what a significant difference I see in my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s works so much faster than any other dryer I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>Does not dry the hair any faster than the regular El Cheapo ones.</li>
            <li>but the cold air is amazing when you are done drying....</li>

            <li> Worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Now she can dry her hair completely at night and wake up to smooth hair in the morning.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the right dryer.</li>
            <li> It took forever to come and then didn&#x27;t live up to expectation.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how fast it dried my hair and how  smooth and silky my hair felt.  </li>
            <li> She said the dryer is powerful enough but not hot enough to damage hair will leaving smooth hair and preventing split ends from fraying from the intense heat of a competitor.  </li>
            <li> It makes your hair soft and silky without drying or damaging it!</li>
            <li> it is my second twin turbo, the first lasted for years  </li>
            <li> I have paid 2-3 times more for hairdryers in the past only to have them lose the ability to stay hot.  </li>
            <li> I simply could not figure out why my hair was always kind of &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; and not quite fully dry when I got out of the shower and tried to dry my hair with my 5+ year old Conair that I bought at CVS</li>
            <li> Professional dryer</li>
            <li> I have dry, curly hair and this hair dryer is powerful enough to straighten my hair without burning it...</li>
            <li> I had ,my first twinturbo for about 10 years roughly</li>
            <li> Then I visited my mother who recently purchased a new drier, the rusk w8less.  </li>
            <li> It is powerful and dries my hair in much less time than others I have used.</li>
            <li> If you have a significant other with delicate hair this is definitely worth the price and wait.  </li>
            <li> If he loves the product in a high volume salon, then I look forward to owning mine for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> I would have never guessed that owning a professional hair dryer could make such a difference.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve dyed my hair for the last 15 years and style it frequently</li>
            <li> I have used it now about 3 times, and it is hard to believe what a significant difference I see in my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works so much faster than any other dryer I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> Does not dry the hair any faster than the regular El Cheapo ones.</li>
            <li> but the cold air is amazing when you are done drying....</li>
            <li> It does dry my hair with less frizz, but it&#x27;s not very lightweight and it doesn&#x27;t ever feel very hot even at max heat.</li>
            <li> Once I used this hair dryer, I noticed how quickly, efficiently and with less noise dried my hair.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased with the results, after all this was a big step up from the half broken one I purchased from Sally&#x27;s years ago.  </li>
            <li> I love the power and all that jazz, but MAN the cord to this sucker gets twisted SO FAST</li>
            <li> I never thought I could get a flat ironed look from just a blow dryer</li>
            <li> -- it is so much better than my CHI dryer at straightening my crazy curly hair.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this blowdryer I spent a lot of time researching different kinds of blow dryers.</li>
            <li> I sent it back and was pretty annoyed that they only refunded me $64 of the $88 I spent on it.  </li>
            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t have waited so long to purchase it.  </li>
            <li> On both occasions I used the drier my long hair was sucked into the screen, causing it to tangle and burn.  </li>
            <li> Heavy but dries thick hair quickly</li>
            <li> It would turn out dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> 45- 60 mins to completely dry her hair at night.</li>
            <li> Or you can wash your hair and let it air dry</li>
            <li> Only thing is the back has come unscrewed a few times and the screen filter falls out then.</li>
            <li> You can blow from wet to dry.</li>
            <li> She is also a victim of ignorance-to-bad-dryer-itis, so I went ahead and sent her the cure.&lt;br /&gt;Happy Drying!</li>
            <li> : Heavy, the wind screen on the back has no cover, just flimsy screen.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so strong that it&#x27;s IMPOSSIBLE to untwist it.</li>
            <li> , I think it was due to the other ion dryers I was using.</li>
            <li> The Twinturbo blows really hard, so it is windy and loud, but those are small sacrifices for the sake of salon-straight hair.</li>
            <li> , It hasn&#x27;t completely quit on me yet but showing signs of getting tired</li>
            <li> I thought I had to have ionized or tourmaline or ceramic or whatever other fancy word to make my hair shiny, but this one works WONDERS!</li>
            <li> My previous hair dryer lasted me 7 years.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair</li>
            <li> you have long, thick, coarse or difficult to manage hair, seriously consider stepping up to a professional dryer.</li>
            <li> I typically spend 5 minutes though since I like to diffuse it at the end with a round brush.</li>
            <li> Just a little heavy</li>
            <li> My daughter has very thick, coarse color-treated hair and it used to take her approx</li>
            <li> It works as expected!!!</li>
            <li> Yes it is heavy as well.</li>
            <li> She suggested that I use it and a round, vented brush.  </li>
            <li> Not too noisy, not too heavy either.</li>
            <li> Cuts my drying time in half!</li>
            <li> The only downside is the nozzle always falls off which can be annoying on a busy day and its noisy.</li>
            <li> I was so tired of wimpy hairdryers that I had to buy this hairdryer after reading the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kinda hard to take apart on purpose.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> am not happy that I bought it.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with the purchase. &#x27;</li>
            <li> All in all, a lousy deal.</li>
            <li> It is a bit awkward for me to manuever as I am not used to this type of hair dryer....</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Product arrived in perfect condition and have had no issues since it arrived.  It was packaged very sustainably and safely. Am very satisfied with customer service.  Totally worth the wait!&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend absolutely loved this as a gift! She said the dryer is powerful enough but not hot enough to damage hair will leaving smooth hair and preventing split ends from fraying from the intense heat of a competitor.  If you have a significant other with delicate hair this is definitely worth the price and wait.  It will pay itself back in no time!&lt;br /&gt;I say it&#x27;s worth the wait because you either have to save up enough money to purchase an item of this caliber and also because it is manufactured in Italy and takes about two weeks to arrive</li>
            <li> I realized a bit too late in my adult life that a good blow-dryer makes all the difference in the look and feel of your hair. I simply could not figure out why my hair was always kind of &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; and not quite fully dry when I got out of the shower and tried to dry my hair with my 5+ year old Conair that I bought at CVS very inexpensively.&lt;br /&gt;I did some research online and scoffed at the $150+ dryers that were being promoted. This one was on the list, and honestly, given the relatively lower price point versus the other professional dryers, I was willing to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;WOW. I have used it now about 3 times, and it is hard to believe what a significant difference I see in my hair. I styled it myself for a formal Gala event, and was able to achieve the shiny look, feel, and volume in my hair that any professional stylist could achieve. It was unreal. Even on a work day I feel so much better about myself having simply styled my hair with this blow dryer. It targets the hot hair wonderfully and leaves my hair so dry, shiny and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;I went back and ordered one to send to my mom! She is also a victim of ignorance-to-bad-dryer-itis, so I went ahead and sent her the cure.&lt;br /&gt;Happy Drying!</li>
            <li> Does not dry the hair any faster than the regular El Cheapo ones. Also it is LOUD.&lt;br /&gt;I am not happy that I bought it. Yes it is heavy as well. It LOOKS well made. I am not happy with the purchase. &#x27;Nuff said.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is the best!  It makes your hair soft and silky without drying or damaging it!</li>
            <li> Awesome dryer, made my fine hair dry in half the time, also gave it more volume.  Great purchase.</li>
            <li> Great service, and  great product, thanks</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand and dryer for 10 years now.  They last a long time and makes my job as a stylist satisfying.  Its gets the job done great for keratin treatments too</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and have owned a lot of hairdryers in my life.  I would have never guessed that owning a professional hair dryer could make such a difference. This thing is amazing.  It&#x27;s works so much faster than any other dryer I have ever owned.  I originally started thinking about paying the big bucks for a pro dryer after reading an article on Jezebel. I had this thing on my wish list for a few months, not quite sure I wanted to spend so much for hairdryer.  I ended up buying it for myself as a birthday present -- what a great decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have long, thick, coarse or difficult to manage hair, seriously consider stepping up to a professional dryer.</li>
            <li> I was so tired of wimpy hairdryers that I had to buy this hairdryer after reading the other reviews.  The reviews are CORRECT.  The air that comes out of this dryer is incredible -- it dries my hair quickly, but the nice thing is that it dries your hair with air and not by baking it with intense heat-- it is hot, but not scorching.  A great purchase!</li>
            <li> Powerful blow dryer that gives you shiny, well-styled hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best blow dryer ever! I have long, thick hair and I was able to dry all of my hair (without styling) in 60 seconds! I typically spend 5 minutes though since I like to diffuse it at the end with a round brush. My hair has never looked so good. It&#x27;s always sleek and smooth and shiny and bouncy. I never thought I could get a flat ironed look from just a blow dryer but I&#x27;ve been able to cut out having to use a flat iron or curling iron when in a rush. Since I&#x27;ve dyed my hair for the last 15 years and style it frequently my air-dryed hair is frazzled and with this blow dryer you&#x27;d think I was a hair model!     Before purchasing this blowdryer I spent a lot of time researching different kinds of blow dryers. I thought I had to have ionized or tourmaline or ceramic or whatever other fancy word to make my hair shiny, but this one works WONDERS! Very long cord too and so light! I&#x27;ve had mine for over a year now and use it 2-3 times per week without any problems. Only thing is the back has come unscrewed a few times and the screen filter falls out then. But it&#x27;s easy to put back on. No idea how or why it comes unscrewed cause it&#x27;s kinda hard to take apart on purpose.</li>
            <li> powerful and fast drying</li>
            <li> Good quality and value I love it</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer having read the wonderful reviews.  It took forever to come and then didn&#x27;t live up to expectation.  I was hoping to solve my frizz problem and speed up the drying time, but I didn&#x27;t think this hair dryer did either.  I sent it back and was pretty annoyed that they only refunded me $64 of the $88 I spent on it.  They charged me a \\&quot;restocking fee\\&quot; and a \\&quot;shipping fee\\&quot; when I already paid $11 to send it back myself.  All in all, a lousy deal.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair.  Before purchasing this dryer, I couldn&#x27;t blow dry my own hair to save my life. It would turn out dry and frizzy.  My hair stylist recommended this dryer to me.  She suggested that I use it and a round, vented brush.  Now, I can do it well and quickly.  I&#x27;m saving a fortune by doing it myself.  Apparently, you need the right tools to be successful at this.  This is definitely the right dryer.</li>
            <li> Great power.  I shouldn&#x27;t have waited so long to purchase it.  Dries hair more quickly than any other dryer - by far!  Worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> best blow dryer for price</li>
            <li> As a hairstylist I have used MANY drying tools and NOTHING compares to this dryer.  I will never use another the famous CHI including.  CHI doesn&#x27;t come close to this one!!!! And the cost you just can&#x27;t beat it.  I had ,my first twinturbo for about 10 years roughly, It hasn&#x27;t completely quit on me yet but showing signs of getting tired so I&#x27;m buying another because I will NOT work without this dryer.  It will not disappoint....HINT  NOTHING manages frizz except products.  So don&#x27;t think a dryer is going to eliminate frizz because that&#x27;s nonsense.</li>
            <li> I bought for my wife and she is really happy with this blower, I strongly recommends this blower. Go and buy one</li>
            <li> I am a hairdresser and this eliminates a lot of drying time... This means more clients, and more money... Love it!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this dryer as it comes highly recommended by professional stylists.  I used it twice, it dried my hair quickly and somewhat smooth using a ceramic ion brush.  I was pleased with the results, after all this was a big step up from the half broken one I purchased from Sally&#x27;s years ago.  Then I visited my mother who recently purchased a new drier, the rusk w8less.  She told me I should try it.  When I used the rusk I was amazed at how fast it dried my hair and how  smooth and silky my hair felt.  I was in LOVE!!! It was a huge step up from the twinturbo.  I had to have the rusk, so I returned the twinturbo.  I could not be happier w the customer service.  Refund was super smooth.  So for the drier 3 stars customer service via Amazon and the seller 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Dries fast, smooth results, nice button position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Heavy, the wind screen on the back has no cover, just flimsy screen. On both occasions I used the drier my long hair was sucked into the screen, causing it to tangle and burn.  In my opinion this is a design flaw. The hole in the back of the dryer is the circumference of my fist!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look to the rusk w8less!  It&#x27;s an outstanding dryer!</li>
            <li> Heavy but dries thick hair quickly</li>
            <li> This was on my daughters Christmas list as a priority item. She is a hairdresser and swears that this blow drier cuts 20 minutes off her styling time. She was thrilled with this blow drier!</li>
            <li> Love the finish this dryer gives. This is my second one my first one lasted forever!! Very durable this is a great product!!</li>
            <li> work like if i was in the salon, totally love it. my hair is a litte kinky and it leaves it nice and soft.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is amazing.</li>
            <li> Best ever hair dryer, my second one as I needed another for our vacation home.  I was so excited to find it on line, great power and blows my hair straight quickly!  Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these blow dryers and I use them in my salon and they work excellent. Its very light so it does&#x27;nt exhaust my arms. Would recommend to buy again.</li>
            <li> Dryer works very well for ,me!</li>
            <li> Love this hairdryer! Cuts my drying time in half!</li>
            <li> this hairdryer is great.  it drys your hair fast &amp; is lightweight.  it is my second twin turbo, the first lasted for years  i love it</li>
            <li> I hairdresser recommended this blow dryer to me she said it was the strongest and best she has ever used, she was right.  I&#x27;m pretty sure they use this blow dryer in the movie Twister to make the tornadoes.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, great price.</li>
            <li> Good Product. Just a little heavy</li>
            <li> my favorite hairdryer.  I have been using this for years! Professional dryer</li>
            <li> Once I used this hair dryer, I noticed how quickly, efficiently and with less noise dried my hair.  I can definitely see a difference with the efficiency when compared to hotel and hair dryers sold at a local drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The delivery of the dryer was as promised, delivered promptly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommed this vendor and product to my friends.</li>
            <li> It works as expected!!! Loved it more that the old one that I had!!! The older lasted for 8 years!!!</li>
            <li> My hair stylist urged me to buy this hair dresser; she never uses anything else. She was right -- it is so much better than my CHI dryer at straightening my crazy curly hair. Plus I like that it&#x27;s made in Italy, not China, which in my experience tends to produce faulty dryers. The Twinturbo blows really hard, so it is windy and loud, but those are small sacrifices for the sake of salon-straight hair.</li>
            <li> I love the power and all that jazz, but MAN the cord to this sucker gets twisted SO FAST and it&#x27;s so strong that it&#x27;s IMPOSSIBLE to untwist it. But, hey man...this dryer is amazing otherwise. Y&#x27;all...fix the cord issue and you&#x27;d have the mercedes of hairdryers!!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is the best I&#x27;ve owned!  I have dry, curly hair and this hair dryer is powerful enough to straighten my hair without burning it... I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and will tell all of my friends about it...</li>
            <li> My daughter has very thick, coarse color-treated hair and it used to take her approx 45- 60 mins to completely dry her hair at night. The Turbo Power Twinturbo only takes 30 mins to achieve her sleek,smooth style! Now she can dry her hair completely at night and wake up to smooth hair in the morning. Truely a life-saver for both of us!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a professional type hair dryer this is a nice one.  It is a bit awkward for me to manuever as I am not used to this type of hair dryer....but the cold air is amazing when you are done drying....</li>
            <li> Used this for year, still awesome!</li>
            <li> Love this. it&#x27;s light weight which is nice and easy to use. I have a lot of hair, and it dries so fast with this hair dryer! would def recommend it!</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair silky and shiny. You can blow from wet to dry. Or you can wash your hair and let it air dry and it will still give u the same results. Love it :)</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer. The heat and power are the same you would get in a salon. My previous hair dryer lasted me 7 years. I had to buy another one immediately. I can&#x27;t live without this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Best blow dryer in the market&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;20 years experience , hairstylist</li>
            <li> Excellent product, and dries my long thick hair very fast.</li>
            <li> Very good product, better than appear, very please. Have a lot of power. Not too noisy, not too heavy either.</li>
            <li> I had this model blow dryer for over 7 years until I dropped it and broke the fan. This blow dryer took many years of abuse and worked like a champ. I bought the same model to replace the one I had.</li>
            <li> My stylist husband loves the Turbo Power blowdryer, and so does everyone he works with. This is a great dryer with nice hot/cold settings.</li>
            <li> After buying one as a gift for $125 at a local store, I was thrilled to find it on Amazon for $85 when my old one died after over 15 years. By far the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned. It is powerful and dries my hair in much less time than others I have used.</li>
            <li> I have had the dryer for a few weeks, and so far I am loving it! It is lightweight and great at transforming my coarse, curly hair into sleek, shiny, and straight hair in a short amount of time.  I have paid 2-3 times more for hairdryers in the past only to have them lose the ability to stay hot.  I am hopeful this dryer will last a while.  My hairdresser recommended it highly.  If he loves the product in a high volume salon, then I look forward to owning mine for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> I was so hopeful for this dryer. It does dry my hair with less frizz, but it&#x27;s not very lightweight and it doesn&#x27;t ever feel very hot even at max heat. I feel it should get hotter. It is ok.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect.the girls  loves it.</li>
            <li> I am a hair stylist and this is my go to blow dryer. Love it!</li>
            <li> This was bought for my daughter. Mine is about 7 years old, and this one is just as good as mine.</li>
            <li> Love the power of this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got this dryer. My hair was starting to look fried and lifeless, I think it was due to the other ion dryers I was using. Someone recommended that I look into the TwinTurbo and I&#x27;m so glad I invested the money.</li>
            <li> It works great. Very powerful. The only downside is the nozzle always falls off which can be annoying on a busy day and its noisy.</li>
            <li> It is worth the money. We had and older  one that lasted for almost 10 years. The new one looks exactly the same and works great too</li>
