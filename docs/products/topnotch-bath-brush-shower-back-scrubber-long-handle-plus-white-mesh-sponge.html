            <li>It even comes with a free cleansing poof!</li>
            <li>I purchased this during a promotion and I am glad that I choose this brush.</li>
            <li>It had a cute ribbon attached so that it can hang easily.  </li>
            <li>I was happy with the soft bonus sponge too.</li>
            <li>It came with a free mesh sponge that I love to use with scented soap.</li>
            <li>Brush works fine.</li>
            <li>The brush is great for exfoliating legs and feet as well as the back.</li>
            <li>The brush is great for exfoliating legs and feet as well as your back.</li>
            <li>It felt really great on my back!  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to obtain a coupon code to try this back brush at a reduced price in exchange for an honest review.  </li>
            <li>This back brush is nice!  </li>
            <li>Seems like this item would be more appropriate for a young child.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean and light weight and very sturdy.</li>
            <li>I got mine with a coupon in exchange for a review, but I&#x27;d buy it at full price.</li>
            <li>It is well made and does a good job cleaning my back!</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed was how nice it is the be able to scrub my back in the shower.</li>
            <li>I can think of several situations where this would make an excellent gift set - Mother&#x27;s Day, student off to college, house warming gift, or gift for someone with physical limitations.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased some sponges that quickly fall apart.</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly with no issues.</li>
            <li>I can say that the we all find the reach to be adequate.  </li>
            <li>When soap is added, the bristles make a nice lather, and the loop of nylon rope at the end means it can be easily hung up on a hook to dry in between uses.</li>
            <li>The mesh sponge is a great little bonus in case you don&#x27;t feel like using the brush.</li>
            <li>The accompanying pouf is one of those with a more &amp;#34;polished&amp;#34; feel - it is not the cheaper nylon netting that is frequently sold.</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy and has a long handle which is perfect for reaching places on my back</li>
            <li>so it makes exfoliating extremely easy if you are sensitive or not.</li>
            <li>Although, I would&#x27;ve liked for the sponge to be slightly larger in size, it seems to be very well made and sturdy.</li>
            <li>This brush has a very long handle so getting to the mid-center of the back is super easy,  which I couldn&#x27;t  accomplish on my own.</li>
            <li>I love this back scrubbing brush!</li>
            <li>Nice and soft and the curve assists back scrubbing.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, it is inexpensive enough so it is worth trying.  </li>
            <li>Not quite as long a handle as I thought, but will be ok.</li>
            <li>When I came across this promotion, I didn&#x27;t think I would enjoy the TopNotch Back Brush as much as I do.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really slippery.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit rough, but that&#x27;s good for exfoliation, the key thing I was looking for.</li>
            <li>This brush has a very long handle so getting to the mid-center of the back is super easy.</li>
            <li>And I thought it was overpriced when he picked it, but I figured for a good brush we could pay a little extra.</li>
            <li>This brush has held up much better than my previous one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably a decent brush, but I wanted something with a longer handle.</li>
            <li>The bristles are so stiff they wouldn&#x27;t even make a good toilet cleaning brush.  </li>
            <li>If you have real sensitive skin it will take a while before you can get use to it.</li>
            <li>The medium bristles make exfoliating easy but they are not too rough if you  have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I never even new</li>
            <li>The bristles are firm, but not to firm it hurts your skin, but great for exfoliation.  </li>
            <li>This back brush has a long, curved handle that handles that job easily.</li>
            <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t have to scratch his back so much!  </li>
            <li>I purchased this back brush to be able to scrub my back since summer is approaching.</li>
            <li>I purchased one at a reduced price at a local retail store and within the first couple of uses the bristles started falling out.  </li>
            <li>I have always used a traditional puff in  the shower which never allowed me to reach my back to clean it.</li>
            <li>The handle is made of heavy plastic, and the brush bristles are made of strong nylon bristles.</li>
            <li>The length of the brush handle is perfect for me to reach all those impossible to reach places on my back.</li>
            <li>I am always looking for a long handle back brush so when I saw this on promotion with a sponge I excited to try it.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are strong and don&#x27;t fall out all the time like other brushes and the mesh sponge has held its shape and form after several uses.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft to medium</li>
            <li>My whole back!</li>
            <li>I purchased (3) of these for different family members and myself and we all have very differing opinions.  </li>
            <li>So, this just must be one of those products that is absolutely subjective -  based on an individual&#x27;s preference.  </li>
            <li>Interestingly, 1 person prefers to use it dry as a back scratcher but finds that it feels like sandpaper when wet.</li>
            <li>They feel soft enough to be comfortable, but firm enough to really scrub.  </li>
            <li>I have small children who also really enjoy using the brush during bath time.</li>
            <li>Not too soft and not too hard, just fine for my liking.&lt;br /&gt;Would probably buy it again.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>had a nice long handle, large oval brush head, and rubber on the handle, but they didn&#x27;t have it in clear, only green, pink, and blue.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a back brush that was clear (no color) to the handle</li>
            <li>The brush is soft yet sturdy enough to get a scrub on your skin.</li>
            <li>My husband is forever looking for things that are long enough to reach his whole back when he showers.</li>
            <li>The handle is long enough to reach my back and is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Other than the clear color, this was a bust !</li>

            <li> Even though the description claims that this brush is 15&amp;#34; long, it&#x27;s really only 14&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Bristles are a little on the short side and fairly soft.</li>
            <li> Especially since its not pink like other ones I saw!</li>
            <li> My husband has very dry skinon his back.  </li>
            <li> The description states long handle, but it is not.  </li>
            <li> long.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are stiff enough to exfoliate my skin and actually scrub my skin rather than just rub it.</li>
            <li> Weird smell at first.</li>
            <li> bristles hard enough</li>
            <li> I previously owned one that I bought at Bed Bath and Beyond that</li>
            <li> I like that it has a slight curve in the handle to make it easier to use.</li>
            <li> The brush is not too hard where it scratches roughly.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would get some dead skin off</li>
            <li> Appears to have gone away after a few uses.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a brush that is a bit on the stiff side, you will like this brush.</li>
            <li> Also the brush is stiff like it was meant for scrubbing tile.</li>
            <li> Also the brush head is rather small.  </li>
            <li> (I have been prone to breakouts lately).  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed when i got it,  but even more disappointed after I realized there&#x27;s no way I could even make do with it.</li>
            <li> What a dumb design.</li>
            <li> Bristles are tough.</li>
            <li> This is a really difficult review.  </li>
            <li> handle broke after a month, I had to toss it :(</li>

            <li> My husband has very dry skinon his back.  I got this for him with a coupon to use in the shower on his back.  I was hoping it would get some dead skin off and I wouldn&#x27;t have to scratch his back so much!  He is very happy with it.  Especially since its not pink like other ones I saw!</li>
            <li> I wanted a back brush that was clear (no color) to the handle so I ordered this one.  The description states long handle, but it is not.  Also the brush head is rather small.  Seems like this item would be more appropriate for a young child.  I&#x27;m 5&#x27;  6&amp;#34; and it does not reach to the middle of my back. The plastic handle does not have rubber grips so if your hands are soapy it&#x27;s really slippery.  I previously owned one that I bought at Bed Bath and Beyond that had a nice long handle, large oval brush head, and rubber on the handle, but they didn&#x27;t have it in clear, only green, pink, and blue.  Other than the clear color, this was a bust !</li>
            <li> This brush has a very long handle so getting to the mid-center of the back is super easy. The bristles are soft to medium so it makes exfoliating extremely easy if you are sensitive or not. The mesh sponge is a great little bonus in case you don&#x27;t feel like using the brush. The brush is angled just right to reach places that may be hard to get to with just a washcloth or sponge. The brush is great for exfoliating legs and feet as well as the back. When I came across this promotion, I didn&#x27;t think I would enjoy the TopNotch Back Brush as much as I do. I guess I didn&#x27;t realize how much I actually needed it.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a brush that is a bit on the stiff side, you will like this brush. If you have real sensitive skin it will take a while before you can get use to it. The handle could be longer.</li>

A mesh sponge  comes with the brush as a bonus. When I came across this promotion, I  was thrilled to purchase this product for my review.</li>
            <li> I can think of several situations where this would make an excellent gift set - Mother&#x27;s Day, student off to college, house warming gift, or gift for someone with physical limitations. The length of the brush handle is perfect for me to reach all those impossible to reach places on my back. I tend to need exfoliation during the winter and to remove sweat from my back during the summer. Although, I would&#x27;ve liked for the sponge to be slightly larger in size, it seems to be very well made and sturdy. I&#x27;ve purchased some sponges that quickly fall apart. I received this item at a promotional rate in exchange for my review, but all opinions expressed are my own. I have small children who also really enjoy using the brush during bath time. Any product that promotes good, self hygiene is a plus in my book.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this brush. The bristles are stiff enough to exfoliate my skin and actually scrub my skin rather than just rub it.</li>
            <li> Wish brush handle was longer</li>
            <li> Handle could be about 4&amp;#34; longer. Brush works fine. Not too soft and not too hard, just fine for my liking.&lt;br /&gt;Would probably buy it again.</li>
            <li> handle broke after a month, I had to toss it :(</li>
            <li> My husband is forever looking for things that are long enough to reach his whole back when he showers. This back brush has a long, curved handle that handles that job easily. The handle is made of heavy plastic, and the brush bristles are made of strong nylon bristles. When soap is added, the bristles make a nice lather, and the loop of nylon rope at the end means it can be easily hung up on a hook to dry in between uses. I got mine with a coupon in exchange for a review, but I&#x27;d buy it at full price. It gets the job done.</li>
            <li> My husband fell for the fake/purchased reviews.  I was disappointed when i got it,  but even more disappointed after I realized there&#x27;s no way I could even make do with it. The handle is short. The brush end is tiny.  The bristles are so stiff they wouldn&#x27;t even make a good toilet cleaning brush.  They just don&#x27;t bend!  If you try to brush yourself with this brush you will leave mark on your skin.  It doesn&#x27;t even have a hook to hang in the shower.  And I thought it was overpriced when he picked it, but I figured for a good brush we could pay a little extra.</li>
            <li> I have really short arms! I have always used a traditional puff in  the shower which never allowed me to reach my back to clean it. I never even new this was a problem until after I purchased this shower brush. I was given the a coupon to purchase in exchange for an unbiased review. I was intrigued so I decided to give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was how nice it is the be able to scrub my back in the shower. My whole back! The handle is long to allow even those with short arms cup access back there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next I started cleaning my arms and legs with the brush- hello exfoliation! My skin tingles and. Feels great after the shower now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reccomend this brush to everyone- it is a great shower brush! It even comes with a free cleansing poof!</li>
            <li> I love this back scrubbing brush! It is well made and does a good job cleaning my back! The bristles do not fall out and soap up nicely. Easy to clean and light weight and very sturdy.</li>
            <li> good price for 2 products. I wish the handle was a bit longer otherwise I am happy with my purchase. The brush is not too hard where it scratches roughly.</li>
            <li> too straight and too narrow. i like something to scratch my back in the shower.</li>
            <li> Good quality and timely delivery!</li>
            <li> This back brush is nice!  I received it at a discounted price in exchange for my opinion. I think the bristles are the perfect firmness.  They feel soft enough to be comfortable, but firm enough to really scrub.  It felt really great on my back!  I was happy with the soft bonus sponge too. It had a cute ribbon attached so that it can hang easily.  It came packaged nicely too in case you are thinking of giving it for a gift.  Would be a great gift for someone needing pampering.</li>
            <li> Get the job done.  Bristles are tough. Buty, I would recommend.</li>
            <li> What a dumb design. The handle is very short and the brush is curved away from your back and not towards it. Also the brush is stiff like it was meant for scrubbing tile. Don&#x27;t buy thgis.</li>
            <li> Nice and soft and the curve assists back scrubbing.  The puff is a tiny one but it works.</li>
            <li> Weird smell at first. Appears to have gone away after a few uses.</li>
            <li> You need this if you want a good bathbrush it reaches places I need to reach and is a good price also fast shipping and delivery.would recommend.</li>
            <li> bristles hard enough so you feel it with pressure. Delivered quickly with no issues.</li>
            <li> What I wanted and price was great</li>
            <li> I am always looking for a long handle back brush so when I saw this on promotion with a sponge I excited to try it.  I like that both piece came in white/clear so my husband on use them without saying it was a girly color.  The bristles are strong and don&#x27;t fall out all the time like other brushes and the mesh sponge has held its shape and form after several uses.</li>
            <li> I purchased this back brush to be able to scrub my back since summer is approaching. The brush is soft yet sturdy enough to get a scrub on your skin. It came with a free mesh sponge that I love to use with scented soap. The handle is long enough to reach my back and is very sturdy. I like that it has a slight curve in the handle to make it easier to use. I purchased this during a promotion and I am glad that I choose this brush. It is also good for scrubbing your feet for those who can&#x27;t reach their feet or lower legs.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to obtain a coupon code to try this back brush at a reduced price in exchange for an honest review.  My dermatologist actually suggest that I purchase one of these to apply my skin clearing body wash to parts of my back I could not reach (I have been prone to breakouts lately).  I purchased one at a reduced price at a local retail store and within the first couple of uses the bristles started falling out.  This brush has held up much better than my previous one.  It is very sturdy and has a long handle which is perfect for reaching places on my back I could not with just a regular washcloth.  The bristles are firm, but not to firm it hurts your skin, but great for exfoliation.  It comes with a mesh sponge as a bonus for purchasing this product.  I love using this brush, and can notice a difference in my skin already!</li>
            <li> Like the bath brush, but the scrounge sponge unraveled and had to throw it out.</li>
            <li> This is a really difficult review.  I purchased (3) of these for different family members and myself and we all have very differing opinions.  Some find it too abrasive and others, delightfully exfoliating.  Interestingly, 1 person prefers to use it dry as a back scratcher but finds that it feels like sandpaper when wet. So, this just must be one of those products that is absolutely subjective -  based on an individual&#x27;s preference.  Fortunately, it is inexpensive enough so it is worth trying.  I can say that the we all find the reach to be adequate.  The accompanying pouf is one of those with a more &amp;#34;polished&amp;#34; feel - it is not the cheaper nylon netting that is frequently sold.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. Seems to be of a good quality. It is a bit rough, but that&#x27;s good for exfoliation, the key thing I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Not quite as long a handle as I thought, but will be ok. Bristles are a little on the short side and fairly soft. Nice.</li>
            <li> Even though the description claims that this brush is 15&amp;#34; long, it&#x27;s really only 14&amp;#34; long.  It&#x27;s probably a decent brush, but I wanted something with a longer handle.</li>
