    <ol>
            <li> This is the only remover that works. We have others and the simply do not work. I have to buy it myself (insurance supplies others) but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> The best for removing bandage adhesive. You can use this as you&#x27;re removing the bandage. As you&#x27;re pulling bandage off use this to help release the bandage adhesive from the skin. Alot less painfull.</li>
            <li> Works much better than expensive alternatives found only at drugstores.</li>
            <li> This works great at cleaning sticky stuff left from  tape or bandaids, and it does not hurt your skin. I have thin skin an does not hurt it.</li>
            <li> This product worked very well for my grandaughter.</li>
            <li> Good product that works well and doesn&#x27;t sting. The wipes are much bigger than some brands so one is usually enough.</li>
            <li> I used a few samples after my surgery and like this better than other products, so I ordered this 30 pack box. After using a few of them I realized these are almost dry feeling and did not clean off the adhesive very good.  I must have received a bad/dry batch.</li>
            <li> These adhesive remover is the best product for this I have found. They make the job much easier and faster.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I use this every time I need to remove anything with adhesive on it.  It does not sting and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Product works very well to remove adhesive without skin irritation. The wipe is a very generous size.</li>
            <li> Easily removes the tacky adhesive left behind from my sons&#x27; CGM.  He is young and another brand of this type of product had alcohol and he said it stung.  No issues with this hurting his skin!!</li>
            <li> This product works well. It&#x27;s not as wet as their allkare product, but I can use both. Does not sting or burn.</li>
            <li> Really good product! Does a good job!</li>
            <li> Paper pads are almost dryed out</li>
            <li> Very little dampness to these removers -- barely active for a minute after opening.  Required to use entire box to remove 6 inch x 6 inch are of medical foam residue.  Buy either a spray or just use nail polish remover (if your doc allows).  These were not helpful and contain very little liquid</li>
            <li> it works fine for me right now. I am glad no etoh in the solution.</li>
            <li> The wipes were dried up and didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> As it says IT DOES NOT STING AT ALL.  Worth every penny</li>
            <li> I have used several removers over the last 26 years.  This is the best product I have ever used.  I can remove adesive without the need to wash which is great when you are on vacation.</li>
            <li> These worked fine but in the long run, I have found that for my use with the medical tape, it wasn&#x27;t necessary. I just get it all off in the shower with soap and warm water and some olive oil if there is any residual leftover.</li>
            <li> Perfect for ostomy patients.  I bought these for my Dad and the home health care company started ordering them for his regular supplies and for other patients in their company.</li>
            <li> Ours arrived dry.  They weren&#x27;t as dry as paper, but just about. Whatever original moisture and stuff that was used to remove the adhesive was definitely gone.  We tried wetting them, and then wringing them out but that just washed out all of the ingredients which would aid in adhesive removal.  We sent these back for a refund.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I heard about Sensi-Care Sting Free Adhesive Remover wipes.  I have to change my colostomy bag frequently and the pads I was using have alcohol as one of the first ingredients in them ... which often burned my skin.  Sensi-care does not.</li>
            <li> These are great for removing all the tape from being in hospital. Use a alcohol wipe after this and takes care of all of it! Love!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work very well--not powerful enough at removing adhesive</li>
            <li> great product as usual</li>
            <li> They are helpful in removing my mother&#x27;s barrier for her ostomy with less stress and pain.</li>
