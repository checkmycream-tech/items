            <li>Wonderful product.</li>
            <li>so wonderful!</li>
            <li>and I think it would be a good product ... if it doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin!</li>
            <li>Loved these!</li>
            <li>The best part is that it&#x27;s paraben free!</li>
            <li>Plus they smell good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The wipes are a good thickness</li>
            <li>These wipes did a good job or cleaning my face</li>
            <li>it feels good on my face.</li>
            <li>and they smell good</li>
            <li>The lavender scent is very refreshing and it appears to get all of my make up off and leave my face refreshed.</li>
            <li>I am still looking for a better one!</li>
            <li>I love these wipes!  </li>
            <li>Gentle and smells great too!  </li>
            <li>These are handy for work as I use them at my desk before reapplying lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bathroom wipes of any kind would also work and would be cheaper.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are soft, a perfect size for me, soothing and do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;This isn&#x27;t my favorite kind of packaging.  </li>
            <li>they smell nice, i love lavender.</li>
            <li>i love the clean feeling i get with these and the SMELL!!</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how refreshed and clean my face felt, and it smelled so good.</li>
            <li>They are also nice and handy to have when you have put in a 12 hour day and don&#x27;t have energy to clean your face before going to bed.</li>
            <li>Refreshing for sure, the fits.</li>
            <li>The smell of these wipes might be one of the most foul scents I have ever had the displeasure of encountering.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m probably going to repurpose them for something else, maybe use them to wipe stinky feet, although I cannot say if the smell is that much better.</li>
            <li>but I found the lavender smell a bit overwhelming</li>
            <li>(I love fragrance</li>
            <li>this is an ok choice</li>
            <li>but I assume there are better options.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel at all oily after using them, and I love the lavender smell.  </li>
            <li>They are delightfully accented with lavender, and always smell nice and refreshing after a rough day on the road.</li>
            <li>They are OK.</li>
            <li>i will be buying these again for sure</li>
            <li>they worked okay</li>
            <li>but with more liquid i would be able to remove my eye makeup easier.</li>
            <li>The scent was so strong that I couldn&#x27;t bear to put it to my face.</li>
            <li>These always made my skin feel comfortable and they are so easy to use</li>
            <li>They work fine though.</li>
            <li>These are great for those on-the-fly moments when a little pit wipe or face touch up makes everything look, feel and smell better!</li>
            <li>/&gt;\\&quot;I received a free sample of Seventh Generation(tm) from Smiley360.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>but I liked them so much that I am now using them at home too.</li>
            <li>I like the company and can appreciate their efforts to be environmentally sound</li>
            <li>Happy overall.</li>
            <li>Nicely priced and it cleans my face very well</li>
            <li>I was using this to take off my makeup and refresh my skin to clean.  </li>
            <li>feel clean and refreshed after using them.</li>
            <li>I have no complaints about the cleansing properties of these wipes but after a while the lavender scent gets very overpowering, and i can smell it on me most of the day.</li>
            <li>LOVE REAL LAVENDER</li>
            <li>Do do an alright job that was good enough, but I haven&#x27;t become brand loyal to them or anything.</li>
            <li>Light soothing scent that made my face feel nice and clean after a long day.</li>
            <li>I got these pretty cheap, so maybe 7th Generation got the hint and are changing the formula.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll take off most of your makeup (the easy stuff) but be sure to splash with water after using as it leaves a slight sticky residue if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>If I find myself in a situation where a sink is nowhere near me, this is when I’m most thankful to have this product.</li>
            <li>That being said, the wipes are a nice big size, and they do work</li>
            <li>Like these face wipes to remove make up, I&#x27;ve been switching to more natural products for the face.</li>
            <li>hot summer, they might make a nice quick facial refresh while traveling.</li>
            <li>I used the Mandarin Refreshing Facial Wipes on a really hot day.</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying this product .</li>
            <li>I really liked that this product removed my makeup, even the mascara/eye liner, that other products didn&#x27;t touch.  </li>
            <li>sure you snap the top securely closed, or they will dry out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I had to force myself to use the whole package.  </li>
            <li>They are very convenient.</li>
            <li>I guess I may not like lavender as much as I had thought.</li>
            <li>but, they don’t really work for that.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I first bought these facial wipes to use when I travel</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Seventh Generation products for many years, so when these facial wipes came out I knew I wanted to try them, especially since they are made with real essential lavender fragrance, no synthetics, which I can not use with my allergies, sensitivities.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you are looking for a natural wipe</li>
            <li>but I think it has a bit of an old fashioned scent.</li>
            <li>which comes in handy when you are tired or busy.</li>
            <li>These smell fantastic, not overly &#x27;perfumey&#x27; and they clean well but aren&#x27;t overly drying and don&#x27;t leave a weird chemical/oily feel on your face.</li>
            <li>This is very gentle wipes and doesn&#x27;t make my eyes sensitive unlike other drug store brand products.</li>
            <li>These worked well but dried out quickly.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The texture of the paper wasn&#x27;t rough.</li>

            <li> I bought these as an add on item when I was purchasing other seventh gen products, thought my daughter would like them.</li>
            <li> the package i recieved were just slightly damp, not very moist at all, so i would not repurchase these again.</li>
            <li> The wipes were dry and were not effective in removing make-up.</li>
            <li> Don’t waste your money.&lt;br</li>

            <li> skin is usually not sensitive at all, unfortunately this product irritated it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always feel really uncomfortable when I sweat or when I go a few hours without washing my face.</li>
            <li> I ended up throwing the entire package away :(</li>
            <li> It was disappointing.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s too bad that I couldn&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate the smell of these--the lavender smells like puke in this product</li>

            <li> I used the Mandarin Refreshing Facial Wipes on a really hot day. I was amazed at how refreshed and clean my face felt, and it smelled so good. I would defiantly recommend these over other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I received a free sample of Seventh Generation(tm) from Smiley360.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I always feel really uncomfortable when I sweat or when I go a few hours without washing my face. If I find myself in a situation where a sink is nowhere near me, this is when I’m most thankful to have this product.</li>
            <li> Refreshing for sure, the fits. I used these when I was having chemotherapy. These always made my skin feel comfortable and they are so easy to use which comes in handy when you are tired or busy.</li>
            <li> My face turned red from the chemical/soap. The texture of the paper wasn&#x27;t rough. Not sure why this happened. ...</li>
            <li> These worked well but dried out quickly.</li>
            <li> The smell of these wipes might be one of the most foul scents I have ever had the displeasure of encountering.  I cannot figure out how 7th Generation managed to create this &amp;#34;lavender&amp;#34; scent, but it cannot possibly come from lavender oil.  That being said, the wipes are a nice big size, and they do work (hence the two star vs one star rating).  I just cannot stand the smell.  I got these pretty cheap, so maybe 7th Generation got the hint and are changing the formula.  Anyway, I would not recommend these for your face at all.  I&#x27;m probably going to repurpose them for something else, maybe use them to wipe stinky feet, although I cannot say if the smell is that much better.</li>
            <li> I first bought these facial wipes to use when I travel but I liked them so much that I am now using them at home too.</li>
            <li> Gentle and smells great too!  These are handy for work as I use them at my desk before reapplying lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Remove make up, don&#x27;t have any &amp;#34;off limits&amp;#34; chemicals, and they don&#x27;t make me break out. Plus they smell good.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate the smell of these--the lavender smells like puke in this product and I had to force myself to use the whole package.  They work fine though.</li>
            <li> I use these wipes to wipe my hands. I carry them in my tote bag. They are very convenient. The downside is they are not organic.</li>
            <li> I was using this to take off my makeup and refresh my skin to clean.  I found the scent was overpowering.</li>
            <li> I bought these as an add on item when I was purchasing other seventh gen products, thought my daughter would like them. They smell terrific and are so soothing, I don&#x27;t even have to put face cream on after using them.</li>
            <li> I really liked that this product removed my makeup, even the mascara/eye liner, that other products didn&#x27;t touch.  However, I broke out after a couple months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is usually not sensitive at all, unfortunately this product irritated it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wipes are a good thickness and I think it would be a good product ... if it doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin!</li>
            <li> Yep, this irritated my skin too. It was disappointing. I have very sensitive skin and it&#x27;s too bad that I couldn&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> These wipes did a good job or cleaning my face but I found the lavender smell a bit overwhelming (I love fragrance so it is not a normal aversion to scent some people have).  I also took off a star for difficulty trying to remove them from the package.  The wipes tend to stick to one another and stretch out when being removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a natural wipe this is an ok choice but I assume there are better options.  I am still looking for a better one!</li>
            <li> I have no complaints about the cleansing properties of these wipes but after a while the lavender scent gets very overpowering, and i can smell it on me most of the day. I guess I may not like lavender as much as I had thought.</li>
            <li> This is very gentle wipes and doesn&#x27;t make my eyes sensitive unlike other drug store brand products. I&#x27;m only going to buy this product from now on!</li>
            <li> I love these wipes!  I don&#x27;t feel at all oily after using them, and I love the lavender smell.  Would definitely buy again</li>
            <li> I had a reaction to one of the ingredients. My face started burning and turning red immediately after use. I rinsed my face, but it still burned. It was still burning even after washing my face with my usual cleanser. I like the company and can appreciate their efforts to be environmentally sound, so they get 2 stars instead of 1, but I will never use these again.</li>
            <li> i like this product. it feels good on my face. feel clean and refreshed after using them. and they smell good</li>
            <li> Loved these! Light soothing scent that made my face feel nice and clean after a long day. It&#x27;ll take off most of your makeup (the easy stuff) but be sure to splash with water after using as it leaves a slight sticky residue if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I find that my face feels like I washed it was soap and water after I use these wipes. It is helpful to have a pack of these in my suitcase at all times when I travel for work. They are delightfully accented with lavender, and always smell nice and refreshing after a rough day on the road. They are also nice and handy to have when you have put in a 12 hour day and don&#x27;t have energy to clean your face before going to bed.</li>
            <li> These smell fantastic, not overly &#x27;perfumey&#x27; and they clean well but aren&#x27;t overly drying and don&#x27;t leave a weird chemical/oily feel on your face. Wonderful product. I would definitely get them again.</li>

            <li> They are OK. I bought them as an alternative to more expensive wipes for dry eye but, they don’t really work for that. Don’t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;Women might like them for makeup removal.&lt;br /&gt;In hot summer, they might make a nice quick facial refresh while traveling. Bathroom wipes of any kind would also work and would be cheaper.</li>
            <li> I got these when they were on sale so for the price I thought I&#x27;d try them out. The lavender scent is very refreshing and it appears to get all of my make up off and leave my face refreshed. The best part is that it&#x27;s paraben free!</li>
            <li> I received this product and was eager to try. This was my first time trying this product . The wipes were dry and were not effective in removing make-up. I do not recommend this .</li>
            <li> The scent was so strong that I couldn&#x27;t bear to put it to my face. I ended up throwing the entire package away :(</li>
            <li> Nicely priced and it cleans my face very well but I think it has a bit of an old fashioned scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Seventh Generation products for many years, so when these facial wipes came out I knew I wanted to try them, especially since they are made with real essential lavender fragrance, no synthetics, which I can not use with my allergies, sensitivities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are soft, a perfect size for me, soothing and do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE REAL LAVENDER so I would definitely purchase these facial wipes again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you snap the top securely closed, or they will dry out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t my favorite kind of packaging.  I would rather have them as individual facial wipes, so that you could put them into your purse or when you travel, when you might want a smaller size than this is, but it&#x27;s standard these days for facial wipes to be in this type of packaging.</li>
            <li> i love the clean feeling i get with these and the SMELL!! so wonderful! i will be buying these again for sure</li>
            <li> the package i recieved were just slightly damp, not very moist at all, so i would not repurchase these again. they worked okay but with more liquid i would be able to remove my eye makeup easier. they smell nice, i love lavender.</li>
