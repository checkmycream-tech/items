            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the aveeno sulfate free shampoo and felt like i was loosing too much hair.</li>
            <li>have no problem getting a full lather, and I don&#x27;t have to use much at all.</li>
            <li>He may even be able to wear the traditional Bichon cut pretty soon.  </li>
            <li>I must say at first when I squeezed the shampoo into my hands</li>
            <li>Leaving some other kind of oil on my hair.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair everyday, so i need something that&#x27;s not too strong on the chemicals and goes easy on the hair.</li>
            <li>I know that sounds odd for short, fine hair, but there are sections of my bangs that just want to do their own thing.</li>
            <li>Trust, you do not want to use too much because avocado is an oily butter.</li>
            <li>This helps and it has helped me retain moisture as much as my hair can.</li>
            <li>Again, our WHOLE family loves this product.</li>
            <li>it was one of the top rated shampoos for dry hair, normal hair, and even oily hair.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling super soft and alive.</li>
            <li>My hair has never felt so soft and my color lasts so much longer.</li>
            <li>I was using WEN Fig, and her hair has been so soft, with no breakage, even in the almost ready for touch up state.</li>
            <li>I love what it does to my hair; it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or dried out.</li>
            <li>First off, let me say I am a white guy with short, fine, blonde hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fragile and dry out easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Carol&#x27;s Daughter shampoo products on my natural mane - four years now.</li>
            <li>Not stripping my hair of all natural oils, or 2.</li>
            <li>Either way, it feels soft and supple after washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>just wish it would leave my hearing soft after</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural oils</li>
            <li>I noticed MARKED improvement with respect to hair fall.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair really soft, untangled and volumized.</li>
            <li>now has never been so manageable and soft and detangled.</li>
            <li>My hair air dried and it was so full of body</li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo with the hope that it would calm my hair down.</li>
            <li>It left me with that same confidence you get when walking out of a salon with a new haircut.</li>
            <li>My dog is even calm when he&#x27;s been blow dried and brushed out.  </li>
            <li>Ever since I did my research at the beginning of my natural transition state, I switched over from using Pantene&#x27;s Relaxed for African American hair line of products to Carol&#x27;s Daughter and the condition of  my hair</li>
            <li>First used CD Lisa hair elixir, then washed with CD tui Herbal shampoo, then deep condition with Shea moisture repair, then sprayed CD black vanilla leave in conditioner.</li>

            <li> I gave it 4 stars because of the price is a little high for my budget</li>
            <li> It left my already fragile, dry hair feeling like straw.</li>
            <li> Took me one hour to flat iron putting CD mimosa hair honey on each strand to moisten.</li>
            <li> With Black Vanilla, my hair feels so soft and moisturized this line of products.</li>
            <li> I have fragile, thin, so-called 4B/C hair that does not like SHEA butter or olive or COCONUT oil very much.</li>
            <li> I have been a product junkie for about four years and NOTHING seemed to work because natural hair products heavily use SHEA a basis.</li>
            <li> I like the way the shampoo cleans my hair, and does not leave it brittle and dry.</li>
            <li> made my scalp dry and itch.........</li>
            <li> Well, for the past several months I have used the following regimen</li>
            <li> Shampoo and deep condition with Carol Daughter&#x27;s \\&quot;Black</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry and wavy</li>
            <li> I have been natural over 20 years and it has been very difficult for me to find the right products for my hair.</li>
            <li> maybe once every other day or every two</li>
            <li> only not-so-great thing is that the 8 ounce bottle seems too small.</li>
            <li> I use very little of it (a little less than the size of a quarter) and it&#x27;s enough for my hair, which is fairly long (about 5&amp;#34; down my shoulder).</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product in fact, its been almost half a year now that I have been using Carol&#x27;s Daughter Tui Shampoo</li>
            <li> , I just wasted money on this crappy shampoo that&#x27;s going to weigh my hair down and take 5 rinses to wash out.</li>
            <li> I have been usint it for a few years</li>
            <li> I am usually embarrassed when I take him to the groomer as he often has matts that cause him to get a cut like a poodle.  </li>
            <li> For the past month, I have washed his hair with the Tui shampoo and it detangles his hair so well.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s unbelievable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no better than the Creme of Nature shampoo I already use on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Hair was so hard, can&#x27;t comb.</li>
            <li> With how thick it was</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is horrible!</li>
            <li> I had heard that I could buy this product at Sephora here in town but just knew the price would be outrageous!</li>

            <li> Tui Moisturizing served as kryptonite to my hair. It left my already fragile, dry hair feeling like straw. Yet, the Black Vanilla was EXCELLENT for my hair. With Black Vanilla, my hair feels so soft and moisturized this line of products. I have fragile, thin, so-called 4B/C hair that does not like SHEA butter or olive or COCONUT oil very much. I have been natural over 20 years and it has been very difficult for me to find the right products for my hair. I have been a product junkie for about four years and NOTHING seemed to work because natural hair products heavily use SHEA a basis. This product is light on shea (thank goodness).  Well, for the past several months I have used the following regimen: Aloe and water works well daily. Shampoo and deep condition with Carol Daughter&#x27;s \\&quot;Black Vanilla\\&quot; line once a week (co-washing dries my hair). Use a mix of grape seed and sweet almond oils. And, end with twisting the a bit (just a bit) of Avocado Butter. Trust, you do not want to use too much because avocado is an oily butter. Wear a satin scarf at night. So, in essence, I use the liquid, oil, and creme/butter (LOC or LOB) method. My hair is very fragile and dry out easily. This helps and it has helped me retain moisture as much as my hair can.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Carol&#x27;s Daughter shampoo products on my natural mane - four years now. Tui is my favorite and probably will be years from now. It&#x27;s a great buy!</li>
            <li> This product performs very well and smells good too!  Although I am very happy with it on my hair, I am estatic about how well it works on my dog&#x27;s hair.  I have a Bichon Frise and have never been able to keep his hair from matting.  I am usually embarrassed when I take him to the groomer as he often has matts that cause him to get a cut like a poodle.  For the past month, I have washed his hair with the Tui shampoo and it detangles his hair so well.  My dog is even calm when he&#x27;s been blow dried and brushed out.  So far, he has NO matts and he smells great!  He may even be able to wear the traditional Bichon cut pretty soon.  Again, our WHOLE family loves this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo for my daughter who is Ethiopian and I am Caucasian. I decided to use it too. My hair is very dry and wavy and it is now moist and smooth. I love it.  She looks great too and has natural curly beautiful hair.</li>
            <li> First off, let me say I am a white guy with short, fine, blonde hair. I decided to go with this shampoo becuase on Sephora&#x27;s website it was one of the top rated shampoos for dry hair, normal hair, and even oily hair. It sounded like a good all around shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it specifically because sometimes my hair seems to have a mind of its own. I know that sounds odd for short, fine hair, but there are sections of my bangs that just want to do their own thing. I bought this shampoo with the hope that it would calm my hair down. I use Shu Uemura shape paste from Gene Juarez for styling after washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no problem getting a full lather, and I don&#x27;t have to use much at all. When I rinse, my hair does not get that \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot; feel, which leads me to believe that it is either 1. Not stripping my hair of all natural oils, or 2. Leaving some other kind of oil on my hair. Either way, it feels soft and supple after washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two days I have seen a noticeable difference in my hair. It is more relaxed and supple, and I can get my bangs to go the direction I want. The reason I gave it four stars and not five is because I wish it would just add a bit more body.</li>
            <li> I must say at first when I squeezed the shampoo into my hands I thought it was thicker then molasses. To me it smells like some type of bubble gum. With how thick it was I was thinking oh great, I just wasted money on this crappy shampoo that&#x27;s going to weigh my hair down and take 5 rinses to wash out. Boy was I wrong! My hair air dried and it was so full of body it&#x27;s unbelievable. It left me with that same confidence you get when walking out of a salon with a new haircut. I love what it does to my hair; it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or dried out. I wish you got more for the price or they sold it cheaper but my hair is happy.</li>
            <li> I actually use this on my face. Diluted or full strength if I have a breakout.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing that doesn&#x27;t break out my skin. It also quickly clears breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note this means it&#x27;s &amp;#34;drying.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I use it only once a week on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I use a different product to wash my hair regularly.</li>
            <li> Good leaves my hair soft when I wash it I like it just wish it would leave my hearing soft after</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product line for a year now and my hair has changed for the way better. Leaves my hair feeling super soft and alive. The scent of this product is awesome too.</li>
            <li> I love her products. I&#x27;ve been using them for about 5 years and I have noticed a great improvement in my hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> The product was alright</li>
            <li> This shampoo is horrible! Damaged my hair severely &amp; I ended up having to cut it. Do NOT buy this.</li>
            <li> The tui herbal shampoo is not that great in my opinion.  It&#x27;s no better than the Creme of Nature shampoo I already use on my hair.  Overly hyped product in my opinion.  Nice smell though.</li>
            <li> Dries out my scalp leaving me with dandruff. Smells delightful.</li>
            <li> I like the way the shampoo cleans my hair, and does not leave it brittle and dry. This product is good for Afro-American hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for your hair.</li>
            <li> smells really good. I have been using this product for 4 years now love it</li>
            <li> I love this product it doesn&#x27;t strip your hair from all it&#x27;s natural oils</li>
            <li> My hair is gray and brown. It dries out very easily. This product is awesome at keeping my hair nice, soft and healthy!  I gave it 4 stars because of the price is a little high for my budget but it works so I sacrifice to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Sulfate free is the way to go! My hair has never felt so soft and my color lasts so much longer. Even my hairdresser has commented on it! It costs more than eat I&#x27;m used to paying, but it is worth it!</li>
            <li> Everything was fine I have been usint it for a few years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the aveeno sulfate free shampoo and felt like i was loosing too much hair. It was also drying my hair out, A LOT. I wash my hair everyday, so i need something that&#x27;s not too strong on the chemicals and goes easy on the hair. So  decided to switch to carol&#x27;s daughter and i am very impressed with the results. It smells AMAZING! I use very little of it (a little less than the size of a quarter) and it&#x27;s enough for my hair, which is fairly long (about 5&amp;#34; down my shoulder). I noticed MARKED improvement with respect to hair fall. Leaves hair really soft, untangled and volumized. The scent stays all day-- even the next day. Hasn&#x27;t caused any scalp, dandruff or acne problems either. Also, using it in conjunction with the conditioner helps moisturize your hair. I wouldn&#x27;t use the conditioner with every wash though-- maybe once every other day or every two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only not-so-great thing is that the 8 ounce bottle seems too small. I think i&#x27;m going to run through it within a month. I wish they had larger bottles--12 -16 ounces. Same goes for the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I read altough reviews and excited to try and What a stressful morning! Daughter has relaxed hair, about time for a touch up. First used CD Lisa hair elixir, then washed with CD tui Herbal shampoo, then deep condition with Shea moisture repair, then sprayed CD black vanilla leave in conditioner. When I could not comb thru her hair I should have re-washed immediately with WEN. I couldn&#x27;t comb thru her hair to the roots! Hair was so tangled. I continued to twist in section and have her sit under dryer. Hair was so hard, can&#x27;t comb. I was almost in tears, hair was breaking again. Havent had tis issue in years. Took me one hour to flat iron putting CD mimosa hair honey on each strand to moisten. Just a nightmare. If it aint broke don&#x27;t fix it they say. I was using WEN Fig, and her hair has been so soft, with no breakage, even in the almost ready for touch up state. Never again. RETURNing the &amp;#34;CD Best Tressed Kit&amp;#34; for less stress!</li>
            <li> I love this Shampoon by Carol&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s.  I love the smell and the tingling that goes on with the scalp.  When my head starts to tingle, it know that it is doing its job.  Will be buying more.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my oldest daughter Sheila and she is very pleased with the product. I had heard that I could buy this product at Sephora here in town but just knew the price would be outrageous! I was so glad to be able to get a great product at a reasonable price :)</li>
            <li> Use with the washout and leave-in conditioner and your hair will be smelling super sexy and feeling super soft! Sent quick and safely wrapped. Though Carol&#x27;s Daughter stopped selling this, this is definitely original stock somehow, not a fake!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this sulfate-free shampoo. Ever since I did my research at the beginning of my natural transition state, I switched over from using Pantene&#x27;s Relaxed for African American hair line of products to Carol&#x27;s Daughter and the condition of  my hair now has never been so manageable and soft and detangled. I will continue to use this product in fact, its been almost half a year now that I have been using Carol&#x27;s Daughter Tui Shampoo and I am in love. The smell is another added bonus!!!!</li>
            <li> made my scalp dry and itch.........</li>
