    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Sk-II has a wonderful reputation in the beauty industry.</li>
            <li>impressed by the pearlescent bottle.</li>
            <li>Therefore, before I even tried this product I had/have very good skin</li>
            <li>Way cheaper and great results.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately great skin can be pricey.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any redness or breakouts like some have reported.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Estee Lauder skin care products for about 40 years, and I have very nice skin.</li>
            <li>My skin was hydrated smooth and perfect.</li>
            <li>Good idea</li>
            <li>thank goodness for good genes.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This product comes in a nice glass bottle with a rubber dropper in the cap for applying 1 or 2 drops.</li>
            <li>If anything, I would say that it&#x27;s a nice product,...</li>
            <li>Nice packaging.  </li>
            <li>makes (there are many good brands, Dr. Oz etc.).</li>
            <li>Especially right now in the winter time.</li>
            <li>The product is lightly scented with a pleasant flowery/citrusy aroma that is not at all intrusive.  </li>
            <li>As per most reports, it takes 2 months to start noticing benefits, so I will continue to update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I have to apply something on top.</li>
            <li>As per most reports, it takes 2 months to start noticing benefits, so I will continue to update.  </li>
            <li>so I have to apply something on top.</li>
            <li>I have been using SK-II Cellumination Aurabright for about three weeks and have been pleased with the the look of my skin.  </li>
            <li>The product has an elegant feel.</li>
            <li>That feeling passes, and I can&#x27;t tell you for sure if there is a long-term benefit.</li>
            <li>Interesting product,</li>
            <li>It has an eyedropper top</li>
            <li>Which I am sure also has helped my skin look better.</li>
            <li>I love this, as there is no possibility of contaminating the product.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t want to lose a precious drop</li>
            <li>I got much better results with products with vitamin C and hyaluronic acid like Life Essentials brand</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s practical as well with a built in eyedropper to dispense the product so you don&#x27;t use more than you need to.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this.</li>
            <li>It is smooth, more liquid than cream, and feels luxurious.</li>
            <li>Bottom line is:  if you are looking for light hydration and a softening primer that is gentle on the skin, I found that this was a good product</li>
            <li>My very fair-skinned face is over 70 years old, and I think, in very good shape...</li>
            <li>Bright, clear line free skin is what we all want and to strive for it is a legitimate goal.</li>
            <li>This essence is part of the SK-II line of products and is classified under &amp;#34;Radiance&amp;#34; and claims that it can give one wrinkle free and brighter skin if used regularly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth after applying this essence but also dries out</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth after applying this essence but also dries out</li>
            <li>It goes on quite smoothly and blends into my skin giving it a pearly appearance, but without the sparkles and glittery appearance that some illuminating products have.  </li>
            <li>And I was given an opportunity to try it free</li>
            <li>During this time I felt that SK-II sufficiently carried on the same purpose as Retin-A, which is great.</li>
            <li>It must have some kind of reflecting particles in it to diffuse light or something, or else how can it work so fast?  </li>
            <li>I will say, in general, good quality skin care products do provide a long-term benefit.</li>
            <li>The review written by ZenWoman was most helpful (she really did her homework!)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know, but the brightening effect gets better with consistent use.  </li>
            <li>It is fairly comparable to Retin-A in results but is priced just barely this side of $200 bucks and can be acquired without a prescription.</li>
            <li>It also pairs nicely under a light foundation ( I use Bare Minerals).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>or GFF is the main ingredient in this essence, many other sellers are selling GFF concentrate on Amazon, some products have great reviews.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s more info on Amazon and through internet searching about the SK-II line, but for the price I&#x27;d suggest they include better directions and a clearer statement of potential benefits.</li>
            <li>The packaging is lovely -- heavy glass in a teardrop shape that feels good in your hand and is stable on shelves -- this is one product you do not want to drop.</li>
            <li>The eye dropper in the lid gives you just the right amount of product, while keeping the product itself clean.</li>
            <li>I, personally, donâ€™t care much about the whole aging process, but it is something that bothers my wife to no end, and as we approach 30 it is becoming more and more noticeable just by the look, and this is something that just wrecks my wife.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Secret Key&amp;#34; was launched as &amp;#34;SK-II&amp;#34; in December 1980.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the success of their water based essence (not this product) that was called &amp;#34;Miracle Water&amp;#34;  they got noticed and P&amp;G acquired them.</li>
            <li>so I apply a natural moisturizer on top.</li>
            <li>so I apply a natural moisturizer on top.</li>
            <li>That is really not a problem as the SK-ll CAIE makes my skin feel smooth and pliable on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>Cellumination is pricey, but well worth it.</li>
            <li>My skin does not seem significantly smoother yet, and it&#x27;s definitely not any more radiant yet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin does not seem significantly smoother yet, and it&#x27;s definitely not any more radiant yet.</li>
            <li>The bottle feels weighty and high quality and the dropper worked just fine.  </li>
            <li>Some stopped right away thinking they were getting an acne attack</li>
            <li>so you can extract the right amount of product for application.  </li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant and light, hardly noticeable.  </li>
            <li>No change in making wrinkles less noticable, I am 52 with fair skin.</li>
            <li>so I want to start using something for my face on a more regular basis.</li>
            <li>essence has Nylon-12 higher up in the list</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re going from no serum or similar creams to this product you may see better results.</li>
            <li>Still using the same products on top of the essence.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going from no serum or similar creams to this product you may see better results.</li>
            <li>Still using the same products on top of the essence.</li>
            <li>It looks natural, which is important to me.  </li>
            <li>This product is really work!</li>
            <li>Even if the help has been to get me to get back into a better skincare routine.</li>
            <li>and I think the overall appearance of my face is better.  </li>
            <li>For me preservation is the issue, not so much the colorful mask I can paint on.  </li>
            <li>Interestingly these are the same possible side effects that many Retin-A users experience when first using that product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The packaging is not only lovely</li>
            <li>My wife was super excited for this, because &amp;#34;SK-II&amp;#34; is such a hot brand.</li>
            <li>I have pretty good skin for my age by just following a very simple regimen of cleansing, moisturizing with natural creams, and not using too much make up, taking vitamins and drinking adequate water.</li>
            <li>here is the real question: What are you willing to pay for this product?</li>
            <li>What I normally use is Retin-A .05% strength every two days to maintain a clear complexion and eliminate/prevent fine lines (I pay $70 a tube.)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say this did one positive thing for my skin, it certainly does not look illuminated at all.</li>
            <li>This information is from a large scale study of women between 40 and 60 - done by guess who - yes,</li>
            <li>My roscea certainly isn&#x27;t gone.</li>
            <li>but my sensitive skin and mildly inflamed body (I have autoimmune arthritis) make this promising solution off limits for this chicky.</li>
            <li>and it really does not take much of the product to make a positive difference in your skin.</li>
            <li>This serum has maintained that effect, but since it&#x27;s slightly drying, right now my skin does not seem any more radiant.</li>
            <li>This serum has maintained that effect, but since it&#x27;s slightly drying, right now my skin does not seem any more radiant.</li>
            <li>so naturally I had high hopes for it since I work on my skin full time.</li>
            <li>After much research and development, the strain of naturally-occurring yeast was isolated for use.</li>
            <li>but I really like the texture.  </li>
            <li>but I found that it was too much.  </li>
            <li>She hates it so much.  </li>
            <li>It takes two drops to cover my whole face.  </li>
            <li>It made my skin glow so much that I looked like</li>
            <li>Retin-A is $70 a tube or lower and can only be had via a prescription, however after one office visit refills can be typically filled with a phone call rather than a checkup.</li>
            <li>My confusion comes from the product packaging, which offers only this: &amp;#34;Place an appropriate amount of Essence on to palm .</li>
            <li>I am in my mid fifties and while I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles my skin is certainly not as tight or radiant as it used to be.  </li>
            <li>In addition I have problems from time to time with too much redness especially in my nose that sometimes blossoms in to full blown rosacea.  </li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to any scent other than fruit, so the &#x27;fresh light floral&#x27; just hit me.</li>
            <li>Wikipedia I read that this product line SK-II was born out of &amp;#34;Secret Key&amp;#34;, a skincare line developed by Japanese scientists during the 1970s who were looking into using more naturally derived ingredients.</li>
            <li>While observing workers at a sake brewery, they observed that elderly workers had wrinkled faces that showed their age, but their hands were smooth, clear and younger looking from years of submerging their hands in the fermented yeast.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I pulled out my Clarisonic (which I highly recommend) to wash my face each day.</li>
            <li>All in all, I highly recommend it, if you can afford it.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this one</li>
            <li>I use Benefit cosmetic products like their High Beam or Moon Beam.</li>
            <li>With just a little drop, this magic in a bottle works wonders on the skin.  </li>
            <li>My only fear is that when it is all gone sheâ€™s going to want another bottleâ€¦because that price isnâ€™t pretty!</li>
            <li>Smooth onto entire face and apply extra drops with  gently knuckling motion on your concerned area.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>Some further information I&#x27;ve read says that Niacinamide reacts with Vitamin C based serums (Hyaluronic Acid) and is not good for your face, in UV light of daytime it actually forms hydrogen peroxide, so until I research further, I will not be using my hyaluronic acid based moisturizer any more on top of this essence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but if it actually works then it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li>I normally reapply moisturizer during the day during the winter months.</li>
            <li>Having used some other serums I don&#x27;t see a huge difference yet.</li>
            <li>They have also branched out into various other essences, lotions, moisturizers etc given the success of the original products.</li>
            <li>This Cellumination essence is relatively new and placed under the &amp;#34;Radiance&amp;#34; category of products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>; and she was really disappointed seeing how wonderful the results seem to be for everyone else.</li>
            <li>It did not cause any adverse skin reactions such as acne, redness, or a rash---it just left my skin feeling soft and smooth with a hint of soft-focus effect.</li>
            <li>Long term use of good products will give you firm clear skin during your middle and later years, so it&#x27;s totally worth</li>
            <li>It applies smoothly, and there is a slight tingly feeling like you expect with an exfoliant.</li>
            <li>I also exfoliate regularly and use a mild facial peel weekly.  </li>
            <li>I am 54 and have been blessed with a good complexion in the peaches-and-cream vein, but I noticed my skin was feeling rough and looking a bit dull.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Some users said it was natural to get breakouts while the skin was &amp;</li>
            <li>I directly squeeze a drop on each cheek and pat in using just the finger</li>
            <li>Since becoming a parent I have been fairly lazy with my skin care routine.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I am in my early 50&#x27;s and have been using this product for a couple of weeks, applying it twice a day after cleansing and before moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>My skin has been brighter, more even toned, and less dry.</li>
            <li>Does Pitera initially cause the skin to break out and is this why Niacinamide is present in a higher concentration to minimize these breakouts?</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a pearly white lotion, with a high concentration of Pitera - the yeast strain that produces youthful skin.</li>
            <li>During the winter, I have been able to use it alone without other moisturizing products, but I can imagine if you have dry skin, this product might not be enough.</li>
            <li>I had spent a day without sunscreen, on a hot beach.  </li>
            <li>: I notice a slight smoothness in my skin, but nothing remarkable yet over other serums that I was using previously.</li>
            <li>: I notice a slight smoothness in my skin, but nothing remarkable yet over other serums that I was using previously.</li>
            <li>I have read some good reviews of this particular preparation, but this was a bad match for my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Often, these vendors give away several free products or extremely discounted products to garner those reviews so read all information carefully, especially as these are facial products.</li>
            <li>If I am to use this essence as my regular product I need to see bigger benefits to justify the high price.</li>
            <li>and it left it looking extra ruddy and feeling sore, tight, dry and generally like I had accidentally rubbed my face with a cat (I&#x27;m allergic to most cats).  </li>
            <li>Whatever the &amp;#34;secret key&amp;#34; is, it apparently didn&#x27;t work of her.</li>
            <li>Using just my basic moisturizer instead of my old nighttime routine.</li>
            <li>...scared me at first, but I was intrigued and curious enough to give it a try!  </li>
            <li>Your skin feels a little tighter right away.</li>
            <li>my skin doesn&#x27;t look like a Cover Girl advertisement; however,  the product accomplished what it claims and I prefer it to other products that I have tried that made similar claims.</li>
            <li>A little does go a long way and it is quickly absorbed into the skin with no greasy feel.  </li>
            <li>Endless summers spent swimming and waterskiing with little more than a slathering of cocoa butter on my face has left me with LOTS of sun damage and age spots.  </li>
            <li>But the high concentration of Niacinamide (Vitamin B3) caused me to wonder as it is the 2nd active ingredient after Pitera.</li>

            <li> &amp;#34;Secret Key&amp;#34; was launched as &amp;#34;SK-II&amp;#34; in December 1980.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the success of their water based essence (not this product) that was called &amp;#34;Miracle Water&amp;#34;  they got noticed and P&amp;G acquired them.</li>
            <li> so I apply a natural moisturizer on top.</li>
            <li> so I apply a natural moisturizer on top.</li>
            <li> That is really not a problem as the SK-ll CAIE makes my skin feel smooth and pliable on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> Cellumination is pricey, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> My skin does not seem significantly smoother yet, and it&#x27;s definitely not any more radiant yet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin does not seem significantly smoother yet, and it&#x27;s definitely not any more radiant yet.</li>
            <li> The bottle feels weighty and high quality and the dropper worked just fine.  </li>
            <li> Some stopped right away thinking they were getting an acne attack</li>
            <li> so you can extract the right amount of product for application.  </li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant and light, hardly noticeable.  </li>
            <li> No change in making wrinkles less noticable, I am 52 with fair skin.</li>
            <li> so I want to start using something for my face on a more regular basis.</li>
            <li> essence has Nylon-12 higher up in the list</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re going from no serum or similar creams to this product you may see better results.</li>
            <li> Still using the same products on top of the essence.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going from no serum or similar creams to this product you may see better results.</li>
            <li> Still using the same products on top of the essence.</li>
            <li> It looks natural, which is important to me.  </li>
            <li> This product is really work!</li>
            <li> Even if the help has been to get me to get back into a better skincare routine.</li>
            <li> and I think the overall appearance of my face is better.  </li>
            <li> For me preservation is the issue, not so much the colorful mask I can paint on.  </li>
            <li> Interestingly these are the same possible side effects that many Retin-A users experience when first using that product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The packaging is not only lovely</li>
            <li> My wife was super excited for this, because &amp;#34;SK-II&amp;#34; is such a hot brand.</li>
            <li> I have pretty good skin for my age by just following a very simple regimen of cleansing, moisturizing with natural creams, and not using too much make up, taking vitamins and drinking adequate water.</li>
            <li> here is the real question: What are you willing to pay for this product?</li>
            <li> What I normally use is Retin-A .05% strength every two days to maintain a clear complexion and eliminate/prevent fine lines (I pay $70 a tube.)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say this did one positive thing for my skin, it certainly does not look illuminated at all.</li>
            <li> This information is from a large scale study of women between 40 and 60 - done by guess who - yes,</li>
            <li> My roscea certainly isn&#x27;t gone.</li>
            <li> but my sensitive skin and mildly inflamed body (I have autoimmune arthritis) make this promising solution off limits for this chicky.</li>
            <li> and it really does not take much of the product to make a positive difference in your skin.</li>
            <li> This serum has maintained that effect, but since it&#x27;s slightly drying, right now my skin does not seem any more radiant.</li>
            <li> This serum has maintained that effect, but since it&#x27;s slightly drying, right now my skin does not seem any more radiant.</li>
            <li> so naturally I had high hopes for it since I work on my skin full time.</li>
            <li> After much research and development, the strain of naturally-occurring yeast was isolated for use.</li>
            <li> but I really like the texture.  </li>
            <li> but I found that it was too much.  </li>
            <li> She hates it so much.  </li>
            <li> It takes two drops to cover my whole face.  </li>
            <li> It made my skin glow so much that I looked like</li>
            <li> Retin-A is $70 a tube or lower and can only be had via a prescription, however after one office visit refills can be typically filled with a phone call rather than a checkup.</li>
            <li> My confusion comes from the product packaging, which offers only this: &amp;#34;Place an appropriate amount of Essence on to palm .</li>
            <li> I am in my mid fifties and while I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles my skin is certainly not as tight or radiant as it used to be.  </li>
            <li> In addition I have problems from time to time with too much redness especially in my nose that sometimes blossoms in to full blown rosacea.  </li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to any scent other than fruit, so the &#x27;fresh light floral&#x27; just hit me.</li>
            <li> Wikipedia I read that this product line SK-II was born out of &amp;#34;Secret Key&amp;#34;, a skincare line developed by Japanese scientists during the 1970s who were looking into using more naturally derived ingredients.</li>
            <li> While observing workers at a sake brewery, they observed that elderly workers had wrinkled faces that showed their age, but their hands were smooth, clear and younger looking from years of submerging their hands in the fermented yeast.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I pulled out my Clarisonic (which I highly recommend) to wash my face each day.</li>
            <li> All in all, I highly recommend it, if you can afford it.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this one</li>
            <li> I use Benefit cosmetic products like their High Beam or Moon Beam.</li>
            <li> With just a little drop, this magic in a bottle works wonders on the skin.  </li>
            <li> My only fear is that when it is all gone sheâ€™s going to want another bottleâ€¦because that price isnâ€™t pretty!</li>
            <li> Smooth onto entire face and apply extra drops with  gently knuckling motion on your concerned area.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> Some further information I&#x27;ve read says that Niacinamide reacts with Vitamin C based serums (Hyaluronic Acid) and is not good for your face, in UV light of daytime it actually forms hydrogen peroxide, so until I research further, I will not be using my hyaluronic acid based moisturizer any more on top of this essence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but if it actually works then it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I normally reapply moisturizer during the day during the winter months.</li>
            <li> Having used some other serums I don&#x27;t see a huge difference yet.</li>
            <li> They have also branched out into various other essences, lotions, moisturizers etc given the success of the original products.</li>
            <li> This Cellumination essence is relatively new and placed under the &amp;#34;Radiance&amp;#34; category of products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; and she was really disappointed seeing how wonderful the results seem to be for everyone else.</li>
            <li> It did not cause any adverse skin reactions such as acne, redness, or a rash---it just left my skin feeling soft and smooth with a hint of soft-focus effect.</li>
            <li> Long term use of good products will give you firm clear skin during your middle and later years, so it&#x27;s totally worth</li>
            <li> It applies smoothly, and there is a slight tingly feeling like you expect with an exfoliant.</li>
            <li> I also exfoliate regularly and use a mild facial peel weekly.  </li>
            <li> I am 54 and have been blessed with a good complexion in the peaches-and-cream vein, but I noticed my skin was feeling rough and looking a bit dull.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> Some users said it was natural to get breakouts while the skin was &amp;</li>
            <li> I directly squeeze a drop on each cheek and pat in using just the finger</li>
            <li> Since becoming a parent I have been fairly lazy with my skin care routine.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 50&#x27;s and have been using this product for a couple of weeks, applying it twice a day after cleansing and before moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> My skin has been brighter, more even toned, and less dry.</li>
            <li> Does Pitera initially cause the skin to break out and is this why Niacinamide is present in a higher concentration to minimize these breakouts?</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a pearly white lotion, with a high concentration of Pitera - the yeast strain that produces youthful skin.</li>
            <li> During the winter, I have been able to use it alone without other moisturizing products, but I can imagine if you have dry skin, this product might not be enough.</li>
            <li> I had spent a day without sunscreen, on a hot beach.  </li>
            <li> : I notice a slight smoothness in my skin, but nothing remarkable yet over other serums that I was using previously.</li>
            <li> : I notice a slight smoothness in my skin, but nothing remarkable yet over other serums that I was using previously.</li>
            <li> I have read some good reviews of this particular preparation, but this was a bad match for my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Often, these vendors give away several free products or extremely discounted products to garner those reviews so read all information carefully, especially as these are facial products.</li>
            <li> If I am to use this essence as my regular product I need to see bigger benefits to justify the high price.</li>
            <li> and it left it looking extra ruddy and feeling sore, tight, dry and generally like I had accidentally rubbed my face with a cat (I&#x27;m allergic to most cats).  </li>
            <li> Whatever the &amp;#34;secret key&amp;#34; is, it apparently didn&#x27;t work of her.</li>
            <li> Using just my basic moisturizer instead of my old nighttime routine.</li>
            <li> ...scared me at first, but I was intrigued and curious enough to give it a try!  </li>
            <li> Your skin feels a little tighter right away.</li>
            <li> my skin doesn&#x27;t look like a Cover Girl advertisement; however,  the product accomplished what it claims and I prefer it to other products that I have tried that made similar claims.</li>
            <li> A little does go a long way and it is quickly absorbed into the skin with no greasy feel.  </li>
            <li> Endless summers spent swimming and waterskiing with little more than a slathering of cocoa butter on my face has left me with LOTS of sun damage and age spots.  </li>
            <li> But the high concentration of Niacinamide (Vitamin B3) caused me to wonder as it is the 2nd active ingredient after Pitera.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m going to be honest here: This product is EXPENSIVE!</li>
            <li> When I went back to the product reviews for this essence on different makeup sites, I found that some users - roughly 20%-25% reported red bumps on the skin when starting to use this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;5 week update: At the 4 week mark I started getting some rough and dry patches on my cheeks near the chin and on my forehead.</li>
            <li> 5 week update: At the 4 week mark I started getting some rough and dry patches on my cheeks near the chin and on my forehead.</li>
            <li> and it was possible even for dry or combination skin people to get a breakout.</li>
            <li> After applying the white pearly liquid, my skin seems to have a coating that does not allow my moisturizer (cheap&#x3D;Ponds Dry Skin Cream) to sink in.  </li>
            <li> However, it is not giving me any confidence in buying this super expensive product in the future.</li>
            <li> Though I contest with some of my wife&#x27;s assessment (I think she does look like a covergirl with or without this stuff), I agree with the rest of it: After a recent bout of acne and skin changes due to pregnancy, I have been searching for a skincare product that would soften the look of my discolorations and also have some moisturizing benefits.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While using this product I suspended use of all my other facial products with the exception of my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have used several dark spot correctors over the years and the one made by Clinique has managed to fade them, up to a point.  </li>
            <li> My skin definitEly is brighter and less dry.</li>
            <li> Next I have the ingredients in this essence and my weekly updates will be down</li>
            <li> Other ingredients are listed below (at the end of the review) and include some ingredients found in similar essences from other brands to rejuvenate, hydrate and plump up the skin.</li>
            <li> but this is not particularly worrying as it is a filler that stays on the surface of the skin and produces &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34; skin.</li>
            <li> I am 36 with very dry skin.</li>
            <li> The only thing noticed were a few small red blotches (no bumps) that are finally disappearing.  </li>
            <li> Every one&#x27;s skin is a little different, so</li>
            <li> Although it increases skin cell circulation and prevents loss of water from skin, it is also used to treat breakouts, red bumps and uneven skin conditions.</li>
            <li> I do like the simple dropper type dispenser as you don&#x27;t waste any product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ingredients (the ingredients on package differ from those listed on website, some key ingredients like rice bran oil etc are now missing and some ingredients like prunus fruit extract are added):&lt;br /&gt;Water,</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not really a serum, gel, or cream</li>
            <li> However, it is not giving me any confidence in buying this super expensive product in the future.rom those listed on website, some key ingredients like rice bran oil etc are now missing and some ingredients like prunus fruit extract are added): Water, Galactomyces Ferment Filtrate (Pitera the miracle ingredient!),</li>
            <li> But I want to pick the right one that I can use over time without any ill effects</li>
            <li> After using this product for a few days I notice my skin is definitely less red.  </li>
            <li> SK-II is a serum and does require a follow up with moisturizer, otherwise your skin will feel tight and dry.</li>
            <li> In 2006, there was some controversy about some unsafe ingredients in the formulation and their formulation has since changed from what I can tell from reviews on other sites.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking at other ingredient lists for some other essences (L&#x27;Occitane, L&#x27;Oreal, Juice Beauty etc.)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Moving on, other ingredients are glycols, silicone based ingredients, nylon, etc.</li>
            <li> As per the product page, any longer term benefits will not be visible before 14 days and as per other users at about 2 month mark.</li>
            <li> I tried some other high-end moisturizers and primers, then I was given this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking of ditching some of the other products I use on my face and just trying the SK-II line.  </li>
            <li> The temperatures are a bit warmer now and the rest of my body is less itchy and dry, so I am not sure why my face is getting dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> The temperatures are a bit warmer now and the rest of my body is less itchy and dry, so I am not sure why my face is getting dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> Cellumination didn&#x27;t have a negative reaction with my skin, only positives.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not thrilled with rubbing my palms together and applying the product this way, but it&#x27;s acceptable, and I can understand that using your palms makes it less likely that you will pull the skin down as you might if you used your finger tips.  </li>
            <li> I had it on less than 5 minutes before wasting my face again...</li>
            <li> I notice a slight dryness after applying serum</li>

            <li> You need only apply a very small amount of this lotion, just two small drops, so a small bottle goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> But unfortunately it didn&#x27;t live up to it&#x27;s reputation.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I am a little scared as I have started using this essence as I don&#x27;t want to get a breakout.</li>
            <li> Illuminating Essence is a little tricky to evaluate.  </li>
            <li> In fact I usually spend on creams, lotions, shampoos and conditioners what other women spend on makeup.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Given that this is an expensive product line that I&#x27;ve seen at Amazon, Sephora, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom and Bloomingdales and if I remember correctly recently at Costco, I was curious to find out some history and benefits before using it on my face.</li>
            <li> Stay tuned for another update after a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Sheâ€™s been using this Cellumination Aurabright for a few weeks now, and she swears by it.  </li>
            <li> Within just a few days, literally, you could see the difference in her skin tone and the smoothness of her face.  </li>
            <li> The serum is administered through a dropper, and you need just a few drops at a time.</li>
            <li> Also because I was a Retin-A user I believe that had preconditioned my skin for using SK-II since I have not experienced any of the possible side effects: redness, bumps and soreness which the product warns about.</li>
            <li> After 30 days of use, I see a slight reduction in the prominence of some age/sun pigmentation, but otherwise I can&#x27;t say my skin looks brighter -- but dull skin was not a problem for me.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this essence at least once a day after I cleanse my face, usually in the night but sometimes during the day too, so I am not sure where the dryness is coming from.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was very excited to try this. Sk-II has a wonderful reputation in the beauty industry. I am 36 with very dry skin. I recently had a baby and the fluctuating hormones is giving me some issues with skin brightness. I washed my face and placed this on... But the scent starting triggering my migraine. I am very sensitive to any scent other than fruit, so the &#x27;fresh light floral&#x27; just hit me. I had it on less than 5 minutes before wasting my face again... And my skin was perfected. In 5 minutes. Wow. My skin was hydrated smooth and perfect. It glowed. I am trying to get used to the smell , because this is a miracle. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My wife was super excited for this, because &amp;#34;SK-II&amp;#34; is such a hot brand. But unfortunately it didn&#x27;t live up to it&#x27;s reputation. Instead of smoothing out her face and vanishing her age, it made her skin red and bumpy. Whatever the &amp;#34;secret key&amp;#34; is, it apparently didn&#x27;t work of her. She says it was actually somewhat painful on her face when applied. She kept at it, hoping that her skin would get used to it and she would start seeing some of that miracle, but no luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This maybe a case of &amp;#34;everyone&#x27;s skin is different,&amp;#34; and she was really disappointed seeing how wonderful the results seem to be for everyone else. Unfortunately, this just didn&#x27;t work it&#x27;s miracles on her.</li>
            <li> This essence is part of the SK-II line of products and is classified under &amp;#34;Radiance&amp;#34; and claims that it can give one wrinkle free and brighter skin if used regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given that this is an expensive product line that I&#x27;ve seen at Amazon, Sephora, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom and Bloomingdales and if I remember correctly recently at Costco, I was curious to find out some history and benefits before using it on my face. I have pretty good skin for my age by just following a very simple regimen of cleansing, moisturizing with natural creams, and not using too much make up, taking vitamins and drinking adequate water. Now as I age, I have seen some reduction in elasticity of skin so I want to start using something for my face on a more regular basis. But I want to pick the right one that I can use over time without any ill effects or I&#x27;d rather go &amp;#34;au naturale&amp;#34;. So bear with me as I take you through my process of research about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Wikipedia I read that this product line SK-II was born out of &amp;#34;Secret Key&amp;#34;, a skincare line developed by Japanese scientists during the 1970s who were looking into using more naturally derived ingredients. While observing workers at a sake brewery, they observed that elderly workers had wrinkled faces that showed their age, but their hands were smooth, clear and younger looking from years of submerging their hands in the fermented yeast. After much research and development, the strain of naturally-occurring yeast was isolated for use. &amp;#34;Secret Key&amp;#34; was launched as &amp;#34;SK-II&amp;#34; in December 1980.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the success of their water based essence (not this product) that was called &amp;#34;Miracle Water&amp;#34;  they got noticed and P&amp;G acquired them.

This Cellumination essence is relatively new and placed under the &amp;#34;Radiance&amp;#34; category of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a pearly white lotion, with a high concentration of Pitera - the yeast strain that produces youthful skin. Other ingredients are listed below (at the end of the review) and include some ingredients found in similar essences from other brands to rejuvenate, hydrate and plump up the skin. I&#x27;ve been looking at other ingredient lists for some other essences (L&#x27;Occitane, L&#x27;Oreal, Juice Beauty etc.) and find some common ingredients but the composition is different in all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This essence has Nylon-12 higher up in the list but this is not particularly worrying as it is a filler that stays on the surface of the skin and produces &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34; skin. But the high concentration of Niacinamide (Vitamin B3) caused me to wonder as it is the 2nd active ingredient after Pitera. Although it increases skin cell circulation and prevents loss of water from skin, it is also used to treat breakouts, red bumps and uneven skin conditions. This information is from a large scale study of women between 40 and 60 - done by guess who - yes, P&amp;G.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When I went back to the product reviews for this essence on different makeup sites, I found that some users - roughly 20%-25% reported red bumps on the skin when starting to use this product. Some stopped right away thinking they were getting an acne attack but others persisted and after some time the breakouts went away. Does Pitera initially cause the skin to break out and is this why Niacinamide is present in a higher concentration to minimize these breakouts? Some users said it was natural to get breakouts while the skin was &amp;#34;getting used&amp;#34; to Pitera and it was possible even for dry or combination skin people to get a breakout. Hmmmmm. NOTE: Some further information I&#x27;ve read says that Niacinamide reacts with Vitamin C based serums (Hyaluronic Acid) and is not good for your face, in UV light of daytime it actually forms hydrogen peroxide, so until I research further, I will not be using my hyaluronic acid based moisturizer any more on top of this essence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also some reporting that there are breakouts if you stop using the essence. But then again, others said they didn&#x27;t get them. Every one&#x27;s skin is a little different, so I don&#x27;t know what will happen if I stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving on, other ingredients are glycols, silicone based ingredients, nylon, etc. that are all used as plumpers, fillers and hydrate skin. I have to admit I am a little scared as I have started using this essence as I don&#x27;t want to get a breakout. I notice a smoothness and don&#x27;t see a breakout yet but I am not using it in the night as I want to let my skin breathe. Having used some other serums I don&#x27;t see a huge difference yet. I do like the simple dropper type dispenser as you don&#x27;t waste any product. I directly squeeze a drop on each cheek and pat in using just the finger tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review/rating will be updated upon any progress. As per the product page, any longer term benefits will not be visible before 14 days and as per other users at about 2 month mark. If I am to use this essence as my regular product I need to see bigger benefits to justify the high price. Given that it will probably last 3-4 months, it is still $40 per month. I need to see the radiance that allows me to stop using any powders or foundation to even out my skin tone, I could then consider buying this pricey product on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pitera or GFF is the main ingredient in this essence, many other sellers are selling GFF concentrate on Amazon, some products have great reviews. Often, these vendors give away several free products or extremely discounted products to garner those reviews so read all information carefully, especially as these are facial products. Next I have the ingredients in this essence and my weekly updates will be down below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients (the ingredients on package differ from those listed on website, some key ingredients like rice bran oil etc are now missing and some ingredients like prunus fruit extract are added):&lt;br /&gt;Water, Galactomyces Ferment Filtrate (Pitera the miracle ingredient!), Niacinamide, Butylene Glycol, Triethylhexanoin, glycerine, Nylon-12, Pentylene Glycol,Phytosteryl Lauroyl Glutamate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Boron Nitride, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride,  Panthenol, PEG-20 Sorbitan Cocoate, Mica, Titanium Dioxide, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Phenoxyethanol, PEG-11 Mehtyl Ehter Dimethicone, Polyacyrlamide, Benzyl Alcohol, Undecylenoyl Phenylalanine, Aminomethyl Propanol, C-13 14 Isoparaffin, Disodium EDTA, Hexyldecanol, Sodium Benzoate, Xantham gum, Laureth 7, Parfum, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Methylparaben, Prunus Mume Fruit Extract, Limonene, Citronellol, Tocopherol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 week update: I did not get a breakout yet, and have switched to using 2 times daily - in morning and at night before bed. I notice a slight dryness after applying serum so I apply a natural moisturizer on top. In the day time I apply serum, moisturizer and some powder. The serum caused a slight redness on my cheeks so I have to apply powder to even out the tone. My skin does not seem significantly smoother yet, and it&#x27;s definitely not any more radiant yet.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re going from no serum or similar creams to this product you may see better results. I had been using another serum lately, that is just 1/5th the price of this serum so my skin had already started feeling smoother. This serum has maintained that effect, but since it&#x27;s slightly drying, right now my skin does not seem any more radiant. Stay tuned for another update after a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 week update: I notice a slight smoothness in my skin, but nothing remarkable yet over other serums that I was using previously. There have been no breakouts andno redness. Immediately after application my skin feels smoother and plumper but I need that to last through the day to show me that there is an actual difference in my skin. As per most reports, it takes 2 months to start noticing benefits, so I will continue to update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 week update: At the 4 week mark I started getting some rough and dry patches on my cheeks near the chin and on my forehead. I have been using this essence at least once a day after I cleanse my face, usually in the night but sometimes during the day too, so I am not sure where the dryness is coming from. I have not changed anything else. Still using the same products on top of the essence. The temperatures are a bit warmer now and the rest of my body is less itchy and dry, so I am not sure why my face is getting dry and flaky. My skin feels smooth after applying this essence but also dries out so I have to apply something on top. I will continue to use and hope this flaky skin clears away. However, it is not giving me any confidence in buying this super expensive product in the future.rom those listed on website, some key ingredients like rice bran oil etc are now missing and some ingredients like prunus fruit extract are added): Water, Galactomyces Ferment Filtrate (Pitera the miracle ingredient!), Niacinamide, Butylene Glycol, Triethylhexanoin, glycerine, Nylon-12, Pentylene Glycol,Phytosteryl Lauroyl Glutamate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Boron Nitride, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride,  Panthenol, PEG-20 Sorbitan Cocoate, Mica, Titanium Dioxide, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Phenoxyethanol, PEG-11 Mehtyl Ehter Dimethicone, Polyacyrlamide, Benzyl Alcohol, Undecylenoyl Phenylalanine, Aminomethyl Propanol, C-13 14 Isoparaffin, Disodium EDTA, Hexyldecanol, Sodium Benzoate, Xantham gum, Laureth 7, Parfum, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Methylparaben, Prunus Mume Fruit Extract, Limonene, Citronellol, Tocopherol.  1 week update: I did not get a breakout yet, and have switched to using 2 times daily - in morning and at night before bed.

            <li> Though I contest with some of my wife&#x27;s assessment (I think she does look like a covergirl with or without this stuff), I agree with the rest of it: After a recent bout of acne and skin changes due to pregnancy, I have been searching for a skincare product that would soften the look of my discolorations and also have some moisturizing benefits.  I tried some other high-end moisturizers and primers, then I was given this product.  I have been using SK-II Cellumination Aurabright for about three weeks and have been pleased with the the look of my skin.  I have combination skin that is acne -prone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not really a serum, gel, or cream but I really like the texture.  It goes on quite smoothly and blends into my skin giving it a pearly appearance, but without the sparkles and glittery appearance that some illuminating products have.  It looks natural, which is important to me.  During the winter, I have been able to use it alone without other moisturizing products, but I can imagine if you have dry skin, this product might not be enough. It did not cause any adverse skin reactions such as acne, redness, or a rash---it just left my skin feeling soft and smooth with a hint of soft-focus effect. I have used it alone with some translucent powder and lip gloss on days I didn&#x27;t feel like wearing makeup. It also pairs nicely under a light foundation ( I use Bare Minerals).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not a miracle product that you might expect for the price tag-- my skin doesn&#x27;t look like a Cover Girl advertisement; however,  the product accomplished what it claims and I prefer it to other products that I have tried that made similar claims. Bottom line is:  if you are looking for light hydration and a softening primer that is gentle on the skin, I found that this was a good product and I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> This product is really work! I use this for one month and my skin obviously became lighter! Love it!</li>
            <li> This is a liquid skin care product. The product has an elegant feel. It applies smoothly, and there is a slight tingly feeling like you expect with an exfoliant. There is an immediate result. Your skin feels a little tighter right away. That feeling passes, and I can&#x27;t tell you for sure if there is a long-term benefit. I will say, in general, good quality skin care products do provide a long-term benefit. I have been using Estee Lauder skin care products for about 40 years, and I have very nice skin. Long term use of good products will give you firm clear skin during your middle and later years, so it&#x27;s totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed by the pearlescent bottle. The eye dropper in the lid gives you just the right amount of product, while keeping the product itself clean. You don&#x27;t have to touch it with your fingers. Good idea</li>
            <li> Review from wife Barbara:  I never use face products like SK-ll Cellumination Aurabright, but this time I decided to take a chance!  My very fair-skinned face is over 70 years old, and I think, in very good shape...thank goodness for good genes.  This product comes in a nice glass bottle with a rubber dropper in the cap for applying 1 or 2 drops. The scent is pleasant and light, hardly noticeable.  One week has gone by and I cannot see any noticeable difference using this Illuminating Essence (no glowing from within...yet!).  The only thing noticed were a few small red blotches (no bumps) that are finally disappearing.  After applying the white pearly liquid, my skin seems to have a coating that does not allow my moisturizer (cheap&#x3D;Ponds Dry Skin Cream) to sink in.  That is really not a problem as the SK-ll CAIE makes my skin feel smooth and pliable on it&#x27;s own. If anything, I would say that it&#x27;s a nice product,... pricey,...and might be helpful for others.  PS:  The review written by ZenWoman was most helpful (she really did her homework!)...scared me at first, but I was intrigued and curious enough to give it a try!  Giving it 3 stars for the same reason as her.  Interesting product, but I&#x27;m not totally convinced that it is such a miracle, especially for me!</li>
            <li> After using this serum for 2 weeks, there is a noticeable difference to the texture of my skin.  I am in my late 30s and my skin doesn&#x27;t have severe signs of aging, however, I am noticing I was loosing some elasticity in my skin.  Cellumination has made my skin softer and tighter.&lt;br /&gt;I admit I was hesitant to try this because my skin is acne prone and any changes in my skin routine will cause breakouts.  Cellumination didn&#x27;t have a negative reaction with my skin, only positives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cellumination&#x27;s iridescent bottle is genius.  It has an eyedropper top so you can extract the right amount of product for application.  There is no wasting and I can use as sparingly as I need.  The directions do say to use up to 2 droppers of product but I found that it was too much.  A little does go a long way and it is quickly absorbed into the skin with no greasy feel.  Cellumination is pricey, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> SK-ll Cellumination Aurabright  Illuminating Essence is a little tricky to evaluate.  After 30 days of use, I see a slight reduction in the prominence of some age/sun pigmentation, but otherwise I can&#x27;t say my skin looks brighter -- but dull skin was not a problem for me.  My confusion comes from the product packaging, which offers only this: &amp;#34;Place an appropriate amount of Essence on to palm . Smooth onto entire face and apply extra drops with  gently knuckling motion on your concerned area.&amp;#34;  That&#x27;s it - no promises of what using this product will produce.  There&#x27;s more info on Amazon and through internet searching about the SK-II line, but for the price I&#x27;d suggest they include better directions and a clearer statement of potential benefits.</li>
            <li> So, aging sucks, but it happens.  I, personally, donâ€™t care much about the whole aging process, but it is something that bothers my wife to no end, and as we approach 30 it is becoming more and more noticeable just by the look, and this is something that just wrecks my wife.  She hates it so much.  Sheâ€™s been using this Cellumination Aurabright for a few weeks now, and she swears by it.  Within just a few days, literally, you could see the difference in her skin tone and the smoothness of her face.  With just a little drop, this magic in a bottle works wonders on the skin.  My only fear is that when it is all gone sheâ€™s going to want another bottleâ€¦because that price isnâ€™t pretty!</li>
            <li> My skin has taken a lot of damage in the 55 years that I&#x27;ve worn it.  Endless summers spent swimming and waterskiing with little more than a slathering of cocoa butter on my face has left me with LOTS of sun damage and age spots.  I have used several dark spot correctors over the years and the one made by Clinique has managed to fade them, up to a point.  I also exfoliate regularly and use a mild facial peel weekly.  Sadly, even after all that my skin still looks dull and uneven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Illuminating serum somehow makes my skin look brighter, as in glowing, even after just one use.  It must have some kind of reflecting particles in it to diffuse light or something, or else how can it work so fast?  I don&#x27;t know, but the brightening effect gets better with consistent use.  I can tell a difference when I&#x27;m in a hurry and don&#x27;t put it on because my skin looks dull and lifeless.  I&#x27;m thinking of ditching some of the other products I use on my face and just trying the SK-II line.  Sure it&#x27;s expensive but if it actually works then it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li> SK-II Cellumination is a luxurious feeling serum. My skin has been brighter, more even toned, and less dry. Since becoming a parent I have been fairly lazy with my skin care routine. I started to use just a face wipe at night instead of soap and water. Using just my basic moisturizer instead of my old nighttime routine. When I recieved the SK-II Cellumination I decided that I needed to step up my game. I pulled out my Clarisonic (which I highly recommend) to wash my face each day. I started to take time with my with my skincare routine. Applying the SK-II Cellumination before applying my moisturizer.  You use the dropper to get a a drop or two of the serum out of the bottle. The serum is a white pearly color. It is smooth, more liquid than cream, and feels luxurious. It takes two drops to cover my whole face.  Rub it between my fingers and apply over my entire face. I have rosacea and dry skin. Especially right now in the winter time. Since I started using this product a month ago by skin tone has evened out some. My roscea certainly isn&#x27;t gone. My skin definitEly is brighter and less dry. I normally reapply moisturizer during the day during the winter months. I haven&#x27;t had to do that since using the Cellumination. I don&#x27;t know if this is a miracle product, but it has helped. Even if the help has been to get me to get back into a better skincare routine. Which I am sure also has helped my skin look better.</li>
            <li> I am 54 and have been blessed with a good complexion in the peaches-and-cream vein, but I noticed my skin was feeling rough and looking a bit dull. I have used quality skin creams since my 20&#x27;s (most often Clinique and Lancome), so I was a bit skeptical that this could make any difference in the condition of my skin. I was pleasantly surprised. My skin seemed smoother within days, and after three weeks of use I am convinced that my complexion looks brighter and fresher (although when I asked my husband if he noticed this he just seemed confused -- I&#x27;ll put that down to the &amp;#34;y&amp;#34; chromosome, though, not the efficacy of this product). The packaging is lovely -- heavy glass in a teardrop shape that feels good in your hand and is stable on shelves -- this is one product you do not want to drop. The serum is administered through a dropper, and you need just a few drops at a time. I love this, as there is no possibility of contaminating the product. I&#x27;m not thrilled with rubbing my palms together and applying the product this way, but it&#x27;s acceptable, and I can understand that using your palms makes it less likely that you will pull the skin down as you might if you used your finger tips.  The product is lightly scented with a pleasant flowery/citrusy aroma that is not at all intrusive.  All in all, I highly recommend it, if you can afford it.</li>
            <li> Yes, this made my skin glow.  It made my skin glow so much that I looked like I had spent a day without sunscreen, on a hot beach.  I have read some good reviews of this particular preparation, but this was a bad match for my sensitive skin and it left it looking extra ruddy and feeling sore, tight, dry and generally like I had accidentally rubbed my face with a cat (I&#x27;m allergic to most cats).  Not for me.  The positives?  Nice packaging.  The bottle feels weighty and high quality and the dropper worked just fine.  I had high hopes for this one but my sensitive skin and mildly inflamed body (I have autoimmune arthritis) make this promising solution off limits for this chicky.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid fifties and while I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles my skin is certainly not as tight or radiant as it used to be.  In addition I have problems from time to time with too much redness especially in my nose that sometimes blossoms in to full blown rosacea.  After using this product for a few days I notice my skin is definitely less red.  It also feels tighter and I think the overall appearance of my face is better.  I like the eyedropper design of the applicator since at this price you don&#x27;t want to lose a precious drop and it really does not take much of the product to make a positive difference in your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this liberally twice a day AM and PM for about 20 days now and If anything my skin is dryer and a little broken out. I can&#x27;t say this did one positive thing for my skin, it certainly does not look illuminated at all. No change in making wrinkles less noticable, I am 52 with fair skin. A lot of money for no results. I don&#x27;t recommend this. I got much better results with products with vitamin C and hyaluronic acid like Life Essentials brand makes (there are many good brands, Dr. Oz etc.). If I need illuminatin I use Benefit cosmetic products like their High Beam or Moon Beam. Way cheaper and great results.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m going to be honest here: This product is EXPENSIVE! And I was given an opportunity to try it free so naturally I had high hopes for it since I work on my skin full time. In fact I usually spend on creams, lotions, shampoos and conditioners what other women spend on makeup. For me preservation is the issue, not so much the colorful mask I can paint on.  Therefore, before I even tried this product I had/have very good skin and I am 46 years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While using this product I suspended use of all my other facial products with the exception of my moisturizer. SK-II is a serum and does require a follow up with moisturizer, otherwise your skin will feel tight and dry. What I normally use is Retin-A .05% strength every two days to maintain a clear complexion and eliminate/prevent fine lines (I pay $70 a tube.) I used one dime sized dab of this product which is fluid enough to cover my face every day  for 30 days. During this time I felt that SK-II sufficiently carried on the same purpose as Retin-A, which is great. Bright, clear line free skin is what we all want and to strive for it is a legitimate goal. Also because I was a Retin-A user I believe that had preconditioned my skin for using SK-II since I have not experienced any of the possible side effects: redness, bumps and soreness which the product warns about. Interestingly these are the same possible side effects that many Retin-A users experience when first using that product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But here is the real question: What are you willing to pay for this product? It is fairly comparable to Retin-A in results but is priced just barely this side of $200 bucks and can be acquired without a prescription. Retin-A is $70 a tube or lower and can only be had via a prescription, however after one office visit refills can be typically filled with a phone call rather than a checkup. Unfortunately great skin can be pricey.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 50&#x27;s and have been using this product for a couple of weeks, applying it twice a day after cleansing and before moisturizing.  You need only apply a very small amount of this lotion, just two small drops, so a small bottle goes a long way.  I haven&#x27;t experienced any redness or breakouts like some have reported.  My skin does feel tighter and the overall appearance does seem a bit brighter.  The packaging is not only lovely but it&#x27;s practical as well with a built in eyedropper to dispense the product so you don&#x27;t use more than you need to.</li>
