            <li>It is a very strong scent and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more of a fan of perfumes that aren&#x27;t overpowering and this one fits nicely in that group.</li>
            <li>Cleopatra perfume has a very strong patchouli/amber scent that masks the grapefruit scent I&#x27;ve grown to love.  </li>
            <li>Classic,  beautiful scent..</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s for sure my scent</li>
            <li>and I fell in love with the frangrance.  </li>
            <li>shipping free is a plus!  </li>
            <li>I received a sample of this from Sephora and fell in love.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking at it because you love the lotion, you should keep looking.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Light and warm....</li>
            <li>My favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li>Lovely.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the most appealing fragrance for me.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>So many compliments and asks about the name.</li>
            <li>Love this scent and get many compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love love love the smell.</li>
            <li>a very clean scent with exotic tones.</li>
            <li>With any scent, it becomes much more accentuated with the mixture of your sweat and musk, which is fine</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own, without the expectation of the fresh grapefruit scent, this is not a fragrance I would wear.  </li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on how clean it smells.  </li>
            <li>but I can easily recommend this perfume to those looking for something not too fragrant that still makes an impression.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of the Tocca Cleopatra Hand Cream.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a sophisticated but fun and flirty scent.</li>
            <li>This perfume has a very unique, clean and fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Kind of a classic fragrance.</li>
            <li>Great perfume...soft light natural smell great for everyday use</li>
            <li>I love this perfume, thanks for the fast shipping, and item exactly as described!!!!</li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed with it at all.  </li>
            <li>I first smelled this perfume in Savannah GA and fell in love.</li>
            <li>I first found this fragrance while on vacation and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s nice to be able to buy it online--before I&#x27;ve only seen it at Anthropologie.</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>fresh and somehow a bit old fashioned....makes me think of a 1920&#x27;s scent with a lovely bottle and decorative top.</li>
            <li>Seems to fade rather quickly, thus...4 stars rather than 5.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t pinpoint the smell, just clean, fresh, light and not irritating</li>
            <li>At first I could not smell the citrus in it, but then after a while, I began to actually smell the grapefruit in it after using it more and more.</li>
            <li>any case, I would not just buy this perfume without smelling it first!</li>
            <li>Sexy, but soft.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is cut in a retro style, a callback to when bottle design was just as important as insuring that a particular perfume&#x27;s scent was just right.</li>
            <li>Very feminine but not too sweet.</li>
            <li>Cleopatra is one of my &amp;#34;everyday favorites&amp;#34;.  Grapefruit and currant upfront, jasmine and tuberose and peach in the middle...drying down to gorgeous vanilla/patchouli/amber.  </li>
            <li>I love the feminine, beautiful, and unique smell--it&#x27;s fun to wear a perfume that not many other people know!</li>
            <li>What you get with this perfume is a light intensity scent that is both subtle and feminine; a floral themed scent that is pleasant in every way.</li>
            <li>the shipping was exactly in the time period mentioned.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this perfume!!</li>
            <li>Had I just smelled this perfume first</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>But I love this scent, and it was my first \\&quot;Big Girl\\&quot; perfume purchase.</li>
            <li>But everytime it gets really hot</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Tocca has several other scents that are nice as well as Cleopatra, but this one will always be my favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m taking that back to Nordstroms, too strong, and didn&#x27;t get any compliments.  </li>
            <li>Great scent, soft but does not last long.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore the citrusy scent.  </li>
            <li>, Cleopatra is a reasonable fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Just a light spray last all day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really tricksy marketing packaging they did there.</li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY</li>
            <li>, I use pure lavender oil dabbed onto my skin too, and that not only mixed well, but personalizes the scent even more.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I like wood/green/light flowers...and the only fruits I can really stand</li>

            <li> I like wood/green/light flowers...and the only fruits I can really stand</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and I always get compliments.</li>
            <li> It is not particularly long-lasting if applied to your skin unfortunately, I&#x27;ve had other \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot; perfumes that linger better.</li>
            <li> And although the other reviews say that the scent doesn&#x27;t last long, I haven&#x27;t noticed that, and I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for three years now.</li>
            <li> It is not overwhelming, thick, or heavy like so many perfumes out there.</li>
            <li> People can be too polite to say anything, so I often wonder if it is too overpowering or not -- I really don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> that even though the bottle is round, I realized that the contents inside only fill up half the space inside.</li>
            <li> But as a person who loves a less &amp;#34;flowery&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;juicy fruit&amp;#34; scent...</li>
            <li> you like a slightly spicy scent that lasts all day</li>
            <li> I feel like that is completely missing from the Cleopatra Eau de Parfum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Feminine and not too heavy.  </li>
            <li> Even though it is on the expensive side, I go through one bottle in about a year&#x27;s time, which doesn&#x27;t seem too extravagant to me.</li>
            <li> I am sad</li>

            <li> Cleopatra is one of my &amp;#34;everyday favorites&amp;#34;.  Grapefruit and currant upfront, jasmine and tuberose and peach in the middle...drying down to gorgeous vanilla/patchouli/amber.  I only wish it would last longer.  Seems to fade rather quickly, thus...4 stars rather than 5.  But as a person who loves a less &amp;#34;flowery&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;juicy fruit&amp;#34; scent...this is great.  I like wood/green/light flowers...and the only fruits I can really stand are the ones in this!  Not for teenagers, I&#x27;d think...this is a womanly scent.  Sexy, but soft.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I just love this perfume! It&#x27;s for sure my scent but they do carry others as well. All are good.</li>
            <li> The perfume is amazing as always!  I get compliments all the time and the scent lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  One of my co-workers wears it and I fell in love with the frangrance.  So beautiful.  My daughter loved it too.  Smells like your on a tropical vacation.</li>
            <li> Classic,  beautiful scent..</li>
            <li> the parfum is WONDERFUL!!!  the shipping was exactly in the time period mentioned.  shipping free is a plus!  will order again!!!!!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter.  She&#x27;s happy, so I&#x27;m happy.  Kind of a classic fragrance.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this from Sephora and fell in love. This is a great scent. I tend to like floral scents (as opposed to citrus for example). It&#x27;s a sophisticated but fun and flirty scent. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite perfume. It is not overwhelming, thick, or heavy like so many perfumes out there. I love the feminine, beautiful, and unique smell--it&#x27;s fun to wear a perfume that not many other people know! And although the other reviews say that the scent doesn&#x27;t last long, I haven&#x27;t noticed that, and I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for three years now. Even though it is on the expensive side, I go through one bottle in about a year&#x27;s time, which doesn&#x27;t seem too extravagant to me. Just my thoughts. And it&#x27;s nice to be able to buy it online--before I&#x27;ve only seen it at Anthropologie. I highly recommend this perfume!!</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of the Tocca Cleopatra Hand Cream.  I absolutely adore the citrusy scent.  I feel like that is completely missing from the Cleopatra Eau de Parfum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cleopatra perfume has a very strong patchouli/amber scent that masks the grapefruit scent I&#x27;ve grown to love.  Without the citrus, I find this fragrance to be disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On it&#x27;s own, without the expectation of the fresh grapefruit scent, this is not a fragrance I would wear.  Had I just smelled this perfume first, I don&#x27;t think I would ever have tried the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to like fruity, floral, and woodsy scents, and I wouldn&#x27;t place Cleopatra in any of those categories.  I also felt like the scent profile didn&#x27;t change on me throughout the day and I never got any of the lighter scents that I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like a slightly spicy scent that lasts all day, Cleopatra is a reasonable fragrance.  If you&#x27;re looking at it because you love the lotion, you should keep looking.</li>
            <li> The best.  Have been using this perfume for years.  Always, daily, get compliments on what I&#x27;m wearing.  However, lasts longer sprayed on your clothing than you body.  Love this stuff.  It&#x27;s my signature scent.  I did recently purchase Madamosele Coco Channel.  I&#x27;m taking that back to Nordstroms, too strong, and didn&#x27;t get any compliments.  I guess if it isn&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift and got good feedback</li>
            <li> This was a great price for this perfume.  It was a gift and I was not disappointed with it at all.  Qualtiy was great.</li>
            <li> Light and warm....a very clean scent with exotic tones. Just a light spray last all day. Good for all seasons.</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance. Light and beautiful. Very feminine but not too sweet. Lovely. And this is the best price, with very fast shipping. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Smells SO good. It is a very strong scent and lasts all day. It smells so good that I could bathe in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a repeat buyer on this product, since my wife loves the smell.  I&#x27;d recommend it for others to try as well.</li>
            <li> I first smelled this perfume in Savannah GA and fell in love. You know how when you find a fragrance that causes you to keep putting your wrist up to your nose just to get a whiff, that&#x27;s how this is......&lt;br /&gt;Tocca has several other scents that are nice as well as Cleopatra, but this one will always be my favorite.</li>
            <li> This perfume has a very unique, clean and fresh scent. It lasts a long time and I always get compliments. Cleopatra is one of my signature perfumes.</li>
            <li> Great perfume...soft light natural smell great for everyday use</li>
            <li> Love it! My favorite!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume smell. It is best sprayed on clothes, because it lingers on fabric a lot better. It is not particularly long-lasting if applied to your skin unfortunately, I&#x27;ve had other \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot; perfumes that linger better. But it mixes the best with my own scent and body. At first I could not smell the citrus in it, but then after a while, I began to actually smell the grapefruit in it after using it more and more. I am sad that even though the bottle is round, I realized that the contents inside only fill up half the space inside. It&#x27;s a really tricksy marketing packaging they did there. But I love this scent, and it was my first \\&quot;Big Girl\\&quot; perfume purchase. With any scent, it becomes much more accentuated with the mixture of your sweat and musk, which is fine, I use pure lavender oil dabbed onto my skin too, and that not only mixed well, but personalizes the scent even more. But everytime it gets really hot and I sweat a lot, its like my body emits some kind of scent aura. People can be too polite to say anything, so I often wonder if it is too overpowering or not -- I really don&#x27;t know. I suppose that&#x27;s a question I should ask my friends about....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, I would not just buy this perfume without smelling it first! All scents are very personal, I would try to find it in store and sample it before purchasing. I found it at a local Urban Outfitters and Sephora before I finally made up my mind about buying this!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, thanks for the fast shipping, and item exactly as described!!!! ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> I keep her supplied with this and life is good.</li>
            <li> I first found this fragrance while on vacation and fell in love with it. Of course when I returned home, I went to Amazon to find it online. It&#x27;s the most appealing fragrance for me. I get lots of compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this perfume.</li>
            <li> My HG perfume.  I get so many compliments on how clean it smells.  I can&#x27;t pinpoint the smell, just clean, fresh, light and not irritating</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s become my signature sent. Love it. So many compliments and asks about the name. Great blends of Grapefruit and heaven.</li>
            <li> Great price, great smell</li>
            <li> Great product, I love this scent! It arrived in a timely fashion and I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Feminine and not too heavy.  Love this scent and get many compliments when I wear it. It&#x27;s a daily fragrance for me.</li>
            <li> I have people ask me what I am wearing - even a TSA agent!  It is a beautiful, feminine scent.  I have thought it didn&#x27;t last, but even later in the day I&#x27;m still being asked about my perfume.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;I would like to receive notices if this fragrance is on sale or specials!</li>
            <li> wonderful fragrance of grapefruit and cucumber...fresh and somehow a bit old fashioned....makes me think of a 1920&#x27;s scent with a lovely bottle and decorative top.</li>
            <li> Great scent, soft but does not last long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more of a fan of perfumes that aren&#x27;t overpowering and this one fits nicely in that group. What you get with this perfume is a light intensity scent that is both subtle and feminine; a floral themed scent that is pleasant in every way. The bottle is cut in a retro style, a callback to when bottle design was just as important as insuring that a particular perfume&#x27;s scent was just right. Of course, you may want to sample this for yourself at your local Sephora before you take my word for it but I can easily recommend this perfume to those looking for something not too fragrant that still makes an impression.</li>
            <li> I adore this perfume and I get compliments on it constantly!</li>
            <li> Love love love the smell. I always get compliments on it, and my friends have even ordered it. Definitely recommend.</li>
