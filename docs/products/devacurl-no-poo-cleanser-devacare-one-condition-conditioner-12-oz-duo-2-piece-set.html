            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>LOVE it and will be ordering again!</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;ve received nothing more than compliments on my bouncy, shiny and nicely scented hair!</li>
            <li>After MANY years of trying to work the curl OUT of my hair I have decided to embrace my curl!</li>
            <li>I had so many products for my curly hair that I could&#x27;ve started a used product store!  </li>
            <li>I love these two together!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff and so do my curls!</li>
            <li>Great product - strong hair</li>
            <li>The excess will be squeezed out, and your curls will look amazing.</li>
            <li>The excess will be squeezed out, and your curls will look amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing product if you straighten your hair or get smoothing treatments.  </li>
            <li>this stuff is truly amazing</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s an amazing feeling.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>does to the job of detangling , but nothing amazing either.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the volumizing foam &amp; the ArcAngel, but I prefer the foam, honestly.</li>
            <li>Nice scents.</li>
            <li>(non)shampoo is minty &amp; fresh and conditioner smells so incredible...</li>
            <li>I liked the scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice alternative.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo is very heavily rose scented.  </li>
            <li>And I am thrilled to have done so because I can tell a difference in my curl and my hair over all.</li>
            <li>The conditioner has a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li>I love this products, the no poo is a great cleanser, and the conditioner smells so good and is really moisturizing, love it!!</li>
            <li>the scent is very nice and light.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very fine which is not the target audience this product was intended for, but I love it!</li>
            <li>This along with my Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream are my hair&#x27;s new best friends!</li>
            <li>It has a very strong odor and tends to make my skin itch.</li>
            <li>It leaves hair baby soft, hydrated and smelling awesome.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 2c/3a with very fine, porous curly hair.</li>
            <li>I figure it&#x27;s worth it with how great my hair looks, but I can&#x27;t give 5 stars :)</li>
            <li>However, this time, both the shampoo and the conditioner - and I can stress this more for the conditioner, that they have a very strong chemical smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells good, makes my hair super soft AND is good for my hair!!! :)</li>
            <li>Otherwise, everything was fine!</li>
            <li>*VERY IMPORTANT:</li>
            <li>*VERY IMPORTANT:</li>
            <li>The conditioner has a citrusy smell and is very light but moist.  </li>
            <li>These are very interesting since we are all use to bubbles/foam to clean our hair.  </li>
            <li>I love the concept of no-poo hair cleanser.....</li>
            <li>I love both the no poo and the one conditioner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the money to go from looking like a hobo to having gorgeous locks that even I can&#x27;t stop looking at &amp; others compliment.</li>
            <li>I like the idea of not washing my hair with detergent like most shampoos but</li>
            <li>and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>ok ADHD, hair and my hairdresser said to try this.</li>
            <li>The conditioner seems to work better if I don&#x27;t thoroughly rinse it out.</li>
            <li>My curls have never looked better, and I keep getting compliments from strangers, friends and family who keep asking me if they&#x27;re real!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most times I twist my hair up, and leave it in for 15-20 mins while I shave my legs, brush my teeth, ect.</li>
            <li>but overall I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>This product is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Better than When without the time and hassle,</li>
            <li>but it is better than another product I have found.</li>
            <li>I love the Deva Curl products.</li>
            <li>Love both.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>so it seemed to straighten more than add volume.</li>
            <li>works great and its much cheaper then going to ULTA</li>
            <li>This is an interesting product.</li>
            <li>The shampoo has a lovely minty herbal scent, and the conditioner is fruity.</li>
            <li>I think my hair is happier using these products, and my curls are silkier and more manageable.</li>
            <li>My hair is also more tangled after sleeping.</li>
            <li>My hair is also more tangled after sleeping.</li>
            <li>One Condition hydrates my hair, boosts my curls, and I love how DevaCurl makes my hair look and feel.</li>
            <li>After trying so many products over the years for my curly hair, I found the one I had been looking for.</li>
            <li>The more I use it the better my hair gets.</li>
            <li>I love Deva Curl.</li>
            <li>For the shampoo, make sure you massage your scalp</li>
            <li>After rinsing the conditioner out, I like to add a bit more just to the ends as a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make my curls any better.</li>
            <li>In fact most of the people I know don&#x27;t even know that my hair is curly.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m trying to love it</li>
            <li>and she had clients pay top dollar to try to get curls like mine.</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>Like everyone else, I recommend you get &amp;#34;The Curly Girl Handbook&amp;#34;, though most of the advice you need is in these reviews.  </li>
            <li>I love DevaCurl products.</li>
            <li>Since using Deva, my hair has felt and looked way better.</li>
            <li>However, my curls have never looked better.</li>
            <li>I had been using Sexy Curly Hair products before finding their &amp;#34;free of &amp;#34; products.  </li>
            <li>I like the Biolage Conditioning Balm better than the Deva conditioner</li>
            <li>I just love it</li>
            <li>how many times I washed it out.</li>
            <li>Even though I am a curly girl, I have avoided the Deva Curl line for years, despite the mostly raving reviews.  </li>
            <li>After ruining my hair with bleach and losing most of my curls, I figured I would give them a shot.  </li>
            <li>I love the No Poo and the way it makes my hair feel.  </li>
            <li>I really Love the smell and</li>
            <li>This set works much better, and doesn&#x27;t just mask the problem with a coating of shine.</li>
            <li>Love all deva curl products.</li>
            <li>I love how this DevaCurl makes my hair so manageable.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with DevaCurl.</li>
            <li>My curls have never looked better and the friz is gone.</li>
            <li>I love the No Poo and Conditioner...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this product.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about the no-poo but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Fantastic products!</li>
            <li>I was about to run out of my precious shampoo..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t afford to compromise the condition of my hair by not being able to brush it out.</li>
            <li>more wavy.</li>
            <li>I love Deva Curl.</li>
            <li>Many compliments.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really enjoying them.</li>
            <li>I love this product, my hair has never been softer.</li>
            <li>My hair stylist sells this shampoo and conditioner but the price on Amazon is the better.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t give 5 stars because the smell is... interesting.  </li>
            <li>Love it, my daughters hair is so much more manageable</li>
            <li>My hair feels better than ever.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair better, softer, shiner in every way.</li>
            <li>I LOVE these products &amp; my 3B type hair seems to appreciate them as well.</li>
            <li>Your curls will thank you!!!! :-)</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Love the Deva products except for the ones with oil since my hair is oily to begin with.</li>
            <li>This product is ok.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have to use a lot of the conditioner and am able to slide my fingers through without any problems.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t use every day but overall great products!</li>
            <li>Amazing product, specially the shampoo, my favorite, I am a guy and my curls are looking better than ever.</li>
            <li>Love this product, it smells great and leaves my curls very soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll take that in exchange of shinier and hydrated hair that looks pretty good even when i do not use the hair dryer.</li>
            <li>The One condition is pretty good too.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I waited so long as this has made my curly, frizzy hair so wonderful and</li>
            <li>I am so excited it works so well!</li>
            <li>Noticed a difference right away for the better!</li>
            <li>And this is VERY true for this one.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s light and refreshing and not cloying.</li>
            <li>The One Condition works as an incredible conditioner and detangler, especially for my tangle-prone hair.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair smelling great, soft, and curly.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say this really does any good for my hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Since using Devacurl No Poo and the Conditioner my hair has returned to normal, even better more curls and more shine!  </li>
            <li>It also smells very nice, a natural earthy scent.</li>
            <li>I noticed a significant reduction in the frizz once I started using this combo, which I contribute mostly to the shampoo.</li>
            <li>Her comments made me excited to see how much better my curls will get using the curly girl method and these products.</li>
            <li>I think you can just read all of the other reviews to see how awesome these products are.  </li>
            <li>The original formula was much better, It was thicker.  </li>
            <li>But easy to deal with.</li>
            <li>It would be an easy product to start dread locks.</li>
            <li>Easy to wash and rinse and</li>
            <li>So when a friend recommended this (she is a researcher, so her recommendation was easily accepted)</li>
            <li>It is SO strong on the rose-scent, it&#x27;s overpowering.</li>
            <li>The scent is quite medicinal (with a strong hit of lemon grass) and it lingers, in case perfumes bother you.  </li>
            <li>And the conditioner has a strong smell that reminds me of suntan lotion.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this after trying the sample size, I had to immediately pruchase a full size of both Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if  sample bottles could be sold for customers to try first.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft, light, and amazing!  </li>
            <li>Awesome set for regular users or someone wanting to try this out for the first time.</li>
            <li>As stated, I do have fine hair (but a LOT of it)</li>
            <li>I have super curly hair and as much as I love it</li>
            <li>The curls are really super defined and no frizz!  </li>
            <li>When I use shampoo or cheap products, it shows.</li>
            <li>It really does make my hair (colored for years) softer and nice.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it is only appropriate for adults as I have met two adult who swear by it and their curls were gorgeous!!!</li>
            <li>It stays light and has body</li>
            <li>it to do I&#x27;ll just spray a light perfume in my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After months of use I have found this product is only great if you are trying to let your hair be curly.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this (use a sulfate free moisture/ repair shampoo) and moisturizing conditioner.</li>
            <li>My dr recommended this product line a few months ago and it was the best thing ever!!!  </li>
            <li>Plus it smells fantastic - lemongrass for the cleanser and jasmine for the conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair is once again smooth, shiney and fuller looking.</li>
            <li>This is the only product I have found that works great with my curly hair.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>The product smells good &amp; makes my hair soft, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has super fine, curly hair that knots easily.</li>
            <li>The conditioner feels like normal conditioner, but it rinses out better than most without a greasy feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells very fresh and clean -notes of rosemary and mint .</li>
            <li>Ok, let me first tell you my hair-type (for the curlies reading this review and debating whether or not to take a chance on this product).</li>
            <li>Once that first week passed, I fell IN LOVE.</li>
            <li>so I love deals;)</li>
            <li>I should have known that this was the perfect product after finding out a few of my very-curly haired friends have been using it for years!</li>
            <li>and I have noticed a significant improvement in my hair  </li>
            <li>I have fine super curly bleached hair.  </li>
            <li>but hopefully it works just as well as the original Devacurl line that I originally wanted.</li>
            <li>I love the way DevaCurl products smell -- so clean and crisp.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly hair that easily turns to frizz, and No-Poo Cleanser/Conditioner control it!  </li>
            <li>will try to find something else that is more natural and smells better.</li>
            <li>Great for dry hair</li>
            <li>A lot of ppl dislike the smell, but I like the minty tingle and smell, give the clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I color treat my normally dry hair, so when the even dryer grays started popping up I went on a quest to get rid of the fuzzy fly aways.</li>
            <li>I love the shampoo, but the conditioner doesn&#x27;t really detangle or smooth my hair</li>
            <li>Scalp and hair gets clean, without feeling at all greasy.  </li>
            <li>Hair is clean and curls are bouncy with no frizz.</li>
            <li>Smells clean too.</li>
            <li>My hair feels and smells clean.  </li>
            <li>My hair is clean and well moisturized by these products.</li>
            <li>You need to use a lot of product to get your hair clean since there are no foaming agents/sulfates.</li>
            <li>Mister right works wonders for a day after touch up!</li>
            <li>she was right!</li>
            <li>And yes, washing with a light conditioner really does get your hair clean!</li>
            <li>Apparently the B&#x27;leave in is superb for 2a&#x27;s as well, so I&#x27;m going to give that a shot as it&#x27;s supposed to add extra volume.</li>
            <li>Also, if you have pin straight hair, this isn&#x27;t going to make your hair magically curly</li>
            <li>I love how my hair feels and have learned so much about the care and growing of curly hair.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner work wonders for my curly hair - it takes away all frizz, makes my curls very formed and prominent and makes my hair shiny.</li>
            <li>Love the no poo, but not so much the conditioner.</li>
            <li>Loved these products when I ordered the trial size kit, so ordered the big bottles.  </li>
            <li>Over short period of time, the curls weren&#x27;t as good.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product</li>
            <li>Full disclosure</li>
            <li>This id my first time buying devacurl products and so far so good.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair incredibly soft, makes it curl more easily, and keeps color in for longer.</li>
            <li>it does have a fresh clean citrus smell.  </li>
            <li>The Noo Poo for a non lathering shampoo, makes my hair feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be able to say for sure, but I checked the ingredient list on the label with a bottle at Sephora and they were the same.</li>
            <li>Super convenient to order on line.</li>
            <li>You do have to make sure to vigorously work the shampoo in, especially scrubbing you scalp, and make sure to wash it all out.</li>
            <li>so it tends to get oily quickly</li>
            <li>I was interested in this product after reading an article about detergent free shampoos.</li>
            <li>The No Poo seemed ok, but clearly this is not an original DevaCurl retailer.</li>
            <li>I got 3 compliments on my hair the very first day I used it.</li>
            <li>My hair feels clean, but not dried out, and it looks much better.</li>
            <li>They are more natural and you do feel lilke your hair is clean.  </li>
            <li>Overall pretty good products.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff so much, the first time I purchased the Deva No Poo product  </li>
            <li>I was so excited after ordering my first Devacurl shampoo and conditioner set, and eagerly waited while it was in shipment.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them as well as the Curly Girl Hair method &amp; the Deva Cuts!!!</li>
            <li>But, I will say that my hair is SUPER soft and more shiny than ever before.</li>
            <li>Sulfates in dish washing detergent really clean the dishes and, without it, they are scummy unless you use very high heat and special cleaners.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels great after I wash it instead of dried out, like I don&#x27;t even need to condition it.</li>
            <li>It also feels fabulous on the head – creamy, no suds, very soothing.</li>
            <li>Once you get over the fact that there is no foam &amp;#34;poo&amp;#34; you love that you don&#x27;t have to wait until putting your conditioner to feel how soft your hair is.</li>
            <li>Also it helps my hair curl better naturally.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this product so far.</li>
            <li>The no-lather shampoo takes some getting used to, but it was completely worth the patience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And the product seems to be working, though I still need a curl activating cream afterward and don&#x27;t have much success using this conditioner as a leave-in.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not at all, worth it.</li>
            <li>Trying to find more natural alternatives for my eldest&#x27;s curly hair.</li>
            <li>They are not the cheapest shampoo/conditioner out there, but if you have curls it is totally worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to shampooing.</li>
            <li>My hair is more soft and shinny...</li>
            <li>Lovely smell and leaves curls soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to see that I could get my favorite No-poo at about 25% off what I pay at my local beauty store.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to see how well Devacurl treats my hair and scalp after a whole bottle&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this product, as I have very curly hair.</li>
            <li>trick, it turned out was to figure out the right amount for me.</li>
            <li>I really like these products - the shampoo helps clean my curly hair without damaging it.</li>
            <li>thing that some may find disconcerting is that each product has a very strong smell, and all the smells are different.  </li>
            <li>but the No Poo Shampoo is simply the best for curly/color treated hair hands down.  </li>
            <li>Great as usual.  </li>
            <li>maybe could smell a little better though :)</li>
            <li>It has only been two days and so far so good.</li>
            <li>It took a couple of tries to get used to no shampoo bubbles, but now after a month, I&#x27;m thrilled to say my hair really does feel clean but still moisturized.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time purchasing lather-less shampoo and like it very much.  </li>
            <li>I have a massive amount of fine hair, enough to make my own lion&#x27;s mane if I so wish, and this works so well for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the first DevaCurl use, my hair felt just as greasy as before.</li>
            <li>On the first use, I noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>first week of using no-poo SUCKED.</li>
            <li>and I think it actually works better, too.</li>
            <li>So overall, I don&#x27;t love this stuff</li>
            <li>I am wondering if the formula has been changed since my first purchase of this product from another vendor.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may have noticed more hair loss than regular shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>My first time trying it - I will continue to use.</li>
            <li>I only gave 4 stars because I wish the products were  more affordable.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that was able to coax my curls out.</li>
            <li>First tiem I used it I saw a difference.</li>
            <li>(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner, when left in, makes the ends of my hair look lovely.</li>
            <li>This is was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Only sometimes, in the summer, when the weather&#x27;s more humid</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sweating more, I&#x27;ll use Low-Poo once or twice a month to get the extra oil out.</li>
            <li>Shampooing your hair can be pretty damaging, No-Poo cleans out build up and dirt without stripping my hair.</li>
            <li>This is the first &#x27;no-poo&#x27; I&#x27;ve used, after researching how to wash, treat and style curly hair.</li>
            <li>with plopping/plunking with a t-shirt, my hair stays frizz-free, touchable, soft, smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>So, I first came across Devacurl through my hairdresser.</li>
            <li>I love my DevaCurl products, but I do not use them daily.</li>
            <li>It also works magically when combined with the Shea Moisture Manuka Honey &amp; Mafura Oil Masque (when using the masque as a regular conditioner) as a way to condition your curls.</li>
            <li>The shampoo leaves my hair soft and light.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Deva !</li>
            <li>After a few more uses, I now have nice, soft wavy curls</li>
            <li>My hair is clean and soft!</li>
            <li>A little reluctant at first, reading that this formula doesn&#x27;t lather (everyone loves a good lather) but really surprised to feel how clean this product gets my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paired</li>
            <li>Other than a little frizz, all hairdressers say my hair is strong and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I actually love the smell of the shampoo but not so much the conditioner, although the shampoo smell is so strong you don&#x27;t smell the odd conditioner smell.</li>
            <li>i put a big blob in my hair and start to work on the top of my head, but i typically need to add more to the get the bottom part clean, too.</li>
            <li>On the days I wake up with flat curls or before a night out with the girls, I&#x27;ll spray this into the hair that needs more definition and scrunch it in to &amp;#34;reactivate&amp;#34; the curls.</li>
            <li>On the days I wake up with flat curls or before a night out with the girls, I&#x27;ll spray this into the hair that needs more definition and scrunch it in to &amp;#34;reactivate&amp;#34; the curls.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the smell, and it leaves my hair feeling good without all the unnecessary chemicals.</li>
            <li>The smell is so clean and the way your hair feels after washing and conditioning is so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>but your hair does feel soft and clean after using it.  </li>
            <li>Sulfates are detergent and they clean the hair completely and make the soap lather up.  </li>
            <li>The DevaCurl Como leaves my hair perfectly clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>hair doesn&#x27;t feel neither clean nor soft to the touch, after washing with this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Conditioner</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly/wavy hair that is pretty fine and prone to frizz, and I live in CO</li>
            <li>was very watery compared to the conditioner in my first order.  </li>
            <li>I am a curly girl and finally found the right products!!</li>
            <li>I have been also using it on my wavy hair and my hair is also just as frizzy on the top, still dry as well.</li>
            <li>Unrelated to the product, don&#x27;t dry your hair with a towel, it&#x27;s much better if you use a cotton t-shirt.</li>
            <li>This is worth a try if you&#x27;re willing to pay a little more, though.</li>
            <li>I will agree with most other people, that I use far more conditioner than shampoo, so be prepared to refill that early.</li>
            <li>It did make my curls look better, but it also made my scalp super greasy and heavy feeling.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair with ribbon curls, and I&#x27;ve been using No-Poo and One Condition on it religiously for years.</li>
            <li>My curls definitely feel more soft and no buildup!  </li>
            <li>I only wish they were more natural but they will have to do until I find a replacement!</li>
            <li>My curl is so soft and pretty!</li>
            <li>I will continue using this product regardless because I already see a huge change after only one week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been a great fan of big suds, because they indicate harsh detergents at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It may be because I have very oily hair, but after a couple of weeks of using this my scalp had so much build up.</li>
            <li>My curls are very defined.</li>
            <li>This stuff really does work wonders.</li>
            <li>It took a couple days but the packed moisture really brought out my curls and even appeared to be a 2b after continual use.</li>
            <li>Believe me, my family always asks where my curly hair came from as I used to &amp;#34;think&amp;#34; my hair was straight.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the scent of this.  </li>
            <li>Very light&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t have much time, I&#x27;ll use a blowdryer with a diffuser to speed up the process.&lt;br /&gt;8)</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t have much time, I&#x27;ll use a blowdryer with a diffuser to speed up the process.&lt;br /&gt;7)</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than Kerastase,</li>
            <li>I really like the Deva Curl products but the One Conditioner I got in this order</li>
            <li>Yes my shipment was on time and greatly appreciated</li>
            <li>Seems very moisturizing</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this stuff!</li>
            <li>My hair is in between very curly and very wavy</li>
            <li>yummy?&lt;br /&gt;2-i don&#x27;t like how much shampoo i have to use.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is very emolient and makes your hair feel hydrated.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>; shampoo really works to remove dirt and excess oil without stripping my hair of moisture.</li>
            <li>I have very damaged hair from dying and processing</li>
            <li>I used to have straight wavy hair</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really recommend them based on cost.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I really like that there are no bubbles when using the shampoo because it feels like it isn&#x27;t cleaning my hair.</li>
            <li>The way you are told to style your hair is also very time consuming</li>
            <li>My hair feels much softer after using this product.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t do much for my curls</li>
            <li>My hair is shinier with this stuff than it ever was with silicone balms, mists, or conditioners, and much softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My daughter has straight hair</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re taking a much healthier avenue with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I really recommended the product.</li>
            <li>My hair is so much nicer.</li>
            <li>Really detangles hair</li>
            <li>Makes the hair really shine.</li>
            <li>It works very well for my curly hair.</li>
            <li>My hair was really fly-awayish and frizzy.  </li>
            <li>This product is absolutely a god send.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how much it changed my curly hair.</li>
            <li>I really like the Devacurl combo</li>
            <li>After ONE use of this system, my hair is so much softer and prettier, with no frizz.</li>
            <li>leaves your feeling very heaver and over moisturized</li>
            <li>This purchase appears to be fragrance free, so I may get to use the entire bottles!</li>
            <li>But I enjoyed the bouncy curls and figured that if household products worked that well for curls, the professional stuff would definitely be awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i liked how my hair looks when it&#x27;s dried using this system</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and these never weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>conditioner smells like dish soap, and it is so strong that it stays on my hair for so long.</li>
            <li>It is strong and stays in your hair for too long.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try &amp;#34;grown-up&amp;#34; shampoo and to get my curls in shape, but the DevaCurl left my hair greasy and I still had frizz issues.</li>
            <li>I was excited till recently my hair turned into a rats nest of unholey stuck together gobs of silicone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the products, better used every other day as the moisturizing properties make my hair&lt;</li>
            <li>I have super fine hair and this doesn&#x27;t weight it down at all!</li>
            <li>The rinse-out steps do rinse out clean, so you may need that last &amp;#34;no rinse&amp;#34; step.</li>
            <li>not sure what separates it from other store or salon bought products, but this line is incredible.</li>
            <li>My hair is coarse and frizzy and these two products really make it smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I air-dried my hair as usual and my curls were flatter than and lifeless compared to the shampoo I have been using from The Honest Company.</li>
            <li>I have less frizz and more controlled curl.</li>
            <li>It is less frizzy and the curl just lays better.</li>
            <li>so be realistic.</li>
            <li>Do some research on how to properly care for your curls and try this product, you&#x27;ll most likely be amazed at those locks of beauty.</li>
            <li>It got rid of the grease, cleaned my scalp but left my roots super</li>
            <li>dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a particular scent--somewhat candy-like--but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>My curls started looking more scrunchy &amp; stiff from all of my previous products and straightening my hair to amazing curly q soft curls.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend this to all people with curly hair.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>(3b type, highly porous)</li>
            <li>My hair can vary from wavy to soft ringlets, and I was expecting this product-based off reviews- to make my curls more defined and less fizzy... not so much.</li>
            <li>leaves my hair looking and feeling dirty, doesn&#x27;t smell very good either</li>
            <li>My curls are very well define and soft.  </li>
            <li>I discovered these products a few years ago and LOVE them.</li>
            <li>The shampoo does have a fairly distinct smell (I want to say witch hazel or something similar, but in not 100% on that)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, didn&#x27;t see any difference after a few uses.  </li>
            <li>They are much more spirally and less frizzy!</li>
            <li>We live in South Carolina near the beach and let&#x27;s just say my hair really doesn&#x27;t do well in the humidity.</li>
            <li>I have wavy (2a) dry hair, and this product is a lot better than using regular shampoo (with sulfates) because it doesn&#x27;t strip my hair of all the oils.</li>
            <li>My hair was more loose and definitely shinier.</li>
            <li>If the smell of baby powder isn&#x27;t one you like I suggest looking at other sulfate free shampoos.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super creamy to keep your hair from getting too dry.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy the No-Poo again because I actually believe it left my hair so soft &amp; easy to manage.</li>
            <li>As others have noted, the odor of the conditioner is odd and strong.  </li>
            <li>so maybe my hair&#x27;s oil production needs to calm down and regulate first.</li>
            <li>so maybe my hair&#x27;s oil production needs to calm down and regulate first.</li>
            <li>My damaged locks feels moisturized and when styled, they look and feel very soft and bouncy.  </li>
            <li>I recommend to use the no poo as opposed to the low poo, the low poo tends to strip my sensitive hair &amp; make it look just as the cheap products did</li>
            <li>ALL SIGNS YOU HAVE NATURALLY CURLY HAIR!</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioning system has completely transformed my hair!</li>
            <li>My hair was more &#x27;crispy&#x27; on the ends than usual too.</li>
            <li>Even my hair stylist asked what I have been using since my hair was so soft and shiny!  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t figure out what I was doing differently than when I first tried them.  </li>
            <li>Trust yourselves, Go natural &amp; get your Deva products!</li>
            <li>This is the first product I&#x27;ve found that actually works on my hair.  </li>
            <li>products are light so my hair is not weighted down...</li>
            <li>I have curls that are unruly and get dried out easily from going to the beach often.</li>
            <li>I read tons of positive reviews on the No Poo prior to purchasing it.</li>
            <li>Very happy to find it less expensive than&lt;br /&gt;mainstream department stores.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice that my curls were any more or less improved for the short time I used these.</li>
            <li>Too heavy for my fine wavy hair.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s a winter month, I run a little bit of light oil through my tips to seal in moisture</li>
            <li>and when I use a curling iron or a curling wand to give it a little more oomph, the style will actually hold</li>
            <li>I may have to try the DevaCare next time for a little more moisture.</li>
            <li>Contrary to the pictures, the shampoo and conditioner are in identical bottles, which makes it really hard to differentiate between the two--not that you would be able to tell the difference from the consistency, since they both feel like conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your hair feeling clear without residue.</li>
            <li>I would say if you have a sensitive scalp and have to use sulfate-free hair products as I, then I probably would not buy this.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural beauty.</li>
            <li>But once you get into the routine, it&#x27;s much quicker and easier than constantly trying to straighten hair that wasn&#x27;t designed to be that way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But once you get into the routine, it&#x27;s much quicker and easier than constantly trying to straighten hair that wasn&#x27;t designed to be that way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With this product, my hair is really greasy in the back of my head</li>
            <li>I wear my hair naturally curly</li>
            <li>The conditioner helps control the frizz and makes your hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>As far as repairing and healing properties go</li>
            <li>it took so much time and then as soon as I walked outside...</li>
            <li>but I will say I had a woman stop me in a store today to ask if my hair was naturally curly.</li>
            <li>Every hairdresser I&#x27;ve had since I started using this has commented on how soft my hair is.</li>
            <li>The combination of both products leaves my hair soft and curly...without the frizz.  </li>
            <li>I basically use it every day and am look to purchase the 32oz bottle, makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>but I feel any old conditioner words as well as One Condition.</li>
            <li>Also, you don&#x27;t have to use as much product per use as the &amp;#34;Wen&amp;#34; system requires, so a bottle should last a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am completely hooked.  </li>
            <li>It smells like old woman perfume-overly flowery.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve only used this twice (plus the intense moisturizer).  </li>
            <li>The Shampoo doesn&#x27;t work for my natural curly hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was using Purelogy line before and going back to it as fast as I can.</li>
            <li>I recommend you go online and watch the videos the company offers on it&#x27;s use.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft and controlled.</li>
            <li>I am completely amazed at how well Deva Curl products work.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and this stuff loves naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I have to use way too much it for having relatively short hair.</li>
            <li>The conditioner leaves everything feeling soft.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft, looks shiny (not in a squeaky-clean way), and produces oil a lot more slowly.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s thick and needs a lot of moisture to look healthy.</li>
            <li>long, thick hair used to be shiny and smooth and now it&#x27;s kind of a mess with tangles and grease.</li>
            <li>long, thick hair used to be shiny and smooth and now it&#x27;s kind of a mess with tangles and grease.</li>
            <li>i am never going back to normal shampoo again!</li>
            <li>I mean, even dandruff shampoo was better than this.  </li>
            <li>She told me that was because the typical shampoos and conditioners that you buy at places like Target or the drugstore typically dry out your hair and if you have more of a wavy curl, they completely take away whatever curl your hair has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She told me I had curly hair, which I didn&#x27;t believe at first because my hair had always been super straight and would never, ever hold a curl not matter what I tried (curling irons, curling wands, hot rollers, foam rollers, tying my hair up in damp twisted knots overnight, dozens of different types of hair sprays and mousse, etc.).</li>
            <li>Packaged well for no mess shipping.  </li>
            <li>I typically wash my hair every third or fourth day, but with this product I may have wash more frequently until my scalp adjusts.</li>
            <li>I only have to use very little product for it to work - love it.</li>
            <li>I figured I didn&#x27;t use enough, so I tried using more of the product and less of the conditioner the next time.</li>
            <li>Stripped clean of the silicone after a few vinegar rinses followed by these two products.</li>
            <li>It has also quickly cleared up the dandruff that my previous cowash had been causing.</li>
            <li>But I cannot live without One Condition regardless of the season; it gives my dry ends life and softness without ever weighing down my fine hair.</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this brand.  </li>
            <li>it is hard to get the spray down to my scalp, so i usually just use the awesome shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly white girl hair and this seems to leave my hair feeling less clean than it was before using it.  </li>
            <li>It is not how much shampoo/conditioner you use, it is how long you leave it there.</li>
            <li>She is blonde, her hair is super dry and curly, and she is only 7 years old</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t use the shampoo every day because the build up left is too heavy on my fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have very fine and thin curly hair that gets snarled</li>
            <li>between washes: I have a little spray bottle filled with water and some One-Conditioner mixed together.</li>
            <li>It is long, thick, frizzy, VERY tangled, and gets oily very quickly.</li>
            <li>By the third wash, my hair was so sticky and gross, it looked like I had used too much styling product</li>
            <li>I felt a little  weird washing my hair with the cleanser without any lather but the result was pretty good.</li>
            <li>One Condition provides just the right amount of moisture to my hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>it simply doesn&#x27;t go very far.</li>
            <li>I first got this, I threw decided to take a chance and throw all my other shampoos/conditioners out.</li>
            <li>My barely wavy hair gets curl when I use this correctly!</li>
            <li>As with all other Deva products (I have the ultra defining gel and deep conditioner), is water-soluble so washes right out with water.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>highly recommend especially for mixed hair!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely the product leaving the residue; it doesn&#x27;t smell like my hair&#x27;s natural oils.</li>
            <li>Both the No Poo and the conditioner left my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>So far, this has been the only thing that has worked for my hair.</li>
            <li>i have medium length VERY curly / frizzy hair that is pretty thick.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although this product was nice, I will not be buying again because it is too expensive.</li>
            <li>My curls are enhanced &amp; look better than ever when using these products as directed and whenever I stray away, my curls are dull, dry, &amp; basically non existent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a little weird getting used to non sudsing shampoo, but it works &amp; smells great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had success with other DevaCurl products for my sometimes dry curly hair.</li>
            <li>Seriously this is a fantastic product if you have coarse-thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I have been straightening my hair for the last five years and have only come to accept my naturally curly hair through Deva Curl and the Curly Girl Method.</li>
            <li>I was tired of trying yet another  product that promised soft smooth curls</li>
            <li>Felt super heavy and waxy, had to strip my hair and go back to my regular routine.</li>
            <li>Works on fine, straight, thin (but very dry) hair.</li>
            <li>This shampoo gets RAVE reviews, but it rally did nothing  for her hair, it is just as tangled, hard to brush and frizzy on the top as with any other shampoo.</li>
            <li>Since there are no silicones in in, you don&#x27;t get the super slick silicone feeling that you would with regular silicone</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant to use these products because an employee at Ulta told me it might make my hair oily quicker than other products but in using them, I can now actually comb through my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on the fence about the no-poo thing, but I still may stop using this product simply because I can barely stand the scent.</li>
            <li>The first few times I used just the no poo cleanser</li>
            <li>The first few times I used just the no poo cleanser</li>
            <li>I noticed after the first few uses my hair was curlier.</li>
            <li>I however do not particularly like the smell so much but so long as it does what I need</li>
            <li>I bought a small travel kit to give it a try on my own and at first I really disliked it because some of my hair only had a small wave, other parts had a little more of a curl, and other parts of it were still stick-straight</li>
            <li>I normally blow dry and the use a flat iron.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair really soft, but unless I blow dry it, my hair looks greasy.</li>
            <li>Doing that and using a diffuser with this product gives me above average curls, but my hair is really poofy/borderline frizzy.</li>
            <li>I have super curly and thick hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Third, my hair has always been super thick with a bit of a wave/curl.</li>
            <li>I have 2a hair, which means it&#x27;s fine, thin, &amp; has an &amp;#34;S&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Split ends have decreased tremendously!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the no-poo and one conditioner for the past few days, and maybe the DevaCurl gel or cream is a must if you want it to work, but I&#x27;ve stuck with my normal Moroccan Oil styling products seeing as I didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money on a whole new line.  </li>
            <li>Regular Shampoos dry the hair out over time and makes it harder to actually condition the hair (very counterproductive to deep conditioning).</li>

            <li> LOVE it and will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;ve received nothing more than compliments on my bouncy, shiny and nicely scented hair!</li>
            <li> After MANY years of trying to work the curl OUT of my hair I have decided to embrace my curl!</li>
            <li> I had so many products for my curly hair that I could&#x27;ve started a used product store!  </li>
            <li> I love these two together!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff and so do my curls!</li>
            <li> Great product - strong hair</li>
            <li> The excess will be squeezed out, and your curls will look amazing.</li>
            <li> The excess will be squeezed out, and your curls will look amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing product if you straighten your hair or get smoothing treatments.  </li>
            <li> this stuff is truly amazing</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s an amazing feeling.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> does to the job of detangling , but nothing amazing either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the volumizing foam &amp; the ArcAngel, but I prefer the foam, honestly.</li>
            <li> Nice scents.</li>
            <li> (non)shampoo is minty &amp; fresh and conditioner smells so incredible...</li>
            <li> I liked the scent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice alternative.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo is very heavily rose scented.  </li>
            <li> And I am thrilled to have done so because I can tell a difference in my curl and my hair over all.</li>
            <li> The conditioner has a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li> I love this products, the no poo is a great cleanser, and the conditioner smells so good and is really moisturizing, love it!!</li>
            <li> the scent is very nice and light.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very fine which is not the target audience this product was intended for, but I love it!</li>
            <li> This along with my Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream are my hair&#x27;s new best friends!</li>
            <li> It has a very strong odor and tends to make my skin itch.</li>
            <li> It leaves hair baby soft, hydrated and smelling awesome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 2c/3a with very fine, porous curly hair.</li>
            <li> I figure it&#x27;s worth it with how great my hair looks, but I can&#x27;t give 5 stars :)</li>
            <li> However, this time, both the shampoo and the conditioner - and I can stress this more for the conditioner, that they have a very strong chemical smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells good, makes my hair super soft AND is good for my hair!!! :)</li>
            <li> Otherwise, everything was fine!</li>
            <li> *VERY IMPORTANT:</li>
            <li> *VERY IMPORTANT:</li>
            <li> The conditioner has a citrusy smell and is very light but moist.  </li>
            <li> These are very interesting since we are all use to bubbles/foam to clean our hair.  </li>
            <li> I love the concept of no-poo hair cleanser.....</li>
            <li> I love both the no poo and the one conditioner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the money to go from looking like a hobo to having gorgeous locks that even I can&#x27;t stop looking at &amp; others compliment.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of not washing my hair with detergent like most shampoos but</li>
            <li> and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> ok ADHD, hair and my hairdresser said to try this.</li>
            <li> The conditioner seems to work better if I don&#x27;t thoroughly rinse it out.</li>
            <li> My curls have never looked better, and I keep getting compliments from strangers, friends and family who keep asking me if they&#x27;re real!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most times I twist my hair up, and leave it in for 15-20 mins while I shave my legs, brush my teeth, ect.</li>
            <li> but overall I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> This product is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> Better than When without the time and hassle,</li>
            <li> but it is better than another product I have found.</li>
            <li> I love the Deva Curl products.</li>
            <li> Love both.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> so it seemed to straighten more than add volume.</li>
            <li> works great and its much cheaper then going to ULTA</li>
            <li> This is an interesting product.</li>
            <li> The shampoo has a lovely minty herbal scent, and the conditioner is fruity.</li>
            <li> I think my hair is happier using these products, and my curls are silkier and more manageable.</li>
            <li> My hair is also more tangled after sleeping.</li>
            <li> My hair is also more tangled after sleeping.</li>
            <li> One Condition hydrates my hair, boosts my curls, and I love how DevaCurl makes my hair look and feel.</li>
            <li> After trying so many products over the years for my curly hair, I found the one I had been looking for.</li>
            <li> The more I use it the better my hair gets.</li>
            <li> I love Deva Curl.</li>
            <li> For the shampoo, make sure you massage your scalp</li>
            <li> After rinsing the conditioner out, I like to add a bit more just to the ends as a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make my curls any better.</li>
            <li> In fact most of the people I know don&#x27;t even know that my hair is curly.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m trying to love it</li>
            <li> and she had clients pay top dollar to try to get curls like mine.</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> Like everyone else, I recommend you get &amp;#34;The Curly Girl Handbook&amp;#34;, though most of the advice you need is in these reviews.  </li>
            <li> I love DevaCurl products.</li>
            <li> Since using Deva, my hair has felt and looked way better.</li>
            <li> However, my curls have never looked better.</li>
            <li> I had been using Sexy Curly Hair products before finding their &amp;#34;free of &amp;#34; products.  </li>
            <li> I like the Biolage Conditioning Balm better than the Deva conditioner</li>
            <li> I just love it</li>
            <li> how many times I washed it out.</li>
            <li> Even though I am a curly girl, I have avoided the Deva Curl line for years, despite the mostly raving reviews.  </li>
            <li> After ruining my hair with bleach and losing most of my curls, I figured I would give them a shot.  </li>
            <li> I love the No Poo and the way it makes my hair feel.  </li>
            <li> I really Love the smell and</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic products!</li>
            <li> I was about to run out of my precious shampoo..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t afford to compromise the condition of my hair by not being able to brush it out.</li>
            <li> more wavy.</li>
            <li> I love Deva Curl.</li>
            <li> Many compliments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying them.</li>
            <li> I love this product, my hair has never been softer.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist sells this shampoo and conditioner but the price on Amazon is the better.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t give 5 stars because the smell is... interesting.  </li>
            <li> Love it, my daughters hair is so much more manageable</li>
            <li> My hair feels better than ever.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair better, softer, shiner in every way.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these products &amp; my 3B type hair seems to appreciate them as well.</li>
            <li> Your curls will thank you!!!! :-)</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> Love the Deva products except for the ones with oil since my hair is oily to begin with.</li>
            <li> This product is ok.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have to use a lot of the conditioner and am able to slide my fingers through without any problems.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t use every day but overall great products!</li>
            <li> Amazing product, specially the shampoo, my favorite, I am a guy and my curls are looking better than ever.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it smells great and leaves my curls very soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll take that in exchange of shinier and hydrated hair that looks pretty good even when i do not use the hair dryer.</li>
            <li> The One condition is pretty good too.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I waited so long as this has made my curly, frizzy hair so wonderful and</li>
            <li> I am so excited it works so well!</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference right away for the better!</li>
            <li> And this is VERY true for this one.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s light and refreshing and not cloying.</li>
            <li> The One Condition works as an incredible conditioner and detangler, especially for my tangle-prone hair.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair smelling great, soft, and curly.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say this really does any good for my hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since using Devacurl No Poo and the Conditioner my hair has returned to normal, even better more curls and more shine!  </li>
            <li> It also smells very nice, a natural earthy scent.</li>
            <li> I noticed a significant reduction in the frizz once I started using this combo, which I contribute mostly to the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Her comments made me excited to see how much better my curls will get using the curly girl method and these products.</li>
            <li> I think you can just read all of the other reviews to see how awesome these products are.  </li>
            <li> The original formula was much better, It was thicker.  </li>
            <li> But easy to deal with.</li>
            <li> It would be an easy product to start dread locks.</li>
            <li> Easy to wash and rinse and</li>
            <li> So when a friend recommended this (she is a researcher, so her recommendation was easily accepted)</li>
            <li> It is SO strong on the rose-scent, it&#x27;s overpowering.</li>
            <li> The scent is quite medicinal (with a strong hit of lemon grass) and it lingers, in case perfumes bother you.  </li>
            <li> And the conditioner has a strong smell that reminds me of suntan lotion.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this after trying the sample size, I had to immediately pruchase a full size of both Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if  sample bottles could be sold for customers to try first.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft, light, and amazing!  </li>
            <li> Awesome set for regular users or someone wanting to try this out for the first time.</li>
            <li> As stated, I do have fine hair (but a LOT of it)</li>
            <li> I have super curly hair and as much as I love it</li>
            <li> The curls are really super defined and no frizz!  </li>
            <li> When I use shampoo or cheap products, it shows.</li>
            <li> It really does make my hair (colored for years) softer and nice.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it is only appropriate for adults as I have met two adult who swear by it and their curls were gorgeous!!!</li>
            <li> It stays light and has body</li>
            <li> it to do I&#x27;ll just spray a light perfume in my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After months of use I have found this product is only great if you are trying to let your hair be curly.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this (use a sulfate free moisture/ repair shampoo) and moisturizing conditioner.</li>
            <li> My dr recommended this product line a few months ago and it was the best thing ever!!!  </li>
            <li> Plus it smells fantastic - lemongrass for the cleanser and jasmine for the conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair is once again smooth, shiney and fuller looking.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have found that works great with my curly hair.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> The product smells good &amp; makes my hair soft, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has super fine, curly hair that knots easily.</li>
            <li> The conditioner feels like normal conditioner, but it rinses out better than most without a greasy feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells very fresh and clean -notes of rosemary and mint .</li>
            <li> Ok, let me first tell you my hair-type (for the curlies reading this review and debating whether or not to take a chance on this product).</li>
            <li> Once that first week passed, I fell IN LOVE.</li>
            <li> so I love deals;)</li>
            <li> I should have known that this was the perfect product after finding out a few of my very-curly haired friends have been using it for years!</li>
            <li> and I have noticed a significant improvement in my hair  </li>
            <li> I have fine super curly bleached hair.  </li>
            <li> but hopefully it works just as well as the original Devacurl line that I originally wanted.</li>
            <li> I love the way DevaCurl products smell -- so clean and crisp.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly hair that easily turns to frizz, and No-Poo Cleanser/Conditioner control it!  </li>
            <li> will try to find something else that is more natural and smells better.</li>
            <li> Great for dry hair</li>
            <li> A lot of ppl dislike the smell, but I like the minty tingle and smell, give the clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I color treat my normally dry hair, so when the even dryer grays started popping up I went on a quest to get rid of the fuzzy fly aways.</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo, but the conditioner doesn&#x27;t really detangle or smooth my hair</li>
            <li> Scalp and hair gets clean, without feeling at all greasy.  </li>
            <li> Hair is clean and curls are bouncy with no frizz.</li>
            <li> Smells clean too.</li>
            <li> My hair feels and smells clean.  </li>
            <li> My hair is clean and well moisturized by these products.</li>
            <li> You need to use a lot of product to get your hair clean since there are no foaming agents/sulfates.</li>
            <li> Mister right works wonders for a day after touch up!</li>
            <li> she was right!</li>
            <li> And yes, washing with a light conditioner really does get your hair clean!</li>
            <li> Apparently the B&#x27;leave in is superb for 2a&#x27;s as well, so I&#x27;m going to give that a shot as it&#x27;s supposed to add extra volume.</li>
            <li> Also, if you have pin straight hair, this isn&#x27;t going to make your hair magically curly</li>
            <li> I love how my hair feels and have learned so much about the care and growing of curly hair.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner work wonders for my curly hair - it takes away all frizz, makes my curls very formed and prominent and makes my hair shiny.</li>
            <li> Love the no poo, but not so much the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Loved these products when I ordered the trial size kit, so ordered the big bottles.  </li>
            <li> Over short period of time, the curls weren&#x27;t as good.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product</li>
            <li> Full disclosure</li>
            <li> This id my first time buying devacurl products and so far so good.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair incredibly soft, makes it curl more easily, and keeps color in for longer.</li>
            <li> it does have a fresh clean citrus smell.  </li>
            <li> The Noo Poo for a non lathering shampoo, makes my hair feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be able to say for sure, but I checked the ingredient list on the label with a bottle at Sephora and they were the same.</li>
            <li> Super convenient to order on line.</li>
            <li> You do have to make sure to vigorously work the shampoo in, especially scrubbing you scalp, and make sure to wash it all out.</li>
            <li> so it tends to get oily quickly</li>
            <li> I was interested in this product after reading an article about detergent free shampoos.</li>
            <li> The No Poo seemed ok, but clearly this is not an original DevaCurl retailer.</li>
            <li> I got 3 compliments on my hair the very first day I used it.</li>
            <li> My hair feels clean, but not dried out, and it looks much better.</li>
            <li> They are more natural and you do feel lilke your hair is clean.  </li>
            <li> Overall pretty good products.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff so much, the first time I purchased the Deva No Poo product  </li>
            <li> I was so excited after ordering my first Devacurl shampoo and conditioner set, and eagerly waited while it was in shipment.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them as well as the Curly Girl Hair method &amp; the Deva Cuts!!!</li>
            <li> But, I will say that my hair is SUPER soft and more shiny than ever before.</li>
            <li> Sulfates in dish washing detergent really clean the dishes and, without it, they are scummy unless you use very high heat and special cleaners.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels great after I wash it instead of dried out, like I don&#x27;t even need to condition it.</li>
            <li> It also feels fabulous on the head – creamy, no suds, very soothing.</li>
            <li> Once you get over the fact that there is no foam &amp;#34;poo&amp;#34; you love that you don&#x27;t have to wait until putting your conditioner to feel how soft your hair is.</li>
            <li> Also it helps my hair curl better naturally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product so far.</li>
            <li> The no-lather shampoo takes some getting used to, but it was completely worth the patience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And the product seems to be working, though I still need a curl activating cream afterward and don&#x27;t have much success using this conditioner as a leave-in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not at all, worth it.</li>
            <li> Trying to find more natural alternatives for my eldest&#x27;s curly hair.</li>
            <li> They are not the cheapest shampoo/conditioner out there, but if you have curls it is totally worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to shampooing.</li>
            <li> My hair is more soft and shinny...</li>
            <li> Lovely smell and leaves curls soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to see that I could get my favorite No-poo at about 25% off what I pay at my local beauty store.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see how well Devacurl treats my hair and scalp after a whole bottle&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product, as I have very curly hair.</li>
            <li> trick, it turned out was to figure out the right amount for me.</li>
            <li> I really like these products - the shampoo helps clean my curly hair without damaging it.</li>
            <li> thing that some may find disconcerting is that each product has a very strong smell, and all the smells are different.  </li>
            <li> but the No Poo Shampoo is simply the best for curly/color treated hair hands down.  </li>
            <li> Great as usual.  </li>
            <li> maybe could smell a little better though :)</li>
            <li> It has only been two days and so far so good.</li>
            <li> It took a couple of tries to get used to no shampoo bubbles, but now after a month, I&#x27;m thrilled to say my hair really does feel clean but still moisturized.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time purchasing lather-less shampoo and like it very much.  </li>
            <li> I have a massive amount of fine hair, enough to make my own lion&#x27;s mane if I so wish, and this works so well for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the first DevaCurl use, my hair felt just as greasy as before.</li>
            <li> On the first use, I noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> first week of using no-poo SUCKED.</li>
            <li> and I think it actually works better, too.</li>
            <li> So overall, I don&#x27;t love this stuff</li>
            <li> I am wondering if the formula has been changed since my first purchase of this product from another vendor.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may have noticed more hair loss than regular shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> My first time trying it - I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I only gave 4 stars because I wish the products were  more affordable.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that was able to coax my curls out.</li>
            <li> First tiem I used it I saw a difference.</li>
            <li> (&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner, when left in, makes the ends of my hair look lovely.</li>
            <li> This is was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Only sometimes, in the summer, when the weather&#x27;s more humid</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sweating more, I&#x27;ll use Low-Poo once or twice a month to get the extra oil out.</li>
            <li> Shampooing your hair can be pretty damaging, No-Poo cleans out build up and dirt without stripping my hair.</li>
            <li> This is the first &#x27;no-poo&#x27; I&#x27;ve used, after researching how to wash, treat and style curly hair.</li>
            <li> with plopping/plunking with a t-shirt, my hair stays frizz-free, touchable, soft, smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> So, I first came across Devacurl through my hairdresser.</li>
            <li> I love my DevaCurl products, but I do not use them daily.</li>
            <li> It also works magically when combined with the Shea Moisture Manuka Honey &amp; Mafura Oil Masque (when using the masque as a regular conditioner) as a way to condition your curls.</li>
            <li> The shampoo leaves my hair soft and light.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Deva !</li>
            <li> After a few more uses, I now have nice, soft wavy curls</li>
            <li> My hair is clean and soft!</li>
            <li> A little reluctant at first, reading that this formula doesn&#x27;t lather (everyone loves a good lather) but really surprised to feel how clean this product gets my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paired</li>
            <li> Other than a little frizz, all hairdressers say my hair is strong and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I actually love the smell of the shampoo but not so much the conditioner, although the shampoo smell is so strong you don&#x27;t smell the odd conditioner smell.</li>
            <li> i put a big blob in my hair and start to work on the top of my head, but i typically need to add more to the get the bottom part clean, too.</li>
            <li> On the days I wake up with flat curls or before a night out with the girls, I&#x27;ll spray this into the hair that needs more definition and scrunch it in to &amp;#34;reactivate&amp;#34; the curls.</li>
            <li> On the days I wake up with flat curls or before a night out with the girls, I&#x27;ll spray this into the hair that needs more definition and scrunch it in to &amp;#34;reactivate&amp;#34; the curls.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the smell, and it leaves my hair feeling good without all the unnecessary chemicals.</li>
            <li> The smell is so clean and the way your hair feels after washing and conditioning is so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> but your hair does feel soft and clean after using it.  </li>
            <li> Sulfates are detergent and they clean the hair completely and make the soap lather up.  </li>
            <li> The DevaCurl Como leaves my hair perfectly clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> hair doesn&#x27;t feel neither clean nor soft to the touch, after washing with this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Conditioner</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly/wavy hair that is pretty fine and prone to frizz, and I live in CO</li>
            <li> was very watery compared to the conditioner in my first order.  </li>
            <li> I am a curly girl and finally found the right products!!</li>
            <li> I have been also using it on my wavy hair and my hair is also just as frizzy on the top, still dry as well.</li>
            <li> Unrelated to the product, don&#x27;t dry your hair with a towel, it&#x27;s much better if you use a cotton t-shirt.</li>
            <li> This is worth a try if you&#x27;re willing to pay a little more, though.</li>
            <li> I will agree with most other people, that I use far more conditioner than shampoo, so be prepared to refill that early.</li>
            <li> It did make my curls look better, but it also made my scalp super greasy and heavy feeling.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair with ribbon curls, and I&#x27;ve been using No-Poo and One Condition on it religiously for years.</li>
            <li> My curls definitely feel more soft and no buildup!  </li>
            <li> I only wish they were more natural but they will have to do until I find a replacement!</li>
            <li> My curl is so soft and pretty!</li>
            <li> I will continue using this product regardless because I already see a huge change after only one week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a great fan of big suds, because they indicate harsh detergents at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It may be because I have very oily hair, but after a couple of weeks of using this my scalp had so much build up.</li>
            <li> My curls are very defined.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work wonders.</li>
            <li> It took a couple days but the packed moisture really brought out my curls and even appeared to be a 2b after continual use.</li>
            <li> Believe me, my family always asks where my curly hair came from as I used to &amp;#34;think&amp;#34; my hair was straight.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the scent of this.  </li>
            <li> Very light&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t have much time, I&#x27;ll use a blowdryer with a diffuser to speed up the process.&lt;br /&gt;8)</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t have much time, I&#x27;ll use a blowdryer with a diffuser to speed up the process.&lt;br /&gt;7)</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than Kerastase,</li>
            <li> I really like the Deva Curl products but the One Conditioner I got in this order</li>
            <li> Yes my shipment was on time and greatly appreciated</li>
            <li> Seems very moisturizing</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this stuff!</li>
            <li> My hair is in between very curly and very wavy</li>
            <li> yummy?&lt;br /&gt;2-i don&#x27;t like how much shampoo i have to use.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is very emolient and makes your hair feel hydrated.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> ; shampoo really works to remove dirt and excess oil without stripping my hair of moisture.</li>
            <li> I have very damaged hair from dying and processing</li>
            <li> I used to have straight wavy hair</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really recommend them based on cost.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I really like that there are no bubbles when using the shampoo because it feels like it isn&#x27;t cleaning my hair.</li>
            <li> The way you are told to style your hair is also very time consuming</li>
            <li> My hair feels much softer after using this product.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t do much for my curls</li>
            <li> My hair is shinier with this stuff than it ever was with silicone balms, mists, or conditioners, and much softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter has straight hair</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re taking a much healthier avenue with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I really recommended the product.</li>
            <li> My hair is so much nicer.</li>
            <li> Really detangles hair</li>
            <li> Makes the hair really shine.</li>
            <li> It works very well for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was really fly-awayish and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> This product is absolutely a god send.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how much it changed my curly hair.</li>
            <li> I really like the Devacurl combo</li>
            <li> After ONE use of this system, my hair is so much softer and prettier, with no frizz.</li>
            <li> leaves your feeling very heaver and over moisturized</li>
            <li> This purchase appears to be fragrance free, so I may get to use the entire bottles!</li>
            <li> But I enjoyed the bouncy curls and figured that if household products worked that well for curls, the professional stuff would definitely be awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i liked how my hair looks when it&#x27;s dried using this system</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and these never weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> conditioner smells like dish soap, and it is so strong that it stays on my hair for so long.</li>
            <li> It is strong and stays in your hair for too long.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try &amp;#34;grown-up&amp;#34; shampoo and to get my curls in shape, but the DevaCurl left my hair greasy and I still had frizz issues.</li>
            <li> I was excited till recently my hair turned into a rats nest of unholey stuck together gobs of silicone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the products, better used every other day as the moisturizing properties make my hair&lt;</li>
            <li> I have super fine hair and this doesn&#x27;t weight it down at all!</li>
            <li> The rinse-out steps do rinse out clean, so you may need that last &amp;#34;no rinse&amp;#34; step.</li>
            <li> not sure what separates it from other store or salon bought products, but this line is incredible.</li>
            <li> My hair is coarse and frizzy and these two products really make it smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I air-dried my hair as usual and my curls were flatter than and lifeless compared to the shampoo I have been using from The Honest Company.</li>
            <li> I have less frizz and more controlled curl.</li>
            <li> It is less frizzy and the curl just lays better.</li>
            <li> so be realistic.</li>
            <li> Do some research on how to properly care for your curls and try this product, you&#x27;ll most likely be amazed at those locks of beauty.</li>
            <li> It got rid of the grease, cleaned my scalp but left my roots super</li>
            <li> dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a particular scent--somewhat candy-like--but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> My curls started looking more scrunchy &amp; stiff from all of my previous products and straightening my hair to amazing curly q soft curls.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend this to all people with curly hair.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> (3b type, highly porous)</li>
            <li> My hair can vary from wavy to soft ringlets, and I was expecting this product-based off reviews- to make my curls more defined and less fizzy... not so much.</li>
            <li> leaves my hair looking and feeling dirty, doesn&#x27;t smell very good either</li>
            <li> My curls are very well define and soft.  </li>
            <li> I discovered these products a few years ago and LOVE them.</li>
            <li> The shampoo does have a fairly distinct smell (I want to say witch hazel or something similar, but in not 100% on that)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, didn&#x27;t see any difference after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> They are much more spirally and less frizzy!</li>
            <li> We live in South Carolina near the beach and let&#x27;s just say my hair really doesn&#x27;t do well in the humidity.</li>
            <li> I have wavy (2a) dry hair, and this product is a lot better than using regular shampoo (with sulfates) because it doesn&#x27;t strip my hair of all the oils.</li>
            <li> My hair was more loose and definitely shinier.</li>
            <li> If the smell of baby powder isn&#x27;t one you like I suggest looking at other sulfate free shampoos.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super creamy to keep your hair from getting too dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy the No-Poo again because I actually believe it left my hair so soft &amp; easy to manage.</li>
            <li> As others have noted, the odor of the conditioner is odd and strong.  </li>
            <li> so maybe my hair&#x27;s oil production needs to calm down and regulate first.</li>
            <li> so maybe my hair&#x27;s oil production needs to calm down and regulate first.</li>
            <li> My damaged locks feels moisturized and when styled, they look and feel very soft and bouncy.  </li>
            <li> I recommend to use the no poo as opposed to the low poo, the low poo tends to strip my sensitive hair &amp; make it look just as the cheap products did</li>
            <li> ALL SIGNS YOU HAVE NATURALLY CURLY HAIR!</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioning system has completely transformed my hair!</li>
            <li> My hair was more &#x27;crispy&#x27; on the ends than usual too.</li>
            <li> Even my hair stylist asked what I have been using since my hair was so soft and shiny!  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t figure out what I was doing differently than when I first tried them.  </li>
            <li> Trust yourselves, Go natural &amp; get your Deva products!</li>
            <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve found that actually works on my hair.  </li>
            <li> products are light so my hair is not weighted down...</li>
            <li> I have curls that are unruly and get dried out easily from going to the beach often.</li>
            <li> I read tons of positive reviews on the No Poo prior to purchasing it.</li>
            <li> Very happy to find it less expensive than&lt;br /&gt;mainstream department stores.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice that my curls were any more or less improved for the short time I used these.</li>
            <li> Too heavy for my fine wavy hair.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s a winter month, I run a little bit of light oil through my tips to seal in moisture</li>
            <li> and when I use a curling iron or a curling wand to give it a little more oomph, the style will actually hold</li>
            <li> I may have to try the DevaCare next time for a little more moisture.</li>
            <li> Contrary to the pictures, the shampoo and conditioner are in identical bottles, which makes it really hard to differentiate between the two--not that you would be able to tell the difference from the consistency, since they both feel like conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your hair feeling clear without residue.</li>
            <li> I would say if you have a sensitive scalp and have to use sulfate-free hair products as I, then I probably would not buy this.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural beauty.</li>
            <li> But once you get into the routine, it&#x27;s much quicker and easier than constantly trying to straighten hair that wasn&#x27;t designed to be that way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But once you get into the routine, it&#x27;s much quicker and easier than constantly trying to straighten hair that wasn&#x27;t designed to be that way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With this product, my hair is really greasy in the back of my head</li>
            <li> I wear my hair naturally curly</li>
            <li> The conditioner helps control the frizz and makes your hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> As far as repairing and healing properties go</li>
            <li> it took so much time and then as soon as I walked outside...</li>
            <li> but I will say I had a woman stop me in a store today to ask if my hair was naturally curly.</li>
            <li> Every hairdresser I&#x27;ve had since I started using this has commented on how soft my hair is.</li>
            <li> The combination of both products leaves my hair soft and curly...without the frizz.  </li>
            <li> I basically use it every day and am look to purchase the 32oz bottle, makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> but I feel any old conditioner words as well as One Condition.</li>
            <li> Also, you don&#x27;t have to use as much product per use as the &amp;#34;Wen&amp;#34; system requires, so a bottle should last a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am completely hooked.  </li>
            <li> It smells like old woman perfume-overly flowery.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve only used this twice (plus the intense moisturizer).  </li>
            <li> The Shampoo doesn&#x27;t work for my natural curly hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was using Purelogy line before and going back to it as fast as I can.</li>
            <li> I recommend you go online and watch the videos the company offers on it&#x27;s use.  </li>
            <li> My hair is soft and controlled.</li>
            <li> I am completely amazed at how well Deva Curl products work.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and this stuff loves naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I have to use way too much it for having relatively short hair.</li>
            <li> The conditioner leaves everything feeling soft.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft, looks shiny (not in a squeaky-clean way), and produces oil a lot more slowly.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s thick and needs a lot of moisture to look healthy.</li>
            <li> long, thick hair used to be shiny and smooth and now it&#x27;s kind of a mess with tangles and grease.</li>
            <li> long, thick hair used to be shiny and smooth and now it&#x27;s kind of a mess with tangles and grease.</li>
            <li> i am never going back to normal shampoo again!</li>
            <li> I mean, even dandruff shampoo was better than this.  </li>
            <li> She told me that was because the typical shampoos and conditioners that you buy at places like Target or the drugstore typically dry out your hair and if you have more of a wavy curl, they completely take away whatever curl your hair has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She told me I had curly hair, which I didn&#x27;t believe at first because my hair had always been super straight and would never, ever hold a curl not matter what I tried (curling irons, curling wands, hot rollers, foam rollers, tying my hair up in damp twisted knots overnight, dozens of different types of hair sprays and mousse, etc.).</li>
            <li> Packaged well for no mess shipping.  </li>
            <li> I typically wash my hair every third or fourth day, but with this product I may have wash more frequently until my scalp adjusts.</li>
            <li> I only have to use very little product for it to work - love it.</li>
            <li> I figured I didn&#x27;t use enough, so I tried using more of the product and less of the conditioner the next time.</li>
            <li> Stripped clean of the silicone after a few vinegar rinses followed by these two products.</li>
            <li> It has also quickly cleared up the dandruff that my previous cowash had been causing.</li>
            <li> But I cannot live without One Condition regardless of the season; it gives my dry ends life and softness without ever weighing down my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this brand.  </li>
            <li> it is hard to get the spray down to my scalp, so i usually just use the awesome shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly white girl hair and this seems to leave my hair feeling less clean than it was before using it.  </li>
            <li> It is not how much shampoo/conditioner you use, it is how long you leave it there.</li>
            <li> She is blonde, her hair is super dry and curly, and she is only 7 years old</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use the shampoo every day because the build up left is too heavy on my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine and thin curly hair that gets snarled</li>
            <li> between washes: I have a little spray bottle filled with water and some One-Conditioner mixed together.</li>
            <li> It is long, thick, frizzy, VERY tangled, and gets oily very quickly.</li>
            <li> By the third wash, my hair was so sticky and gross, it looked like I had used too much styling product</li>
            <li> I felt a little  weird washing my hair with the cleanser without any lather but the result was pretty good.</li>
            <li> One Condition provides just the right amount of moisture to my hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> it simply doesn&#x27;t go very far.</li>
            <li> I first got this, I threw decided to take a chance and throw all my other shampoos/conditioners out.</li>
            <li> My barely wavy hair gets curl when I use this correctly!</li>
            <li> As with all other Deva products (I have the ultra defining gel and deep conditioner), is water-soluble so washes right out with water.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> highly recommend especially for mixed hair!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely the product leaving the residue; it doesn&#x27;t smell like my hair&#x27;s natural oils.</li>
            <li> Both the No Poo and the conditioner left my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> So far, this has been the only thing that has worked for my hair.</li>
            <li> i have medium length VERY curly / frizzy hair that is pretty thick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although this product was nice, I will not be buying again because it is too expensive.</li>
            <li> My curls are enhanced &amp; look better than ever when using these products as directed and whenever I stray away, my curls are dull, dry, &amp; basically non existent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a little weird getting used to non sudsing shampoo, but it works &amp; smells great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had success with other DevaCurl products for my sometimes dry curly hair.</li>
            <li> Seriously this is a fantastic product if you have coarse-thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I have been straightening my hair for the last five years and have only come to accept my naturally curly hair through Deva Curl and the Curly Girl Method.</li>
            <li> I was tired of trying yet another  product that promised soft smooth curls</li>
            <li> Felt super heavy and waxy, had to strip my hair and go back to my regular routine.</li>
            <li> Works on fine, straight, thin (but very dry) hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo gets RAVE reviews, but it rally did nothing  for her hair, it is just as tangled, hard to brush and frizzy on the top as with any other shampoo.</li>
            <li> Since there are no silicones in in, you don&#x27;t get the super slick silicone feeling that you would with regular silicone</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to use these products because an employee at Ulta told me it might make my hair oily quicker than other products but in using them, I can now actually comb through my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the fence about the no-poo thing, but I still may stop using this product simply because I can barely stand the scent.</li>
            <li> The first few times I used just the no poo cleanser</li>
            <li> The first few times I used just the no poo cleanser</li>
            <li> I noticed after the first few uses my hair was curlier.</li>
            <li> I however do not particularly like the smell so much but so long as it does what I need</li>
            <li> I bought a small travel kit to give it a try on my own and at first I really disliked it because some of my hair only had a small wave, other parts had a little more of a curl, and other parts of it were still stick-straight</li>
            <li> I normally blow dry and the use a flat iron.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair really soft, but unless I blow dry it, my hair looks greasy.</li>
            <li> Doing that and using a diffuser with this product gives me above average curls, but my hair is really poofy/borderline frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have super curly and thick hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Third, my hair has always been super thick with a bit of a wave/curl.</li>
            <li> I have 2a hair, which means it&#x27;s fine, thin, &amp; has an &amp;#34;S&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Split ends have decreased tremendously!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the no-poo and one conditioner for the past few days, and maybe the DevaCurl gel or cream is a must if you want it to work, but I&#x27;ve stuck with my normal Moroccan Oil styling products seeing as I didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money on a whole new line.  </li>
            <li> Regular Shampoos dry the hair out over time and makes it harder to actually condition the hair (very counterproductive to deep conditioning).</li>
            <li> The cleanser has  a weird smell to it because it&#x27;s a plain non-scented  product, but the conditoner leaves your hair smelling good.</li>
            <li> When dry, it doesn&#x27;t feel any less thick, I just think I notice more in the drain.</li>
            <li> I add half deva curl half normal shampoo and use the conditioner like normal</li>
            <li> Even though I occasionally use a flat iron, I will never switch products again.</li>
            <li> I have very curly and frizzy hair and have been using this conditioner for the past month.  </li>
            <li> my hair is too flat.</li>
            <li> IT does moisturize however If you like to flat iron your hair</li>
            <li> It dries out easily, especially in the northeast winters with cranked up indoor heating and dry freezing air, and responds well to lighter moisture enhancing products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I want some extra &amp;#34;oomph&amp;#34;, I&#x27;ll add the Ultra-Defining gel and dry with a diffuser.</li>
            <li> and I want some extra &amp;#34;oomph&amp;#34;, I&#x27;ll add the Ultra-Defining gel and dry with a diffuser.</li>
            <li> I have been using another known curly hair products but their stuff is way to drying and left my hair frizzy and my curls dry.  </li>
            <li> Coarse, curly hair is not as stripped and dry.</li>
            <li> tried other similar products, came back to this</li>
            <li> The Deva products are more expensive than other products</li>
            <li> My frizzy hair days are less frequent and hair does not feel dry and wiry.</li>
            <li> It may be that hard water is the real culprit and that no products can compensate.  </li>
            <li> only complaint about this product is that it is a little pricey, but I think that it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> But on thinner, younger strands it just makes hair look wet.</li>
            <li> and my hair is really long</li>
            <li> Held the curls in all days long</li>
            <li> Still a long way to go</li>
            <li> What this does do is give me oily roots, which clearly I am not looking for.</li>
            <li> I reviewed this previously, giving you the information about article in LATimes &amp;#34;Ask Angel&amp;#34; about her using this product to shampoo her hair for last ten years instead of detergent shampoo.</li>
            <li> will never go back to any other type of store products for my hair  </li>
            <li> I will use every other washing in combination with a low sulfate shampoo and conditioner, but I will put a dab of the One Condition in as a leave in conditioner no matter what I use to cleanse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other &amp;#34;no lather&amp;#34; products and end up with buildup and an overall yucky feeling, but not with this stuff!</li>
            <li> Silicones in normal conditioner mask the problem for a while, but actually make the internal dryness worse.  </li>
            <li> I have been using deva curl products for the last year &amp; JUST recently started using the shampoo &amp; conditioner &amp; even though it is a little pricey, I can&#x27;t use anything else.  </li>
            <li> I keep buying it periodically and using it as long as I can, then give it away!  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t feel they did the trick as the other products left my hair oily.</li>
            <li> Once dry, I scrunch again to loosen out the curls and get volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once dry, I scrunch again to loosen out the curls and get volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but my daughter has really dry curly hair and I had to try it.</li>
            <li> and now it&#x27;s gone dry but curly.  </li>
            <li> not-curly hair is chemically damaged, so it needs a lot of moisture to keep it from looking and feeling dry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair and it maintains the luster.</li>
            <li> My curls are DRY, DRY, DRY with tons of fly-aways.  </li>
            <li> No longer have dry scalp or flakes.</li>
            <li> My wife can not live without</li>
            <li> The One Conditioner I received was clearly watered down and made my scalp extremely itchy for days!  </li>
            <li> your hair is extra dry, tangly, or has natural texture you want to enhance, I would suggest using a little bit of the conditioner in your towel dried hair for detangling and softness.</li>
            <li> It took me a few tries to figure out how much of the No Poo I needed to use (too little, and your hair will end up a bit greasy), but after that I&#x27;ve had no issues.</li>
            <li> Also, I wasn&#x27;t too crazy about the smell when I sniffed a sample a while back, but now that I&#x27;ve actually used it, I find that it&#x27;s not too bothersome and leaves a fresh scent in my tresses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been addicted to washing my hair before, but now, I almost crave it ;)</li>
            <li> I have loose wavy/curly hair and my daughter has spiral curls.</li>
            <li> Takes my hair from curly waves to loose ringlets.</li>
            <li> I can get spirals if I twirl wet strands around my finger and let it dry like that.</li>
            <li> Same stuff, half the price.</li>
            <li> so it is a very dry climate.</li>
            <li> and it just seemed like a total mess.</li>
            <li> The curls are a mess after the wash and it requires several additional product to style them.</li>
            <li> You have actual curls not the stringy mess you get with mousses or gels.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is the smell - a little too minty.  </li>
            <li> The other thing is that I got a haircut where the stylist cut my hair dry to even out my hair based on its tendencies (which you cannot see when wet).</li>
            <li> Products arrived faster than expected.  </li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s the mental image</li>
            <li> Use One-Condition as leave-in conditioner on soaking wet hair, squeeze out the excess.</li>
            <li> Use One-Condition as leave-in conditioner on soaking wet hair, squeeze out the excess.</li>
            <li> I used to use this product a few years back</li>
            <li> I actually also went for a haircut to the Devachan Salon and I&#x27;ve been using the DevaCurl for a few months now, and I can say it does truly make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I would end up pulling it back into a ponytail or messy bun.</li>
            <li> Not even the wet brush.</li>
            <li> The cleanser smells like a cross between a heavy duty institutional cleaner and an herb garden.</li>
            <li> Spent a lot of money on this product that I won&#x27;t use again.</li>
            <li> it left it greasy and feeling as though there was a thick residue left over no matter</li>
            <li> Currently, I No-Poo once a week and Co-wash daily or every other day depending on if I&#x27;m running late in the mornings for work.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, coarse, curly....</li>
            <li> These products haven&#x27;t had a big effect on my hair except perhaps making it sleeker (less fluffy) &amp; flatter.  </li>
            <li> My recommendation; buy it at Harmon&#x27;s or any other store you can return the used product to if you don&#x27;t like it, that way you can return it &amp;</li>
            <li> Sometimes I step out of the shower and leave it in my hair while doing other things around the house.</li>
            <li> BUT...I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s attributable to the product or my idea that I might lose hair when using it because I read other reviews of this product before purchasing.</li>
            <li> my hair dries the radiance due to this duo.</li>
            <li> I usually wash my hair every 2 days but with this duo I felt that I had to wash every other day - No big deal though.</li>
            <li> saw other reviews that they didn&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li> My hair has changes due to thyroid issues.  </li>
            <li> Shampoo and condition every other day, medium length hair</li>
            <li> shampoo reminds me of Noxema face cleanser, or cold cream; it feels a bit cool, and it cleanses, but isn&#x27;t soapy.</li>
            <li> I have tried other no poo shampoos</li>
            <li> all may sound complicated and like it&#x27;s too hard to follow.</li>
            <li> all may sound complicated and like it&#x27;s too hard to follow.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, some people have mentioned this is an imitation product.</li>
            <li> and I think regular shampoo was only making it worse.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t they work a little harder a something</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think this stuff they sell is the real deal, it smells the same but my hair hated it!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really put my finger on the conditioner, but it&#x27;s just weird.  </li>
            <li> Really good, cleansing shampoo with none of the nasty stuff.  </li>
            <li> I am not at all a fan of this development, but I&#x27;ve been diligently waiting a month to see if my hair calms down and evens itself out in regards to oil production.</li>
            <li> My hair wasn&#x27;t weighed down at all.</li>
            <li> Then of course those products weighed my hair down and attracted dirt.</li>
            <li> No frizz and nothing weighs it down.  </li>
            <li> But, if you have the slightest wave (hair gets frizzy when humid, you notice little curls close to your scalp or underneath hair by neckline, or your &amp;#34;straight&amp;#34; hair curls up to one side while the other side flips another way)</li>
            <li> When I called my hairdresser to tell her about it, she told me that was because it would take a little time to reverse the damage done by the other shampoos and conditioners I had been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Your hair maybe semi-greasy for a few weeks while doing every other day washes, but your hair will adjust.</li>
            <li> I grew tired of the blow dry and flat iron routine..</li>
            <li> My hair is less frizzy and I wash it less often.</li>
            <li> The scent is slightly minty-</li>
            <li> I do have curly hair and this product makes it look like a greasy stringy mess.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I wasn&#x27;t crazy about it and worried I had made a mistake.  </li>
            <li> It is extremely thick and frizzy and long.  </li>
            <li> It tones down after a few hours though.</li>
            <li> I have tight curly hair</li>
            <li> Now I shampoo once or twice a week; I condition every day, and my hair never looks dull and dry.</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick &amp; kinky curly hair.</li>
            <li> The shampoo does not clean my scalp at all.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that would make my curls look less frizzy, and this did for a few days.</li>
            <li> Not having a lather shampoo takes a little getting use to</li>
            <li> Have used just the shampoo for a little over a week now</li>
            <li> Finally going with my wonky curls!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to ever use any other product!!</li>
            <li> Some hairdressers think that hair gets dull without sulfate cleansing (probably because hair products remain on the hair) and that the anti-sulfate movement is a trend and not a real health or beauty issue.  </li>
            <li> Do not be afraid to use too much.</li>
            <li> Do not be afraid to use too much.</li>
            <li> It is gentle but doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling dirty.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m damaging my hair all the time by shampooing everyday.</li>
            <li> no money wasted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting to post a review for a few weeks because I wanted my hair to get used to the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not horrible, but it smells a lot like sunscreen or some sort of repellent.</li>
            <li> does not leave my hair heavy but leaves it moisturized and manageable.</li>
            <li> It did take my hair a few weeks to adapt to these products.</li>
            <li> I tried three gels and didn&#x27;t like any of them because they made my hair heavy and somewhat sticky although they all pumped up the volume and added a lot of texture.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;a bit heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few friends recommend this brand to me</li>
            <li> I used to shampoo every two or three weeks because it dried out my hair, and it took a week or two and a number of products to restore shine and moisture.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t waste my $ with this brand again...</li>
            <li> I really disliked how these smelled.</li>
            <li> It made my hair heavy and it seemed to pull the curl out.</li>
            <li> The texture changed in a few uses.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thin, slightly wavy hair.</li>
            <li> They are less $$!</li>
            <li> It has a horrible smell and the smell is very strong.  </li>
            <li> I had tried WEN in the past, which caused a reaction, so I was a little nervous with this product.  </li>
            <li> As a curly haired girl, I have always subjected my hair to straighteners, Brazillian Blow Outs, flat irons and, despite the conditioners and extreme conditioners, my hair was in very poor condition.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product for anyone with curly hair that is not super thick.</li>
            <li> Then one day, I got frustrated and used TOO MUCH.</li>
            <li> frankly they usually don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> it was the product, but for the fact that I ran out before my Amazon order arrived so I went and bought a small bottle of each to tide me over.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about it.</li>
            <li> Just too expensive to use on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Which is not the usual feel of highlighted curly hair.</li>
            <li> No more sulfate shampoo</li>
            <li> and this system has smoothed my hair, decreased the frizz and has allowed me to use less styling products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time figuring out what will hold her hair in place and keep it from getting frizzy and</li>
            <li> But do yourself a favor and give it at least a week or two before you write it off.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that I have never liked.</li>
            <li> As wonky as it is...</li>
            <li> hair type: thick and curly</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair which is frizzy on the ends.  </li>
            <li> Hair looks unbelievable!</li>
            <li> What I HAVE noticed is serious increase in tangles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was still skeptical, but she used Devacurl on my hair and there was a little bit of a wave.</li>
            <li> Not good for me.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this entire line of products.</li>
            <li> Im not a person that usually buys expensive products</li>
            <li> i bought these hoping the other reviewers were wrong regarding the smell, but unfortunately they were spot on.</li>
            <li> but the smell is pretty horrible.</li>
            <li> I hate it at the same time sometimes.</li>
            <li> (it is easier since it is a no-lather shampoo); when using the conditioner, squeeze the water out of your hair before you apply, massage it and leave it there while you soap up or sing a few songs in the shower (it also helps leaving a bit in, and if won&#x27;t feel dirty or soapy).&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> The worst shampoo and conditioner I ever purchased; it felt like plastic on my curls and made it absolutely unmanageable</li>
            <li> My hair is just too oily to use this product regularly (which is a disappointment because it is expensive!), but I use it every 3 days or so.</li>
            <li> I hate using product everyday and having to shampoo everyday but DevaCurl No-Poo Cleanser has helped a ton!</li>
            <li> After using No Poo and the conditioner for 4 washes I saw a dramatic difference.</li>
            <li> Maybe this product works well for girls with super-dry curls, but my average hair and my poor broken-out skin hate it.</li>
            <li> I No more have bad hair days.</li>
            <li> Must be these bottles are from a bad batch of shampoo and conditioner, and too late to return them.  </li>
            <li> Expensive, but this combo helps.</li>
            <li> That being said, a printer can make fake labels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s somewhat expensive to pay $30.64 for a 12oz duo.</li>
            <li> What am I doing wrong?</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel dirty, scalp itches and hair is greasy the day after I wash it.  </li>
            <li> I look and SMELL like a geriatric poodle after a bath (it stinks like dog shampoo and perm solution).  </li>
            <li> In the description it says this is the Devacurl, and since my hair is treated or colored, this is highly inconvenient.</li>
            <li> It smells horrible and totally dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> Wrong!</li>
            <li> Deva curl is very expensive in the store</li>
            <li> Overwhelmingly bad product smell, but you get used to it.ngles.</li>
            <li> Overwhelmingly bad product smell, but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> This stuff irritated my scalp so bad I had to treat it with Apple Cider Vinegar for a week.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not all that bad.</li>
            <li> the shampoo made my scalp itch, painfully.  </li>
            <li> However, I am kinda of disappointed in the results of my curls.</li>
            <li> I can say I am disappointed with this.</li>
            <li> All in all I just hate the product.  </li>
            <li> I hate spending money on products that can&#x27;t deliver.  </li>
            <li> It also smelled horrible.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> i am never going back to normal shampoo again! Love this!... maybe could smell a little better though :)</li>
            <li> Great product - strong hair</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try &amp;#34;grown-up&amp;#34; shampoo and to get my curls in shape, but the DevaCurl left my hair greasy and I still had frizz issues. I stopped using regular shampoo and conditioner over a month ago and switched to baking soda and apple cider vinegar, but I was getting a lot of frizz and eventually my hair started getting a bit greasy at the scalp. But I enjoyed the bouncy curls and figured that if household products worked that well for curls, the professional stuff would definitely be awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first DevaCurl use, my hair felt just as greasy as before. I figured I didn&#x27;t use enough, so I tried using more of the product and less of the conditioner the next time. Nope, my hair felt even greasier. By the third wash, my hair was so sticky and gross, it looked like I had used too much styling product and I couldn&#x27;t touch my hair without getting greasy residue on my fingers. Literally, there is enough gunk in my hair to leave marks on my paper at work. It&#x27;s definitely the product leaving the residue; it doesn&#x27;t smell like my hair&#x27;s natural oils. Maybe this product works well for girls with super-dry curls, but my average hair and my poor broken-out skin hate it.</li>
            <li> I have super curly hair and as much as I love it I hate it at the same time sometimes. I hate using product everyday and having to shampoo everyday but DevaCurl No-Poo Cleanser has helped a ton! I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m damaging my hair all the time by shampooing everyday.</li>
            <li> will never go back to any other type of store products for my hair  Deva is my choice</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say this really does any good for my hair.  I have naturally curly white girl hair and this seems to leave my hair feeling less clean than it was before using it.  I have found that just using a silicone free conditioner as a cleanser works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Once you get over the fact that there is no foam &amp;#34;poo&amp;#34; you love that you don&#x27;t have to wait until putting your conditioner to feel how soft your hair is. Also it helps my hair curl better naturally.</li>
            <li> My hair is less frizzy and I wash it less often. My curls look great!</li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving this three stars is because I actually like the conditioner.  The shampoo does not clean my scalp at all.  It may be because I have very oily hair, but after a couple of weeks of using this my scalp had so much build up.</li>
            <li> Products arrived faster than expected.  I like the fragrance.. it does have a fresh clean citrus smell.  The only problem I have with it is:  it makes leaves a waxy layer on my scalp and makes my scalp itch.  I would say if you have a sensitive scalp and have to use sulfate-free hair products as I, then I probably would not buy this.  I have tried Wen products also and those products do the same for me.  Sometimes you just have to try a product to find it if it will work for you.  I love the concept of no-poo hair cleanser.....just have not found one yet that works for me.</li>
            <li> I love both the no poo and the one conditioner. My hair feels clean, but not dried out, and it looks much better. My curls are very defined. The conditioner is great as a leave in too.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Great Product! This is definitely as staple.</li>
            <li> I have oily, wavy hair. I was looking for a product that would make my curls look less frizzy, and this did for a few days. My hair is just too oily to use this product regularly (which is a disappointment because it is expensive!), but I use it every 3 days or so. I tried using exclusively for a few weeks to get my hair to adjust and stop producing so much oil, but it never happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have oily hair and need to wash every day, I would skip this.</li>
            <li> Great product and excellent price.</li>
            <li> As others have noted, the odor of the conditioner is odd and strong.  It&#x27;s the type of scent that might be worn by an elderly grandmother attending a seance in eastern Europe in the 1800s -- that&#x27;s the mental image I have when I apply it.  These products haven&#x27;t had a big effect on my hair except perhaps making it sleeker (less fluffy) &amp; flatter.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll continuing using them &amp; perhaps try for a different brand of shampoo-less cleansers with a different scent.  Before purchasing, I&#x27;d advise finding the product in a store &amp; sniff-testing the conditioner.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work wonders. I have 2a hair, which means it&#x27;s fine, thin, &amp; has an &amp;#34;S&amp;#34; wave to it. I also color it blonde so that doesn&#x27;t help. When I use shampoo or cheap products, it shows. It took a couple days but the packed moisture really brought out my curls and even appeared to be a 2b after continual use. If you have even the slightest wave &amp; just can&#x27;t figure out what to do with your hair, give this product a shot. I recommend to use the no poo as opposed to the low poo, the low poo tends to strip my sensitive hair &amp; make it look just as the cheap products did (I&#x27;m learning no poo is the way to go, period!). Use the no poo followed by the one condition. Comb with wide tooth brush or pull apart strands with fingers (hair is always curlier using this no harsh brush method). I&#x27;ve used the volumizing foam &amp; the ArcAngel, but I prefer the foam, honestly. Mister right works wonders for a day after touch up! Apparently the B&#x27;leave in is superb for 2a&#x27;s as well, so I&#x27;m going to give that a shot as it&#x27;s supposed to add extra volume. My curls are enhanced &amp; look better than ever when using these products as directed and whenever I stray away, my curls are dull, dry, &amp; basically non existent. It&#x27;s well worth the money to go from looking like a hobo to having gorgeous locks that even I can&#x27;t stop looking at &amp; others compliment. My recommendation; buy it at Harmon&#x27;s or any other store you can return the used product to if you don&#x27;t like it, that way you can return it &amp; no money wasted. But do yourself a favor and give it at least a week or two before you write it off. Also, if you have pin straight hair, this isn&#x27;t going to make your hair magically curly so be realistic. But, if you have the slightest wave (hair gets frizzy when humid, you notice little curls close to your scalp or underneath hair by neckline, or your &amp;#34;straight&amp;#34; hair curls up to one side while the other side flips another way) ALL SIGNS YOU HAVE NATURALLY CURLY HAIR! You just need to learn to give it some TLC &amp; bring out it&#x27;s natural beauty. Believe me, my family always asks where my curly hair came from as I used to &amp;#34;think&amp;#34; my hair was straight. Wrong! Do some research on how to properly care for your curls and try this product, you&#x27;ll most likely be amazed at those locks of beauty.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the scent of this.  It has a very strong odor and tends to make my skin itch. I like the idea of not washing my hair with detergent like most shampoos but will try to find something else that is more natural and smells better.</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I have super curly and thick hair. I discovered these products a few years ago and LOVE them. Great for dry hair and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Great product. I have NO split ends and my hair stylist says it&#x27;s because of the shampoo I use. My hair feels wonderful!</li>
            <li> As a curly haired girl, I have always subjected my hair to straighteners, Brazillian Blow Outs, flat irons and, despite the conditioners and extreme conditioners, my hair was in very poor condition.  I thought my hair would not grow when, in reality, it was breaking.  A curly haired friend sent me these products and the book written by the maker of these products.  On the first use, I noticed a difference.  I love how my hair feels and have learned so much about the care and growing of curly hair.  Even though I occasionally use a flat iron, I will never switch products again.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, coarse, curly....ok ADHD, hair and my hairdresser said to try this. I am always reluctant to pay the price for hair products because...well...frankly they usually don&#x27;t work. I am happy to say that I have noticed a difference in my hair since using this product. I guess you could say it&#x27;s like Ritalin for my ADHD locks ;) This along with my Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream are my hair&#x27;s new best friends!</li>
            <li> These are very interesting since we are all use to bubbles/foam to clean our hair.  Not the case and my daughter turned me on to these.  They are more natural and you do feel lilke your hair is clean.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is the smell - a little too minty.  But easy to deal with.</li>
            <li> Nice scents. Can&#x27;t use the shampoo every day because the build up left is too heavy on my fine hair. On day one, I use a low sulfate shampoo (Loreal&#x27;s for curly hair) with the diva conditioner, then nothing the next day except maybe a scrunch in some water. On the third day I use diva no-poo and conditioner, fourth day no-poo sometimes w/conditioner sometimes not. By the fifth day, it&#x27;s time for a low sulfate shampoo again. One hair dresser said to put baking soda in the no-poo as an alternative to using the low sulfate shampoo, but I think that&#x27;s a pain. The conditioner seems to work better if I don&#x27;t thoroughly rinse it out. I rinse the roots well, but try to leave a bit on the ends of my hair. The no-poo must be thoroughly rinsed out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product so far. It took me a few tries to figure out how much of the No Poo I needed to use (too little, and your hair will end up a bit greasy), but after that I&#x27;ve had no issues. My hair feels soft, looks shiny (not in a squeaky-clean way), and produces oil a lot more slowly. It has also quickly cleared up the dandruff that my previous cowash had been causing. Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t used this before, I&#x27;d suggest trying out the Deva Curl Travel Kit to decide if you like these products before buying the full-size versions.</li>
            <li> Ok, let me first tell you my hair-type (for the curlies reading this review and debating whether or not to take a chance on this product). I&#x27;m 2c/3a with very fine, porous curly hair. It dries out easily, especially in the northeast winters with cranked up indoor heating and dry freezing air, and responds well to lighter moisture enhancing products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got this, I threw decided to take a chance and throw all my other shampoos/conditioners out. Here is what happened:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first week of using no-poo SUCKED. I wasn&#x27;t used to the no-lather, and initially didn&#x27;t use enough. The result was a greasy head. Then one day, I got frustrated and used TOO MUCH. It got rid of the grease, cleaned my scalp but left my roots super dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick, it turned out was to figure out the right amount for me. Once that first week passed, I fell IN LOVE. Now I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else. My curls have never looked better, and I keep getting compliments from strangers, friends and family who keep asking me if they&#x27;re real!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Very light&lt;br /&gt;- As with all other Deva products (I have the ultra defining gel and deep conditioner), is water-soluble so washes right out with water.&lt;br /&gt;- Some people will disagree with me but.... the smell!&lt;br /&gt;- The One-Conditioner is AWESOME!!! I use it to condition my hair, as leave in conditioner, and as a curl refresher in between washes (explanation in my routine described below)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;- The price&lt;br /&gt;- I use up the conditioner at 2-3 times the rate as the shampoo, so can no longer buy this in the set. I had to order the conditioner separately after the one from this set ran out.&lt;br /&gt;- The no-lather shampoo takes some getting used to, but it was completely worth the patience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my routine for those wondering how to use these products to maximize their curls:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deep conditioning days (x2 a week in the winter, 1x a week rest of the year):&lt;br /&gt;1) Wash hair with no-poo, rinse out.&lt;br /&gt;2) Condition with one-conditioner, rinse out.&lt;br /&gt;3) Deep condition with Deva Heaven in Hair. Sometimes I step out of the shower and leave it in my hair while doing other things around the house. Most times I twist my hair up, and leave it in for 15-20 mins while I shave my legs, brush my teeth, ect. The steam from the shower helps to open up the hair follicles and suck in all the goodness.&lt;br /&gt;4) Rinse out the deep conditioner&lt;br /&gt;5) Use One-Condition as leave-in conditioner on soaking wet hair, squeeze out the excess. **VERY IMPORTANT: Do not be afraid to use too much. The excess will be squeezed out, and your curls will look amazing. I can always tell the difference when my hair doesn&#x27;t have enough conditioner in it **&lt;br /&gt;6) Put in Deva Ultra defining gel and scrunch my hair&lt;br /&gt;7) Air-dry. If I don&#x27;t have much time, I&#x27;ll use a blowdryer with a diffuser to speed up the process.&lt;br /&gt;8) Flip my head over, &amp;#34;crack&amp;#34; the gel casing around my set curls and run my hands through the roots for added volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regular wash days (2x a week since I workout often and get sweaty)&lt;br /&gt;1) Wash hair with no-poo, rinse out.&lt;br /&gt;2) Condition with one-conditioner, rinse out.&lt;br /&gt;3) Use One-Condition as leave-in conditioner on soaking wet hair, squeeze out the excess. **VERY IMPORTANT: Do not be afraid to use too much. The excess will be squeezed out, and your curls will look amazing. I can always tell the difference when my hair doesn&#x27;t have enough conditioner in it **&lt;br /&gt;4) If it&#x27;s a winter month, I run a little bit of light oil through my tips to seal in moisture&lt;br /&gt;5) Put in Deva Ultra defining gel and scrunch my hair&lt;br /&gt;6) Air-dry. If I don&#x27;t have much time, I&#x27;ll use a blowdryer with a diffuser to speed up the process.&lt;br /&gt;7) Flip my head over, &amp;#34;crack&amp;#34; the gel casing around my set curls and run my hands through the roots for added volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In between washes: I have a little spray bottle filled with water and some One-Conditioner mixed together. On the days I wake up with flat curls or before a night out with the girls, I&#x27;ll spray this into the hair that needs more definition and scrunch it in to &amp;#34;reactivate&amp;#34; the curls. If it&#x27;s a night out and I want some extra &amp;#34;oomph&amp;#34;, I&#x27;ll add the Ultra-Defining gel and dry with a diffuser. Once dry, I scrunch again to loosen out the curls and get volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This all may sound complicated and like it&#x27;s too hard to follow. But once you get into the routine, it&#x27;s much quicker and easier than constantly trying to straighten hair that wasn&#x27;t designed to be that way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review was helpful.d with water and some One-Conditioner mixed together.

            <li> It&#x27;s great for curly hair!</li>
            <li> I have loose wavy/curly hair and my daughter has spiral curls. I know there&#x27;s so sort of number letter system for curls but I don&#x27;t know what we are. Anyway, I actually love the smell of the shampoo but not so much the conditioner, although the shampoo smell is so strong you don&#x27;t smell the odd conditioner smell. Not having a lather shampoo takes a little getting use to but overall I am very happy with the product. On my daughters hair especially. I&#x27;ve had a hard time figuring out what will hold her hair in place and keep it from getting frizzy and this combo is perfect.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it smells great and leaves my curls very soft. I get a bunch of compliments too.</li>
            <li> got this to put in my traveling pack perfect size..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d read a review of this stuff so tried it.  I love it.  It really does make my hair (colored for years) softer and nice.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but this combo helps. And the product seems to be working, though I still need a curl activating cream afterward and don&#x27;t have much success using this conditioner as a leave-in. But it works as a wash out conditioner.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to see that I could get my favorite No-poo at about 25% off what I pay at my local beauty store.  This shampoo and conditioner make my hair so silky and my curls shine.  I have come to the conclusion, however, that I need to keep buying my product at the local store, because after using this stuff for a month or so my hair is like straw!  I don&#x27;t know when I would have figured out it was the product, but for the fact that I ran out before my Amazon order arrived so I went and bought a small bottle of each to tide me over. My hair was immediately thankful!  I really don&#x27;t think this stuff they sell is the real deal, it smells the same but my hair hated it!  Buyer beware!!!!</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair feeling clear without residue.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic!  I have very curly hair that easily turns to frizz, and No-Poo Cleanser/Conditioner control it!  Much cheaper than Kerastase, and I think it actually works better, too.</li>
            <li> Amazing product if you straighten your hair or get smoothing treatments.  Better than When without the time and hassle,</li>
            <li> I like the shampoo and it smells great.  It&#x27;s super creamy to keep your hair from getting too dry.  The conditioner is stinky.  I don&#x27;t know why it doesn&#x27;t smell like the shampoo. Won&#x27;t be buying the conditioner again.</li>
            <li> So far so good. However, I am kinda of disappointed in the results of my curls. My hair can vary from wavy to soft ringlets, and I was expecting this product-based off reviews- to make my curls more defined and less fizzy... not so much. But, I will say that my hair is SUPER soft and more shiny than ever before. It does take time to get used to the non-lathering of the shampoo... especially, if you are a greasy ball like I am. Your hair maybe semi-greasy for a few weeks while doing every other day washes, but your hair will adjust. be patient. So overall, I don&#x27;t love this stuff but it is better than another product I have found.</li>
            <li> I tried the system on my daughter and her hair just turned to grease.  Perhaps it is only appropriate for adults as I have met two adult who swear by it and their curls were gorgeous!!! But on thinner, younger strands it just makes hair look wet.</li>
            <li> This is my second Deva Curl purchase. I really like the Deva Curl products but the One Conditioner I got in this order was very watery compared to the conditioner in my first order.  I am wondering if the formula has been changed since my first purchase of this product from another vendor.</li>
            <li> I love the Deva Curl products. Yes my shipment was on time and greatly appreciated</li>
            <li> Love both.  My curl is so soft and pretty!</li>
            <li> Shampoo takes some getting used to w no suds.  Conditioner rocks! Love the smell. Unfortunately I have more wavy than curly hair so it seemed to straighten more than add volume.</li>
            <li> my hair is too flat. its not for my type of hair.</li>
            <li> I have curls that are unruly and get dried out easily from going to the beach often. This pair is an excellent conditioner/shampoo combination that treat the dryness. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> works great and its much cheaper then going to ULTA they have it for sale for 19.99 each.</li>
            <li> This is an interesting product. The shampoo has a lovely minty herbal scent, and the conditioner is fruity. The combination is wonderful. I think my hair is happier using these products, and my curls are silkier and more manageable.</li>
            <li> Only thing I use! Love the Deva line of products!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting to post a review for a few weeks because I wanted my hair to get used to the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, some people have mentioned this is an imitation product. I wouldn&#x27;t be able to say for sure, but I checked the ingredient list on the label with a bottle at Sephora and they were the same. That being said, a printer can make fake labels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the smell takes some getting used to. It is SO strong on the rose-scent, it&#x27;s overpowering. I&#x27;m on the fence about the no-poo thing, but I still may stop using this product simply because I can barely stand the scent. It tones down after a few hours though. The conditioner smells way better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, my hair has always been super thick with a bit of a wave/curl. I can get spirals if I twirl wet strands around my finger and let it dry like that. Doing that and using a diffuser with this product gives me above average curls, but my hair is really poofy/borderline frizzy. I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about it. I&#x27;ve NEVER had greasy hair before...even going 3 days between traditional sudsy shampoos. With this product, my hair is really greasy in the back of my head and I&#x27;ve been breaking out on my shoulders, neck, chest, and face more...basically, wherever my hair rests...and my hair is really long so it touches a lot of skin. I am not at all a fan of this development, but I&#x27;ve been diligently waiting a month to see if my hair calms down and evens itself out in regards to oil production. If nothing changes I will not continue to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may have noticed more hair loss than regular shampoo and conditioner BUT...and I stress BUT...I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s attributable to the product or my idea that I might lose hair when using it because I read other reviews of this product before purchasing. When dry, it doesn&#x27;t feel any less thick, I just think I notice more in the drain. This might just be conditioned expectation and not reality. What I HAVE noticed is serious increase in tangles. The first few times I used just the no poo cleanser I couldn&#x27;t get my comb through. My hair is also more tangled after sleeping. This has never been a problem for me using regular shampoo and conditioner. This issue did resolve somewhat when I started using the conditioner along with the no poo cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tl;dr&lt;br /&gt;My long, thick hair used to be shiny and smooth and now it&#x27;s kind of a mess with tangles and grease. But it&#x27;s only been 3 weeks so maybe my hair&#x27;s oil production needs to calm down and regulate first. Overwhelmingly bad product smell, but you get used to it.ngles.

            <li> Just too expensive to use on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Too heavy for my fine wavy hair. Seems very moisturizing but it felt like I couldn&#x27;t rinse it all off.</li>
            <li> I was interested in this product after reading an article about detergent free shampoos. My hair is very fine which is not the target audience this product was intended for, but I love it! My hair feels great after I wash it instead of dried out, like I don&#x27;t even need to condition it. I highly recommend this stuff!</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioning system has completely transformed my hair! My hair is in between very curly and very wavy and this system has smoothed my hair, decreased the frizz and has allowed me to use less styling products. Since using this product I can go a week without shampooing and my hair does not get greasy or unmanageable. It stays light and has body and I highly recommend this to all people with curly hair. It is a dream!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to ever use any other product!! I wear my hair naturally curly AND I straighten it at times. Either way, this no-poo and conditioner work wonders!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this entire line of products. I have very long, thick &amp; kinky curly hair. Before my purchase I would just put conditioner in my hair &amp; defuse it. I was hoping the devacul line would do &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; than my Suave $2.00 bottle of conditioner. NO! The product smells good &amp; makes my hair soft, but that&#x27;s it. So if your thinking about forking over a fortune for this line.... I wouldn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s not at all, worth it.</li>
            <li> I have super fine hair and this doesn&#x27;t weight it down at all! Held the curls in all days long</li>
            <li> Really good, cleansing shampoo with none of the nasty stuff.  One Condition hydrates my hair, boosts my curls, and I love how DevaCurl makes my hair look and feel.</li>
            <li> After trying so many products over the years for my curly hair, I found the one I had been looking for. The smell is so clean and the way your hair feels after washing and conditioning is so soft and silky. Which is not the usual feel of highlighted curly hair. No matter if I am wearing my hair curly or straightening it, the Deva Curl products work great. The more I use it the better my hair gets. I love Deva Curl.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo &amp; conditioner for fine curly hair!</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this shampoo and conditioner. i have medium length VERY curly / frizzy hair that is pretty thick. I noticed a significant reduction in the frizz once I started using this combo, which I contribute mostly to the shampoo. I will continue to use it, as I do think it helps to keep my hair moisturized and doesn&#x27;t strip it like sulfate shampoos too.&lt;br /&gt;the reason for 4 stars is this:&lt;br /&gt;1-the smell. blegh. it&#x27;s not horrible, but it smells a lot like sunscreen or some sort of repellent. couldn&#x27;t they work a little harder a something yummy?&lt;br /&gt;2-i don&#x27;t like how much shampoo i have to use. it simply doesn&#x27;t go very far. i put a big blob in my hair and start to work on the top of my head, but i typically need to add more to the get the bottom part clean, too. i notice greasy roots on the bottom part of my hair if i don&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> Finally a conditioner that works for curly hair!  I have very curly and frizzy hair and have been using this conditioner for the past month.  So far so good.  The conditioner helps control the frizz and makes your hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner work wonders for my curly hair - it takes away all frizz, makes my curls very formed and prominent and makes my hair shiny. I have finally found the miracle shampoo/conditioner combo! It smells very fresh and clean -notes of rosemary and mint . I only have to use very little product for it to work - love it. My first time trying it - I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> hair type: thick and curly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works!  does not leave my hair heavy but leaves it moisturized and manageable. I have an ombre color in my hair and I noticed the min. my hair dries the radiance due to this duo. I however do not particularly like the smell so much but so long as it does what I need it to do I&#x27;ll just spray a light perfume in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/28/14 Updated review: After months of use I have found this product is only great if you are trying to let your hair be curly. IT does moisturize however If you like to flat iron your hair I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this (use a sulfate free moisture/ repair shampoo) and moisturizing conditioner. As far as repairing and healing properties go it&#x27;s a no go for me</li>
            <li> This stuff irritated my scalp so bad I had to treat it with Apple Cider Vinegar for a week. Never buying it agin!</li>
            <li> I am a curly girl and finally found the right products!! Once you try it you will be hooked on the entire  process.  Hair looks unbelievable!</li>
            <li> It took me years to find a product I could use on my curly hair that would actually work. This stuff is amazing!!</li>
            <li> I have long, thin, slightly wavy hair. Overall pretty good products. I felt a little  weird washing my hair with the cleanser without any lather but the result was pretty good. The conditioner is very emolient and makes your hair feel hydrated. My hair was more loose and definitely shinier. I usually wash my hair every 2 days but with this duo I felt that I had to wash every other day - No big deal though. I&#x27;ll take that in exchange of shinier and hydrated hair that looks pretty good even when i do not use the hair dryer. I do recommend this product. I only gave 4 stars because I wish the products were  more affordable. It&#x27;s somewhat expensive to pay $30.64 for a 12oz duo.</li>
            <li> Love DevaCurl!!! got to me on time with no problems.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner exceeded my expectations. It leaves hair baby soft, hydrated and smelling awesome. This is the only product that was able to coax my curls out. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> the shampoo made my scalp itch, painfully.  the conditioner is good</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t catch that it was the NO-POO vs. LOW-POO.</li>
            <li> Recommended by his hairdresser, This is my son&#x27;s preferred combo! I always have it here when he visits.. And it always goes home with him! My treat, on Amazon. They are less $$!</li>
            <li> Trying to find more natural alternatives for my eldest&#x27;s curly hair. She is blonde, her hair is super dry and curly, and she is only 7 years old so we aren&#x27;t talking about damaged hair at all. This shampoo gets RAVE reviews, but it rally did nothing  for her hair, it is just as tangled, hard to brush and frizzy on the top as with any other shampoo. And for the price, I have to give this one star. I have been also using it on my wavy hair and my hair is also just as frizzy on the top, still dry as well. What this does do is give me oily roots, which clearly I am not looking for.</li>
            <li> I used to use this product a few years back and I loved my hair. Then I decided to go short, switched to a cheaper shampoo, and I said bye bye to my curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m back on the DevaCurl train now, and my curls are coming back to life! I actually also went for a haircut to the Devachan Salon and I&#x27;ve been using the DevaCurl for a few months now, and I can say it does truly make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some notes:&lt;br /&gt;1. They are not the cheapest shampoo/conditioner out there, but if you have curls it is totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;2. It is not how much shampoo/conditioner you use, it is how long you leave it there. And this is VERY true for this one. For the shampoo, make sure you massage your scalp (it is easier since it is a no-lather shampoo); when using the conditioner, squeeze the water out of your hair before you apply, massage it and leave it there while you soap up or sing a few songs in the shower (it also helps leaving a bit in, and if won&#x27;t feel dirty or soapy).&lt;br /&gt;3. Unrelated to the product, don&#x27;t dry your hair with a towel, it&#x27;s much better if you use a cotton t-shirt.</li>
            <li> I read tons of positive reviews on the No Poo prior to purchasing it. The &amp;#34;no lather&amp;#34; shampoo really works to remove dirt and excess oil without stripping my hair of moisture. The scent is slightly minty- but it&#x27;s light and refreshing and not cloying. I would categorize my hair as somewhere between wavy and curly depending on the day (and the weather). Both the No Poo and the conditioner left my hair soft and shiny. My hair wasn&#x27;t weighed down at all. After rinsing the conditioner out, I like to add a bit more just to the ends as a leave in conditioner. I&#x27;ve tried not rinsing it all the way instead, but this method seems to be easier.</li>
            <li> Love this combo!! This id my first time buying devacurl products and so far so good. Im not a person that usually buys expensive products but my daughter has really dry curly hair and I had to try it. First tiem I used it I saw a difference. Still a long way to go but I will keep buying them.</li>
            <li> I used DevaCurl products before and they worked well for my hair. However, this time, both the shampoo and the conditioner - and I can stress this more for the conditioner, that they have a very strong chemical smell.&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner smells like dish soap, and it is so strong that it stays on my hair for so long. I can say I am disappointed with this.</li>
            <li> tried other similar products, came back to this and I love it.  (non)shampoo is minty &amp; fresh and conditioner smells so incredible...i think it is the lemonbalm.  I like the MisterRight mist too, but if i need to use it to freshen my hair (from a workout, etc) it is hard to get the spray down to my scalp, so i usually just use the awesome shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Add me to one of the people who got dandruff (and scabs on my scalp) from using this product. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner, when left in, makes the ends of my hair look lovely. However it makes the roots look oily.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. This is was exactly what I was looking for.  I would recommend this buyer to a friend.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make my curls any better. My hair was more &#x27;crispy&#x27; on the ends than usual too. I air-dried my hair as usual and my curls were flatter than and lifeless compared to the shampoo I have been using from The Honest Company. I&#x27;m back to using that shampoo over this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw other reviews that they didn&#x27;t like the smell but I think the smell of the &#x27;no poo&#x27; and conditioner is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money. I do not recommend this.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, specially the shampoo, my favorite, I am a guy and my curls are looking better than ever. Im obesessed</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a no poo option for quite some time.  After giving up on at home products, I decided to give Devacurl a try.  I love it! My hair feels soft, light, and amazing!  I will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this. It makes my hair really soft, but unless I blow dry it, my hair looks greasy. Letting it go all-natural is out the window for now.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that I have never liked. It is extremely thick and frizzy and long.  I normally blow dry and the use a flat iron. In fact most of the people I know don&#x27;t even know that my hair is curly. We live in South Carolina near the beach and let&#x27;s just say my hair really doesn&#x27;t do well in the humidity. I grew tired of the blow dry and flat iron routine..it took so much time and then as soon as I walked outside...poof, my hair grew to twice its size and I would end up pulling it back into a ponytail or messy bun. I got the curly girl book and decided I would try to embrace my curls. It has only been two days and so far so good. I&#x27;m not used to my hair this way and I&#x27;m trying to love it but I will say I had a woman stop me in a store today to ask if my hair was naturally curly. When I said yes, she told me she was a hairdresser and I had the best curls that she has ever seen and she had clients pay top dollar to try to get curls like mine. Her comments made me excited to see how much better my curls will get using the curly girl method and these products.</li>
            <li> Deva curl is very expensive in the store I only use it when I don&#x27;t have time to do anything to my hair so I love deals;)</li>
            <li> I reviewed this previously, giving you the information about article in LATimes &amp;#34;Ask Angel&amp;#34; about her using this product to shampoo her hair for last ten years instead of detergent shampoo. I have used it once as a shampoo, and find it does a good job.</li>
            <li> My dr recommended this product line a few months ago and it was the best thing ever!!!  My hair hasn&#x27;t been this healthy in 25 years!!!</li>
            <li> i love it it is a good product&lt;br /&gt;thank you for it I will recommend it to my friend .</li>
            <li> I have fine hair with ribbon curls, and I&#x27;ve been using No-Poo and One Condition on it religiously for years. It makes my hair incredibly soft, makes it curl more easily, and keeps color in for longer. Every hairdresser I&#x27;ve had since I started using this has commented on how soft my hair is. Plus it smells fantastic - lemongrass for the cleanser and jasmine for the conditioner. When I was in Australia and held a koala, it couldn&#x27;t stop sniffing my hair, and humans like it too! And yes, washing with a light conditioner really does get your hair clean! Only sometimes, in the summer, when the weather&#x27;s more humid and I&#x27;m sweating more, I&#x27;ll use Low-Poo once or twice a month to get the extra oil out. But I cannot live without One Condition regardless of the season; it gives my dry ends life and softness without ever weighing down my fine hair.</li>
            <li> The One Conditioner I received was clearly watered down and made my scalp extremely itchy for days!  It also smelled horrible. The No Poo seemed ok, but clearly this is not an original DevaCurl retailer.</li>
            <li> I think you can just read all of the other reviews to see how awesome these products are.  Like everyone else, I recommend you get &amp;#34;The Curly Girl Handbook&amp;#34;, though most of the advice you need is in these reviews.  I&#x27;ve been struggling with my hair since the 7th grade, and was straightening it since I was 18.  Now, at 38, I&#x27;m finally happy with my curls.  If you know the struggle...then these products are for you.  I will agree with most other people, that I use far more conditioner than shampoo, so be prepared to refill that early.</li>
            <li> I love DevaCurl products. I would even suggest Deva if you don&#x27;t have curly hair. I enjoy the smell, and it leaves my hair feeling good without all the unnecessary chemicals. Shampooing your hair can be pretty damaging, No-Poo cleans out build up and dirt without stripping my hair. Since using Deva, my hair has felt and looked way better. I have very damaged hair from dying and processing and I think regular shampoo was only making it worse. I honestly don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to shampooing. Cleansing is where it&#x27;s at.</li>
            <li> This is the first &#x27;no-poo&#x27; I&#x27;ve used, after researching how to wash, treat and style curly hair. I should have known that this was the perfect product after finding out a few of my very-curly haired friends have been using it for years! A little reluctant at first, reading that this formula doesn&#x27;t lather (everyone loves a good lather) but really surprised to feel how clean this product gets my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paired with plopping/plunking with a t-shirt, my hair stays frizz-free, touchable, soft, smooth and shiny. I also can&#x27;t forget how awesome this stuff smells! Can&#x27;t wait to see how well Devacurl treats my hair and scalp after a whole bottle&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li> This is my first time purchasing lather-less shampoo and like it very much.  The combination of both products leaves my hair soft and curly...without the frizz.  I will be re-ordering.</li>
            <li> i bought these hoping the other reviewers were wrong regarding the smell, but unfortunately they were spot on. This shampoo and conditioner smell like the yucky hand soap in public restrooms.... I can&#x27;t stand the odor on my hair!!! It is strong and stays in your hair for too long. Yuuuck</li>
            <li> Seriously this is a fantastic product if you have coarse-thick curly hair.  I was tired of trying yet another  product that promised soft smooth curls but thankfully I tried one more!  It smells great as well.  I will be using this forever!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff has changed my wife&#x27;s life.  She loves it.</li>
            <li> Love the no poo, but not so much the conditioner. It smells like laundry detergent to me, which I don&#x27;t want my hair to smell even close to. It also did not leave my hair as conditioned as I would prefer it too, even the day after a deep treatment.</li>
            <li> It did take my hair a few weeks to adapt to these products. My hair has always been oily, so when using these products it was especially oily for about two weeks. However, my curls have never looked better. They are much more spirally and less frizzy! Now that my hair has adapted, the oil is under control and I have never been happier with my curls.</li>
            <li> No-Poo is great but I didn&#x27;t like the conditioner.  I&#x27;ll buy the No-Poo again because I actually believe it left my hair so soft &amp; easy to manage.</li>
            <li> Love this! The Noo Poo for a non lathering shampoo, makes my hair feel clean and fresh. A lot of ppl dislike the smell, but I like the minty tingle and smell, give the clean feeling. The One condition is pretty good too. I basically use it every day and am look to purchase the 32oz bottle, makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Great Product! I don&#x27;t like their Salon in NY but the No Poo Shampoo is simply the best for curly/color treated hair hands down.  Super convenient to order on line.</li>
            <li> My hair has changes due to thyroid issues.  I used to have straight wavy hair and now it&#x27;s gone dry but curly.  My hair dresser recommended this so I gave it a shot.  The shampoo does not lather at all but your hair does feel soft and clean after using it.  Has a medicinal smell to it but still...like the product.  The conditioner has a citrusy smell and is very light but moist.  I would recommend them for regular or curly hair.</li>
            <li> So, I first came across Devacurl through my hairdresser. She told me I had curly hair, which I didn&#x27;t believe at first because my hair had always been super straight and would never, ever hold a curl not matter what I tried (curling irons, curling wands, hot rollers, foam rollers, tying my hair up in damp twisted knots overnight, dozens of different types of hair sprays and mousse, etc.). She told me that was because the typical shampoos and conditioners that you buy at places like Target or the drugstore typically dry out your hair and if you have more of a wavy curl, they completely take away whatever curl your hair has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was still skeptical, but she used Devacurl on my hair and there was a little bit of a wave. I bought a small travel kit to give it a try on my own and at first I really disliked it because some of my hair only had a small wave, other parts had a little more of a curl, and other parts of it were still stick-straight and it just seemed like a total mess. When I called my hairdresser to tell her about it, she told me that was because it would take a little time to reverse the damage done by the other shampoos and conditioners I had been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And she was right! After a few more uses, I now have nice, soft wavy curls and when I use a curling iron or a curling wand to give it a little more oomph, the style will actually hold now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about this product is that it is a little pricey, but I think that it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I had been using Sexy Curly Hair products before finding their &amp;#34;free of &amp;#34; products.  I was excited till recently my hair turned into a rats nest of unholey stuck together gobs of silicone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using Devacurl No Poo and the Conditioner my hair has returned to normal, even better more curls and more shine!  Stripped clean of the silicone after a few vinegar rinses followed by these two products. Got curly fine/mixed race hair?  This might just be a miracle!</li>
            <li> In preparation for a trip to Europe, I tried the Deva conditioner, No-Poo and Deva gel for 6 weeks.  I have thick, wavy hair which is frizzy on the ends.  None of the Deva products, used as directed, improved my hair enough so that I didn&#x27;t need a curling iron.  I like the Biolage Conditioning Balm better than the Deva conditioner and I&#x27;ll probably return to my regular shampoo after I finish the No-Poo.  I tried three gels and didn&#x27;t like any of them because they made my hair heavy and somewhat sticky although they all pumped up the volume and added a lot of texture.  It may be that hard water is the real culprit and that no products can compensate.  The Deva products are more expensive than other products so I can&#x27;t really recommend them based on cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I researched non-sulfate shampoos and saw that there is controversy.  Sulfates are detergent and they clean the hair completely and make the soap lather up.  Some hairdressers think that hair gets dull without sulfate cleansing (probably because hair products remain on the hair) and that the anti-sulfate movement is a trend and not a real health or beauty issue.  Sulfates in dish washing detergent really clean the dishes and, without it, they are scummy unless you use very high heat and special cleaners.  I could find no scientific or neutral opinion that sulfates (in low solutions) hurt hair but it seems possible although I’ve been using sulfate shampoos for decades.  Other than a little frizz, all hairdressers say my hair is strong and beautiful.</li>
            <li> The best hair care regimen I&#x27;ve found to combat Texas humidity. My hair used to be a wreck before a friend of mine told me about DevaCurl. Now I legitimately cannot imagine going back to regular shampoos and mousse.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and the conditioner  works perfectly in my curly. My hair is more soft and shinny... I just love it</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product by my hairdresser, who is a curly hair specialist. Very happy to find it less expensive than&lt;br /&gt;mainstream department stores. I like the products, better used every other day as the moisturizing properties make my hair&lt;br /&gt;a bit heavy.</li>
            <li> My daughter has super fine, curly hair that knots easily. I heard about Devacurl and decided to try it. The No Poo works well and they both smell delicious but I feel any old conditioner words as well as One Condition. I plan to try to spray or detengler next.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. No complaints</li>
            <li> love it! My hair is clean and soft!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product, as I have very curly hair. This product did not work for my hair, though-- it left it greasy and feeling as though there was a thick residue left over no matter how many times I washed it out. I would not recommend this product for anyone with curly hair that is not super thick.</li>
            <li> I have what people would call &amp;#34;Jewfro&amp;#34; hair. It is long, thick, frizzy, VERY tangled, and gets oily very quickly. I was very hesitant to use these products because an employee at Ulta told me it might make my hair oily quicker than other products but in using them, I can now actually comb through my hair. I can&#x27;t say I really like that there are no bubbles when using the shampoo because it feels like it isn&#x27;t cleaning my hair. Also, I end up using a lot of the product because it doesn&#x27;t expand as others do with suds/bubbles/lather, whatever you would call it. I will continue using this product regardless because I already see a huge change after only one week.</li>
            <li> Great product for working with curly hair. I have less frizz and more controlled curl.</li>
            <li> It did make my curls look better, but it also made my scalp super greasy and heavy feeling.</li>
            <li> Lovely smell and leaves curls soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Awesome! My curls are softer and shinier than ever, with no greasy scalp. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I cant say enough about this product! I color treat my normally dry hair, so when the even dryer grays started popping up I went on a quest to get rid of the fuzzy fly aways. After using No Poo and the conditioner for 4 washes I saw a dramatic difference. My hair is once again smooth, shiney and fuller looking. Shampoo and condition every other day, medium length hair, the 12 oz lasts me 5 months.</li>
            <li> Great Product very quick delivery!</li>
            <li> Even though I am a curly girl, I have avoided the Deva Curl line for years, despite the mostly raving reviews.  After ruining my hair with bleach and losing most of my curls, I figured I would give them a shot.  I gotta tell you.  I am sold.  I love the No Poo and the way it makes my hair feel.  The One Condition is just as good.  My damaged locks feels moisturized and when styled, they look and feel very soft and bouncy.  I am aslo greatful that I can get the pair here for $10 cheaper than they sell them at Ulta. ($19.99 ea)  These will remain a staple in my bathroom for awhile and the Deva Curl line has won another fan.</li>
            <li> Works great to keep the curl in my wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I do not like this product at all.  It has a horrible smell and the smell is very strong.  I am a Quidad fan and will go back to using that product.  The way you are told to style your hair is also very time consuming</li>
            <li> I love my DevaCurl products, but I do not use them daily. I will use every other washing in combination with a low sulfate shampoo and conditioner, but I will put a dab of the One Condition in as a leave in conditioner no matter what I use to cleanse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen and wanted to try something different.  I liked the scent.  It did leave my hair drier than when I use the Wen.  It&#x27;s a nice alternative.  I may have to try the DevaCare next time for a little more moisture.</li>
            <li> DevaCurl No-Poo--Regular Shampoos dry the hair out over time and makes it harder to actually condition the hair (very counterproductive to deep conditioning). The No-Poo doesn&#x27;t have hair drying elements. Currently, I No-Poo once a week and Co-wash daily or every other day depending on if I&#x27;m running late in the mornings for work. My hair feels much softer after using this product. DevCurl One Conditioner--I used this after I deep conditioned with the Heaven in Hair... I went to the Dominican salon and had them No-Poo, deep condition with Heaven in Hair, and then detangle my hair with the One Condition...(all for $5.00!!) and then I left with the conditioner in my hair... got home and rinsed it in the shower and finger combed the hair in the shower to get the conditioner out.</li>
            <li> I really Love the smell and how it makes my hair feel. Seems to be helping to revive my curls!</li>
            <li> BEST. EVER! I&#x27;ve never been addicted to washing my hair before, but now, I almost crave it ;)</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner smells incredible... it doesn&#x27;t do much for my curls but I love how great my hair smells.</li>
            <li> It is gentle but doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling dirty.  Will definitely use again, I like this product a lot.</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo, but the conditioner doesn&#x27;t really detangle or smooth my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other &amp;#34;no lather&amp;#34; products and end up with buildup and an overall yucky feeling, but not with this stuff! My curls definitely feel more soft and no buildup!  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Works on fine, straight, thin (but very dry) hair. Scalp and hair gets clean, without feeling at all greasy.  Also, you don&#x27;t have to use as much product per use as the &amp;#34;Wen&amp;#34; system requires, so a bottle should last a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo reminds me of Noxema face cleanser, or cold cream; it feels a bit cool, and it cleanses, but isn&#x27;t soapy. The scent is quite medicinal (with a strong hit of lemon grass) and it lingers, in case perfumes bother you.  The conditioner feels like normal conditioner, but it rinses out better than most without a greasy feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My not-curly hair is chemically damaged, so it needs a lot of moisture to keep it from looking and feeling dry. Silicones in normal conditioner mask the problem for a while, but actually make the internal dryness worse.  This set works much better, and doesn&#x27;t just mask the problem with a coating of shine. My hair is shinier with this stuff than it ever was with silicone balms, mists, or conditioners, and much softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hair is extra dry, tangly, or has natural texture you want to enhance, I would suggest using a little bit of the conditioner in your towel dried hair for detangling and softness. The rinse-out steps do rinse out clean, so you may need that last &amp;#34;no rinse&amp;#34; step.</li>
            <li> this stuff is truly amazing and I am completely hooked.  miracle stuff for frizzy and wavy/curly hair.  not sure what separates it from other store or salon bought products, but this line is incredible.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser and conditioner duo! It smells good, makes my hair super soft AND is good for my hair!!! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few friends recommend this brand to me and I finally bit it and decided to try it out. I can&#x27;t believe I waited so long as this has made my curly, frizzy hair so wonderful and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using the product, I haven&#x27;t straightened my hair once and that&#x27;s an amazing feeling.</li>
            <li> Packaged well for no mess shipping.  Love all deva curl products. Wld def buy again</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have found that works great with my curly hair. It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair and it maintains the luster. I No more have bad hair days.</li>
            <li> My barely wavy hair gets curl when I use this correctly!</li>
            <li> Awesome set for regular users or someone wanting to try this out for the first time. I&#x27;m a regular user after trying this 6 months ago. Works great for my Type 3A hair. My daughter has straight hair and I can&#x27;t see why she shouldn&#x27;t use shampoo that will help her hair rather than harm it. So I bought her this gift set and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I love how this DevaCurl makes my hair so manageable. Never have had anything to work so well.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with DevaCurl. I had tried WEN in the past, which caused a reaction, so I was a little nervous with this product.  Nothing to worry about.  Even my hair stylist asked what I have been using since my hair was so soft and shiny!  Will definitely purchase again, and this time I am going to also try the styling gel.</li>
            <li> This combo has been working great for me.  Doesn&#x27;t leave my scalp feeling oily or dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a particular scent--somewhat candy-like--but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> The cleanser has  a weird smell to it because it&#x27;s a plain non-scented  product, but the conditoner leaves your hair smelling good. I&#x27;ve been using for 3 weeks and I can see that my hair is hydrated and the curls are bouncier.</li>
            <li> Holy moly this stuff makes my curls beautiful.</li>
            <li> Just wish it weren&#x27;t so pricey.</li>
            <li> Deva Curl products have changed my life. My curls have never looked better and the friz is gone.</li>
            <li> I love the No Poo and Conditioner...it feels so great on my hair...I am a Happy Deva Curl Girl... 😆</li>
            <li> Great for curly hair, of course!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a bit like baby powder. I don&#x27;t know how else to describe it. If the smell of baby powder isn&#x27;t one you like I suggest looking at other sulfate free shampoos.</li>
            <li> Hair is clean and curls are bouncy with no frizz. I&#x27;m in love with this product.</li>
            <li> Deva has changed the formula for the One Condition, and I&#x27;m not a fan.  The original formula was much better, It was thicker.  The current formula is watery</li>
            <li> Deva Curl made me love my hair for all its eccentricities! It is the best product for curly hair I have ever come across!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I wasn&#x27;t sure about the no-poo but my curly girl friends said I should try it. I&#x27;m glad I did. I got 3 compliments on my hair the very first day I used it.</li>
            <li> Deva Curl Combo No Poo Cleanser and Conditioner are the only products I use on my hair now.  No more sulfate shampoo; it&#x27;s great!!  It smells wonderful and I have noticed a significant improvement in my hair  I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it! Switched from Aveda Be Curly to the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; (wish they would change that name) and saw a difference in one washing. Tried the low poo formula as well but if you&#x27;re going to go without the sulfate, you might as well go all the way with! It does take time to get use to not having any lather when washing your hair so be prepared...just know the cleanser is cleaning your scalp and you&#x27;re taking a much healthier avenue with this shampoo. Smells clean too.</li>
            <li> Fantastic products! I find that the No Poo has worked as a great co-wash, and I tend to use it a couple of times a week after going to the gym. The One Condition works as an incredible conditioner and detangler, especially for my tangle-prone hair. It also works magically when combined with the Shea Moisture Manuka Honey &amp; Mafura Oil Masque (when using the masque as a regular conditioner) as a way to condition your curls. Also, I wasn&#x27;t too crazy about the smell when I sniffed a sample a while back, but now that I&#x27;ve actually used it, I find that it&#x27;s not too bothersome and leaves a fresh scent in my tresses.</li>
            <li> I love this products, the no poo is a great cleanser, and the conditioner smells so good and is really moisturizing, love it!!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the product. My curls are very well define and soft.  I received the product faster and well packed.  I really recommended the product.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this brand.  Makes my hair feel dirty, scalp itches and hair is greasy the day after I wash it.  All in all I just hate the product.  I do have curly hair and this product makes it look like a greasy stringy mess.  Ugh!  I hate spending money on products that can&#x27;t deliver.  Back to Aveda products I go.</li>
            <li> The no poo shampoo took the color out of my hair. It isnt for color treated hair which they dont tell you.! MY HANDS WHERE THE COLOR OF MY HAIR!!</li>
            <li> My wife says best ever!!!</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not using this correctly, but my hair has never looked crappier--I mean, even dandruff shampoo was better than this.  I&#x27;ve used the no-poo and one conditioner for the past few days, and maybe the DevaCurl gel or cream is a must if you want it to work, but I&#x27;ve stuck with my normal Moroccan Oil styling products seeing as I didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money on a whole new line.  My curls are DRY, DRY, DRY with tons of fly-aways.  I look and SMELL like a geriatric poodle after a bath (it stinks like dog shampoo and perm solution).  Contrary to the pictures, the shampoo and conditioner are in identical bottles, which makes it really hard to differentiate between the two--not that you would be able to tell the difference from the consistency, since they both feel like conditioner.  Maybe this works well for some curls, but definitely not mine.</li>
            <li> good product for curly frizzy hair</li>
            <li> i liked how my hair looks when it&#x27;s dried using this system but the smell is pretty horrible. It smells like old woman perfume-overly flowery.</li>
            <li> Split ends have decreased tremendously!  My hair is so much nicer.</li>
            <li> Love these products!  My hair is coarse and frizzy and these two products really make it smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference right away for the better! I wish I had know about DevaCurl products sooner.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time and just in time...I was about to run out of my precious shampoo.. Perfect for curly hair!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. I noticed after the first few uses my hair was curlier. However, after continued use my hair always looked greasy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to get a brush through my hair without ripping through it. Not even the wet brush. I have tried both the no poo and low poo with the one conditioner to no avail.  I have fine super curly bleached hair.  I can&#x27;t afford to compromise the condition of my hair by not being able to brush it out. It would be an easy product to start dread locks. What am I doing wrong?</li>
            <li> Loved these products when I ordered the trial size kit, so ordered the big bottles.  Over short period of time, the curls weren&#x27;t as good.  Couldn&#x27;t figure out what I was doing differently than when I first tried them.  It dawned on me yesterday that things changed when I started using these bottles that I&#x27;d ordered last month.  Tried the trial size bottles again, and great curls immediately returned.  Must be these bottles are from a bad batch of shampoo and conditioner, and too late to return them.  Won&#x27;t order from this supplier again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have curly hair per se... more wavy. Have used just the shampoo for a little over a week now and my hair is transformed. No longer have dry scalp or flakes. The shampoo does have a fairly distinct smell (I want to say witch hazel or something similar, but in not 100% on that) but it&#x27;s not all that bad. I kind of like it now that happy hair comes along with it!</li>
            <li> Really detangles hair</li>
            <li> I love the way DevaCurl products smell -- so clean and crisp.  I have tight curly hair that&#x27;s thick and needs a lot of moisture to look healthy. It took a couple of tries to get used to no shampoo bubbles, but now after a month, I&#x27;m thrilled to say my hair really does feel clean but still moisturized.  I used to shampoo every two or three weeks because it dried out my hair, and it took a week or two and a number of products to restore shine and moisture. Then of course those products weighed my hair down and attracted dirt. Now I shampoo once or twice a week; I condition every day, and my hair never looks dull and dry.</li>
            <li> I love Deva Curl. These products are great for curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using another known curly hair products but their stuff is way to drying and left my hair frizzy and my curls dry.  The DevaCurl Como leaves my hair perfectly clean and soft.  No frizz and nothing weighs it down.  I am very happy with this product and can see using this stuff for years.  Easy to wash and rinse and the scent is very nice and light.  I like how the scents complement one another. Thank you.</li>
            <li> A must have for great curly hair.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on the Deva product line and thought I would give it a try. I&#x27;ve only used this product once. I am moving away from Wen... But I haven&#x27;t used it enough to review it. I typically wash my hair every third or fourth day, but with this product I may have wash more frequently until my scalp adjusts. I&#x27;ll keep you posted.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! Works so well, especially on colored hair. Makes the hair really shine. Excellent curl definition from these products. Many compliments. I have to say the smell requires some getting used to...but otherwise the product is terrific.</li>
            <li> excellent for my curly hair</li>
            <li> I was so excited after ordering my first Devacurl shampoo and conditioner set, and eagerly waited while it was in shipment. After opening my package and taking a look at my Devacurl Duo set, I realized that it was a white bottle that said Devacare. In the description it says this is the Devacurl, and since my hair is treated or colored, this is highly inconvenient. (The Devacare products are marketed for chemically treated hair..)&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried it out as of yet, but hopefully it works just as well as the original Devacurl line that I originally wanted.</li>
            <li> Great products. I&#x27;m really enjoying them.</li>
            <li> Great product! It works very well for my curly hair. No frizz, no heaviness, just beautiful curls.</li>
            <li> I love this product, my hair has never been softer. If you&#x27;re looking for a product for youre curly hair that&#x27;s going to help perfect the way the curls turn out then this is just the product for you! Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product</li>
            <li> My hair stylist sells this shampoo and conditioner but the price on Amazon is the better. Same stuff, half the price.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY IF YOU WANT DEVACURL ONE CONDITION. They are selling DEVACARE, which is for color treated hair. They will tell you it&#x27;s DevaCurl, like the shampoo, but it&#x27;s not. Liars, do not purchase. I had to send back.</li>
            <li> I have been using deva curl products for the last year &amp; JUST recently started using the shampoo &amp; conditioner &amp; even though it is a little pricey, I can&#x27;t use anything else.  It&#x27;s been a little weird getting used to non sudsing shampoo, but it works &amp; smells great &amp; the conditioner works &amp; smells great too!</li>
            <li> My hair feels and smells clean.  It doesn&#x27;t lather if that is an issue for someone.  I&#x27;m used to it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this line of products.  The shampoo leaves my hair soft and light.  My hair is very fine and these never weigh my hair down. All of the products make my curly hair beautiful again.</li>
            <li> this is the second set i bought from Amazon.  i loved mine so i&#x27;m sharing this to my mother who also have wavy hair.  i hope she&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> My expectation for this product was that it would add moisture and shine to my hair. It did not. If anything, it left it looking even drier. My hair has body but no curl so I don&#x27;t know what it would do for curly hair but it&#x27;s been my experience that curls crave moisture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with these products!</li>
            <li> Full disclosure - I&#x27;ve only used this twice (plus the intense moisturizer).  The first time I used it, I wasn&#x27;t crazy about it and worried I had made a mistake.  My hair was really fly-awayish and frizzy.  I used it again, but left some of the intensive conditioner in.  My hair looks AWESOME! The curls are really super defined and no frizz!  I also use the gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars because the smell is... interesting.  The shampoo is very heavily rose scented.  I can&#x27;t really put my finger on the conditioner, but it&#x27;s just weird.  I figure it&#x27;s worth it with how great my hair looks, but I can&#x27;t give 5 stars :)</li>
            <li> Love it!  Have been using it for years now and it is still working well.  Coarse, curly hair is not as stripped and dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had success with other DevaCurl products for my sometimes dry curly hair. I found these to work just as well for my hair. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, didn&#x27;t see any difference after a few uses.  Won&#x27;t waste my $ with this brand again...I don&#x27;t understand the hype.</li>
            <li> like the conditioner, not the shampoo.</li>
            <li> The Shampoo doesn&#x27;t work for my natural curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;The hair doesn&#x27;t feel neither clean nor soft to the touch, after washing with this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Conditioner does to the job of detangling , but nothing amazing either. The curls are a mess after the wash and it requires several additional product to style them. I was using Purelogy line before and going back to it as fast as I can.</li>
            <li> I recently did a big chop and this product has saved my curl pattern. My hair always smells delicious and my curls are always POPPING!</li>
            <li> Leaves hair smelling great, soft, and curly.</li>
            <li> Great as usual.  Thanks Deva !</li>
            <li> My wife can not live without</li>
            <li> Love it, my daughters hair is so much more manageable</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely a god send. I cannot believe how much it changed my curly hair. My curls started looking more scrunchy &amp; stiff from all of my previous products and straightening my hair to amazing curly q soft curls. I have finally found my product for my hair, as all of us curly haired girls can say, we&#x27;ve tried everything!</li>
            <li> Learned about this product during a learning session at my local salon.  It is a must have for anyone with curly hair--natural, or permed.  It makes an incredible difference in the shape and softness of my curls.  I recommend you go online and watch the videos the company offers on it&#x27;s use.  They help a lot, as it&#x27;s sort of a different process than you would be used to.</li>
            <li> If you have waves and want curls, No Poo is the shampoo for you. I have no idea why it works, but it does. Takes my hair from curly waves to loose ringlets. It also feels fabulous on the head – creamy, no suds, very soothing. I&#x27;ve never been a great fan of big suds, because they indicate harsh detergents at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that some may find disconcerting is that each product has a very strong smell, and all the smells are different.  It&#x27;s like a crash course in herbal scents. Doesn&#x27;t bother me, but be prepared.</li>
            <li> My hair feels better than ever. LOVE this after trying the sample size, I had to immediately pruchase a full size of both Shampoo and Conditioner. Leaves hair better, softer, shiner in every way. LOVE it and will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Works wonders on my curly hair...products are light so my hair is not weighted down...highly recommend especially for mixed hair!</li>
            <li> I LOVE these products &amp; my 3B type hair seems to appreciate them as well. I switched to using Deva products full-time around 3 months ago &amp; I&#x27;ve received nothing more than compliments on my bouncy, shiny and nicely scented hair! I highly recommend them as well as the Curly Girl Hair method &amp; the Deva Cuts!!! Trust yourselves, Go natural &amp; get your Deva products! Your curls will thank you!!!! :-)</li>
            <li> After MANY years of trying to work the curl OUT of my hair I have decided to embrace my curl! As wonky as it is...I am learning that is a part that make me, ME. So when a friend recommended this (she is a researcher, so her recommendation was easily accepted) I had to try it. And I am thrilled to have done so because I can tell a difference in my curl and my hair over all. It is less frizzy and the curl just lays better. The other thing is that I got a haircut where the stylist cut my hair dry to even out my hair based on its tendencies (which you cannot see when wet). I use the conditioner as a leave-in too. Great products! Finally going with my wonky curls!</li>
            <li> I thought the conditioner was he regular conditioner but it ended up being one for color treated hair. I wish the description mentioned this. Otherwise, everything was fine!</li>
            <li> It smells horrible and totally dried out my hair. (3b type, highly porous)</li>
            <li> I really like the Devacurl combo No-Poo Cleanser &amp; One conditioner. They work well. My hair is clean and well moisturized by these products. The conditioner has a nice scent to it. I would recommend these products. I would also order them again.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly/wavy hair that is pretty fine and prone to frizz, and I live in CO so it is a very dry climate. After ONE use of this system, my hair is so much softer and prettier, with no frizz. I am so excited it works so well!</li>
            <li> I had so many products for my curly hair that I could&#x27;ve started a used product store!  None of them can compare to Deva Curl.  This will be the only product I use from now on.</li>
            <li> Using the Curly Girl method (meaning NO SULFATES AND NO SILICONE) then this works perfectly. I have a massive amount of fine hair, enough to make my own lion&#x27;s mane if I so wish, and this works so well for me. You do have to make sure to vigorously work the shampoo in, especially scrubbing you scalp, and make sure to wash it all out. So far, this has been the only thing that has worked for my hair. As stated, I do have fine hair (but a LOT of it) so it tends to get oily quickly but I have not had an issue with this if I follow the directions and stay away from silicone. My hair is soft and controlled. I love it.</li>
            <li> I really disliked how these smelled. The cleanser smells like a cross between a heavy duty institutional cleaner and an herb garden. And the conditioner has a strong smell that reminds me of suntan lotion.  I used for a week and then had to get rid of them.  I didn&#x27;t notice that my curls were any more or less improved for the short time I used these.</li>
            <li> Great product at a fraction of the price it sells for at my salon!!!</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner didn&#x27;t work well in my hair. It made my hair heavy and it seemed to pull the curl out. Definitely didn&#x27;t put bounce in my curls. Spent a lot of money on this product that I won&#x27;t use again. It would be nice if  sample bottles could be sold for customers to try first.</li>
            <li> leaves your feeling very heaver and over moisturized</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but decided to give it a try.  I am completely amazed at how well Deva Curl products work.  This is the first product I&#x27;ve found that actually works on my hair.  You have actual curls not the stringy mess you get with mousses or gels. I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> The worst shampoo and conditioner I ever purchased; it felt like plastic on my curls and made it absolutely unmanageable</li>
            <li> leaves my hair looking and feeling dirty, doesn&#x27;t smell very good either</li>
            <li> Very happy to find product that works so well with my hair.  The texture changed in a few uses.  My frizzy hair days are less frequent and hair does not feel dry and wiry.</li>
            <li> Not good for me. Felt super heavy and waxy, had to strip my hair and go back to my regular routine. Tossed it after a week</li>
            <li> Love the Deva products except for the ones with oil since my hair is oily to begin with.</li>
            <li> I love these two together! I have been straightening my hair for the last five years and have only come to accept my naturally curly hair through Deva Curl and the Curly Girl Method. They smell wonderful! I only wish they were more natural but they will have to do until I find a replacement!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff so much, the first time I purchased the Deva No Poo product  I had an allergic reaction to the fragrance.  I used it for about a week, then gave it away.  I keep buying it periodically and using it as long as I can, then give it away!  I have naturally curly hair and this stuff loves naturally curly hair.  You should try it!  This purchase appears to be fragrance free, so I may get to use the entire bottles!</li>
            <li> This product is ok. I feel like I have to use way too much it for having relatively short hair.</li>
            <li> I have curly wave hair but it makes me hair greasy. I add half deva curl half normal shampoo and use the conditioner like normal and it&#x27;s everything I wanted it to be.</li>
            <li> I have wavy (2a) dry hair, and this product is a lot better than using regular shampoo (with sulfates) because it doesn&#x27;t strip my hair of all the oils. It also smells very nice, a natural earthy scent. One Condition provides just the right amount of moisture to my hair without weighing it down. Since there are no silicones in in, you don&#x27;t get the super slick silicone feeling that you would with regular silicone conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this product was nice, I will not be buying again because it is too expensive. You need to use a lot of product to get your hair clean since there are no foaming agents/sulfates. I have started co-washing with Tresemme Naturals Hair Conditioner and it does the same thing as DevaCurl for a lot cheaper. This is worth a try if you&#x27;re willing to pay a little more, though.</li>
            <li> I initially bought the travel kit to test this stuff out. I have very fine and thin curly hair that gets snarled and I&#x27;m used to putting gobs of conditioner in. I have tried other no poo shampoos and I didn&#x27;t feel they did the trick as the other products left my hair oily. I LOVE this stuff and so do my curls! I don&#x27;t even have to use a lot of the conditioner and am able to slide my fingers through without any problems. Happy camper. Kinda pricy so I don&#x27;t use every day but overall great products!</li>
            <li> I really like these products - the shampoo helps clean my curly hair without damaging it. The conditioner leaves everything feeling soft. I like to switch up shampoos after time, but always end up coming back to the DevaCurl no poo and conditioner.</li>
