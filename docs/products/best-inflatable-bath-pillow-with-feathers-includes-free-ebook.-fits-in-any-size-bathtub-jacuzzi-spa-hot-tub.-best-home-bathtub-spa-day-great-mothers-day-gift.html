            <li>I really enjoyed this bath pillow, I love the little bit of girly with the feathers that float around and its a very good size so your head doesn&#x27;t slip while relaxing in the tub.  </li>
            <li>The feathers are a nice pretty addition.</li>
            <li>You can add or release air which is awesome depending on if I am sitting up or laying down.</li>
            <li>The feathers make it pretty, but I love it more for how comfortable it is.  </li>
            <li>She uses the suction cups to secure it to the window.</li>
            <li>Nice and comfy for a bath, the suction cups don&#x27;t work very well though.</li>
            <li>She told me how comfortable the pillow feels under her neck when she is relaxing in the bath, and</li>
            <li>For it to be comfortable</li>
            <li>I am excited to use this in the tub.</li>
            <li>I was able to purchase this product at a low price for my unbiased review and honestly.</li>
            <li>This is more like a real pillow for the tub.</li>
            <li>The feathers are cute, but the pillow doesn&#x27;t stick very well.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a very nice product if your looking for something simple for a nice relaxing</li>
            <li>The suction cups on the back work wonderfully, I dont have to worrry about it falling down while I&#x27;m resting my head and enjoying my bath.</li>
            <li>The feathers are so pretty floating inside!</li>
            <li>These fun bath pillows are easy to blow up, hold the air very well, and are made of a sturdy plastic material.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too cute for words, and a pretty clever idea I must say.  </li>
            <li>Something that occupy them is really worth it.</li>
            <li>Will update my review again, but so far I love this.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a good size for the average head size.</li>
            <li>especially how much she enjoys the unique and original artistic design of painted pink feathers on top, and free floating pink feathers inside, very interesting &amp; clever concept!</li>
            <li>I was able to relax and lay my head back on this in the spa.  </li>
            <li>I only wish it would be more pliable when resting the head against it.</li>
            <li>My daughter claims it as her own because it&#x27;s pretty and pink.</li>
            <li>she loves it soo much!</li>
            <li>I wish it was a little more comfortable.</li>
            <li>They do not need to be filled up completely, but loosely instead, which cradles the neck better.</li>
            <li>The pink feathers inside give it an elegant look and feel.</li>
            <li>I really like this pillow...</li>
            <li>very gilie</li>
            <li>This pillow is nice for the tub, however it is pretty hard.</li>
            <li>Decent pillow, wish it wasn&#x27;t really plastic though</li>
            <li>This in made  from a strong plastic material, can&#x27;t really damage this unless you take a sharp object to it.</li>
            <li>so I just let a little out to make it more squishy.  </li>
            <li>This works well although the pads could be a little better to stay stuck to the bath tub.</li>
            <li>this is a cute little pillow.</li>
            <li>enjoyed using it  everyday in my bath tub.</li>

            <li>Cute little bath tub pillow!</li>
            <li>Love the hot pink color and the little feathers inside.</li>
            <li>So much better than using a towel because towels always end up falling into the water no matter how hard you try to avoid it.</li>
            <li>I take about 4 long hot bubble baths a week</li>
            <li>This has finally fixed my problem.</li>
            <li>If fully inflated its a little to full of air for me</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cool little pillow to help relax in the tub after a long day or night.</li>
            <li>It is a clear plastic oblong pillow with pink feathers painted on the front, and meany real ones floating around loosely inside.</li>

            <li> You can blow it up to make it as thick and hard as you would like.</li>
            <li> I found it quite difficult to inflate it though.  </li>
            <li> I found it really useless.</li>

            <li> Beautiful and fits perfectly in the tub... The feathers are so pretty floating inside!</li>
            <li> Very comfortable. Smells like plastic though</li>
            <li> This was such a great buy!  You never really think about needing a pillow like this until you do.  That being said this came in so handy for the 4th of July pool parties.  I was able to relax and lay my head back on this in the spa.  The feathers make it pretty, but I love it more for how comfortable it is.  It stays in place and is easy to inflate and deflate.  Never thought I would need a waterproof pillow.  I love it!</li>
            <li> This pillow is nice for the tub, however it is pretty hard. I wish it was a little more comfortable. I also did not like how when I blew it up, it left condensation inside with those feathers, and the feathers stuck to the inside wall then.</li>
            <li> Never had one like this before. I ordered this just curious. My kids are loving this pillow, they using it in the bath tub and play with it. Something that occupy them is really worth it.</li>
            <li> This bath pillow is very comfortable and and very pretty! The pink feathers inside give it an elegant look and feel. The suction cups on the back work wonderfully, I dont have to worrry about it falling down while I&#x27;m resting my head and enjoying my bath. Its easily inflatable and can adjusted to your comfort.</li>
            <li> The feathers are a nice pretty addition. I am not using it for the bath but in my car. My  year old can pull it out and blow it up when she gets tired. She uses the suction cups to secure it to the window. Then she deflates it when we get to our destination. Great size.</li>
            <li> Decent pillow, wish it wasn&#x27;t really plastic though</li>
            <li> I really like this pillow...its cute with the feathers inside of it and also has feathers painted on the plastic.  I think I probably would have been easily pleased with any bath pillow as I&#x27;ve never had one, its a nice addition to a relaxing bath.  If fully inflated its a little to full of air for me so I just let a little out to make it more squishy.  Very nice!</li>
            <li> It worked well, but you do need to remember to punch out a hole in the inflator when blowing it up. A little overpriced for what you get.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too cute for words, and a pretty clever idea I must say.  Love this thing!</li>
            <li> This pillow is so cute I really love the feathers.Can,t wait to take A bath tonight.</li>
            <li> This works well although the pads could be a little better to stay stuck to the bath tub. They have a tendency to slide down when I am using it. My neck is much more comfortable when I take a bath now!</li>
            <li> This works perfectly.  I take about 4 long hot bubble baths a week and I usually start getting a headache from my head laying on the tub. This has finally fixed my problem. You can add or release air which is awesome depending on if I am sitting up or laying down. Great product.</li>
            <li> the pillow is really nice for use during the bath. i take it where ever i go. personally i donot like the feathers in it.</li>
            <li> Cute bath pillow.  Quality seems good.  I found it quite difficult to inflate it though.  Once I did get it inflated, it felt a little big and was kind of uncomfortable.  So I let out about 1/4 of the air and it was perfect!  I like to read in the bath and this made it very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Great product,  great price,  fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Nice bath accessory! My little one loves playing with it too! The feathers are a nice addition!!!</li>
            <li> Nice pillow and pretty!</li>
            <li> Cute little bath tub pillow! Love the hot pink color and the little feathers inside. This in made  from a strong plastic material, can&#x27;t really damage this unless you take a sharp object to it. It&#x27;s also a good size for the average head size. I am excited to use this in the tub. I only wish it would be more pliable when resting the head against it. I guess I will just let some of the air out and see how that goes. Will update my review again, but so far I love this.  I was able to purchase this product at a low price for my unbiased review and honestly.</li>
            <li> Nice and comfy for a bath, the suction cups don&#x27;t work very well though.</li>
            <li> I purchased (2) for my wife, who loves using spa items for the bath. It is a clear plastic oblong pillow with pink feathers painted on the front, and meany real ones floating around loosely inside. It has the word &#x27;Bliss&amp;#34; written on the front in pink too. My wife feels this way about her &amp;#34;relaxing bubble baths&#x27;, so I thought buying her these was an appropriate gesture. Linda loves them!  She&#x27;s using one pillow, &amp; also has a spare. These fun bath pillows are easy to blow up, hold the air very well, and are made of a sturdy plastic material. They do not need to be filled up completely, but loosely instead, which cradles the neck better. She told me how comfortable the pillow feels under her neck when she is relaxing in the bath, and especially how much she enjoys the unique and original artistic design of painted pink feathers on top, and free floating pink feathers inside, very interesting &amp; clever concept!</li>
            <li> this is a cute little pillow. very gilie</li>
            <li> I played with this pillow for an hour before adding it to my tub. The feathers float around in the pillow so I couldn&#x27;t resist throwing it around. Sticks to the tub with no problem.</li>
            <li> I found it really useless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cool little pillow to help relax in the tub after a long day or night. The feathers give it a cute and fancy look to set the mood.</li>
            <li> Love the pillow. My daughter claims it as her own because it&#x27;s pretty and pink. I had a store bought one but it was too flat. This is more like a real pillow for the tub. The only problem is the suction cups don&#x27;t always stay on.</li>
            <li> I like using this is the tub. So much better than using a towel because towels always end up falling into the water no matter how hard you try to avoid it. You do have to blow it up yourself, but since it is so small, it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> beautiful and comfortable. enjoyed using it  everyday in my bath tub. had to buy a second one for daughter. she loves it soo much!</li>
            <li> Great deal for the price I got threw the elite club. You can blow it up to make it as thick and hard as you would like. The suction cups work good and our tub is horrible so this is a life savor</li>
            <li> Finally a bath pillow that I can use while I&#x27;m in the bath tub, obviously it&#x27;s waterproof, looks so cute with it&#x27;s pink feathers design in it. And it has 2 suction cups. Love it.</li>
            <li> Seems to work okay. I just don&#x27;t use it enough because I don&#x27;t take enough baths. Enjoyable while I used it though</li>
            <li> I love this pillow. Perfect for the tub and the feathers add a nice decorative touch. Comfy too</li>
            <li> I recieved this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review and I am honestly impressed! The quality is great for being an inflatable material and it is really comfortable plus it does bot skip at all while laying on it in the bath!</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this bath pillow, I love the little bit of girly with the feathers that float around and its a very good size so your head doesn&#x27;t slip while relaxing in the tub.  My kids have stolen it from me and use it as a bath toy, they like to put their toys on it and say its a floating island of pink chickens.  Overall this is a very nice product if your looking for something simple for a nice relaxing bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review, all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> The feathers are cute, but the pillow doesn&#x27;t stick very well. For it to be comfortable you have to under inflate it.</li>
