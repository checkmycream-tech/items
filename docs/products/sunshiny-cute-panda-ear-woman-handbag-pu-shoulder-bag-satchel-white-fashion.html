            <li>This is adorable!</li>
            <li>The ears don&#x27;t stand up on their own either, which is kind of a downer, but after playing with it a bunch</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t think of a way that they would be able to stand up on their own anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really cute.</li>
            <li>I would place too many items in the bag.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute but came all creased and bent out of shape.</li>

            <li>cute</li>
            <li>but rather then that its a great bag for anyone Otaku&#x27;s, teens , adults or older women can pull it off</li>
            <li>super cute!</li>
            <li>Super cute bag!</li>
            <li>it means more room to store all my belonging in, and the quality of the leather is soft and nice and is just the most adorable thing ever.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lived a good life, but time for a new one!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-wears out easily</li>
            <li>/&gt;-stitching on the pockets comes undone easily</li>
            <li>and its still fine</li>
            <li>Looks Exactly the same as in the picture, My ipad3, fits perfectly in it.</li>
            <li>Super cute and fun!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s huge inside too.</li>
            <li>I often carry one water bottle, my huge wallet, keys, snack and my phone with room to spare.</li>
            <li>but i can fit my hinge wallet, my pencil bag, my 3DS, PSP, my cellphone, my house keys, 2 mangas and my volunteer badge.</li>
            <li>Like what most reviews said, the ears don&#x27;t stand up on their own like they do within the pictures, but I used take on he bag to try to get them to stand like a pop-up book, and covered them with decorative tape from Daiso to hide the back tape and add some more design to it.</li>
            <li>I can fit 4 water bottles inside by themselves.</li>
            <li>It is cute and all, it match with all my outfits but it the handle broke right awayðŸ˜¥</li>
            <li>Cute bag zipper pull fell off right out of the bag.</li>
            <li>Cute purse and looks exactly like the photo.</li>
            <li>Arrived two weeks earlier than what was posted, which was quite the pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>would not have paid the full asking price for this bag, but I would say it was $13</li>
            <li>I love this bag so much.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was going to be a cheap one, but once it arrived its pretty cute just like the picture.</li>
            <li>But for only $8, I didn&#x27;t expect it to be exceptional quality.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m immensely pleased with what I received, and I&#x27;m very excited to wear it as soon as I can.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping for an item from China!</li>
            <li>I accidentally ordered 2 the first time and after reading the reviews I figured I may as well get both since they were so cheap to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall cute bag !</li>
            <li>It is a pretty unique item for someone that loves Pandas.</li>
            <li>I just cut off the old strap and put on a better one.</li>
            <li>to clean (a bit of spit and elbow grease or a damp paper towel will remove most minor scuffs and stains)&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fabric is not as thick or sturdy-feeling as I would have liked it, but I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s zipper on the top, back, and inside the purse to store in your items.</li>
            <li>This is such a cute purse.</li>
            <li>The only thing that bothers me is that the ears won&#x27;t stay up but aside from that it&#x27;s adorable</li>
            <li>The purse I received looks exactly like the one in the picture.</li>
            <li>few good sized pockets&lt;br /&gt;-easy</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was super well priced, especially after I originally found it on ebay.</li>
            <li>It is made of very nice material and is much bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will hold up for a long time!</li>
            <li>, since its white it does stain but its easy enough to clean with water.&lt;br /&gt;Spacious and adorable, this purse is definitely a winner!</li>
            <li>Big enough to hold a Harry Potter book and more !</li>
            <li>However if you&#x27;re gentle enough, is should be just fine.</li>
            <li>The size of the bag is actually large and I can fit all the necessities, even an umbrella, water bottle, and an extra medium bag.</li>
            <li>Would recommend if you only carry light weight items</li>
            <li>but ears don&#x27;t stay up very well.</li>
            <li>Shipping was really fast, it wasn&#x27;t supposed to get here until Aug 28th - Sept 16th</li>
            <li>Fast shipping to.</li>
            <li>The straps aren&#x27;t as strong, or as long as I like them to be.</li>
            <li>I use it pretty much every time I go out, and although that&#x27;s not everyday,  it&#x27;s holding up really well.</li>
            <li>The outer bag feels very durable, and I like the light grey nylon-ish fabric that was used for the liner.</li>
            <li>(but I think they look kinda cute folded down</li>
            <li>I believe I paid a decent price for this bag.</li>
            <li>So far mine has been holding up really well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute but the strap isn&#x27;t long enough</li>
            <li>and the purse sits right on my hip, personally I like bags that hand on thighs.</li>
            <li>As a 17 year old I can appreciate a decent quality bag when I see one.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s actually pretty big!</li>
            <li>The bag itself seems very sturdy and seems as if it can last a while, but, at the same time, over using it can cause the expected damages and wear that occurs to most things.</li>
            <li>And for the price you could probably just keep buying new ones when the old ones wear out.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a lovely little bag.</li>
            <li>and I really can&#x27;t get it back up.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t recommend this to very tall people who like their bags low.</li>
            <li>It also came like about a week or two,so it came early.</li>
            <li>but it can be fixed.</li>
            <li>It cute, but the handle broke off the second I put it on :/</li>
            <li>THe only issue I have with this bag is well when you wearing black jeans the bag gets black and the string on the top zipper ripped fast.</li>
            <li>(so when yours inevitably breaks you can get a new one)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had to spend a weekend carrying it around in my arms because it has no other straps)&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bag itself is a little larger than what I had expected which I absolutely love cause</li>
            <li>In the middle of the airport on the way out of town no less!</li>
            <li>I could probably fit at least two manga in there without any issue.</li>
            <li>I thought this bag was going to be cheap and flimsy, however, I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks and the only problem I&#x27;ve had was the zipper tassel coming loose.</li>
            <li>Its a simple fix to just wash it and tie the string back but just the zipper I have major problems with</li>
            <li>The zippers do look a little flimsy though, if treated gently</li>

            <li> The zippers do look a little flimsy though, if treated gently</li>
            <li> it probably wouldn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> The inside of the purse has a strange smell.</li>
            <li> I used Febreeze to eliminate the strange smell.</li>
            <li> Looks sturdy and will hold a few miscellaneous things for a young girl.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s relatively well made, however If you&#x27;re really rough on your purses</li>
            <li> can see where this white bag would get dirty really easily.</li>
            <li> Oh and the strap isn&#x27;t very long, Im 5&amp;#34;3&#x27;</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s kind of crinkly which might be annoying for others but for some weird reason I like the sound it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just big enough to hold my wallet, 3DS in it&#x27;s case, pencil case, small sketch book, makeup bag, and my charger.</li>
            <li> I bought this two years ago and it finally broke under heavy use.</li>
            <li> The bag is made out of a stronger material than I expected.</li>
            <li> The ears of the panda came looking down, but if you push them up for a long time they will take the position and stay up.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a small zippered pocket on the outside, another on the inside, along with two pouches on the inside, not zippered.</li>
            <li> n other things girls carry.</li>
            <li> Thr only complaint was that it should have thicker straps</li>
            <li> The ears stay folded down from the shipping process though.</li>
            <li> The ears however do not stand up as pictured, they flop down.</li>
            <li> just tearing at handle due to heavy weight.</li>
            <li> It came a week and a half before the estimated shipping date.</li>
            <li> When i ordered this i expected it to be fairly small (which I didn&#x27;t mind )</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just hard to tell it&#x27;s a panda when the ears are down.</li>
            <li> Its small</li>

            <li> The bag arrived sooner than estimated, and was just as pictured. The only flaw I had with it was the strap. It was flimsy, too short,and the adjustment buckle seemed too big to be on there. But for only $8, I didn&#x27;t expect it to be exceptional quality. I just cut off the old strap and put on a better one. Overall, it&#x27;s a lovely little bag. It&#x27;s just big enough to hold my wallet, 3DS in it&#x27;s case, pencil case, small sketch book, makeup bag, and my charger.</li>
            <li> I bought this two years ago and it finally broke under heavy use. I&#x27;ve tried to repair it all of last year, but it kept ripping and breaking. For around $8, it&#x27;s not so bad to replace. Amazingly cute and functional shoulder bag! It&#x27;s lived a good life, but time for a new one!</li>
            <li> Really cute. The size of the bag is actually large and I can fit all the necessities, even an umbrella, water bottle, and an extra medium bag. I am really happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Came in 2 weeks&lt;br /&gt;Ordered on the 1st received on the 15.&lt;br /&gt;Reason for four stars is the ears don&#x27;t stand up . Overall cute bag !</li>
            <li> As a 17 year old I can appreciate a decent quality bag when I see one. I thought this bag was going to be cheap and flimsy, however, I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks and the only problem I&#x27;ve had was the zipper tassel coming loose. It&#x27;s strap feels a bit thin, but I doubt it&#x27;ll break.&lt;br /&gt;I would not have paid the full asking price for this bag, but I would say it was $13 well spent.&lt;br /&gt;Also, since its white it does stain but its easy enough to clean with water.&lt;br /&gt;Spacious and adorable, this purse is definitely a winner!</li>
            <li> It was great!!! It looked soooo adorable! The bad thing was the ears got folded down and I really can&#x27;t get it back up.The bag string part is short so I don&#x27;t recommend this to very tall people who like their bags low.It also came like about a week or two,so it came early.</li>
            <li> The ears don&#x27;t stick up like in the pictures. D:&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s so cute and the perfect size!! I use it daily! xD</li>
            <li> I bought this for one of my friends and she uses it a lot. It is falling a part a bit but it can be fixed. She&#x27;s been using it for 3 months  already and its still fine just tearing at handle due to heavy weight. Would recommend if you only carry light weight items</li>
            <li> I love this bag!! So far mine has been holding up really well. I use it pretty much every time I go out, and although that&#x27;s not everyday,  it&#x27;s holding up really well. The outer bag feels very durable, and I like the light grey nylon-ish fabric that was used for the liner. (It&#x27;s kind of crinkly which might be annoying for others but for some weird reason I like the sound it makes.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see where this white bag would get dirty really easily. The ears don&#x27;t stand up on their own either, which is kind of a downer, but after playing with it a bunch I can&#x27;t think of a way that they would be able to stand up on their own anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was super well priced, especially after I originally found it on ebay.</li>
            <li> super cute! but ears don&#x27;t stay up very well.</li>
            <li> It is cute and all, it match with all my outfits but it the handle broke right awayðŸ˜¥ im very disappointed</li>
            <li> I love this bag so much. At first I thought it was going to be a cheap one, but once it arrived its pretty cute just like the picture. Its small but i can fit my hinge wallet, my pencil bag, my 3DS, PSP, my cellphone, my house keys, 2 mangas and my volunteer badge. THe only issue I have with this bag is well when you wearing black jeans the bag gets black and the string on the top zipper ripped fast. Its a simple fix to just wash it and tie the string back but just the zipper I have major problems with but rather then that its a great bag for anyone Otaku&#x27;s, teens , adults or older women can pull it off lol.</li>
            <li> The fabric is not as thick or sturdy-feeling as I would have liked it, but I am pleased with it. The ears stay folded down from the shipping process though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute but the strap isn&#x27;t long enough</li>
            <li> I am from Baltimore, MD. I ordered this bag on February 28, 2014, and received it on March 12, 2014. It came a week and a half before the estimated shipping date.Very fast shipping for an item from China! The bag is made out of a stronger material than I expected. The ears are bent, and hard to keep up. There&#x27;s zipper on the top, back, and inside the purse to store in your items. I had no issues with the zippers. The inside of the purse has a strange smell. I used Febreeze to eliminate the strange smell. I would place too many items in the bag. The straps aren&#x27;t as strong, or as long as I like them to be. It is a pretty unique item for someone that loves Pandas. A purse like this one would be hard to find in stores. I believe I paid a decent price for this bag.</li>
            <li> Arrived two weeks earlier than what was posted, which was quite the pleasant surprise. The bag itself is a little larger than what I had expected which I absolutely love cause it means more room to store all my belonging in, and the quality of the leather is soft and nice and is just the most adorable thing ever. Like what most reviews said, the ears don&#x27;t stand up on their own like they do within the pictures, but I used take on he bag to try to get them to stand like a pop-up book, and covered them with decorative tape from Daiso to hide the back tape and add some more design to it. The bag itself seems very sturdy and seems as if it can last a while, but, at the same time, over using it can cause the expected damages and wear that occurs to most things. Overall, I&#x27;m immensely pleased with what I received, and I&#x27;m very excited to wear it as soon as I can.</li>
            <li> Super cute bag! Shipping was really fast, it wasn&#x27;t supposed to get here until Aug 28th - Sept 16th and it&#x27;s only Aug 15th. It is made of very nice material and is much bigger than I expected. My clutch wallet fits in there with plenty of room, plus my iPhone. I could probably fit at least two manga in there without any issue. If you are looking for a cute panda bag, this may be for you! The zippers do look a little flimsy though, if treated gently I&#x27;m sure it will hold up for a long time!</li>
            <li> It cute, but the handle broke off the second I put it on :/</li>
            <li> I imagined it to be bigger based on the picture. It&#x27;s cute but came all creased and bent out of shape.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Just as described, good quality! Arrived in time and in good condition. Very cute, a MUST for every kawaii lover. This is such a cute purse. The ears of the panda came looking down, but if you push them up for a long time they will take the position and stay up.</li>
            <li> It was so great!! It&#x27;s huge inside too. I can fit 4 water bottles inside by themselves. I often carry one water bottle, my huge wallet, keys, snack and my phone with room to spare. The ears however do not stand up as pictured, they flop down. I think it&#x27;sstill cute like that, it&#x27;s just hard to tell it&#x27;s a panda when the ears are down. There&#x27;s a small zippered pocket on the outside, another on the inside, along with two pouches on the inside, not zippered. The inside zipper is very small and hard to grab, I added some string to it to make it easier to move. Oh and the strap isn&#x27;t very long, Im 5&amp;#34;3&#x27; and the purse sits right on my hip, personally I like bags that hand on thighs. But all in all I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> The item was perfect. It looked just like the picture. Thr only complaint was that it should have thicker straps</li>
            <li> This is the most Adorable Bag i Have bought. Looks Exactly the same as in the picture, My ipad3, fits perfectly in it. Fast shipping to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute. But it arrived in poor condition sadly....</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier then anticipated date. Cute bag that will be given as a gift. Looks sturdy and will hold a few miscellaneous things for a young girl.</li>
            <li> When i ordered this i expected it to be fairly small (which I didn&#x27;t mind ) but it&#x27;s actually pretty big! Big enough to hold a Harry Potter book and more ! The only thing that bothers me is that the ears won&#x27;t stay up but aside from that it&#x27;s adorable and I wear it with almost every outfit !</li>
            <li> I accidentally ordered 2 the first time and after reading the reviews I figured I may as well get both since they were so cheap to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Very cute&lt;br /&gt;-very spacious&lt;br /&gt;-a few good sized pockets&lt;br /&gt;-easy to clean (a bit of spit and elbow grease or a damp paper towel will remove most minor scuffs and stains)&lt;br /&gt;-very inexpensive (so when yours inevitably breaks you can get a new one)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-wears out easily (Ordered mine in January and the strap snapped off in March/April after daily use. In the middle of the airport on the way out of town no less! I had to spend a weekend carrying it around in my arms because it has no other straps)&lt;br /&gt;-stitching on the pockets comes undone easily (I had to go in by hand and resew the lining on the pockets on both the purses I received)&lt;br /&gt;-ears don&#x27;t stick up like they do in the picture (but I think they look kinda cute folded down anyway)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a good purse for the price.</li>
            <li> I LOve it!!!! It looks very cute!!!</li>
            <li> Cute purse and looks exactly like the photo. And if your looking for a panda purse you should get this one and u will have enough room to fix ur wallet n other things girls carry.</li>
            <li> The purse I received looks exactly like the one in the picture. It&#x27;s relatively well made, however If you&#x27;re really rough on your purses it probably wouldn&#x27;t last long. However if you&#x27;re gentle enough, is should be just fine. And for the price you could probably just keep buying new ones when the old ones wear out.</li>
            <li> This is adorable! The strap is kinda short. Definately cant wear it across the body. Super cute and fun!</li>
            <li> Cute bag zipper pull fell off right out of the bag.</li>
