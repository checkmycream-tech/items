            <li>I am delighted with the promptness of the arrival of the toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>constructed, nice colors; and great value.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great product- perfect natural toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The colors are fun and the price is great for these.</li>
            <li>that did such an incredible job!</li>
            <li>Better than Fuchs, lasts forever, I don&#x27;t even care that once in a while a bristle comes off in my mouth.</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t use toothpaste, and I brush with warm water, but these toothbrushes get my teeth super clean after just a minute or so.</li>
            <li>She said the one you enjoy using.</li>
            <li>Great Natural Bristle Soft toothbrushes!&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>At 60, I have had many natural bristle toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many natural tooth brushes but this one not meet my expectations.</li>
            <li>I would say more medium than soft.</li>
            <li>the price is right</li>
            <li>Soft bristles, easy to see which is morning brush and which is night brush.  </li>
            <li>This product is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>My two teenage boys love them as well.</li>
            <li>The heat is large which took some getting used to</li>
            <li>I expect to get praise for my clean teeth at my next dental visit.</li>
            <li>Made my teeth feel extra clean.</li>
            <li>These are too rough on the enamel and the bristles break easily, leaving you with clumps of them in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>Not a good choice for cleaning your teeth, but turns out they are great for scrubbing around the toilet, grout, and anything else that needs a good scrubbing with a small tool!</li>
            <li>While the handle may be fine for smaller people, I was hoping since the head was large, the handle would be bigger.</li>
            <li>I expected more from the performance it wear&#x27;s down quickly.  </li>
            <li>I searched Amazon for a large head, soft, natural bristle toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using mine for 3 months now and it shows very little wear, which is much more than I can say for my husband&#x27;s synthetic bristled one.</li>
            <li>only concern is that you have to be EXTRA alert to the possibility of a bristle falling out during brushing.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I will more than likely continue to buy them.&lt;br /&gt;Swissco has been around for years.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>I was looking for a natural alternative to sythentic brushes.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very big, so it is a bit of work to reach the very back teeth if you have a small mouth like mine, but the bristles are amazing.</li>
            <li>I have found that I use this brush longer and more carefully than my previous brushes because the bristles are quite long and soft.</li>
            <li>At first I was a little unsure about these toothbrushes.</li>

            <li> That is issue #1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Issue #2, is that, even though I have a large mouth, the bristle area on these toothbrushes is SO large, that it makes it difficult to reach my back molars with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is a little rough, yet gentle on the gums at the same time.  </li>

            <li> At first I was a little unsure about these toothbrushes. They&#x27;re very big, so it is a bit of work to reach the very back teeth if you have a small mouth like mine, but the bristles are amazing. I don&#x27;t use toothpaste, and I brush with warm water, but these toothbrushes get my teeth super clean after just a minute or so. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with these. I&#x27;ve never found a toothbrush before that did such an incredible job!</li>
            <li> I will never know if these brushes were any good. When I received them,the container each brush was in,had been opened. the safety seal on each plastic container had been previously opened. Why ?? I threw them away !</li>
            <li> Better than Fuchs, lasts forever, I don&#x27;t even care that once in a while a bristle comes off in my mouth.</li>
            <li> This is a great product- perfect natural toothbrush. great quality we are very pleased with these! The three pack is just want I wanted and the price is right</li>
            <li> I buy these toothbrushes for my guests and I. The colors are fun and the price is great for these. I love the Swissco brand, really great toothbrushes!</li>
            <li> bought these just to try them out not sure what they are made of  they work well they do leave little bits in your mouth  but that stopped after a few uses  try them</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great toothbrush. used this company for 30 plus years. never found on line before. now i know where to get them.</li>
            <li> These are not soft! Not a good choice for cleaning your teeth, but turns out they are great for scrubbing around the toilet, grout, and anything else that needs a good scrubbing with a small tool!</li>
            <li> I asked my dental hygienest for the best toothbrush. She said the one you enjoy using. I have found that I use this brush longer and more carefully than my previous brushes because the bristles are quite long and soft. The heat is large which took some getting used to but now that I have gotten used to it I am very happy. The bristles take quite a long time to dry so I have a morning and an evening brush. I expect to get praise for my clean teeth at my next dental visit.</li>
            <li> the brush head is giant</li>
            <li> I searched Amazon for a large head, soft, natural bristle toothbrush. This product is exactly what I was looking for. It feels awesome in my mouth. My two teenage boys love them as well. My only complaint is that the handle is small and not ergonomic so it does not fit well in my large hands. While the handle may be fine for smaller people, I was hoping since the head was large, the handle would be bigger. I will order this brand again.</li>
            <li> I am delighted with the promptness of the arrival of the toothbrushes. The workmanship is great, but I have two issues with the product. At 60, I have had many natural bristle toothbrushes. These, were the hardest that I have ever purchased. The bristles have not softened up, enough to use them without raking my gums, badly. That is issue #1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Issue #2, is that, even though I have a large mouth, the bristle area on these toothbrushes is SO large, that it makes it difficult to reach my back molars with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use them, for scrubbing toothbrushes, but not in my mouth...</li>
            <li> Made my teeth feel extra clean. I would recommend that you do not eat leafy greens with this product because it will cause the bristles to turn color.</li>
            <li> by far the worst toothbush ever made&lt;br /&gt;Amazon Should not even offer this item it is so inferior&lt;br /&gt;one brushing and the bristles became matted and tangled</li>
            <li> Soft bristles, easy to see which is morning brush and which is night brush.  Wonderful for my teeth and gums!</li>
            <li> I expected more from the performance it wear&#x27;s down quickly.  Brussels continued to come out in mouth while brushing.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve used many natural tooth brushes but this one not meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> I was very excited about these brushes, and they were alright; but after approx. 2 to 3 weeks the bristles begin falling out.  If you are willing to change ultra frequently your toothbrush... then they are great!</li>
            <li> Great Natural Bristle Soft toothbrushes!&lt;br /&gt;Well constructed, nice colors; and great value.&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is that you have to be EXTRA alert to the possibility of a bristle falling out during brushing.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I will more than likely continue to buy them.&lt;br /&gt;Swissco has been around for years.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks A Million!&lt;br /&gt;DeAnna</li>
            <li> These are too rough on the enamel and the bristles break easily, leaving you with clumps of them in your mouth.  I was looking for a natural product but these are disappointing.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural alternative to sythentic brushes.  This one fits my bill perfectly.  It is a little rough, yet gentle on the gums at the same time.  The head is quite a bit larger than mainstream toothbrushes that I am used to.  My husband complains that the bristles fall out, but it hasn&#x27;t been a problem for me. I&#x27;ve been using mine for 3 months now and it shows very little wear, which is much more than I can say for my husband&#x27;s synthetic bristled one.</li>
            <li> I would say more medium than soft.</li>
