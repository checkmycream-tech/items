            <li> Can&#x27;t handle the smell. Too strong for me.</li>
            <li> This product is niiiccceee I like silicone mix products and smell. Some don&#x27;t but I do :)! This leave in does its job! :) I recommend it holds nicer and defines my curls</li>
            <li> Like this product third bottle</li>
            <li> leave my hair silky, non grease. i&#x27;ve been using the silicon mix treatment but never the leave in, i am totally satisfy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and a great product. Reasonably priced.  Smells great. Works well on my natural hair to soften and strengthen it. Will continue to buy this product along with the deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> cheaper at some of the salons, but worth the money in a pinch. would recommend to any one with thick hair and or african american natural hair.</li>
            <li> Not that great for my type of hair, I have average wavy hair, kind of frizzy. I bought this because I love the regular silicon mix. Smell is ok.

            <li> I love  x 20 this product. It contains ceramides and relaxed hair benefits the most from these products. I air dry and wrap my hair after my weekly wash and deep condition. The ceramides in this product protect the hair shaft from the extended exposure to water from air drying. I will forever use this product to keep my relaxed hair healthy.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Leaves my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> No me gusto, te deja el pelo horrible :(</li>
            <li> I ran out of my leave in conditioning spray that costs almost three times as much.  I was introduced to this by a beauty guru on Youtube.  She said she uses this with the deep treatment.  I also started doing the same and have noticed a big improvement of my hair.  I apply extra product to my ends because that&#x27;s where it&#x27;s the most damaged.  The smell is a bit strong, but it goes away for me.</li>
