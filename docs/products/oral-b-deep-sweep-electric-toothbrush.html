            <li>but this product does a great job.</li>
            <li>Read great reviews on Deadspin Deals and decided to go with this Toothbrush.</li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>This is a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Would prefer automatic santization and an improved charging station, but it&#x27;s still great.</li>
            <li>battery lasts for around 4 days (2 brushes per day) and the built in timer (and separate clock) are great accessories.  </li>
            <li>The brush head storage, clock time and pressure sensor all work great.</li>
            <li>The brush works great...  </li>

            <li>I love the time it comes with!!</li>
            <li>Very nice toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>However, it is so very nice.  </li>
            <li>Very nice product</li>
            <li>I find very effective.</li>
            <li>The motions feel very effective.</li>
            <li>Two amazing purchases!</li>
            <li>Best toothbrush, love everything about it.</li>
            <li>It makes more noise, but I am very happy with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>LOOKS GOOD, WORKS GREAT.  </li>
            <li>I have been happy with it but was eager to give this Oral-B electric toothbrush a try since I&#x27;ve heard good things about</li>
            <li>I told her I hadn&#x27;t noticed because her teeth were beautiful and perfect before, which earned me a smooch, but the point is that it will improve your smile no matter the setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>but I hope it lets me get good reviews at the dentist...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost moved to purchase one, but then again, my $7.99 Oral-B does a good job too-giggles...</li>
            <li>Superior product.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s a good chance that you can break the device.  </li>
            <li>My dental hygienist gave me a good report.  </li>
            <li>I loved this one from the start.</li>
            <li>Buy the product, you&#x27;ll be glad you did and show it with shiny brilliant teeth.</li>
            <li>it  does  a  superior job at cleaning  </li>
            <li>However, I decided to take the plunge when I read the fair return</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning performance of the Oral-B is every bit as good as my Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning performance of the Oral-B is every bit as good as my Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>The Oral-B Triaction 5000 is a good, top-of-the-line toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>3 stars; it&#x27;s a good brush</li>
            <li>It is a good and durable product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;to imagine how it could be good for your gums.</li>
            <li>To me this suggests that the brush must be doing a really good job removing all the bacteria from the surfaces of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an excellent electric toothbrush with unique features.  </li>
            <li>This Oral-B product has been an exceptional performer.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly &amp; keeps my teeth, gums, &amp; braces very clean &amp; healthy.</li>
            <li>Powerful, teeth look great!</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very pleased.  </li>
            <li>electric toothbrush is as &#x27;intelligent&#x27; as you get and it&#x27;s many features</li>
            <li>my first was another brand that was good, this one is just excellent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this one.</li>
            <li>Very interesting.  </li>
            <li>The brush that comes with this ergonomically designed handle is unique because it swivels from side to side, thus enabling the user to use easily ideal brushing techniques.</li>
            <li>Another nice touch is that when the brush is done charging, the very bright power light goes out instead of staying on all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>But it is the brush head and the wonderful Smart Guide that made this brush a cleaning guru for me!</li>
            <li>Love the power!  </li>
            <li>Love the timer setting!</li>
            <li>We love it!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>I was pretty impressed!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>There is a coupon in the box for refill heads, and if you register you will get in even better coupon, so don&#x27;t throw that paper out!</li>
            <li>Love my Oral B Tooth Brush !</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is really great, it has prompts to fine tune your brushing</li>
            <li>This is really nice toothbrush.</li>
            <li>That would be a nice item to buy separately if you have children.</li>
            <li>I am comparing this toothbrush to Sonicare brushes I have owned and do own .&lt;br</li>
            <li>This brush is good but the Sonicare are better than they used to be</li>
            <li>TIMED BRUSHING WITH QUADRANT CONTROL AND SMILEY FACE ADD NICE TOUCH.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for a week now and am loving it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice to have</li>
            <li>Thanks to Braun and the excellent product.  </li>
            <li>Oral-B fits nicely in one&#x27;s hand.</li>
            <li>s clean has greatly improved my teeth and gums...</li>
            <li>Also i suffer a bit from OCD - this brush is great and now I&#x27;ve got a clean mouth in about 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li>A great sensation of really clean teeth.  </li>
            <li>But within its market, this brush is an excellent product that I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this new toothbrush about 2 months ago and am so impressed with it.</li>
            <li>great price, quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Well, I am pleased to report that the results Oral-B are fairly comparable in many aspects.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is by far the best part of the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t say that my teeth are whiter yet, but give it some more time</li>
            <li>This is by far the best electronic toothbrush!!!  </li>
            <li>Strongly recommended!</li>
            <li>in all... a great brush with a handy Smart Guide.</li>
            <li>I think it clean just as good</li>
            <li>Happily the replacement heads look and perform exactly like the included brush head.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great electric toothbrush but you may be equally as happy with a more basic version that doesn&#x27;t include the SmartGuide and the superfluous modes.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush, was exactly as described</li>
            <li>it worked really great when i first got it.</li>
            <li>nice plus, the brush runs for quite some time on one charge, and an overnight charge now and then will keep you going strong.</li>
            <li>-B makes very good toothbrushes, but their marketing leaves a bit to be desired; this is far from a breakthrough.  </li>
            <li>LOVE THAT.CLEAN TEEETH AND BRIGHT SMILE</li>
            <li>Really love this ...</li>
            <li>/&gt;What could be better with this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS TOOTHBRUSH, IT MAKES</li>
            <li>SURE</li>
            <li>SmartGuide 5000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush is an interesting product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell--both units do a great job--the Oral B unit also \\&quot;vibrates\\&quot;</li>
            <li>more w/in the mouth--not a problem for me.  </li>
            <li>Love love love...</li>
            <li>Seems to be able to brush all over the teeth much more so, rather than just glazing over the teeth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There maybe more cons to be listed, but it&#x27;s all I can remember off-hand at this moment.</li>
            <li>This is simply the BEST automatic toothbrush on the market today, period.</li>
            <li>I gums look so much better</li>
            <li>and I love the just from the dentist</li>
            <li>My teeth have never felt better</li>
            <li>Proof is in the better dental appointments, too.</li>
            <li>I know, I know, you would like for us to spend more money on your products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love having a clock in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>And it brushes and cleans my teeth better</li>
            <li>glad I did</li>
            <li>I love the brush, but I wish I could have done without the expense of the smiley face timer.</li>
            <li>This was a gift and they enjoy it twice a day!</li>
            <li>Love how it works so well dispite his braces.</li>
            <li>Love that you can chage the speed of how you can  change the type of cleaning</li>
            <li>My husband LOVES this so much more than the one he had.  </li>
            <li>it is even better.</li>
            <li>but the DiamondClean is better.</li>
            <li>The Oral B is way better than a manual brush</li>
            <li>it is much better than my 7</li>
            <li>Amazon had all the items to select from not like most stores.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t judge which of the two is better.  </li>
            <li>sure, I can see myself keeping this tooth brush for another 3-4 years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Simply the best toothbrush on the market.</li>
            <li>Even better now.</li>
            <li>The sensitive light indicator is an awesome feature.</li>
            <li>Now, I have better awareness and control of my brushing technique.</li>
            <li>What could be better?</li>
            <li>It is way better than Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>I love it  </li>
            <li>The battery life is better than that of my car.</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Moreover, it allows you to choose between 5 settings, the most I&#x27;ve ever had in an electric brush.  </li>
            <li>I were to suggest improvements, I&#x27;d love a better charger and automatic UV sanitization.  </li>

            <li>I can get a better case at the dollar store...for wanna guess?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love gadgets</li>
            <li>I had a Sonic Care toothbrush and decided to give this a shot after reading the study that showed it did a better job of removing plaque.</li>
            <li>the carrying case does not offer any ventilation and most the features you will be using it on this brush.</li>
            <li>the carrying case does not offer any ventilation and most the features you will be using it on this brush.</li>
            <li>product is as advertised and works magically</li>
            <li>but it was interesting to discover that I brush my teeth longer than required.  </li>
            <li>I having been using rotary toothbrushes for more than 40 years</li>
            <li>For some reason I thought you&#x27;d have to do something more to get it to connect</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, as to the comparison of the Sonicare vs. Oral-B - I think this Oral-B gave me a better cleaning.</li>
            <li>Unlike a manual toothbrush, this toothbrush does most of the work for me.</li>
            <li>With the Sonicare,I was able to use the included brush immediately.</li>
            <li>Oral B should have included a sample selection of toothbrushes so that the customer could figure out which one was best without having to pay extra for his/</li>

            <li>I am pleased with amazon</li>
            <li>more deeply.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was is so much better.  </li>
            <li>I love the massage head the most.</li>
            <li>love shopping at Amazon, can always find what I am looking for, and</li>
            <li>Love the timer feature.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>At any rate, I&#x27;m glad I upgraded.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Sonicare has been tested to do a tad better then oral-b design.  </li>
            <li>but it still have more area where bacteria build up.  </li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It has been better than its predecessor - another Oral-B - which lasted 10 years.</li>
            <li>Excellent deep cleaning!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still much more of</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;won&#x27;t be used by most people, and they probably won&#x27;t use the rack</li>
            <li>It would have made much more sense to have it hold two</li>
            <li>, so I don&#x27;t think most users will have a need to mount the&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is phenomenal ...</li>
            <li>I have literally never had better reports from my hygienist.</li>
            <li>However, if you have a low tolerance for noise, this may not be your best choice.</li>
            <li>At the same time, I tend to buy the latest and greatest, thinking that it&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li>At the time of this review, the 5000 costs about $40 more.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the money since it will keep my teeth healthy.</li>
            <li>Okay, I know mechanical brushes - and this is the BOMB of all</li>
            <li>Though i suspect that may change over time as my teeth and gums adjust to the more vigorous</li>
            <li>(1 unit is included) seems most effective to take full advantage of the triple-action sweep motion the 5000 provides.  </li>
            <li>This one, like the first (4000 model) is giving me a good brushing and my dentist is pleased with the results I&#x27;m getting.  </li>
            <li>teeth always come out very clean with this brush which is not something i would say of the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Teeth feel very clean, almost like a polish from the dentist</li>
            <li>Timer helps you get a very clean mouth.</li>
            <li>Love it even more than my SonicCare AND more importantly, the replacement heads are affordable.</li>
            <li>Great tool for getting super clean teeth and a germ free mouth.</li>
            <li>I agree with the rest of the reviewer this a pretty good toothbrush, but at this point of writing</li>
            <li>Teeth are exceptionally clean and my mouth feels clean!!</li>
            <li>worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>I am happy of the switch and gotten used to oral-b with this new brush head design.  </li>
            <li>I am happy of the switch and gotten used to oral-b with this new brush head design.  </li>
            <li>Strongly urged by my dentist to encourage better dental hygiene.  </li>
            <li>like going to the dentist twice daily&lt;br /&gt;good built, nice timer adequate power&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;First the setup - like most electric toothbrushes, easy and intuitive to set up.</li>
            <li>the brush heads attach is much better than the sonicare, it feels more secure</li>
            <li>I received my toothbrush a week ago, and was quite impressed by the many functions, especially as they helped reinforce good brushing habits in my 7-year old daughter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s what makes this beauty clean like a marvel!</li>
            <li>and it makes my teeth feel so clean!  </li>
            <li>I have only used the cleaning and whitening modes and they are very good.</li>
            <li>So, for brushing, for those of us who know how to brush properly, this is ideal.</li>
            <li>Packaging was secure and appropriate in size.</li>
            <li>the Triaction seems like a better fit for you than the Pulsonic,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>I tried 3 other electric toothbrushes and this one works the best of all.</li>
            <li>My hygienist complimented me on my clean healthy teeth and gums since using this and water pic.  </li>
            <li>I have been using an Oral B Vitality and after my last visit to the dentist where things were doing great, I decided to upgrade my brush to, hopefully, make it even better.</li>
            <li>Love how clean my teeth get after brushing them.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>Clean teeth and healthy gums.</li>
            <li>This was not an easy task.  </li>
            <li>The replacement brush heads are easy to find at Wal-Mart and I used a coupon from the newspaper.</li>
            <li>just because you can easily see what setting you&#x27;re on.</li>
            <li>The vibration was so strong it made my head \\&quot;itch\\&quot;, LOL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am delighted with the cleaning power of this particular arrangement.</li>
            <li>recommend to buy it strongly</li>
            <li>Again, Go with Sonicare, Sonicare makes a Much quieter and MUCH more effective bush.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Oral B tooth brushes for a long time and this one is very good.</li>
            <li>so I can be sure to brush for a full 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Sweet deal, love the travel case and the battery basically lasts forever - I don&#x27;t even have to bring charger anymore.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s incomparable, and it&#x27;s even better than my Sonicare Diamond Clean</li>
            <li>Great feels like a dental professional clean up</li>
            <li>I works fine.</li>
            <li>and it works just fine.  </li>
            <li>It feels comfortable in the hand and is easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>It has a slightly rubberized bottom and a tilted display so it works perfectly there.  </li>
            <li>It has a slightly rubberized bottom and a tilted display so it works perfectly there.  </li>
            <li>all seems fine again.  </li>
            <li>I think they all do a fine job.  </li>
            <li>Pulsonic included a separate fine head for cleaning your gum line</li>
            <li>Sonicare offers a pleasant hum while you&#x27;re brushing.</li>
            <li>Sonicare offers a pleasant hum while you&#x27;re brushing.</li>
            <li>You will be quite pleased with this worthy investment.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get a very good cleaning from this one, but is it any better than what you&#x27;d have gotten from their previous top-of-the-line model?  </li>
            <li>quality was deemed not as good as the first one I bought and the 2nd electric toothbrush (forgotten the brand) wasn&#x27;t as good as the Roro-router . . .&lt;br /&gt;Loma</li>
            <li>This unit is great for travel as a full charge is good for 20 brush sessions and also comes included with a stylish, hard plastic carrying case.</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:mo17LX29MOE1FWD]]The Oral-B 5000 electric toothbrush makes a fine toothbrush on its own, but it&#x27;s the nifty Smart Guide that makes this toothbrush a standout.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I especially like the smart guide, the best ever!</li>
            <li>my dentist and hygienist noticed a huge change in my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a toothbrush this fantastic in my life.  </li>
            <li>They are all great for their specific purpose.  </li>
            <li>&quot; 5000 is a great unit(BTW, the \\&quot;deep sweep head\\&quot; can also be used on the Oral B 1k, 3K and 4K units)--I will use it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because the designers of this brush dropped the ball in a couple of important ways:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Feel of the smooth plastic brush seems to condone dripping of liquids.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>However, I prefer using a night light instead of something serving as dual purposes.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>great price PLUS an extra discount</li>
            <li>I had the same model before this 1 worked great.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush comes with a flossing and regular brush head which are great for switching between day and night.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The feel of the Oral B and The Sonicare Elite are neck and neck but the feel of the DiamondClean is like you are holding a light precision instrument.  </li>
            <li>but sure are fun.  </li>
            <li>the Oral-B sounds like those cheap $5 AA powered toothbrushes you pick up in the impulse section of Wally-world.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more useful as a self-defense weapon if anyone ever invades my bathroom.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Electric toothbrushes do a fantastic job cleaning your teeth and masaging your gums.</li>
            <li>It is great for someone like me who doesn&#x27;t spend enough time brushing.</li>
            <li>This is a great electric toothbrush with 5 different modes.</li>
            <li>If you have some younger people in the house that could benefit from the LCD guide, this may be a great model for them.  </li>
            <li>If you have some younger people in the house that could benefit from the LCD guide, this may be a great model for them.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>The brushing part was nice and gentle though.</li>
            <li>For instance, I was tinkering with the toothbrush before it was fully charged and was alarmed at the sound.</li>
            <li>and it has given me a brighter smile and a better check up.</li>
            <li>and far superior to those competitors.  </li>
            <li>Far more effective than maual brushing.</li>
            <li>So far so good,</li>
            <li>you can systematically be sure you&#x27;ve hit all the right spots.</li>
            <li>Somehow, watching the timer countdown (4x 30-second increments) makes me more inclined to finish a 2-minute brushing session than before, when I&#x27;d just brush while staring at the wall and wait for the toothbrush to buzz at the right times.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t need this kind of versatility, the older Professional 1000 is a good alternative.&lt;br</li>
            <li>TOO MUCH WORK!!!  </li>
            <li>If one is seeking a great clean, this will definitely provide that.</li>
            <li>but most people will find the older model to be a better value proposition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth feel very clean when I&#x27;m done, and my breath is fresh.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel very clean when I&#x27;m done, and my breath is fresh.  </li>
            <li>And a very useful bonus is that the wall-mountable smart guide has a clock on it, so you know the time of day for those of us who are in a rush when using the bathroom! :)))</li>

            <li>With all the discount coupons available, and sometimes a &#x27;special&#x27; sale, you can get this $129 +/-</li>
            <li>Strong function, good quality and low price, especially toothbrush head comes too strong, with more than one month of both very strong.</li>
            <li>For years and years now I have shyed away from electric toothbrushes because I assumed that they were all like the original Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line - If I did not buy the sonicare then this brush would surely have a higher rating from me</li>
            <li>when I ordered this product for review, I was really excited.</li>
            <li>The original sonic care had bacteria or some junk between the head and body.  </li>
            <li>I had a scanned copy of what I had sent them, and they denied it because it wasn&#x27;t the original.</li>
            <li>I think what is most impressive to me about this electric toothbrush is that I&#x27;ve noticed that my teeth stay cleaner longer than they did when I brushed with a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Feel so clean after using it</li>
            <li>Definately leaves a clean feeling when using this brush.</li>
            <li>I use the head with the pointy bristles to clean between teeth; its listed as providing cleaning on dentures.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to clean as well as the Oral-B Sonic Complete.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>I felt like I was getting all of my teeth just as clean as with this brush</li>
            <li>My teeth have never felt and looked so clean.  </li>
            <li>I could never bruch my teeth as clean as this does.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels perfectly clean.</li>
            <li>Oh so clean.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so clean.  </li>
            <li>The Sonicare Diamond Clean takes it.</li>
            <li>they clean but do not massage the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes your teeth  feel polished and clean  </li>
            <li>my teeth feel so clean after using this brush.</li>
            <li>My dentist says the my teeth are clean.  </li>
            <li>Let me just say, my teeth felt extremely clean after using this 2x a day for 7 days.</li>
            <li>I feel a noticeable difference in how clean my teeth are after brushing.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with Oral-B Professional Deep Sweep and I recommend it wholeheartedly.</li>
            <li>an incredibly clean feeling.</li>
            <li>They work well and clean efficiently and do not break after a year of use (like the Sonicares).</li>
            <li>&quot; feeling of clean.</li>
            <li>Totally excited about this product after a full year of use.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought the clock/timer was overkill, but the positive reinforcement smiley face when finished is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>My favorite part of the tooth brush is the smart guide.</li>
            <li>The Oral-B Professional toothbrush comes with some nice features.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the Braun that imitates the Sonicare, but my guess is going to do the same as the Sonicare and won&#x27;t produce as good a result as this, the \\&quot;original\\&quot;,</li>
            <li>Both Oral B and Sonicare do a good job--if both are used properly.  </li>
            <li>Love it, very high-quality, deep-cleaning toothbrush.</li>
            <li>So far I am loving this brush.</li>
            <li>This brush feels good and solid but it lacks the ease of use of the competition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bluetooth thingamabob, I think, is a scam to allow company to charge more than they really need to.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s good to replace the brush heads regularly.  </li>
            <li>but the timer has prodded me to change my brushing habits to the full 2 minute session.  </li>
            <li>its full potential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Sweet...</li>
            <li>Sweet...</li>
            <li>it is true.  </li>
            <li>After you brush for the full 2 minutes, you are rewarded with a smiley face.</li>
            <li>The cool thing is you can be in another room</li>
            <li>The cheaper ones we have are good enough to do the job.</li>
            <li>some people say oral-b is noisier then sonicare, it is true but I won&#x27;t lose any sleep over</li>
            <li>Turns out, this is a completely different animal -- in a good way.</li>
            <li>nice touches: a fairly strong looking travel case for the brush and brush heads (the battery will supposedly last up to 10 days without a charge);</li>
            <li>nice touches: a fairly strong looking travel case for the brush and brush heads (the battery will supposedly last up to 10 days without a charge);</li>
            <li>The toothbrush cleaning action is incredible, better than any other toothbrush I&#x27;ve tested (and I have tested many!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just love that and feel like it gives the brush heads a much more thorough cleaning than simply rinsing them in the water after you clean your teeth.</li>
            <li>I just love that and feel like it gives the brush heads a much more thorough cleaning than simply rinsing them in the water after you clean your teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Setup was pretty easy, one thing that through me though is that the brush is delivered with zero charge.  </li>
            <li>And the 30 second cues help keep you on track to brushing long enough to do the best job.r more effective than maual brushing.</li>
            <li>It would be just as good without the large smiley face that appears after the brushing is complete, and that might allow them to make the housing</li>
            <li>It leaves my&lt;br /&gt;mouth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Useful for anyone wanting to thoroughly clean their teeth.</li>
            <li>The whitening brush is also helpful, but i limit my use to this brush for the same reason that i use Xylitol toothpaste most of the time, and a cleaning paste infrequently, i want to keep my enamel intact more than i want whiter teeth.</li>
            <li>, It must have taken longer though; 30 seconds for each quadrant seems too quick.</li>
            <li>life is awesome, last you like a week on daily use&lt;br /&gt;nice carrying case</li>
            <li>I love the sweeping brush as it gets around and in between teeth better than a regular brush.</li>
            <li>Does an excellent job on plaque and has terrific feed back on time brushing and brushing pressure.</li>
            <li>In particular, people with braces should consider purchasing the \\&quot;Ortho Brush Head\\&quot; that is better suited to cleaning teeth with braces.</li>
            <li>but luckily another suggested I just use Sonicare, floss every night, and dab Listerine on my gums.</li>
            <li>Came quickly, thank you.  </li>
            <li>For most travel,&lt;br /&gt;this won&#x27;t be an issue, since the battery should last many days, but&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unless you&#x27;re super fastidious about cleaning the charger!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The advanced features are handy, but I mostly like the more basic features such as the timer that helps me take the time to brush thoroughly.</li>
            <li>but I am sticking with my sonicare as I see it as the more precision, high quality cleaning tool.  </li>
            <li>The device is of high quality while the brush (Oral-B) is the top recommended tooth brush among the dental care professionals.</li>
            <li>Individual receiving the gift is very pleased with the gift</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and to clean the brush itself, the battery is big for many times of use without charging.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;electronic timer\\&quot; is nice but not always necessary since the brush stops every 30 seconds--however unlike the Sonicare--the unit continues even after the 2 minutes are up--I use this continuation to clean the brushhead under the faucet.  </li>
            <li>B003UKM9CO Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Precision 1000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush 1 Count]] at about 1/3 the cost.</li>
            <li>For the price of this toothbrush($133.32), you could have bought [[ASIN:B008PEMOV6 Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean +</li>
            <li>The Oral-B Professional Triaction 5000 does a very fine job of cleaning my teeth using side to side rather than rotary motion.</li>
            <li>I had an older model Oral-B which was still going strong though the battery life seemed a bit shorter and not quite as powerful as when I originally purchased it.</li>
            <li>I am really glad we purchased this new one.</li>
            <li>Love this new electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I actually had a pretty good system for brushing my teeth with a manual brush where in</li>
            <li>Love it; far more than the high end</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Sonicare feels more like a professional clean, this feels more like a soft scrub.  </li>
            <li>As a toothbrush it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to - my visits to the dentist became significantly shorter/happier experiences since I started using the Oral-B brushes (compared to manual brushes and a Sonicare brush I once had).</li>
            <li>It gives star rating at the end and stays on there until the next time you brush, so it&#x27;s nice to be ably to quickly see whenever I use his bathroom to see how he&#x27;s been brushing.</li>
            <li>The smart guide is a fantastic wireless feature.</li>
            <li>On the front of the handle are the power button, the mode button, the smart guide indicator light, and the battery level lights.  </li>
            <li>Liked it better than sonicare, but was missing an auto shutoff after 2 mins of brushing.  </li>
            <li>It is so powerful it makes her teeth tingle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really the type of monitoring and reinforcement that I personally prefer, but it can be helpful for some, and probably is especially handy for children.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just as good as expected.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find the coaching beeps particularly useful because left to my own devices without rushing to keep up with the coaching peeps</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t find the pressure sensor particularly useful.</li>
            <li>and I feel the time spent with this brush is well worth the fact of my good dental results.</li>
            <li>This is far better than that</li>
            <li>This toothbrush has more power than my old battery operated one.</li>
            <li>Just had a couple of K ($$) worth of dental work done.  </li>
            <li>I guess the sensor could be useful for some people.&lt;br</li>
            <li>He believes it cleans better than his old one as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>This might be a useful feature for those who need to pay more attention to their teeth, are young or are motivated by seeing icons, stars and smiley faces of encouragement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But then the light came on and sure enough, when I read through the instruction booklet it tells you this could happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I already own several Sonicare toothbrushes, I didn&#x27;t bother reading the instructions for the Oral B, thinking,</li>
            <li>It was definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is worth paying the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s dramatically better in every conceivable way.</li>
            <li>If the monetary difference isn&#x27;t that important to you, then the 5000 Deep Sweep would be a worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li>Taken together, this is one powerful combination.</li>
            <li>This was very much worth</li>
            <li>What really makes this product unique in my experience, however, is the fact that it moves in all three dimensions, which makes a noticable difference in cleaning spots that a normal brush might easily miss.  </li>
            <li>My mouth really feels clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I personally prefer the circular motion as that gives you a more focused clean.</li>
            <li>I can say that my teeth are exceptionally clean and this toothbrush makes sure that I brush properly for 2 or 2.5 minutes at a time.</li>
            <li>Works very well and leaves my mouth and teeth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, if I did not know how good the other was, then I would buy this brush again but now that I know - no way</li>
            <li>right, moving through about 1/4 inch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Oral-B  Professional Deep Sweep is amazing!</li>
            <li>At first I thought its brush head was kind of small, having gone for full size brush heads in the past, but it is actually a perfect size.  </li>
            <li>We got this to replace a major competetor brand that died in under a year and cost a TON more.  </li>
            <li>Very good except the 110 volts adapter not good</li>
            <li>The new \\&quot;deep sweep\\&quot; does a good job but the Oral B unit is a bit louder than the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>like the extra module that shows how much more time left to brush and also displays a handy clock when not in use.</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of being able to use different style brush heads with this model, as well as having five different cleaning modes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a good toothbrush, but it&#x27;s not worth</li>
            <li>The large, glaring, red strip is unmistakeable and handily prevents the user from damaging his/her gums.</li>
            <li>but geez, for 10 cents more, they could make it a little better.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While I am not a convert (mostly as a result of the noise but a little because my dentist solely endorses Sonicare), I plan to keep it as a back-up (I plan on taking it on vacations since it has a better travel case).</li>
            <li>I also thought the smart guide was probably something I wouldn&#x27;t use!  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;- strong vibrating action</li>
            <li>The sensitive and deep clean options are especially useful.  </li>
            <li>Or get the [[ASIN:B008PEMNJY Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Sensitive Gum Care Precision 3000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush And Refill Brush Head 1 Count]] and oral irrigator but forget the dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s an important feature for me but as far as the cleaning itself, I think the Oral-B wins</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s an important feature for me but as far as the cleaning itself, I think the Oral-B wins out.</li>
            <li>overall effect was entirely comparable to what I have experienced with Sonicare ...</li>
            <li>This brush does the exact same task, and has the same options as the Diamond Series from Sonicare, but it&#x27;s even better since this product is very well made and the electric mechanism inside the brush is manufactured by Braun which is a very reputable manufacturer of shavers, trimmers and etc.</li>
            <li>The main difference between most Oral-B&#x27;s is that they have a circular motion mainly concentrating on each individual tooth, while most Sonicare&#x27;s use longer brush heads that sweep back and forth to cover more area.</li>
            <li>the unit is pretty loud and not as easy to manipulate around the hard-to-reach spots</li>
            <li>If you have kids, the Smart Guide might be fun to have; it flashes, gives stars for every part of the brushing routine, and displays a smiley face at the end of the cycle.  </li>
            <li>for some, and the Smart Guide could be useful if people have</li>
            <li>The new brush is also significantly lighter.  </li>
            <li>how smooth and clean my teeth feel verse a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Imagine my shock when it was fully charged and remained SUPER, SUPER loud.</li>
            <li>The smart guide has four 1/4 circles on it, each representing a section or &amp;#34;quadrant&amp;#34; of your mouth: Top right, bottom right, bottom left, top left, in that order.</li>
            <li>I just relaxed and stopped pressing so hard , and got a great cleaning!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was going to purchase the new Sonicare Diamond Clean</li>
            <li>Choosing the right electric toothbrush is of great importance to me because I have serious gum recession - one dentist recommended gum surgery</li>
            <li>biggest difference between the Pro 4000 and the Deep Sweep 5000 is the new brush head, which I do think is slightly superior to older brush heads.  </li>
            <li>every 30 seconds is an idiot-proof nudge to move onto the next quadrant even to the most distracted of brushers.  </li>
            <li>It monitors your cleaning and lets you know if you&#x27;re exerting too much pressure on your teeth by warning you with a red light and sound.</li>
            <li>I owned the other top brand and this one beats it two to one!</li>
            <li>Seems more cheaply made, or something of a beta model when comparing to the earlier Oral-B Sonic Complete</li>
            <li>I love the digital reminder to brush for 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li>, I actually take the time to do a better job.  </li>
            <li>I tested by pushing on it with my thumb to make sure it worked, but I have never seen it actually work while brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Gave the first to my child.  </li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush!  </li>
            <li>It works exactly as advertized, a rarity in todays world.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Works very well!</li>
            <li>This really cleans your teeth and in between your teeth too!  </li>
            <li>For a \\&quot;Smart\\&quot; brush, that&#x27;s pretty...</li>
            <li>This was my first  time using electric  toothbrush  </li>
            <li>This is targeted for those who are really devoted to a brighter smile and cleaner feeling, and are willing to work for it.  </li>
            <li>Our rushed lifestyles harm our health in many ways, but they especially prevent us from caring for our mouths.  </li>
            <li>I can feel the difference after the first brushing.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>This is the first electric toothbrush I ever owned in my life.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure why the plastic part was so essential.</li>
            <li>her first kit.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>her first kit.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the way it works and it appears to do a better job than my Sonic brush but only time will tell.  </li>
            <li>It cleans better than my low end Oral B, and probably equal to or better than the Sonicaire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>of the first things I realized after turning it on the first time was that it wasn&#x27;t a sonic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It went off about 5 times per brushing the first couple of times I used it, but that was just the way I was used to brushing with the Triumph model.  </li>
            <li>once I&#x27;m sure my theeth are properly cleaned</li>
            <li>The 5000 also beeps once after the first quadrant,&lt;br /&gt;twice</li>
            <li>/&gt;In terms of the extra features, I think the travel case and the extra&lt;br /&gt;brush head add the most value.</li>
            <li>She likes the brushing action and hand fit of this model.</li>
            <li>It is very well made and powerful.</li>
            <li>After I discarded several of the space-consuming things such as the large retainer stand that holds multiple brush-heads, it fit nicely on the counter top taking up almost no space.  </li>
            <li>Overall i do enjoy the sheer novelty that this dashboard provides and would hope that future versions punch up the functionality to include more robust features such as reminders/alerts if your brush hasn&#x27;t been used (a great feature for parents),</li>
            <li>For me, the most useful feature is probably the pressure sensor that lights bright red if I&#x27;m pushing too hard on my teeth with the brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very easy to see that different things are important to different people when buying anything and that includes the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>And the 30 second cues help keep you on track to brushing long enough to do the best job.</li>
            <li>when you first place the toothbrush on the charger it doesn&#x27;t immediately light up, it takes more than a few seconds.</li>
            <li>I find it works well for me, but the nice thing about Oral-B is that they have a number of other heads to choose from based on your needs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find it works well for me, but the nice thing about Oral-B is that they have a number of other heads to choose from based on your needs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the timer it helps me make sure I brush long enough.  </li>
            <li>Even brand new, my teeth never felt this clean - this is very close to that \\&quot;just from the dentist\\&quot; feeling of clean.rushing time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even brand new, my teeth never felt this clean - this is very close to that \\&quot;just from the dentist\\</li>
            <li>Mechanical and sonic action gets your teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>You can also purchase the Floss Action brush heads which contains rubber &amp;#34;flossers&amp;#34; to clean up gunk between</li>
            <li>so you know how much more time you have left to get ready.</li>
            <li>Each is one more green light on the front.</li>
            <li>This is my second Oral-B, which the first one is still going strong for 16 months now.  </li>
            <li>My teeth felt much cleaner and my mouth stayed fresher longer after my first use.  </li>
            <li>I was on my fifth Sonicare toothbrush and like a long love affair, wanted to check out something</li>
            <li>I expected a pack of three, which would be more appropriate for multiple users.&lt;br</li>
            <li>than that, they&#x27;re pretty much identical:</li>
            <li>and I have to set them manually each time which takes  some time, if  I were able to make these setting permanent it would save a lot of time and hassle in the long run.</li>
            <li>/&gt;FINALLY there is a well made electric toothbrush that cleans your teeth and mouth with the good old traditional brushing action.  </li>
            <li>The 5000 has so far proved more useful because it takes this two steps further by doing things the others haven&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Given that the Pro 1000 costs much less than this model and does an extremely good job, I&#x27;d be tempted to just buy it if I were new to Oral B.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try this new one because it doesn&#x27;t have a round brush head (even though I could put the round brush heads on this one also; they&#x27;re perfectly compatible).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used Oral-B for quite a few years and this is probably the best toothbrush of the bunch, if only for the reason that you can use pretty much any of the Braun Oral-B heads with this unit.&lt;br /&gt;The battery (so far) is working fine and seems to last quite a while between charges.  </li>
            <li>Going through a proper 2 minute session (or 3 minutes with the &#x27;Deep Clean&#x27; mode) will leave your mouth refreshed and satisfied and the pulse pause and audible beep</li>
            <li>This has several settings &amp; it easily syncs with the clock.  </li>
            <li>The Deep Clean has 5 modes and can take up to 6 different tooth brush heads that help you on your way to healthy gums.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy enough to time your brushing without using the SmartGuide at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We had a previous model and liked it.  </li>
            <li>The timer/ clock is nice to see things the duration and mode, but I wished it didn&#x27;t use battery and was part of the charger.&lt;br /&gt;+ less stain and residue on the brush.  </li>
            <li>It is portable with long lasting battery and feels good after brushing.</li>
            <li>I own an older Oral B Professional 1000, so I can compare this newer Oral-B Deep Sweep + Smart Guide</li>
            <li>Also, the controls aren&#x27;t 100% intuitive for we of the iPhone generation, though they can certainly be mastered with 5 minutes of work.  </li>
            <li>Also, the controls aren&#x27;t 100% intuitive for we of the iPhone generation, though they can certainly be mastered with 5 minutes of work.  </li>
            <li>toothbrush also comes with a large and clunky \\&quot;SmartGuide.\\</li>
            <li>got people who don&#x27;t have large mouths.</li>
            <li>I saw it came with a \\&quot;Smart Guide\\&quot; timer</li>
            <li>let&#x27;s talk about the Smart Guide.  </li>
            <li>You can mount the Smart Guide on the wall with an included bracket, but I like to place mine on the countertop.  </li>
            <li>The Smart Guide keeps me on track.  </li>
            <li>The Smart Guide runs off of 2 AA batteries (they are included).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>The Smart Guide runs off of 2 AA batteries (they are included).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not so large that it gets in the way, but it does take a bit of getting used to.</li>
            <li>setup the time on the smart guide</li>
            <li>I wanted it because of the certain types of brush</li>
            <li>a travel case, the wireless \\&quot;Smart</li>
            <li>When not in&lt;br /&gt;use, the Smart Guide doubles as a clock.</li>
            <li>the Smart Guide if you don&#x27;t want to.</li>
            <li>The Smart Guide slides into a holder than you can mount on your&lt;br /&gt;bathroom mirror or wall with an included adhesive strip.</li>
            <li>In 12h mode, the Smart Guide clock has no way to indicate am/</li>
            <li>Although the travel case can hold the toothbrush and two brushheads,&lt;br /&gt;there is no case for the charger or the Smart Guide.</li>
            <li>Both of the electric toothbrushes I&#x27;ve tried have had some sort of timer in them, but it&#x27;s been some form of pausing or pulsing to indicate that you&#x27;re done with a certain section of teeth.</li>
            <li>However, the many features that make it so are also largely unchanged from the previous top-of-the-line [[ASIN:B008PEMOV6 Oral-B Professional Precision 5000]], save for a $20 price increase and a fancy new brush that many people won&#x27;t use.  </li>
            <li>The different modes are also nice (and differ from each other significantly).</li>
            <li>The new \\&quot;deep sweep\\&quot; head is supposed to be better than the Sonicare--</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the Smart Guide, as I am quite used to what I am doing, but it&#x27;s a nice touch to those that are new to the Oral-B Professional Deep Sweep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>..I was surprised and delighted at how easy it is to use, especially with that smart little guide to time me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably not advisable to do so, though, as most dentists recommend gentle bristles for electric toothbrushes and the new brush head definitely doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>The smart guide makes a nice little clock for the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In use I&#x27;ve gotta say this thing is noisy.  </li>
            <li>The time for each mouth quadrant (or section) varies from 30 seconds for standard clean mode, to 45 seconds for professional or intensive clean mode.&lt;br</li>
            <li>She loves this and it has some really nice features but you will have to read the manual a little to understand them and the display.......</li>
            <li>A nice little travel case comes with the brush as well.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, Oral-B has a large variety of different brush heads that you can purchase separately.</li>
            <li>... a great brush with a handy Smart Guide.also displays the current mode you are in, and if you are pushing too hard (the toothbrush itself also has a light to indicate that you are pushing too hard).  </li>
            <li>and this is probably a huge DUH for most everyone else but myself, the Smart Guide is wireless and you don&#x27;t have to do anything to get it to team up with the toothbrush -</li>
            <li>After I decided to give it one more chance (my seventh try), I was astonished to see that my gums had actually receded a little on the top.</li>
            <li>After I decided to give it one more chance (my seventh try), I was astonished to see that my gums had actually receded a little on the top.</li>
            <li>I tried them several days in a row against each other and the cleaning mode of the DiamondClean Limited is the best brush - period.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another feature of the toothbrush is a pressure sensor that will flash a red light in the handle to let you know that you are exerting too much pressure on your teeth while brushing.</li>
            <li>The timer helps so much.</li>
            <li>Smartguide which monitors the brushing cycle and gives us a warning if too much pressure is applied</li>
            <li>I also tried the Oral B \\&quot;gentle and floss\\&quot; heads--both are the circular type--</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need to brush for 2 minutes with this brush and can get the job done in 1.5 mins or even 1 minute if it&#x27;s at night.</li>
            <li>that I eve could, and MUCH faster</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li>I had the toothbrush before, so I knew it really worked.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It teaches me how much force to put against my teeth while brushing.</li>
            <li>I also enjoy how you can have two brush heads with different rings.  </li>
            <li>No joke, this product really works that well.  </li>
            <li>Also has a sensor that alerts you if you&#x27;re using too much pressure.</li>
            <li>and I  don&#x27;t say that much does  </li>
            <li>This really is the Ferrari of toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>It really does make a difference and my mouth has never felt cleaner.</li>
            <li>For those with slack tendencies (ahem...me), its timer helps improve habits by making us more mindful of the time we&#x27;ve spent brushing.  </li>
            <li>works VERY well.  </li>
            <li>I believe all you really need is a fast and a slower speed.</li>
            <li>Really like how  my teeth and mouth feel after using .</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel that it cleans any better than my old one, and I don&#x27;t personally like how it stops and beeps every time it wants you to change side.</li>
            <li>I can really feel the difference in  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really need the timer</li>
            <li>It is fast and thorough.  </li>
            <li>, I felt my whole head vibrating</li>
            <li>, I felt my whole head vibrating</li>
            <li>It syncs in with the toothbrush and shows how much time I spend brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li>Thanks to his suggestions, I&#x27;ve managed to keep the gum pockets stable and from getting deeper for about fifteen years.</li>
            <li>It makes your mouth feel much fresher and it was recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t realize how much I would like an electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>How it feels, its deep cleaning, it is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>The front and back of the brush are rubberized, while the sliver sides are done in a smooth plastic.  </li>
            <li>Sound-wise, the Oral-B is no worse than an electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is mechanical and although it is fast, it is not sonic.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning modes are fairly unnecessary even though they seem like an attractive feature on the surface.&lt;br</li>
            <li>probably paid too much since I don&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li>Bought as gift, he really likes it a lot.</li>
            <li>The Triaction is also&lt;br /&gt;chunkier than the Pulsonic, but not as much as the Philips Sonicare&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;a fast vibration than a gentle massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;around three times as much counter space as the charger alone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much like the Sonicare, it is ergonomically</li>
            <li>Really neat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is MUCH, MUCH, MUCH louder than my Sonicare.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another neat trick this brush is capable of is changing its brushing style.</li>
            <li>It also gently massages your gums.</li>
            <li>what I discovered is that if I brush standing up straight that isn&#x27;t a problem.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Deep Sweep head is so much better than the Floss Action head</li>
            <li>Especially with the sweeping motion, it reaches more tooth than we naturally cover on our own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Especially with the sweeping motion, it reaches more tooth than we naturally cover on our own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This means I&#x27;ll have to run out and pay extra for one of the many choices Oral B offers.</li>

            <li>do generally like using an electric toothbrush, not because it does a better job than a manual  brush, but because it does an equal job a little more quickly.</li>
            <li>It cleans up easier than my old one!!!</li>
            <li>It is creating a loud resonating sound of cheap plastic clanging against each other.  </li>
            <li>mean this in a good way.</li>
            <li>I had experienced some irritation around the crowns in the past--not often--but the irritation did happen every few months--even though I thought I was pretty meticulous about keeping them clean with the small periodontal brushes I used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The Oral-B is very nicely done in white, silver, and green.  </li>
            <li>It will time how long you are brushing and that is a feature that I have very quickly come to appreciate.  </li>
            <li>Often when I&#x27;m in a rush it is easy to think I&#x27;ve been brushing a long time</li>
            <li>In the box was a case, the handle, one brush head (not sure why the description states that there are multiple refill heads, mine didn&#x27;t include them), the smart guide (included Duracell batteries which I thought was great), and the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a no brainer when spending a significant amount on the actual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It looks way better than the other 2 on the counter.</li>
            <li>The manufacturer claims the sweeping&lt;br /&gt;action is even better at removing plaque than other electric&lt;br</li>
            <li>They sent mine back stating I didn&#x27;t send the original UPC from the box, when I did.</li>
            <li>My teeth are so clean and white by the time I&#x27;m done brushing</li>
            <li>(well, maybe not total delight) and your teeth, gums, tongue and mouth roof are sparkling clean.  </li>
            <li>Deep clean mode...extends time by 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li>Daily Clean mode&lt;br</li>
            <li>Deep Clean mode&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>also, it shifted automatically between brush modes while i was brushing and could not get it to brush with the 3 minute mode (deep clean) would not allow me to set it there.</li>
            <li>What is the difference between deep clean and whitening?</li>
            <li>your mouth even partially, such as to clean your gum line with the&lt;br /&gt;tip</li>
            <li>Now, since I have used these types of toothbrushes throughout the years, I began with the deep clean ...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to someone who is looking for a high tech toothbrush!</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I would give this product 5 stars for the brushing unit itself, I deducted a star because they only included on brush head and these are new types of heads for Oral-B and not yet readily available.</li>
            <li>Use paste not gel or you will find yourself less than satisfied as the paste will not spray as much.</li>
            <li>The brush beeps every 30 seconds to tell you to move to a new quadrant, this is also shown on the smart meter.  </li>
            <li>I believe that by so poorly promoting DeepSweep Procter &amp; Gamble made a huge disfavor to both themselves (as that diminishes their profits) and millions of people who are unaware of how good this product is.</li>
            <li>A full charge lasts over 7 days of brushing twice a day for 2 minutes (4 minutes daily), so I don&#x27;t have to carry the charger when I travel.</li>
            <li>I can charge it for the full charge and it last alnost 2 weeks without charging.</li>
            <li>Would not go back to regular tooth brush, my teeth feel super clean.</li>
            <li>I imagine that this may actually motivate chidren and hopefully get them to brush the full 2 minutes</li>
            <li>30 second rush jobs as you head out to work become the full 2 minutes they&#x27;re supposed to be.</li>
            <li>Years ago I had a very cheap one which I dont remember the model, but it overall was not that different.</li>
            <li>One other nice feature of the Smart Guide is when you are not brushing your teeth it displays the current time.  </li>
            <li>One other nice feature of the Smart Guide is when you are not brushing your teeth it displays the current time.  </li>
            <li>They are more prone to lemons and batteries weakening too early(as short as three months).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B also has a better method of replacing the brush heads, so it&#x27;s more future-proof: several times with Sonicare as new models come out, I found myself unable to use my current brush heads at that time and had to switch to newer heads, so with this method you can save more and not have to worry about buying new brush heads and wasting your old ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Comparing the Oral-B Professional to the past Oral-B Sonic Complete, the Oral-B Sonic (Complete) brands seems to win without competition from these newer makes and models from Oral-B!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>needed a new toothbrush and after what must have been too much research</li>
            <li>I had an older model and didn&#x27;t really need a new one, but decided to splurge.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With the charger design, you can actually scrub it clean to new looking.</li>
            <li>The reason why is clearly the internal gears are all plastic on plastic and they are not very tight fitting.  </li>
            <li>(daily clean, deep clean, sensitive, whitening, massage)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are 5 brushing modes: daily clean, deep clean, sensitive, massage, and polish.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are five modes, Daily Clean, Deep Clean, Sensitive, Whitening and Massage.</li>
            <li>Daily Clean (30 seconds per quadrant), Deep Clean (45 seconds per quadrant), Sensitive (slower speed for gentler brushing), Whitening (for a \\&quot;polishing\\&quot; experience) and Massage (for gum stimulation).  </li>
            <li>I was never been able to clean my teeth so efficiently, you will definitely feel the difference after using it a few times.</li>
            <li>We had the older model so this was an upgrade.</li>
            <li>According to independent, scientific medical study it removes 40% more plague than SoniCare (&lt;br /&gt;http://www.dentalcare.com/media/en-US/research_db/pdf/products/8week-eval-benefits-multidirectional.pdf);&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>It does not make an irritating high-pinch ultrasonic sound like SoniCare that many people don&#x27;t like;&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>but it makes a decent looking clock.</li>
            <li>PARTICULARLY LIKE 5 SPEED CONTROL</li>
            <li>Given this toothbrush costs over a hundred smackers for a brush, make it a decent case.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this to replace an older Braun Oral B electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>A few extra features that I didn&#x27;t need but still a good product.</li>
            <li>main difference between the two, however, is the price.</li>
            <li>Unlike oscillating Oral-B toothbrush that requires special technique for brushing, you can use DeepSweep in a same familiar motion as any manual toothbrush;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately Procter &amp; Gamble company that owns Oral-B did a horrible job at marketing it: there are no ads I&#x27;m aware of that promote this wonderful product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, if you had an older model, I highly recommend you try this.</li>
            <li>brush has 5 cleaning modes, which I think is a little bit of overkill for me, HOWEVER, if you have sensitive gums, this might be perfect for you as the settings are:  Whitening (a polishing mode), Daily clean, Deep clean, SENSITIVE and massage mode.&lt;br /&gt;I tend to brush too hard and the \\&quot;gum care pressure sensor\\&quot; kept me from tearing up my gums, thankfully.</li>
            <li>the Healthy White, the Oral-B has a regular setting and a setting for \\&quot;whitening.\\&quot; Additionally, it has sensitive, massage, and deep clean options.</li>
            <li>I highly highly highly recommend Oral-B rechargable electric tooth brushes.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>high quality, high -tech</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and  I highly recommend it .</li>
            <li>Highly degenerate to the companies image and reputation.  </li>
            <li>The sonicare sounds like a high end tool with its vibrating hum,</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Performance wise it would be the same, because the only difference between this and the old 5000 is deep sweep brush</li>
            <li>husband, on the other hand, likes it more than his professional care 1000.</li>
            <li>My Professional 1000 and 4000 did not come with a Smart Guide, which is a 2:00 LCD timer wirelessly linked to the brush.  </li>
            <li>(However, teeth do feel much cleaner after using the Oral-B Sonic Complete brush, completely seemingly nullifying this positive aspect!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;</li>
            <li>I think the motor could be a little more quieter.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know my old Oral-B was out of date until I tried the Deep Clean.  </li>
            <li>For those that have never used an electric toothbrush, this will likely wow you with how your teeth feel &#x27;dentist clean&#x27; every day.  </li>
            <li>There are positive and negative to both design, but with the 5000 (vibrate/ pulsating head) I think Oral-b is equal or better then sonicare brushing design.is true</li>
            <li>Additionally, it has a really amazing feature (not available on any Sonicare I&#x27;ve ever seen): the back of the handle lights-up if one applies too much pressure.</li>
            <li>It is so powerful and quiet.  </li>
            <li>Love the timer and that it stops at 30 second intervals to let you know how long you&#x27;ve been brushing.</li>
            <li>It is worth the extra money just in style.</li>
            <li>Having many family members, this is a heavily used product in our house.  </li>
            <li>at first i missed the sonic care vibrate, but this is really the same thing</li>
            <li>Most people don&#x27;t brush properly or long enough if they do.  </li>
            <li>e.g the default program is normal cleaning and</li>
            <li>With normal brushing I&#x27;d sometimes notice a film on my teeth by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>Since its a new product, I can&#x27;t speak to its durability, but it feels very solidly constructed, for what that&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>Since its a new product, I can&#x27;t speak to its durability, but it feels very solidly constructed, for what that&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>Oral-B&#x27;s &#x27;Deep Sweep Triaction 5000&#x27; Electric toothbrush is a great, premium quality product with a unique feature that distinguishes it from other similar brushes - a small wireless &#x27;Smart Guide&#x27; gadget that serves as a dashboard of sorts to monitor the progress of your toothbrushing session.  </li>
            <li>It also displays an icon indicating the&lt;br /&gt;selected brushing mode, and if you press too hard, in addition to the&lt;br /&gt;warning light on the toothbrush that the Triaction 1000 shares, a&lt;br /&gt;warning icon and red light will appear on the Smart Guide.</li>
            <li>To keep this brush in the upper mid range, Oral-B has left out some good features such as automatic santization and an improved charging station.  </li>
            <li>Pretty much the same as my other Oral B brush, but significantly noisier than a Sonicaire.  </li>
            <li>to the Smart Guide, personally, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using it much, but  for some</li>
            <li>Smart Guide is a battery powered LCD display (about the size of an&lt;br /&gt;iPhone, but more than twice as thick), that communicates wirelessly&lt;br</li>
            <li>The timer is a separate piece which is not very user friendly.</li>
            <li>I can tell the new brush will do just that.</li>
            <li>Put off buying a new electric toothbrush because Roto-router (?)</li>
            <li>Have needed a new electronic toothbrush for sometime and I like this one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is something new, and even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>new Oral-B Triaction 5000 has  5 modes of operation.</li>
            <li>they sent me a new one to exchange</li>
            <li>It took some getting use to the new design.  </li>
            <li>So I bought this, expecting just a new version of what I had before.</li>
            <li>There are some out there who have not &#x27;sunk their teeth&#x27; into the new dental technology.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one thing to hear that it&#x27;s time to move to a new section, but it&#x27;s another to know that you have been brushing that section for 20 seconds.</li>
            <li>This gadget is particularly handy when you&#x27;re toggling between the 5 different brushing modes (eg - &#x27;whitening,&#x27; &#x27;deep clean,&#x27; etc) or just to watch the seconds count down before moving onto the next quadrant.  </li>
            <li>when the brush is charging, you see one light blinking, then two, then finally three blinking lights as it completes the final 1/3 of the charge.</li>
            <li>Inthe old days, you call it brush your teeth for a few seconds more.  </li>
            <li>I had an older Oral-B electric toothbrush that was showing its age (battery was wimping out, etc.), it was probably about six years old.</li>
            <li>The company probably spent more money denying my rebate (which was only $20) than if they had honored it as advertised.</li>
            <li>I found the Braun provided a very clear improvement over the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Deep Sweep 5000 is currently more expensive than the older Professional 1000 because it is the more versatile of the two models.  </li>
            <li>Huge red lights light up on the handle if you push too hard, so what is it for?  </li>
            <li>First of all, I am a Sonicare user--I did use Oral B about 6-8 years ago and for some forgotten reason went back to a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Seems more harsh when compared to the Oral-B Sonic Complete lower brushing levels for sensitive teeth and gum areas.&lt;br /&gt;5)</li>
            <li>My only regret is spending too much to get all these extra features which I don&#x27;t find useful.</li>
            <li>literally the first time I used it I brushed for about 10 minutes</li>
            <li>I like the fact that you can use the deep sweep head as well as many of the other Oral B heads.</li>
            <li>Deep Sweep combines the familiar brushing motion of a manual toothbrush with triple-action, deep cleaning technology.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After retiring the first brush head, to investigate further my concern for it harboring moisture, I broke it apart with a hammer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not needed, you can do everything exactly the same without it.  </li>
            <li>For the first time, I can&#x27;t wait until my next dental appointment to see if they can see a difference as well.</li>
            <li>Bought for significant other.</li>
            <li>I will be interested to see if I had received a damaged product, or if another person, like me, received something different than what was in the Amazon description.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will be interested to see if I had received a damaged product, or if another person, like me, received something different than what was in the Amazon description.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Aside from the My Guide, the tooth brush is basically exactly the same as the 4000.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s nice about it, I suppose, is that the My Guide will visually let you know when you&#x27;ve brushed exactly as long as it wants you to, instead of only relying on the pulses as an indication.</li>
            <li>Real improvement seen at my latest dental appointment after using this twice daily for a few months.</li>
            <li>I alternate between the deep sweep brush head and the precision clean brush head.  </li>
            <li>I saw the Oral-B Deep Clean in a commercial and</li>
            <li>I use the basic, deep clean and</li>
            <li>but we were intrigued by the &amp;#34;Wow&amp;#34; ads so purchased this new Deep Sweep + Smart Guide 5000 toothbrush.</li>
            <li>If, however, this is your first electric tooth brush I would recommend starting in Sensitive mode so that your gums can adjust and not bleed.  </li>
            <li>If, however, this is your first electric tooth brush I would recommend starting in Sensitive mode so that your gums can adjust and not bleed.  </li>
            <li>This is the first issue the Oral-B Professional Deep Sweep solves.  </li>
            <li>The accessory that comes with it is also very useful because it tells you how long you brushed your teeth and when you aren&#x27;t, it tells you the time</li>
            <li>The new brush, being quite large, splashes the whole area with wet toothpaste when in use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That leaves the new brush head, which twists and turns as well as rotating, as the only real difference between the two.  </li>
            <li>(The earlier Sonic Complete would subtly flash every second or more while charging, and then stay lit as a night light.  </li>
            <li>My last checkup was better, much less plaque than before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update this if I get another failure or the brush continues to operate normally for a year or more.</li>
            <li>Of course, you can simply go out and buy a pack of the new brush heads and put them on the older model if you&#x27;d like; both use the exact same stem.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard for me to get over that sound of loose, cheap grinding plastic.  </li>
            <li>There are positive and negative to both design, but with the 5000 (vibrate/ pulsating head) I think Oral-b is equal or better then sonicare brushing design.</li>
            <li>five cleaning modes leave me a little perplexed.  </li>
            <li>, the battery is EXTREMELY GOOD (I&#x27;m getting more than a week out of a single charge and have not let it run out all the way yet), and the crazy wireless sensor thing actually helps me get my brushing done.</li>
            <li>The sonicare Diamond Clean I just bought a week ago and it destroys the competition in my view and I will break down how.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re an adult, though, the Smart Guide likely will just take up wall or counter space.  </li>
            <li>a month into using it twice a day for 3 minutes each brush cycle it started to indicate that i was brushing to hard even when it was touching nothing.</li>
            <li>As I mentioned above, the Smart Guide is more than twice as thick as&lt;br /&gt;an iPhone.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive gum, this product will not damage your gum more: there is sensor preventing you from being too hard when you brush your teeth.</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t like the new bigger one that comes packaged with it, you have other choices that could potentially fill your needs better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s huge and it&#x27;s heavy like a hockey puck.  </li>
            <li>note - where the Sonicare clearly beats this is in having the UV brush head sanitizer.</li>
            <li>note - where the Sonicare clearly beats this is in having the UV brush head sanitizer.</li>
            <li>The brushing action is much stronger (so the &amp;#34;you&#x27;re brushing too hard&amp;#34; indicator is necessary!)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear that Oral-B are marketing the 5000 as their&lt;br /&gt;premium product.</li>
            <li>You can read it quite clearly in this&lt;</li>
            <li>It is a big help to time how much time I&#x27;m brushing within each quadrant.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel like I had a professional cleaning every day.</li>
            <li>then the Sonic Complete.  </li>
            <li>The result: there are by far fewer retailers that carry this toothbrush than SoniCare.</li>
            <li>Before this one, i used 3000 series professional one.</li>
            <li>this thing is loud on the lowest setting</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s helped us do the complete time.</li>
            <li>You can really use the brush to massage your gums where the sonicare brushes simply do it for you and that is that.</li>
            <li>So my teeth always look like they had a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li>Loud though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for nearly 3.5 years.  </li>
            <li>We also find ourselves seeing who brushes more frequently, or at least who wears out the brush head faster.  </li>
            <li>The difficulty is the same with a sonicare brush, so this really isn&#x27;t a can that gives the competition and edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m in the bathroom at 5am while everyone else is still in bed, the last thing the rest of the household wants to hear is me brushing.  </li>
            <li>the timer is like a coach encouraging systematic and complete coverage of &amp;#60;all&amp;#62; of your gums and teeth.&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li>I had to replace my Oral-B Sonic Complete electric toothbrush this week after 5 years.  </li>
            <li>Sensitive mode (runs at a slower speed)&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>B008I2IKM2 Oral-B Professional Ortho Brush Kit?</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve gone as far away as 50 feet</li>
            <li>I use an Oral-B professional care 7500 - have been using it for about 5 years and it has worked well.</li>
            <li>Needed a replacement for my old oralB that was lost in action on a buenos aires trip.</li>
            <li>This is my second Oral B electric toothbrush, and I am very pleaased with the results.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why they didn&#x27;t include at least one more brush instead of the travel case.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s all that helpful to have it show you how far you&#x27;ve progressed in quarter increments</li>
            <li>but thought it was some extra bath accessory, thinking I didn&#x27;t really need it.</li>
            <li>Too loud.</li>
            <li>Too loud.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 9yr old so he could keep track of how well he&#x27;s brushing his teeth.</li>
            <li>It tells you if you&#x27;re using too much pressure and there&#x27;s a monitor to tell you when to move from one side to the next.</li>
            <li>Really, it leaves my mouth feeling like I just got back from the dentist.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for the last couple of days, and it really is a gadget lovers dream.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised that the screen doesn&#x27;t come with a stand.  </li>
            <li>It was easier to stop early without a thing to look at, basically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It offers five brushing modes instead of one:  </li>
            <li>I thought it was simply because it wasn&#x27;t completely ready for use.</li>
            <li>Floss Action Precision 5000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush And Refill Brush Head 1 Count]]($109.99)and</li>
            <li>And, if you use the same brushing style every day, like the standard one that I currently use, you&#x27;ll know that at 30 seconds you&#x27;ll be prompted to move on, so you can keep your brushing on track and make sure all your teeth are properly attended</li>
            <li>It feels like a pretty long time.</li>
            <li>bother with the gray fancier version of this - you&#x27;re not missing</li>
            <li>This is as useless as the Kardashians at a physics fair.  </li>
            <li>* if the screen was on the brush we wouldn&#x27;t need the the clock, kind of unnecessary, but I do like looking at it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>* if the screen was on the brush we wouldn&#x27;t need the the clock, kind of unnecessary, but I do like looking at it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been pretty loyal to Oral-B for both electric and conventional toothbrushes for quite a long time.</li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush, it feels pretty similar (although less intense) to the polishing brush they use at the dentist.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Deep Clean\\&quot; mode only differes from the Daily Clean mode by requiring you to brush for 3 minutes rather than 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Last a good long time even with hard</li>
            <li>The first charge takes about a day for me, and it takes hours and hours for the battery indicator to increase a single bar.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years when I needed to replace a too tired, old one with a new model.  </li>
            <li>cleaning (pulsates and sweeps back and forth) to remove up to 100% more plaque than an ordinary manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, this is not a toothbrush for those who, left to themselves, brush once a day for a minute or so (yes, like I tend to do) out of a sense of obligation and general hygiene, and who don&#x27;t really intend to change.  </li>
            <li>so no black stain yet after 1-2 months of use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The replacement packages for the new-style brush heads say they are only compatible with this particular model, but I put the new-style brush head on my 1000 and 4000 and couldn&#x27;t tell the difference in brushing quality.  </li>
            <li>While the Smart Guide might seem like a gimmick, I find it quite helpful as I tend let my mind drift while I brush my teeth and always forget how long I&#x27;ve been brushing, or what quadrant I&#x27;m supposed to be brushing.  </li>

            <li>Except for the massage mode, it seems like all of the other modes would clean in the same way</li>
            <li>The standard \\&quot;deep sweep\\&quot; heads are ingenious in that they have they tiny little gears which actually BRUSH your teeth (back and forth action, only FAST!!!)</li>
            <li>While I stick to the standard cleaning mode, which is two minutes long, there&#x27;s also a variation of this called \\&quot;deep clean mode.\\</li>
            <li>There is Deep Clean (3 minutes of brushing), Sensitive (slows the brush head down), Whitening</li>
            <li>$20 more than the previous year&#x27;s version unless for some reason you either really like the older base stand or have fallen in love with the new brush head.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush has the features I really wish my old Oral B had - timer I can actually see and notification when the battery is getting low and needs to be re-charged.</li>
            <li>Flexcare Plus Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]&lt;br /&gt;However, even without looking at the panel, I could usually guess which mode it was by the motion and the sound alone.</li>
            <li>Flexcare Plus Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]&lt;br /&gt;However, even without looking at the panel, I could usually guess which mode it was by the motion and the sound alone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sorry Oral B, but for me, Sonicare wins hands down over this one.</li>
            <li>From the cleaning to the look to the Smart Sensor that has removed my need to constantly ask, &#x27;Have you brushed for two minutes?&#x27;</li>
            <li>Therefore, when I was afforded the opportunity to review this Oral-B Deep Sweep, I was fairly certain that nothing could possible match the quality of Sonicare.</li>
            <li>The pressure sensor is useful, but I don&#x27;t always care about the pressure I put on my teeth anyway, since I don&#x27;t think I am too hard on them, but supposedly too much pressure will eat away your enamel eventually, so</li>
            <li>also like the round heads more personally, since I don&#x27;t have a large mouth and the larger head makes it harder to get around</li>
            <li>To sum up, the new Oral B \\&quot;deep sweep\\</li>
            <li>Thought I&#x27;d reward my teen by getting a new electric toothbrush for them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m scaling back my dental hygiene visits from 4 to 2 times per year, thanks to the Deep Sweep.  </li>
            <li>in all, however, neither of us think it&#x27;s worth the extra money spent on it.</li>
            <li>First, the timer lets you know how long to brush and the toothbrush takes care of the proper brushing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Oral B Professional 1000, Professional 4000, and now this, the 5000 Deep Sweep.  </li>
            <li>Instead of intense vibration of the Sonicare, the Oral-B has stationary blue bristles with white bristles that move rapidly oscillate from side to side.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another plus that I can only attribute to this brush and the particular \\&quot;sweep-style\\&quot; brush head that comes with this brush is that my teeth actually feel cleaner than my old Oral B ever did with the twist-style head that it has.</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s for my friend&#x27;s gift,and i have not seen it,he don&#x27;t say anything wrong about it,so i think it is good enough</li>
            <li>If you press too hard the brush flashes red, and a red light flashes on the smart meter.  </li>
            <li>so I know it will last just as long as my previous Triumph toothbrush which is over 3 years old but still going strong.</li>
            <li>The flashing LED light of this newer model is more quickly repetitive and irritating</li>
            <li>My teeth feel like I&#x27;ve left the dentist with a professional cleaning!</li>
            <li>In other words, it takes a little more time and effort to use this brush at</li>
            <li>No other way to mount it</li>
            <li>Looks exactly the same, has the same modes, uses the same toothbrush heads, etc.</li>
            <li>very careful not to take out the brush from your mouth when using it, because unlike more basic electric toothbrushes, this has side-to-side movement and you will get wet toothpaste all over you!</li>
            <li>very careful not to take out the brush from your mouth when using it, because unlike more basic electric toothbrushes, this has side-to-side movement and you will get wet toothpaste all over you!</li>
            <li>the smart guide&#x27;s view angle is a bit limited and require proper positioning to view it clearly</li>
            <li>The main differences between the two are that the newer model has a more clearly marked button to switch between the 5 cleaning modes, stops and chimes every thirty seconds instead of simply vibrating, has a green plastic backing instead of a blue one, has a green LED instead of an LCD to show battery charge, and uses the older version of the charging stand with a dimple in the middle instead of the newer ring one.  </li>
            <li>It would have been nice for it to at least come with a stand or with some other non-permanent mounting method like Command Removable Adhesive</li>
            <li>By segmenting your mouth into 4 sections (e.g. outside left, outside right, lower inside and upper inside)</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It feels cheaper, like large hollow plastic.  </li>
            <li>I had to push so hard for that light to go on, I question its usefullness.</li>
            <li>This also has a light that flickers when you are using it too hard.  </li>
            <li>My advice:  go with the whitening or daily clean for regular use, and use the \\&quot;deep clean\\&quot; once every two or three days, or after a long meal or when you feel a bit gross.  </li>

            <li>I mean, it felt like every cell in my head was being agitated with this fine vibration to the point of distraction.  </li>
            <li>The different modes were clearly listed on the handle of the Sonicare - for reference,</li>
            <li>also like that the Braun offers different brush shapes that produce an improved result.  </li>
            <li>Oral-B Professional Deep Sweep +</li>
            <li>The timer is a big help because I found I was no where near the 2 minute brush time.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Oral-B Professional Deep Sweep for 3 weeks now and it helps keep my teeth from being stained.</li>
            <li>accustomed to early on and look forward to the next time.  </li>
            <li>No worries  no regrets.</li>
            <li>It has improved my habits by providing a timer and pressure sensor, and offers 5 different modes, allowing your brushing to be personalized for your needs while still improving your brushing.  </li>
            <li>and the bristles barely move.  </li>
            <li>It is aggressively complete in deep cleaning the mouth.  </li>
            <li>Bought as a replacement for an old Oral-B brush which had finally given up the ghost after ~10 years of use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It only came with one brush, which surprised me at this price-point.</li>
            <li>following the pauses in the brushing action that convey the&lt;br /&gt;same information.</li>
            <li>However, I would caution those who have strictly used manual brushes to begin on sensitive and work your way up to \\&quot;deep clean.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>B00ARTKAPE Oral-B Professional Deep Sweep Replacement Brush Head 4 Count]]$30.21).</li>
            <li>It comes with: Rechargeable toothbrush handle, charging Station with Brush Head Storage, SmartGuide timer, travel Case and 2 refill Heads, a deep sweep and a sensitive.</li>
            <li>I was a tried and true Sonicare user but the heads seemed way too small.  </li>
            <li>Though it is a little louder than other electric toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used, it is much more solid and feels like it cleans</li>
            <li>This new style won&#x27;t suffer that same fate since it can be simply wiped out.</li>
            <li>This new style won&#x27;t suffer that same fate since it can be simply wiped out.</li>
            <li>I like both the indicator that warns of excessive pressure and the Smart Guide countdown, as making certain of proper brushing (time and amount of pressure</li>
            <li>It provides a small, but significant, improvement over the standard brush.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is, all my sonicare brushes have gone easily over 4 years each since it&#x27;s used only a few mins daily and charged daily (keeps the life of the battery</li>
            <li>If you are prone to brushing too hard, this also could be good for you since the LCD screen shows you when you are brushing too hard.  </li>
            <li>If you are prone to brushing too hard, this also could be good for you since the LCD screen shows you when you are brushing too hard.  </li>
            <li>nominal 10 day battery life (which is a little bit lower under field conditions, and there&#x27;s a noticeable difference between a new battery and an older one for both life and strength of brushing) , and a wireless SmartGuide that you&#x27;ll probably throw in a drawer and ignore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also lets you know if you&#x27;re brushing too hard by stopping and having its light turn red.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s powerful but it&#x27;s loud and at least with this brush head</li>
            <li>my opinion the different modes are for the most part unnecessary.</li>
            <li>I pretty much always just use the daily or deep cleaning modes because by the time you toggle the button to all the other modes, you&#x27;ve already wasted half the time for your first quadrant.  </li>
            <li>Unlike brush modes which do absolutely positively nothing different other than change the length of time or the speed, they have different cleaning patterns&lt;br /&gt;-Way</li>
            <li>Also included is the Oral-B Wireless SmartGuide, which provides real-time guidance - its quadrant guides help you brush for the recommended 2 minutes (3 minutes with Deep Clean Mode) and it lights up to tell you when you are brushing too hard.</li>
            <li>The actual toothbrush is a terrific product - it has multiple cleaning \\&quot;modes\\&quot; which include settings for sensitive teeth and even for a gum massage.</li>
            <li>They barely have to scrap any tartar off my teeth since starting to use Oral-B brushes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brush body is sturdy and water-proof and seems to be made of the same or similar material as was my old electric brush above.</li>
            <li>Or with my 3 year old sonicare, push the button again and brush how long you like.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not sure it is worth the additional money.</li>
            <li>My gums bled the first few times I used it though they don&#x27;t anymore.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Essentially the SmartGuide cues you when to move from quadrant to quadrant while brushing, After 30 seconds, a black bar appears and a star becomes filled in with black to indicate your brushing progress.</li>
            <li>I prefer the smaller Floss Action brushes due to me sensitive teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>, so far I am on the orginal battery, so I don&#x27;t know how long that will last before replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband bought the exact same toothbrush a little cheaper and with four extra brush heads!</li>
            <li>brush is generations ahead of others on the market, and is mid-range priced, though it certainly is an investment if you&#x27;re used to getting the job done with a $3 brush and a little mindfulness and fortitude.  </li>

            <li>It is so loud that it adds to my general impression that Oral B is simply too rough for my tender gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is so loud that it adds to my general impression that Oral B is simply too rough for my tender gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>From there it will enter normal cleaning mode (2-minutes of brushing), but by pressing the mode button you can cycle through the other modes.  </li>
            <li>Instead of the usual small and round brush head, the new product comes packaged with a new bigger brush head that gives it more of a manual toothbrush</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the way they provide feedback on charging because the charge state is far less obvious than on the old brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This item is useful for individuals with gum issues who brush to hard.</li>
            <li>One thing that really made the difference for me is the fact that there is significantly less vibration that other products I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>Now that&#x27;s good news and bad -</li>

            <li> but this product does a great job.</li>
            <li> Read great reviews on Deadspin Deals and decided to go with this Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> LOL</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Would prefer automatic santization and an improved charging station, but it&#x27;s still great.</li>
            <li> battery lasts for around 4 days (2 brushes per day) and the built in timer (and separate clock) are great accessories.  </li>
            <li> The brush head storage, clock time and pressure sensor all work great.</li>
            <li> The brush works great...  </li>
            <li> Great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> , the performance style varies greatly from the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> works great</li>
            <li> A really great buy.</li>
            <li> LOVE the automatic sensor!!</li>
            <li> I love the time it comes with!!</li>
            <li> Very nice toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> This is a very nice toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> However, it is so very nice.  </li>
            <li> Very nice product</li>
            <li> I find very effective.</li>
            <li> The motions feel very effective.</li>
            <li> Two amazing purchases!</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush, love everything about it.</li>
            <li> It makes more noise, but I am very happy with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> LOOKS GOOD, WORKS GREAT.  </li>
            <li> I have been happy with it but was eager to give this Oral-B electric toothbrush a try since I&#x27;ve heard good things about</li>
            <li> I told her I hadn&#x27;t noticed because her teeth were beautiful and perfect before, which earned me a smooch, but the point is that it will improve your smile no matter the setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> but I hope it lets me get good reviews at the dentist...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost moved to purchase one, but then again, my $7.99 Oral-B does a good job too-giggles...</li>
            <li> Superior product.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s a good chance that you can break the device.  </li>
            <li> My dental hygienist gave me a good report.  </li>
            <li> I loved this one from the start.</li>
            <li> Buy the product, you&#x27;ll be glad you did and show it with shiny brilliant teeth.</li>
            <li> it  does  a  superior job at cleaning  </li>
            <li> However, I decided to take the plunge when I read the fair return</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning performance of the Oral-B is every bit as good as my Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning performance of the Oral-B is every bit as good as my Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> The Oral-B Triaction 5000 is a good, top-of-the-line toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> 3 stars; it&#x27;s a good brush</li>
            <li> It is a good and durable product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;to imagine how it could be good for your gums.</li>
            <li> To me this suggests that the brush must be doing a really good job removing all the bacteria from the surfaces of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is an excellent electric toothbrush with unique features.  </li>
            <li> This Oral-B product has been an exceptional performer.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly &amp; keeps my teeth, gums, &amp; braces very clean &amp; healthy.</li>
            <li> Powerful, teeth look great!</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very pleased.  </li>
            <li> electric toothbrush is as &#x27;intelligent&#x27; as you get and it&#x27;s many features</li>
            <li> my first was another brand that was good, this one is just excellent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this one.</li>
            <li> Very interesting.  </li>
            <li> The brush that comes with this ergonomically designed handle is unique because it swivels from side to side, thus enabling the user to use easily ideal brushing techniques.</li>
            <li> Another nice touch is that when the brush is done charging, the very bright power light goes out instead of staying on all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> But it is the brush head and the wonderful Smart Guide that made this brush a cleaning guru for me!</li>
            <li> Love the power!  </li>
            <li> Love the timer setting!</li>
            <li> We love it!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I was pretty impressed!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li> There is a coupon in the box for refill heads, and if you register you will get in even better coupon, so don&#x27;t throw that paper out!</li>
            <li> Love my Oral B Tooth Brush !</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is really great, it has prompts to fine tune your brushing</li>
            <li> This is really nice toothbrush.</li>
            <li> That would be a nice item to buy separately if you have children.</li>
            <li> I am comparing this toothbrush to Sonicare brushes I have owned and do own .&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brush is good but the Sonicare are better than they used to be</li>
            <li> TIMED BRUSHING WITH QUADRANT CONTROL AND SMILEY FACE ADD NICE TOUCH.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for a week now and am loving it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice to have</li>
            <li> Thanks to Braun and the excellent product.  </li>
            <li> Oral-B fits nicely in one&#x27;s hand.</li>
            <li> s clean has greatly improved my teeth and gums...</li>
            <li> Also i suffer a bit from OCD - this brush is great and now I&#x27;ve got a clean mouth in about 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> A great sensation of really clean teeth.  </li>
            <li> But within its market, this brush is an excellent product that I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this new toothbrush about 2 months ago and am so impressed with it.</li>
            <li> great price, quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Well, I am pleased to report that the results Oral-B are fairly comparable in many aspects.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is by far the best part of the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t say that my teeth are whiter yet, but give it some more time</li>
            <li> This is by far the best electronic toothbrush!!!  </li>
            <li> Strongly recommended!</li>
            <li> in all... a great brush with a handy Smart Guide.</li>
            <li> I think it clean just as good</li>
            <li> Happily the replacement heads look and perform exactly like the included brush head.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great electric toothbrush but you may be equally as happy with a more basic version that doesn&#x27;t include the SmartGuide and the superfluous modes.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, was exactly as described</li>
            <li> it worked really great when i first got it.</li>
            <li> nice plus, the brush runs for quite some time on one charge, and an overnight charge now and then will keep you going strong.</li>
            <li> -B makes very good toothbrushes, but their marketing leaves a bit to be desired; this is far from a breakthrough.  </li>
            <li> LOVE THAT.CLEAN TEEETH AND BRIGHT SMILE</li>
            <li> Really love this ...</li>
            <li> /&gt;What could be better with this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS TOOTHBRUSH, IT MAKES</li>
            <li> SURE</li>
            <li> SmartGuide 5000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush is an interesting product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell--both units do a great job--the Oral B unit also \\&quot;vibrates\\&quot;</li>
            <li> more w/in the mouth--not a problem for me.  </li>
            <li> Love love love...</li>
            <li> Seems to be able to brush all over the teeth much more so, rather than just glazing over the teeth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There maybe more cons to be listed, but it&#x27;s all I can remember off-hand at this moment.</li>
            <li> This is simply the BEST automatic toothbrush on the market today, period.</li>
            <li> I gums look so much better</li>
            <li> and I love the just from the dentist</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt better</li>
            <li> Proof is in the better dental appointments, too.</li>
            <li> I know, I know, you would like for us to spend more money on your products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Love having a clock in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> And it brushes and cleans my teeth better</li>
            <li> glad I did</li>
            <li> I love the brush, but I wish I could have done without the expense of the smiley face timer.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and they enjoy it twice a day!</li>
            <li> Love how it works so well dispite his braces.</li>
            <li> Love that you can chage the speed of how you can  change the type of cleaning</li>
            <li> My husband LOVES this so much more than the one he had.  </li>
            <li> it is even better.</li>
            <li> but the DiamondClean is better.</li>
            <li> The Oral B is way better than a manual brush</li>
            <li> it is much better than my 7</li>
            <li> Amazon had all the items to select from not like most stores.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t judge which of the two is better.  </li>
            <li> sure, I can see myself keeping this tooth brush for another 3-4 years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Simply the best toothbrush on the market.</li>
            <li> Even better now.</li>
            <li> The sensitive light indicator is an awesome feature.</li>
            <li> Now, I have better awareness and control of my brushing technique.</li>
            <li> What could be better?</li>
            <li> It is way better than Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> I love it  </li>
            <li> The battery life is better than that of my car.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Moreover, it allows you to choose between 5 settings, the most I&#x27;ve ever had in an electric brush.  </li>
            <li> I were to suggest improvements, I&#x27;d love a better charger and automatic UV sanitization.  </li>

            <li> I can get a better case at the dollar store...for wanna guess?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love gadgets</li>
            <li> I had a Sonic Care toothbrush and decided to give this a shot after reading the study that showed it did a better job of removing plaque.</li>
            <li> the carrying case does not offer any ventilation and most the features you will be using it on this brush.</li>
            <li> the carrying case does not offer any ventilation and most the features you will be using it on this brush.</li>
            <li> product is as advertised and works magically</li>
            <li> but it was interesting to discover that I brush my teeth longer than required.  </li>
            <li> I having been using rotary toothbrushes for more than 40 years</li>
            <li> For some reason I thought you&#x27;d have to do something more to get it to connect</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, as to the comparison of the Sonicare vs. Oral-B - I think this Oral-B gave me a better cleaning.</li>
            <li> Unlike a manual toothbrush, this toothbrush does most of the work for me.</li>
            <li> With the Sonicare,I was able to use the included brush immediately.</li>
            <li> Oral B should have included a sample selection of toothbrushes so that the customer could figure out which one was best without having to pay extra for his/</li>

            <li> I am pleased with amazon</li>
            <li> more deeply.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was is so much better.  </li>
            <li> I love the massage head the most.</li>
            <li> love shopping at Amazon, can always find what I am looking for, and</li>
            <li> Love the timer feature.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> At any rate, I&#x27;m glad I upgraded.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Sonicare has been tested to do a tad better then oral-b design.  </li>
            <li> but it still have more area where bacteria build up.  </li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It has been better than its predecessor - another Oral-B - which lasted 10 years.</li>
            <li> Excellent deep cleaning!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still much more of</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;won&#x27;t be used by most people, and they probably won&#x27;t use the rack</li>
            <li> It would have made much more sense to have it hold two</li>
            <li> , so I don&#x27;t think most users will have a need to mount the&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is phenomenal ...</li>
            <li> I have literally never had better reports from my hygienist.</li>
            <li> However, if you have a low tolerance for noise, this may not be your best choice.</li>
            <li> At the same time, I tend to buy the latest and greatest, thinking that it&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li> At the time of this review, the 5000 costs about $40 more.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the money since it will keep my teeth healthy.</li>
            <li> Okay, I know mechanical brushes - and this is the BOMB of all</li>
            <li> Though i suspect that may change over time as my teeth and gums adjust to the more vigorous</li>
            <li> (1 unit is included) seems most effective to take full advantage of the triple-action sweep motion the 5000 provides.  </li>
            <li> This one, like the first (4000 model) is giving me a good brushing and my dentist is pleased with the results I&#x27;m getting.  </li>
            <li> teeth always come out very clean with this brush which is not something i would say of the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Teeth feel very clean, almost like a polish from the dentist</li>
            <li> Timer helps you get a very clean mouth.</li>
            <li> Love it even more than my SonicCare AND more importantly, the replacement heads are affordable.</li>
            <li> Great tool for getting super clean teeth and a germ free mouth.</li>
            <li> I agree with the rest of the reviewer this a pretty good toothbrush, but at this point of writing</li>
            <li> Teeth are exceptionally clean and my mouth feels clean!!</li>
            <li> worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> I am happy of the switch and gotten used to oral-b with this new brush head design.  </li>
            <li> I am happy of the switch and gotten used to oral-b with this new brush head design.  </li>
            <li> Strongly urged by my dentist to encourage better dental hygiene.  </li>
            <li> like going to the dentist twice daily&lt;br /&gt;good built, nice timer adequate power&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;First the setup - like most electric toothbrushes, easy and intuitive to set up.</li>
            <li> the brush heads attach is much better than the sonicare, it feels more secure</li>
            <li> I received my toothbrush a week ago, and was quite impressed by the many functions, especially as they helped reinforce good brushing habits in my 7-year old daughter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what makes this beauty clean like a marvel!</li>
            <li> and it makes my teeth feel so clean!  </li>
            <li> I have only used the cleaning and whitening modes and they are very good.</li>
            <li> So, for brushing, for those of us who know how to brush properly, this is ideal.</li>
            <li> Packaging was secure and appropriate in size.</li>
            <li> the Triaction seems like a better fit for you than the Pulsonic,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> I tried 3 other electric toothbrushes and this one works the best of all.</li>
            <li> My hygienist complimented me on my clean healthy teeth and gums since using this and water pic.  </li>
            <li> I have been using an Oral B Vitality and after my last visit to the dentist where things were doing great, I decided to upgrade my brush to, hopefully, make it even better.</li>
            <li> Love how clean my teeth get after brushing them.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> Clean teeth and healthy gums.</li>
            <li> This was not an easy task.  </li>
            <li> The replacement brush heads are easy to find at Wal-Mart and I used a coupon from the newspaper.</li>
            <li> just because you can easily see what setting you&#x27;re on.</li>
            <li> The vibration was so strong it made my head \\&quot;itch\\&quot;, LOL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am delighted with the cleaning power of this particular arrangement.</li>
            <li> recommend to buy it strongly</li>
            <li> Again, Go with Sonicare, Sonicare makes a Much quieter and MUCH more effective bush.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Oral B tooth brushes for a long time and this one is very good.</li>
            <li> so I can be sure to brush for a full 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Sweet deal, love the travel case and the battery basically lasts forever - I don&#x27;t even have to bring charger anymore.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s incomparable, and it&#x27;s even better than my Sonicare Diamond Clean</li>
            <li> Great feels like a dental professional clean up</li>
            <li> I works fine.</li>
            <li> and it works just fine.  </li>
            <li> It feels comfortable in the hand and is easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> It has a slightly rubberized bottom and a tilted display so it works perfectly there.  </li>
            <li> It has a slightly rubberized bottom and a tilted display so it works perfectly there.  </li>
            <li> all seems fine again.  </li>
            <li> I think they all do a fine job.  </li>
            <li> Pulsonic included a separate fine head for cleaning your gum line</li>
            <li> Sonicare offers a pleasant hum while you&#x27;re brushing.</li>

            <li> You&#x27;ll get a very good cleaning from this one, but is it any better than what you&#x27;d have gotten from their previous top-of-the-line model?  </li>
            <li> quality was deemed not as good as the first one I bought and the 2nd electric toothbrush (forgotten the brand) wasn&#x27;t as good as the Roro-router . . .&lt;br /&gt;Loma</li>
            <li> This unit is great for travel as a full charge is good for 20 brush sessions and also comes included with a stylish, hard plastic carrying case.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo17LX29MOE1FWD]]The Oral-B 5000 electric toothbrush makes a fine toothbrush on its own, but it&#x27;s the nifty Smart Guide that makes this toothbrush a standout.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I especially like the smart guide, the best ever!</li>
            <li> my dentist and hygienist noticed a huge change in my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a toothbrush this fantastic in my life.  </li>
            <li> They are all great for their specific purpose.  </li>
            <li> &quot; 5000 is a great unit(BTW, the \\&quot;deep sweep head\\&quot; can also be used on the Oral B 1k, 3K and 4K units)--I will use it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because the designers of this brush dropped the ball in a couple of important ways:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Feel of the smooth plastic brush seems to condone dripping of liquids.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> However, I prefer using a night light instead of something serving as dual purposes.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> great price PLUS an extra discount</li>
            <li> I had the same model before this 1 worked great.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush comes with a flossing and regular brush head which are great for switching between day and night.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The feel of the Oral B and The Sonicare Elite are neck and neck but the feel of the DiamondClean is like you are holding a light precision instrument.  </li>
            <li> but sure are fun.  </li>
            <li> the Oral-B sounds like those cheap $5 AA powered toothbrushes you pick up in the impulse section of Wally-world.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more useful as a self-defense weapon if anyone ever invades my bathroom.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Electric toothbrushes do a fantastic job cleaning your teeth and masaging your gums.</li>
            <li> It is great for someone like me who doesn&#x27;t spend enough time brushing.</li>
            <li> This is a great electric toothbrush with 5 different modes.</li>
            <li> If you have some younger people in the house that could benefit from the LCD guide, this may be a great model for them.  </li>
            <li> If you have some younger people in the house that could benefit from the LCD guide, this may be a great model for them.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> The brushing part was nice and gentle though.</li>
            <li> For instance, I was tinkering with the toothbrush before it was fully charged and was alarmed at the sound.</li>
            <li> and it has given me a brighter smile and a better check up.</li>
            <li> and far superior to those competitors.  </li>
            <li> Far more effective than maual brushing.</li>
            <li> So far so good,</li>
            <li> you can systematically be sure you&#x27;ve hit all the right spots.</li>
            <li> Somehow, watching the timer countdown (4x 30-second increments) makes me more inclined to finish a 2-minute brushing session than before, when I&#x27;d just brush while staring at the wall and wait for the toothbrush to buzz at the right times.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t need this kind of versatility, the older Professional 1000 is a good alternative.&lt;br</li>
            <li> TOO MUCH WORK!!!  </li>
            <li> If one is seeking a great clean, this will definitely provide that.</li>
            <li> but most people will find the older model to be a better value proposition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth feel very clean when I&#x27;m done, and my breath is fresh.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel very clean when I&#x27;m done, and my breath is fresh.  </li>
            <li> And a very useful bonus is that the wall-mountable smart guide has a clock on it, so you know the time of day for those of us who are in a rush when using the bathroom! :)))</li>
            <li> is that the wall-mountable smart guide has a clock on it, so you know the time of day for those of us who are in a rush when using the bathroom! :)))</li>
            <li> With all the discount coupons available, and sometimes a &#x27;special&#x27; sale, you can get this $129 +/-</li>
            <li> Strong function, good quality and low price, especially toothbrush head comes too strong, with more than one month of both very strong.</li>
            <li> For years and years now I have shyed away from electric toothbrushes because I assumed that they were all like the original Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line - If I did not buy the sonicare then this brush would surely have a higher rating from me</li>
            <li> when I ordered this product for review, I was really excited.</li>
            <li> The original sonic care had bacteria or some junk between the head and body.  </li>
            <li> I had a scanned copy of what I had sent them, and they denied it because it wasn&#x27;t the original.</li>
            <li> I think what is most impressive to me about this electric toothbrush is that I&#x27;ve noticed that my teeth stay cleaner longer than they did when I brushed with a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Feel so clean after using it</li>
            <li> Definately leaves a clean feeling when using this brush.</li>
            <li> I use the head with the pointy bristles to clean between teeth; its listed as providing cleaning on dentures.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to clean as well as the Oral-B Sonic Complete.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> I felt like I was getting all of my teeth just as clean as with this brush</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt and looked so clean.  </li>
            <li> I could never bruch my teeth as clean as this does.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels perfectly clean.</li>
            <li> Oh so clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean.  </li>
            <li> The Sonicare Diamond Clean takes it.</li>
            <li> they clean but do not massage the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes your teeth  feel polished and clean  </li>
            <li> my teeth feel so clean after using this brush.</li>
            <li> My dentist says the my teeth are clean.  </li>
            <li> Let me just say, my teeth felt extremely clean after using this 2x a day for 7 days.</li>
            <li> I feel a noticeable difference in how clean my teeth are after brushing.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with Oral-B Professional Deep Sweep and I recommend it wholeheartedly.</li>
            <li> an incredibly clean feeling.</li>
            <li> They work well and clean efficiently and do not break after a year of use (like the Sonicares).</li>
            <li> &quot; feeling of clean.</li>
            <li> Totally excited about this product after a full year of use.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought the clock/timer was overkill, but the positive reinforcement smiley face when finished is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> My favorite part of the tooth brush is the smart guide.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Professional toothbrush comes with some nice features.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the Braun that imitates the Sonicare, but my guess is going to do the same as the Sonicare and won&#x27;t produce as good a result as this, the \\&quot;original\\&quot;,</li>
            <li> Both Oral B and Sonicare do a good job--if both are used properly.  </li>
            <li> Love it, very high-quality, deep-cleaning toothbrush.</li>
            <li> So far I am loving this brush.</li>
            <li> This brush feels good and solid but it lacks the ease of use of the competition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bluetooth thingamabob, I think, is a scam to allow company to charge more than they really need to.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s good to replace the brush heads regularly.  </li>
            <li> but the timer has prodded me to change my brushing habits to the full 2 minute session.  </li>
            <li> its full potential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Sweet...</li>
            <li> Sweet...</li>
            <li> it is true.  </li>
            <li> After you brush for the full 2 minutes, you are rewarded with a smiley face.</li>
            <li> The cool thing is you can be in another room</li>
            <li> The cheaper ones we have are good enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> some people say oral-b is noisier then sonicare, it is true but I won&#x27;t lose any sleep over</li>
            <li> Turns out, this is a completely different animal -- in a good way.</li>
            <li> nice touches: a fairly strong looking travel case for the brush and brush heads (the battery will supposedly last up to 10 days without a charge);</li>
            <li> nice touches: a fairly strong looking travel case for the brush and brush heads (the battery will supposedly last up to 10 days without a charge);</li>
            <li> The toothbrush cleaning action is incredible, better than any other toothbrush I&#x27;ve tested (and I have tested many!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just love that and feel like it gives the brush heads a much more thorough cleaning than simply rinsing them in the water after you clean your teeth.</li>
            <li> I just love that and feel like it gives the brush heads a much more thorough cleaning than simply rinsing them in the water after you clean your teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Setup was pretty easy, one thing that through me though is that the brush is delivered with zero charge.  </li>
            <li> And the 30 second cues help keep you on track to brushing long enough to do the best job.r more effective than maual brushing.</li>
            <li> It would be just as good without the large smiley face that appears after the brushing is complete, and that might allow them to make the housing</li>
            <li> It leaves my&lt;br /&gt;mouth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Useful for anyone wanting to thoroughly clean their teeth.</li>
            <li> The whitening brush is also helpful, but i limit my use to this brush for the same reason that i use Xylitol toothpaste most of the time, and a cleaning paste infrequently, i want to keep my enamel intact more than i want whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> , It must have taken longer though; 30 seconds for each quadrant seems too quick.</li>
            <li> life is awesome, last you like a week on daily use&lt;br /&gt;nice carrying case</li>
            <li> I love the sweeping brush as it gets around and in between teeth better than a regular brush.</li>
            <li> Does an excellent job on plaque and has terrific feed back on time brushing and brushing pressure.</li>
            <li> In particular, people with braces should consider purchasing the \\&quot;Ortho Brush Head\\&quot; that is better suited to cleaning teeth with braces.</li>
            <li> but luckily another suggested I just use Sonicare, floss every night, and dab Listerine on my gums.</li>
            <li> Came quickly, thank you.  </li>
            <li> For most travel,&lt;br /&gt;this won&#x27;t be an issue, since the battery should last many days, but&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unless you&#x27;re super fastidious about cleaning the charger!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The advanced features are handy, but I mostly like the more basic features such as the timer that helps me take the time to brush thoroughly.</li>
            <li> but I am sticking with my sonicare as I see it as the more precision, high quality cleaning tool.  </li>
            <li> The device is of high quality while the brush (Oral-B) is the top recommended tooth brush among the dental care professionals.</li>
            <li> Individual receiving the gift is very pleased with the gift</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and to clean the brush itself, the battery is big for many times of use without charging.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;electronic timer\\&quot; is nice but not always necessary since the brush stops every 30 seconds--however unlike the Sonicare--the unit continues even after the 2 minutes are up--I use this continuation to clean the brushhead under the faucet.  </li>
            <li> B003UKM9CO Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Precision 1000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush 1 Count]] at about 1/3 the cost.</li>
            <li> For the price of this toothbrush($133.32), you could have bought [[ASIN:B008PEMOV6 Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean +</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Professional Triaction 5000 does a very fine job of cleaning my teeth using side to side rather than rotary motion.</li>
            <li> I had an older model Oral-B which was still going strong though the battery life seemed a bit shorter and not quite as powerful as when I originally purchased it.</li>
            <li> I am really glad we purchased this new one.</li>
            <li> Love this new electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I actually had a pretty good system for brushing my teeth with a manual brush where in</li>
            <li> Love it; far more than the high end</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Sonicare feels more like a professional clean, this feels more like a soft scrub.  </li>
            <li> As a toothbrush it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to - my visits to the dentist became significantly shorter/happier experiences since I started using the Oral-B brushes (compared to manual brushes and a Sonicare brush I once had).</li>
            <li> It gives star rating at the end and stays on there until the next time you brush, so it&#x27;s nice to be ably to quickly see whenever I use his bathroom to see how he&#x27;s been brushing.</li>
            <li> The smart guide is a fantastic wireless feature.</li>
            <li> On the front of the handle are the power button, the mode button, the smart guide indicator light, and the battery level lights.  </li>
            <li> Liked it better than sonicare, but was missing an auto shutoff after 2 mins of brushing.  </li>
            <li> It is so powerful it makes her teeth tingle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really the type of monitoring and reinforcement that I personally prefer, but it can be helpful for some, and probably is especially handy for children.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just as good as expected.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find the coaching beeps particularly useful because left to my own devices without rushing to keep up with the coaching peeps</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t find the pressure sensor particularly useful.</li>
            <li> and I feel the time spent with this brush is well worth the fact of my good dental results.</li>
            <li> This is far better than that</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has more power than my old battery operated one.</li>
            <li> Just had a couple of K ($$) worth of dental work done.  </li>
            <li> I guess the sensor could be useful for some people.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He believes it cleans better than his old one as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This might be a useful feature for those who need to pay more attention to their teeth, are young or are motivated by seeing icons, stars and smiley faces of encouragement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But then the light came on and sure enough, when I read through the instruction booklet it tells you this could happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I already own several Sonicare toothbrushes, I didn&#x27;t bother reading the instructions for the Oral B, thinking,</li>
            <li> It was definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is worth paying the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dramatically better in every conceivable way.</li>
            <li> If the monetary difference isn&#x27;t that important to you, then the 5000 Deep Sweep would be a worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li> Taken together, this is one powerful combination.</li>
            <li> This was very much worth</li>
            <li> What really makes this product unique in my experience, however, is the fact that it moves in all three dimensions, which makes a noticable difference in cleaning spots that a normal brush might easily miss.  </li>
            <li> My mouth really feels clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I personally prefer the circular motion as that gives you a more focused clean.</li>
            <li> I can say that my teeth are exceptionally clean and this toothbrush makes sure that I brush properly for 2 or 2.5 minutes at a time.</li>
            <li> Works very well and leaves my mouth and teeth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, if I did not know how good the other was, then I would buy this brush again but now that I know - no way</li>
            <li> right, moving through about 1/4 inch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Oral-B  Professional Deep Sweep is amazing!</li>
            <li> At first I thought its brush head was kind of small, having gone for full size brush heads in the past, but it is actually a perfect size.  </li>
            <li> We got this to replace a major competetor brand that died in under a year and cost a TON more.  </li>
            <li> Very good except the 110 volts adapter not good</li>
            <li> The new \\&quot;deep sweep\\&quot; does a good job but the Oral B unit is a bit louder than the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> like the extra module that shows how much more time left to brush and also displays a handy clock when not in use.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of being able to use different style brush heads with this model, as well as having five different cleaning modes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a good toothbrush, but it&#x27;s not worth</li>
            <li> The large, glaring, red strip is unmistakeable and handily prevents the user from damaging his/her gums.</li>
            <li> but geez, for 10 cents more, they could make it a little better.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While I am not a convert (mostly as a result of the noise but a little because my dentist solely endorses Sonicare), I plan to keep it as a back-up (I plan on taking it on vacations since it has a better travel case).</li>
            <li> I also thought the smart guide was probably something I wouldn&#x27;t use!  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;- strong vibrating action</li>
            <li> The sensitive and deep clean options are especially useful.  </li>
            <li> Or get the [[ASIN:B008PEMNJY Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Sensitive Gum Care Precision 3000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush And Refill Brush Head 1 Count]] and oral irrigator but forget the dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s an important feature for me but as far as the cleaning itself, I think the Oral-B wins</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s an important feature for me but as far as the cleaning itself, I think the Oral-B wins out.</li>
            <li> overall effect was entirely comparable to what I have experienced with Sonicare ...</li>
            <li> This brush does the exact same task, and has the same options as the Diamond Series from Sonicare, but it&#x27;s even better since this product is very well made and the electric mechanism inside the brush is manufactured by Braun which is a very reputable manufacturer of shavers, trimmers and etc.</li>
            <li> The main difference between most Oral-B&#x27;s is that they have a circular motion mainly concentrating on each individual tooth, while most Sonicare&#x27;s use longer brush heads that sweep back and forth to cover more area.</li>
            <li> the unit is pretty loud and not as easy to manipulate around the hard-to-reach spots</li>
            <li> If you have kids, the Smart Guide might be fun to have; it flashes, gives stars for every part of the brushing routine, and displays a smiley face at the end of the cycle.  </li>
            <li> for some, and the Smart Guide could be useful if people have</li>
            <li> The new brush is also significantly lighter.  </li>
            <li> how smooth and clean my teeth feel verse a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Imagine my shock when it was fully charged and remained SUPER, SUPER loud.</li>
            <li> The smart guide has four 1/4 circles on it, each representing a section or &amp;#34;quadrant&amp;#34; of your mouth: Top right, bottom right, bottom left, top left, in that order.</li>
            <li> I just relaxed and stopped pressing so hard , and got a great cleaning!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was going to purchase the new Sonicare Diamond Clean</li>
            <li> Choosing the right electric toothbrush is of great importance to me because I have serious gum recession - one dentist recommended gum surgery</li>
            <li> biggest difference between the Pro 4000 and the Deep Sweep 5000 is the new brush head, which I do think is slightly superior to older brush heads.  </li>
            <li> every 30 seconds is an idiot-proof nudge to move onto the next quadrant even to the most distracted of brushers.  </li>
            <li> It monitors your cleaning and lets you know if you&#x27;re exerting too much pressure on your teeth by warning you with a red light and sound.</li>
            <li> I owned the other top brand and this one beats it two to one!</li>
            <li> Seems more cheaply made, or something of a beta model when comparing to the earlier Oral-B Sonic Complete</li>
            <li> I love the digital reminder to brush for 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> , I actually take the time to do a better job.  </li>
            <li> I tested by pushing on it with my thumb to make sure it worked, but I have never seen it actually work while brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Gave the first to my child.  </li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> It works exactly as advertized, a rarity in todays world.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Works very well!</li>
            <li> This really cleans your teeth and in between your teeth too!  </li>
            <li> For a \\&quot;Smart\\&quot; brush, that&#x27;s pretty...</li>
            <li> This was my first  time using electric  toothbrush  </li>
            <li> This is targeted for those who are really devoted to a brighter smile and cleaner feeling, and are willing to work for it.  </li>
            <li> Our rushed lifestyles harm our health in many ways, but they especially prevent us from caring for our mouths.  </li>
            <li> I can feel the difference after the first brushing.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric toothbrush I ever owned in my life.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure why the plastic part was so essential.</li>
            <li> her first kit.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> her first kit.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the way it works and it appears to do a better job than my Sonic brush but only time will tell.  </li>
            <li> It cleans better than my low end Oral B, and probably equal to or better than the Sonicaire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> of the first things I realized after turning it on the first time was that it wasn&#x27;t a sonic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It went off about 5 times per brushing the first couple of times I used it, but that was just the way I was used to brushing with the Triumph model.  </li>
            <li> once I&#x27;m sure my theeth are properly cleaned</li>
            <li> The 5000 also beeps once after the first quadrant,&lt;br /&gt;twice</li>
            <li> /&gt;In terms of the extra features, I think the travel case and the extra&lt;br /&gt;brush head add the most value.</li>
            <li> She likes the brushing action and hand fit of this model.</li>
            <li> It is very well made and powerful.</li>
            <li> After I discarded several of the space-consuming things such as the large retainer stand that holds multiple brush-heads, it fit nicely on the counter top taking up almost no space.  </li>
            <li> Overall i do enjoy the sheer novelty that this dashboard provides and would hope that future versions punch up the functionality to include more robust features such as reminders/alerts if your brush hasn&#x27;t been used (a great feature for parents),</li>
            <li> For me, the most useful feature is probably the pressure sensor that lights bright red if I&#x27;m pushing too hard on my teeth with the brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very easy to see that different things are important to different people when buying anything and that includes the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> And the 30 second cues help keep you on track to brushing long enough to do the best job.</li>
            <li> when you first place the toothbrush on the charger it doesn&#x27;t immediately light up, it takes more than a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I find it works well for me, but the nice thing about Oral-B is that they have a number of other heads to choose from based on your needs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find it works well for me, but the nice thing about Oral-B is that they have a number of other heads to choose from based on your needs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the timer it helps me make sure I brush long enough.  </li>
            <li> Even brand new, my teeth never felt this clean - this is very close to that \\&quot;just from the dentist\\&quot; feeling of clean.rushing time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even brand new, my teeth never felt this clean - this is very close to that \\&quot;just from the dentist\\</li>
            <li> Mechanical and sonic action gets your teeth clean.  </li>
            <li> You can also purchase the Floss Action brush heads which contains rubber &amp;#34;flossers&amp;#34; to clean up gunk between</li>
            <li> so you know how much more time you have left to get ready.</li>
            <li> Each is one more green light on the front.</li>
            <li> This is my second Oral-B, which the first one is still going strong for 16 months now.  </li>
            <li> My teeth felt much cleaner and my mouth stayed fresher longer after my first use.  </li>
            <li> I was on my fifth Sonicare toothbrush and like a long love affair, wanted to check out something</li>
            <li> I expected a pack of three, which would be more appropriate for multiple users.&lt;br</li>
            <li> than that, they&#x27;re pretty much identical:</li>
            <li> and I have to set them manually each time which takes  some time, if  I were able to make these setting permanent it would save a lot of time and hassle in the long run.</li>
            <li> /&gt;FINALLY there is a well made electric toothbrush that cleans your teeth and mouth with the good old traditional brushing action.  </li>
            <li> The 5000 has so far proved more useful because it takes this two steps further by doing things the others haven&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Given that the Pro 1000 costs much less than this model and does an extremely good job, I&#x27;d be tempted to just buy it if I were new to Oral B.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to try this new one because it doesn&#x27;t have a round brush head (even though I could put the round brush heads on this one also; they&#x27;re perfectly compatible).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used Oral-B for quite a few years and this is probably the best toothbrush of the bunch, if only for the reason that you can use pretty much any of the Braun Oral-B heads with this unit.&lt;br /&gt;The battery (so far) is working fine and seems to last quite a while between charges.  </li>
            <li> Going through a proper 2 minute session (or 3 minutes with the &#x27;Deep Clean&#x27; mode) will leave your mouth refreshed and satisfied and the pulse pause and audible beep</li>
            <li> This has several settings &amp; it easily syncs with the clock.  </li>
            <li> The Deep Clean has 5 modes and can take up to 6 different tooth brush heads that help you on your way to healthy gums.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy enough to time your brushing without using the SmartGuide at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We had a previous model and liked it.  </li>
            <li> The timer/ clock is nice to see things the duration and mode, but I wished it didn&#x27;t use battery and was part of the charger.&lt;br /&gt;+ less stain and residue on the brush.  </li>
            <li> It is portable with long lasting battery and feels good after brushing.</li>
            <li> I own an older Oral B Professional 1000, so I can compare this newer Oral-B Deep Sweep + Smart Guide</li>
            <li> Also, the controls aren&#x27;t 100% intuitive for we of the iPhone generation, though they can certainly be mastered with 5 minutes of work.  </li>
            <li> Also, the controls aren&#x27;t 100% intuitive for we of the iPhone generation, though they can certainly be mastered with 5 minutes of work.  </li>
            <li> toothbrush also comes with a large and clunky \\&quot;SmartGuide.\\</li>
            <li> got people who don&#x27;t have large mouths.</li>
            <li> I saw it came with a \\&quot;Smart Guide\\&quot; timer</li>
            <li> let&#x27;s talk about the Smart Guide.  </li>
            <li> You can mount the Smart Guide on the wall with an included bracket, but I like to place mine on the countertop.  </li>
            <li> The Smart Guide keeps me on track.  </li>
            <li> The Smart Guide runs off of 2 AA batteries (they are included).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> The Smart Guide runs off of 2 AA batteries (they are included).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not so large that it gets in the way, but it does take a bit of getting used to.</li>
            <li> setup the time on the smart guide</li>
            <li> I wanted it because of the certain types of brush</li>
            <li> a travel case, the wireless \\&quot;Smart</li>
            <li> When not in&lt;br /&gt;use, the Smart Guide doubles as a clock.</li>
            <li> the Smart Guide if you don&#x27;t want to.</li>
            <li> The Smart Guide slides into a holder than you can mount on your&lt;br /&gt;bathroom mirror or wall with an included adhesive strip.</li>
            <li> In 12h mode, the Smart Guide clock has no way to indicate am/</li>
            <li> Although the travel case can hold the toothbrush and two brushheads,&lt;br /&gt;there is no case for the charger or the Smart Guide.</li>
            <li> Both of the electric toothbrushes I&#x27;ve tried have had some sort of timer in them, but it&#x27;s been some form of pausing or pulsing to indicate that you&#x27;re done with a certain section of teeth.</li>
            <li> However, the many features that make it so are also largely unchanged from the previous top-of-the-line [[ASIN:B008PEMOV6 Oral-B Professional Precision 5000]], save for a $20 price increase and a fancy new brush that many people won&#x27;t use.  </li>
            <li> The different modes are also nice (and differ from each other significantly).</li>
            <li> The new \\&quot;deep sweep\\&quot; head is supposed to be better than the Sonicare--</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the Smart Guide, as I am quite used to what I am doing, but it&#x27;s a nice touch to those that are new to the Oral-B Professional Deep Sweep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ..I was surprised and delighted at how easy it is to use, especially with that smart little guide to time me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably not advisable to do so, though, as most dentists recommend gentle bristles for electric toothbrushes and the new brush head definitely doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> The smart guide makes a nice little clock for the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In use I&#x27;ve gotta say this thing is noisy.  </li>
            <li> The time for each mouth quadrant (or section) varies from 30 seconds for standard clean mode, to 45 seconds for professional or intensive clean mode.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She loves this and it has some really nice features but you will have to read the manual a little to understand them and the display.......</li>
            <li> A nice little travel case comes with the brush as well.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, Oral-B has a large variety of different brush heads that you can purchase separately.</li>
            <li> ... a great brush with a handy Smart Guide.also displays the current mode you are in, and if you are pushing too hard (the toothbrush itself also has a light to indicate that you are pushing too hard).  </li>
            <li> and this is probably a huge DUH for most everyone else but myself, the Smart Guide is wireless and you don&#x27;t have to do anything to get it to team up with the toothbrush -</li>
            <li> After I decided to give it one more chance (my seventh try), I was astonished to see that my gums had actually receded a little on the top.</li>
            <li> After I decided to give it one more chance (my seventh try), I was astonished to see that my gums had actually receded a little on the top.</li>
            <li> I tried them several days in a row against each other and the cleaning mode of the DiamondClean Limited is the best brush - period.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another feature of the toothbrush is a pressure sensor that will flash a red light in the handle to let you know that you are exerting too much pressure on your teeth while brushing.</li>
            <li> The timer helps so much.</li>
            <li> Smartguide which monitors the brushing cycle and gives us a warning if too much pressure is applied</li>
            <li> I also tried the Oral B \\&quot;gentle and floss\\&quot; heads--both are the circular type--</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t need to brush for 2 minutes with this brush and can get the job done in 1.5 mins or even 1 minute if it&#x27;s at night.</li>
            <li> that I eve could, and MUCH faster</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> I had the toothbrush before, so I knew it really worked.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It teaches me how much force to put against my teeth while brushing.</li>
            <li> I also enjoy how you can have two brush heads with different rings.  </li>
            <li> No joke, this product really works that well.  </li>
            <li> Also has a sensor that alerts you if you&#x27;re using too much pressure.</li>
            <li> and I  don&#x27;t say that much does  </li>
            <li> This really is the Ferrari of toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> It really does make a difference and my mouth has never felt cleaner.</li>
            <li> For those with slack tendencies (ahem...me), its timer helps improve habits by making us more mindful of the time we&#x27;ve spent brushing.  </li>
            <li> works VERY well.  </li>
            <li> I believe all you really need is a fast and a slower speed.</li>
            <li> Really like how  my teeth and mouth feel after using .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel that it cleans any better than my old one, and I don&#x27;t personally like how it stops and beeps every time it wants you to change side.</li>
            <li> I can really feel the difference in  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really need the timer</li>
            <li> It is fast and thorough.  </li>
            <li> , I felt my whole head vibrating</li>
            <li> , I felt my whole head vibrating</li>
            <li> It syncs in with the toothbrush and shows how much time I spend brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> Thanks to his suggestions, I&#x27;ve managed to keep the gum pockets stable and from getting deeper for about fifteen years.</li>
            <li> It makes your mouth feel much fresher and it was recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize how much I would like an electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> How it feels, its deep cleaning, it is fabulous.  </li>
            <li> The front and back of the brush are rubberized, while the sliver sides are done in a smooth plastic.  </li>
            <li> Sound-wise, the Oral-B is no worse than an electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is mechanical and although it is fast, it is not sonic.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning modes are fairly unnecessary even though they seem like an attractive feature on the surface.&lt;br</li>
            <li> probably paid too much since I don&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li> Bought as gift, he really likes it a lot.</li>
            <li> The Triaction is also&lt;br /&gt;chunkier than the Pulsonic, but not as much as the Philips Sonicare&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;a fast vibration than a gentle massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;around three times as much counter space as the charger alone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much like the Sonicare, it is ergonomically</li>
            <li> Really neat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is MUCH, MUCH, MUCH louder than my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another neat trick this brush is capable of is changing its brushing style.</li>
            <li> It also gently massages your gums.</li>
            <li> what I discovered is that if I brush standing up straight that isn&#x27;t a problem.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I really like it.  </li>
            <li> Deep Sweep head is so much better than the Floss Action head</li>
            <li> Especially with the sweeping motion, it reaches more tooth than we naturally cover on our own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Especially with the sweeping motion, it reaches more tooth than we naturally cover on our own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This means I&#x27;ll have to run out and pay extra for one of the many choices Oral B offers.</li>
            <li> This means I&#x27;ll have to run out and pay extra for one of the many choices Oral B offers.</li>
            <li> do generally like using an electric toothbrush, not because it does a better job than a manual  brush, but because it does an equal job a little more quickly.</li>
            <li> It cleans up easier than my old one!!!</li>
            <li> It is creating a loud resonating sound of cheap plastic clanging against each other.  </li>
            <li> mean this in a good way.</li>
            <li> I had experienced some irritation around the crowns in the past--not often--but the irritation did happen every few months--even though I thought I was pretty meticulous about keeping them clean with the small periodontal brushes I used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The Oral-B is very nicely done in white, silver, and green.  </li>
            <li> It will time how long you are brushing and that is a feature that I have very quickly come to appreciate.  </li>
            <li> Often when I&#x27;m in a rush it is easy to think I&#x27;ve been brushing a long time</li>
            <li> In the box was a case, the handle, one brush head (not sure why the description states that there are multiple refill heads, mine didn&#x27;t include them), the smart guide (included Duracell batteries which I thought was great), and the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a no brainer when spending a significant amount on the actual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It looks way better than the other 2 on the counter.</li>
            <li> The manufacturer claims the sweeping&lt;br /&gt;action is even better at removing plaque than other electric&lt;br</li>
            <li> They sent mine back stating I didn&#x27;t send the original UPC from the box, when I did.</li>
            <li> My teeth are so clean and white by the time I&#x27;m done brushing</li>
            <li> (well, maybe not total delight) and your teeth, gums, tongue and mouth roof are sparkling clean.  </li>
            <li> Deep clean mode...extends time by 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> Daily Clean mode&lt;br</li>
            <li> Deep Clean mode&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> also, it shifted automatically between brush modes while i was brushing and could not get it to brush with the 3 minute mode (deep clean) would not allow me to set it there.</li>
            <li> What is the difference between deep clean and whitening?</li>
            <li> your mouth even partially, such as to clean your gum line with the&lt;br /&gt;tip</li>
            <li> Now, since I have used these types of toothbrushes throughout the years, I began with the deep clean ...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to someone who is looking for a high tech toothbrush!</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I would give this product 5 stars for the brushing unit itself, I deducted a star because they only included on brush head and these are new types of heads for Oral-B and not yet readily available.</li>
            <li> Use paste not gel or you will find yourself less than satisfied as the paste will not spray as much.</li>
            <li> The brush beeps every 30 seconds to tell you to move to a new quadrant, this is also shown on the smart meter.  </li>
            <li> I believe that by so poorly promoting DeepSweep Procter &amp; Gamble made a huge disfavor to both themselves (as that diminishes their profits) and millions of people who are unaware of how good this product is.</li>
            <li> A full charge lasts over 7 days of brushing twice a day for 2 minutes (4 minutes daily), so I don&#x27;t have to carry the charger when I travel.</li>
            <li> I can charge it for the full charge and it last alnost 2 weeks without charging.</li>
            <li> Would not go back to regular tooth brush, my teeth feel super clean.</li>
            <li> I imagine that this may actually motivate chidren and hopefully get them to brush the full 2 minutes</li>
            <li> 30 second rush jobs as you head out to work become the full 2 minutes they&#x27;re supposed to be.</li>
            <li> Years ago I had a very cheap one which I dont remember the model, but it overall was not that different.</li>
            <li> One other nice feature of the Smart Guide is when you are not brushing your teeth it displays the current time.  </li>
            <li> One other nice feature of the Smart Guide is when you are not brushing your teeth it displays the current time.  </li>
            <li> They are more prone to lemons and batteries weakening too early(as short as three months).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B also has a better method of replacing the brush heads, so it&#x27;s more future-proof: several times with Sonicare as new models come out, I found myself unable to use my current brush heads at that time and had to switch to newer heads, so with this method you can save more and not have to worry about buying new brush heads and wasting your old ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Comparing the Oral-B Professional to the past Oral-B Sonic Complete, the Oral-B Sonic (Complete) brands seems to win without competition from these newer makes and models from Oral-B!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> needed a new toothbrush and after what must have been too much research</li>
            <li> I had an older model and didn&#x27;t really need a new one, but decided to splurge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the charger design, you can actually scrub it clean to new looking.</li>
            <li> The reason why is clearly the internal gears are all plastic on plastic and they are not very tight fitting.  </li>
            <li> (daily clean, deep clean, sensitive, whitening, massage)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are 5 brushing modes: daily clean, deep clean, sensitive, massage, and polish.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are five modes, Daily Clean, Deep Clean, Sensitive, Whitening and Massage.</li>
            <li> Daily Clean (30 seconds per quadrant), Deep Clean (45 seconds per quadrant), Sensitive (slower speed for gentler brushing), Whitening (for a \\&quot;polishing\\&quot; experience) and Massage (for gum stimulation).  </li>
            <li> I was never been able to clean my teeth so efficiently, you will definitely feel the difference after using it a few times.</li>
            <li> We had the older model so this was an upgrade.</li>
            <li> According to independent, scientific medical study it removes 40% more plague than SoniCare (&lt;br /&gt;http://www.dentalcare.com/media/en-US/research_db/pdf/products/8week-eval-benefits-multidirectional.pdf);&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> It does not make an irritating high-pinch ultrasonic sound like SoniCare that many people don&#x27;t like;&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> but it makes a decent looking clock.</li>
            <li> PARTICULARLY LIKE 5 SPEED CONTROL</li>
            <li> Given this toothbrush costs over a hundred smackers for a brush, make it a decent case.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace an older Braun Oral B electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> A few extra features that I didn&#x27;t need but still a good product.</li>
            <li> main difference between the two, however, is the price.</li>
            <li> Unlike oscillating Oral-B toothbrush that requires special technique for brushing, you can use DeepSweep in a same familiar motion as any manual toothbrush;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately Procter &amp; Gamble company that owns Oral-B did a horrible job at marketing it: there are no ads I&#x27;m aware of that promote this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, if you had an older model, I highly recommend you try this.</li>
            <li> brush has 5 cleaning modes, which I think is a little bit of overkill for me, HOWEVER, if you have sensitive gums, this might be perfect for you as the settings are:  Whitening (a polishing mode), Daily clean, Deep clean, SENSITIVE and massage mode.&lt;br /&gt;I tend to brush too hard and the \\&quot;gum care pressure sensor\\&quot; kept me from tearing up my gums, thankfully.</li>
            <li> the Healthy White, the Oral-B has a regular setting and a setting for \\&quot;whitening.\\&quot; Additionally, it has sensitive, massage, and deep clean options.</li>
            <li> I highly highly highly recommend Oral-B rechargable electric tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> high quality, high -tech</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and  I highly recommend it .</li>
            <li> Highly degenerate to the companies image and reputation.  </li>
            <li> The sonicare sounds like a high end tool with its vibrating hum,</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Performance wise it would be the same, because the only difference between this and the old 5000 is deep sweep brush</li>
            <li> husband, on the other hand, likes it more than his professional care 1000.</li>
            <li> My Professional 1000 and 4000 did not come with a Smart Guide, which is a 2:00 LCD timer wirelessly linked to the brush.  </li>
            <li> (However, teeth do feel much cleaner after using the Oral-B Sonic Complete brush, completely seemingly nullifying this positive aspect!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;</li>
            <li> I think the motor could be a little more quieter.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know my old Oral-B was out of date until I tried the Deep Clean.  </li>
            <li> For those that have never used an electric toothbrush, this will likely wow you with how your teeth feel &#x27;dentist clean&#x27; every day.  </li>
            <li> There are positive and negative to both design, but with the 5000 (vibrate/ pulsating head) I think Oral-b is equal or better then sonicare brushing design.is true</li>
            <li> Additionally, it has a really amazing feature (not available on any Sonicare I&#x27;ve ever seen): the back of the handle lights-up if one applies too much pressure.</li>
            <li> It is so powerful and quiet.  </li>
            <li> Love the timer and that it stops at 30 second intervals to let you know how long you&#x27;ve been brushing.</li>
            <li> It is worth the extra money just in style.</li>
            <li> Having many family members, this is a heavily used product in our house.  </li>
            <li> at first i missed the sonic care vibrate, but this is really the same thing</li>
            <li> Most people don&#x27;t brush properly or long enough if they do.  </li>
            <li> e.g the default program is normal cleaning and</li>
            <li> With normal brushing I&#x27;d sometimes notice a film on my teeth by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> Since its a new product, I can&#x27;t speak to its durability, but it feels very solidly constructed, for what that&#x27;s worth.  </li>

            <li> Oral-B&#x27;s &#x27;Deep Sweep Triaction 5000&#x27; Electric toothbrush is a great, premium quality product with a unique feature that distinguishes it from other similar brushes - a small wireless &#x27;Smart Guide&#x27; gadget that serves as a dashboard of sorts to monitor the progress of your toothbrushing session.  </li>
            <li> It also displays an icon indicating the&lt;br /&gt;selected brushing mode, and if you press too hard, in addition to the&lt;br /&gt;warning light on the toothbrush that the Triaction 1000 shares, a&lt;br /&gt;warning icon and red light will appear on the Smart Guide.</li>
            <li> To keep this brush in the upper mid range, Oral-B has left out some good features such as automatic santization and an improved charging station.  </li>
            <li> Pretty much the same as my other Oral B brush, but significantly noisier than a Sonicaire.  </li>
            <li> to the Smart Guide, personally, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using it much, but  for some</li>
            <li> Smart Guide is a battery powered LCD display (about the size of an&lt;br /&gt;iPhone, but more than twice as thick), that communicates wirelessly&lt;br</li>
            <li> The timer is a separate piece which is not very user friendly.</li>
            <li> I can tell the new brush will do just that.</li>
            <li> Put off buying a new electric toothbrush because Roto-router (?)</li>
            <li> Have needed a new electronic toothbrush for sometime and I like this one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is something new, and even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> new Oral-B Triaction 5000 has  5 modes of operation.</li>
            <li> they sent me a new one to exchange</li>
            <li> It took some getting use to the new design.  </li>
            <li> So I bought this, expecting just a new version of what I had before.</li>
            <li> There are some out there who have not &#x27;sunk their teeth&#x27; into the new dental technology.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one thing to hear that it&#x27;s time to move to a new section, but it&#x27;s another to know that you have been brushing that section for 20 seconds.</li>
            <li> This gadget is particularly handy when you&#x27;re toggling between the 5 different brushing modes (eg - &#x27;whitening,&#x27; &#x27;deep clean,&#x27; etc) or just to watch the seconds count down before moving onto the next quadrant.  </li>
            <li> when the brush is charging, you see one light blinking, then two, then finally three blinking lights as it completes the final 1/3 of the charge.</li>
            <li> Inthe old days, you call it brush your teeth for a few seconds more.  </li>
            <li> I had an older Oral-B electric toothbrush that was showing its age (battery was wimping out, etc.), it was probably about six years old.</li>
            <li> The company probably spent more money denying my rebate (which was only $20) than if they had honored it as advertised.</li>
            <li> I found the Braun provided a very clear improvement over the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Deep Sweep 5000 is currently more expensive than the older Professional 1000 because it is the more versatile of the two models.  </li>
            <li> Huge red lights light up on the handle if you push too hard, so what is it for?  </li>
            <li> First of all, I am a Sonicare user--I did use Oral B about 6-8 years ago and for some forgotten reason went back to a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Seems more harsh when compared to the Oral-B Sonic Complete lower brushing levels for sensitive teeth and gum areas.&lt;br /&gt;5)</li>
            <li> My only regret is spending too much to get all these extra features which I don&#x27;t find useful.</li>
            <li> literally the first time I used it I brushed for about 10 minutes</li>
            <li> I like the fact that you can use the deep sweep head as well as many of the other Oral B heads.</li>
            <li> Deep Sweep combines the familiar brushing motion of a manual toothbrush with triple-action, deep cleaning technology.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After retiring the first brush head, to investigate further my concern for it harboring moisture, I broke it apart with a hammer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not needed, you can do everything exactly the same without it.  </li>
            <li> For the first time, I can&#x27;t wait until my next dental appointment to see if they can see a difference as well.</li>
            <li> Bought for significant other.</li>
            <li> I will be interested to see if I had received a damaged product, or if another person, like me, received something different than what was in the Amazon description.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will be interested to see if I had received a damaged product, or if another person, like me, received something different than what was in the Amazon description.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Aside from the My Guide, the tooth brush is basically exactly the same as the 4000.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s nice about it, I suppose, is that the My Guide will visually let you know when you&#x27;ve brushed exactly as long as it wants you to, instead of only relying on the pulses as an indication.</li>
            <li> Real improvement seen at my latest dental appointment after using this twice daily for a few months.</li>
            <li> I alternate between the deep sweep brush head and the precision clean brush head.  </li>
            <li> I saw the Oral-B Deep Clean in a commercial and</li>
            <li> I use the basic, deep clean and</li>
            <li> but we were intrigued by the &amp;#34;Wow&amp;#34; ads so purchased this new Deep Sweep + Smart Guide 5000 toothbrush.</li>
            <li> If, however, this is your first electric tooth brush I would recommend starting in Sensitive mode so that your gums can adjust and not bleed.  </li>
            <li> If, however, this is your first electric tooth brush I would recommend starting in Sensitive mode so that your gums can adjust and not bleed.  </li>
            <li> This is the first issue the Oral-B Professional Deep Sweep solves.  </li>
            <li> The accessory that comes with it is also very useful because it tells you how long you brushed your teeth and when you aren&#x27;t, it tells you the time</li>
            <li> The new brush, being quite large, splashes the whole area with wet toothpaste when in use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That leaves the new brush head, which twists and turns as well as rotating, as the only real difference between the two.  </li>
            <li> (The earlier Sonic Complete would subtly flash every second or more while charging, and then stay lit as a night light.  </li>
            <li> My last checkup was better, much less plaque than before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update this if I get another failure or the brush continues to operate normally for a year or more.</li>
            <li> Of course, you can simply go out and buy a pack of the new brush heads and put them on the older model if you&#x27;d like; both use the exact same stem.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to get over that sound of loose, cheap grinding plastic.  </li>
            <li> There are positive and negative to both design, but with the 5000 (vibrate/ pulsating head) I think Oral-b is equal or better then sonicare brushing design.</li>
            <li> five cleaning modes leave me a little perplexed.  </li>
            <li> , the battery is EXTREMELY GOOD (I&#x27;m getting more than a week out of a single charge and have not let it run out all the way yet), and the crazy wireless sensor thing actually helps me get my brushing done.</li>
            <li> The sonicare Diamond Clean I just bought a week ago and it destroys the competition in my view and I will break down how.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re an adult, though, the Smart Guide likely will just take up wall or counter space.  </li>
            <li> a month into using it twice a day for 3 minutes each brush cycle it started to indicate that i was brushing to hard even when it was touching nothing.</li>
            <li> As I mentioned above, the Smart Guide is more than twice as thick as&lt;br /&gt;an iPhone.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive gum, this product will not damage your gum more: there is sensor preventing you from being too hard when you brush your teeth.</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t like the new bigger one that comes packaged with it, you have other choices that could potentially fill your needs better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s huge and it&#x27;s heavy like a hockey puck.  </li>
            <li> note - where the Sonicare clearly beats this is in having the UV brush head sanitizer.</li>
            <li> note - where the Sonicare clearly beats this is in having the UV brush head sanitizer.</li>
            <li> The brushing action is much stronger (so the &amp;#34;you&#x27;re brushing too hard&amp;#34; indicator is necessary!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear that Oral-B are marketing the 5000 as their&lt;br /&gt;premium product.</li>
            <li> You can read it quite clearly in this&lt;</li>
            <li> It is a big help to time how much time I&#x27;m brushing within each quadrant.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel like I had a professional cleaning every day.</li>
            <li> then the Sonic Complete.  </li>
            <li> The result: there are by far fewer retailers that carry this toothbrush than SoniCare.</li>
            <li> Before this one, i used 3000 series professional one.</li>
            <li> this thing is loud on the lowest setting</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped us do the complete time.</li>
            <li> You can really use the brush to massage your gums where the sonicare brushes simply do it for you and that is that.</li>
            <li> So my teeth always look like they had a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> Loud though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for nearly 3.5 years.  </li>
            <li> We also find ourselves seeing who brushes more frequently, or at least who wears out the brush head faster.  </li>
            <li> The difficulty is the same with a sonicare brush, so this really isn&#x27;t a can that gives the competition and edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m in the bathroom at 5am while everyone else is still in bed, the last thing the rest of the household wants to hear is me brushing.  </li>
            <li> the timer is like a coach encouraging systematic and complete coverage of &amp;#60;all&amp;#62; of your gums and teeth.&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li> I had to replace my Oral-B Sonic Complete electric toothbrush this week after 5 years.  </li>
            <li> Sensitive mode (runs at a slower speed)&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> B008I2IKM2 Oral-B Professional Ortho Brush Kit?</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve gone as far away as 50 feet</li>
            <li> I use an Oral-B professional care 7500 - have been using it for about 5 years and it has worked well.</li>
            <li> Needed a replacement for my old oralB that was lost in action on a buenos aires trip.</li>
            <li> This is my second Oral B electric toothbrush, and I am very pleaased with the results.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why they didn&#x27;t include at least one more brush instead of the travel case.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s all that helpful to have it show you how far you&#x27;ve progressed in quarter increments</li>
            <li> but thought it was some extra bath accessory, thinking I didn&#x27;t really need it.</li>
            <li> Too loud.</li>
            <li> Too loud.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 9yr old so he could keep track of how well he&#x27;s brushing his teeth.</li>
            <li> It tells you if you&#x27;re using too much pressure and there&#x27;s a monitor to tell you when to move from one side to the next.</li>
            <li> Really, it leaves my mouth feeling like I just got back from the dentist.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for the last couple of days, and it really is a gadget lovers dream.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised that the screen doesn&#x27;t come with a stand.  </li>
            <li> It was easier to stop early without a thing to look at, basically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It offers five brushing modes instead of one:  </li>
            <li> I thought it was simply because it wasn&#x27;t completely ready for use.</li>
            <li> Floss Action Precision 5000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush And Refill Brush Head 1 Count]]($109.99)and</li>
            <li> And, if you use the same brushing style every day, like the standard one that I currently use, you&#x27;ll know that at 30 seconds you&#x27;ll be prompted to move on, so you can keep your brushing on track and make sure all your teeth are properly attended</li>
            <li> It feels like a pretty long time.</li>
            <li> bother with the gray fancier version of this - you&#x27;re not missing</li>
            <li> This is as useless as the Kardashians at a physics fair.  </li>
            <li> * if the screen was on the brush we wouldn&#x27;t need the the clock, kind of unnecessary, but I do like looking at it.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been pretty loyal to Oral-B for both electric and conventional toothbrushes for quite a long time.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush, it feels pretty similar (although less intense) to the polishing brush they use at the dentist.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Deep Clean\\&quot; mode only differes from the Daily Clean mode by requiring you to brush for 3 minutes rather than 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Last a good long time even with hard</li>
            <li> The first charge takes about a day for me, and it takes hours and hours for the battery indicator to increase a single bar.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years when I needed to replace a too tired, old one with a new model.  </li>
            <li> cleaning (pulsates and sweeps back and forth) to remove up to 100% more plaque than an ordinary manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, this is not a toothbrush for those who, left to themselves, brush once a day for a minute or so (yes, like I tend to do) out of a sense of obligation and general hygiene, and who don&#x27;t really intend to change.  </li>
            <li> so no black stain yet after 1-2 months of use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The replacement packages for the new-style brush heads say they are only compatible with this particular model, but I put the new-style brush head on my 1000 and 4000 and couldn&#x27;t tell the difference in brushing quality.  </li>
            <li> While the Smart Guide might seem like a gimmick, I find it quite helpful as I tend let my mind drift while I brush my teeth and always forget how long I&#x27;ve been brushing, or what quadrant I&#x27;m supposed to be brushing.  </li>

            <li> Except for the massage mode, it seems like all of the other modes would clean in the same way</li>
            <li> The standard \\&quot;deep sweep\\&quot; heads are ingenious in that they have they tiny little gears which actually BRUSH your teeth (back and forth action, only FAST!!!)</li>
            <li> While I stick to the standard cleaning mode, which is two minutes long, there&#x27;s also a variation of this called \\&quot;deep clean mode.\\</li>
            <li> There is Deep Clean (3 minutes of brushing), Sensitive (slows the brush head down), Whitening</li>
            <li> $20 more than the previous year&#x27;s version unless for some reason you either really like the older base stand or have fallen in love with the new brush head.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush has the features I really wish my old Oral B had - timer I can actually see and notification when the battery is getting low and needs to be re-charged.</li>
            <li> Flexcare Plus Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]&lt;br /&gt;However, even without looking at the panel, I could usually guess which mode it was by the motion and the sound alone.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Sorry Oral B, but for me, Sonicare wins hands down over this one.</li>
            <li> From the cleaning to the look to the Smart Sensor that has removed my need to constantly ask, &#x27;Have you brushed for two minutes?&#x27;</li>
            <li> Therefore, when I was afforded the opportunity to review this Oral-B Deep Sweep, I was fairly certain that nothing could possible match the quality of Sonicare.</li>
            <li> The pressure sensor is useful, but I don&#x27;t always care about the pressure I put on my teeth anyway, since I don&#x27;t think I am too hard on them, but supposedly too much pressure will eat away your enamel eventually, so</li>
            <li> also like the round heads more personally, since I don&#x27;t have a large mouth and the larger head makes it harder to get around</li>
            <li> To sum up, the new Oral B \\&quot;deep sweep\\</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d reward my teen by getting a new electric toothbrush for them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m scaling back my dental hygiene visits from 4 to 2 times per year, thanks to the Deep Sweep.  </li>
            <li> in all, however, neither of us think it&#x27;s worth the extra money spent on it.</li>
            <li> First, the timer lets you know how long to brush and the toothbrush takes care of the proper brushing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Oral B Professional 1000, Professional 4000, and now this, the 5000 Deep Sweep.  </li>
            <li> Instead of intense vibration of the Sonicare, the Oral-B has stationary blue bristles with white bristles that move rapidly oscillate from side to side.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another plus that I can only attribute to this brush and the particular \\&quot;sweep-style\\&quot; brush head that comes with this brush is that my teeth actually feel cleaner than my old Oral B ever did with the twist-style head that it has.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s for my friend&#x27;s gift,and i have not seen it,he don&#x27;t say anything wrong about it,so i think it is good enough</li>
            <li> If you press too hard the brush flashes red, and a red light flashes on the smart meter.  </li>
            <li> so I know it will last just as long as my previous Triumph toothbrush which is over 3 years old but still going strong.</li>
            <li> The flashing LED light of this newer model is more quickly repetitive and irritating</li>
            <li> My teeth feel like I&#x27;ve left the dentist with a professional cleaning!</li>
            <li> In other words, it takes a little more time and effort to use this brush at</li>
            <li> No other way to mount it</li>
            <li> Looks exactly the same, has the same modes, uses the same toothbrush heads, etc.</li>
            <li> very careful not to take out the brush from your mouth when using it, because unlike more basic electric toothbrushes, this has side-to-side movement and you will get wet toothpaste all over you!</li>
            <li> very careful not to take out the brush from your mouth when using it, because unlike more basic electric toothbrushes, this has side-to-side movement and you will get wet toothpaste all over you!</li>
            <li> the smart guide&#x27;s view angle is a bit limited and require proper positioning to view it clearly</li>
            <li> The main differences between the two are that the newer model has a more clearly marked button to switch between the 5 cleaning modes, stops and chimes every thirty seconds instead of simply vibrating, has a green plastic backing instead of a blue one, has a green LED instead of an LCD to show battery charge, and uses the older version of the charging stand with a dimple in the middle instead of the newer ring one.  </li>
            <li> It would have been nice for it to at least come with a stand or with some other non-permanent mounting method like Command Removable Adhesive</li>
            <li> By segmenting your mouth into 4 sections (e.g. outside left, outside right, lower inside and upper inside)</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It feels cheaper, like large hollow plastic.  </li>
            <li> I had to push so hard for that light to go on, I question its usefullness.</li>
            <li> This also has a light that flickers when you are using it too hard.  </li>
            <li> My advice:  go with the whitening or daily clean for regular use, and use the \\&quot;deep clean\\&quot; once every two or three days, or after a long meal or when you feel a bit gross.  </li>

            <li> I mean, it felt like every cell in my head was being agitated with this fine vibration to the point of distraction.  </li>
            <li> The different modes were clearly listed on the handle of the Sonicare - for reference,</li>
            <li> also like that the Braun offers different brush shapes that produce an improved result.  </li>
            <li> Oral-B Professional Deep Sweep +</li>
            <li> The timer is a big help because I found I was no where near the 2 minute brush time.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Oral-B Professional Deep Sweep for 3 weeks now and it helps keep my teeth from being stained.</li>
            <li> accustomed to early on and look forward to the next time.  </li>
            <li> No worries  no regrets.</li>
            <li> It has improved my habits by providing a timer and pressure sensor, and offers 5 different modes, allowing your brushing to be personalized for your needs while still improving your brushing.  </li>
            <li> and the bristles barely move.  </li>
            <li> It is aggressively complete in deep cleaning the mouth.  </li>
            <li> Bought as a replacement for an old Oral-B brush which had finally given up the ghost after ~10 years of use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It only came with one brush, which surprised me at this price-point.</li>
            <li> following the pauses in the brushing action that convey the&lt;br /&gt;same information.</li>
            <li> However, I would caution those who have strictly used manual brushes to begin on sensitive and work your way up to \\&quot;deep clean.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> B00ARTKAPE Oral-B Professional Deep Sweep Replacement Brush Head 4 Count]]$30.21).</li>
            <li> It comes with: Rechargeable toothbrush handle, charging Station with Brush Head Storage, SmartGuide timer, travel Case and 2 refill Heads, a deep sweep and a sensitive.</li>
            <li> I was a tried and true Sonicare user but the heads seemed way too small.  </li>
            <li> Though it is a little louder than other electric toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used, it is much more solid and feels like it cleans</li>
            <li> This new style won&#x27;t suffer that same fate since it can be simply wiped out.</li>
            <li> This new style won&#x27;t suffer that same fate since it can be simply wiped out.</li>
            <li> I like both the indicator that warns of excessive pressure and the Smart Guide countdown, as making certain of proper brushing (time and amount of pressure</li>
            <li> It provides a small, but significant, improvement over the standard brush.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is, all my sonicare brushes have gone easily over 4 years each since it&#x27;s used only a few mins daily and charged daily (keeps the life of the battery</li>
            <li> If you are prone to brushing too hard, this also could be good for you since the LCD screen shows you when you are brushing too hard.  </li>
            <li> If you are prone to brushing too hard, this also could be good for you since the LCD screen shows you when you are brushing too hard.  </li>
            <li> nominal 10 day battery life (which is a little bit lower under field conditions, and there&#x27;s a noticeable difference between a new battery and an older one for both life and strength of brushing) , and a wireless SmartGuide that you&#x27;ll probably throw in a drawer and ignore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also lets you know if you&#x27;re brushing too hard by stopping and having its light turn red.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s powerful but it&#x27;s loud and at least with this brush head</li>
            <li> my opinion the different modes are for the most part unnecessary.</li>
            <li> I pretty much always just use the daily or deep cleaning modes because by the time you toggle the button to all the other modes, you&#x27;ve already wasted half the time for your first quadrant.  </li>
            <li> Unlike brush modes which do absolutely positively nothing different other than change the length of time or the speed, they have different cleaning patterns&lt;br /&gt;-Way</li>
            <li> Also included is the Oral-B Wireless SmartGuide, which provides real-time guidance - its quadrant guides help you brush for the recommended 2 minutes (3 minutes with Deep Clean Mode) and it lights up to tell you when you are brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> The actual toothbrush is a terrific product - it has multiple cleaning \\&quot;modes\\&quot; which include settings for sensitive teeth and even for a gum massage.</li>
            <li> They barely have to scrap any tartar off my teeth since starting to use Oral-B brushes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brush body is sturdy and water-proof and seems to be made of the same or similar material as was my old electric brush above.</li>
            <li> Or with my 3 year old sonicare, push the button again and brush how long you like.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure it is worth the additional money.</li>
            <li> My gums bled the first few times I used it though they don&#x27;t anymore.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Essentially the SmartGuide cues you when to move from quadrant to quadrant while brushing, After 30 seconds, a black bar appears and a star becomes filled in with black to indicate your brushing progress.</li>
            <li> I prefer the smaller Floss Action brushes due to me sensitive teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> , so far I am on the orginal battery, so I don&#x27;t know how long that will last before replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband bought the exact same toothbrush a little cheaper and with four extra brush heads!</li>
            <li> brush is generations ahead of others on the market, and is mid-range priced, though it certainly is an investment if you&#x27;re used to getting the job done with a $3 brush and a little mindfulness and fortitude.  </li>

            <li> It is so loud that it adds to my general impression that Oral B is simply too rough for my tender gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is so loud that it adds to my general impression that Oral B is simply too rough for my tender gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> From there it will enter normal cleaning mode (2-minutes of brushing), but by pressing the mode button you can cycle through the other modes.  </li>
            <li> Instead of the usual small and round brush head, the new product comes packaged with a new bigger brush head that gives it more of a manual toothbrush</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the way they provide feedback on charging because the charge state is far less obvious than on the old brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This item is useful for individuals with gum issues who brush to hard.</li>
            <li> One thing that really made the difference for me is the fact that there is significantly less vibration that other products I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> Now that&#x27;s good news and bad -</li>
            <li> bristles on the newer brush head have different lengths and colors: those at the tip of the head are the longest and are light blue in color, the remaining rows of bristles are either dark blue or white in color, and the white bristles are slightly longer than the dark blue ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> far as I can tell, the frothing is due to the \\&quot;deep sweep\\</li>
            <li> I traveled with it a few weeks ago and it charged fine with just the small unit.  </li>
            <li> I have been using another brand electric toothbrush for the past few years, I liked it although it could be a bit messy.  </li>
            <li> The head which comes with it, when combined with the action of the brush mechanism itself, simulates the back and forth and up and down movement of your hands as if you are using a manual hand-held (non-electrical) toothbrush!</li>
            <li> , I got a digital toilet that warms and self-washes the bowl</li>
            <li> The Smart Guide is a small device (about the size of a deck of playing cards) that counts your brushing time, and shows you which quadrant you should be working on.  </li>
            <li> A little internet research leads me to believe that this is a common problem with these units - the connector between the circuit board and the LCD is quite frail, and easily breaks.</li>
            <li> &quot; setting I found it pretty hard to get used to.  </li>
            <li> It is one of those few items in my life without which I simply cannot live.</li>
            <li> The 4 stars rating is because it a little too load, especially in the quiet of early morning when the rest of the house is asleep.</li>
            <li> Knowing how reliable Braun toothbrushes are, it should last a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Knowing how reliable Braun toothbrushes are, it should last a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the timer which helps you brush long enough.  </li>
            <li> The one question mark i had was whether i really needed the gimmicky remote display/countdown but it does serve its purpose of coercing you to brush for the proper amount of time.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t brush as long as you should, the My Guide&#x27;s display will shame you to the rest of your family members until you brush again next time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The unit also comes with an extra, and in my case unnecessary, \\&quot;SmartGuide\\&quot; with a battery operated interactive display screen to show you with icons how to brush, how mush pressure to apply, spending at 30 seconds on each quadrant of your mouth and for those who need to learn proper oral health care and brushing techniques a smiley face and stars when success (achieving the recommended levels of attention to one&#x27;s teeth) is achieved.</li>
            <li> a removable charge base so the charger can be used on its own; and a brush-head caddy that open completely up.</li>
            <li> a removable charge base so the charger can be used on its own; and a brush-head caddy that open completely up.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried that this new approach to cleaning could affect my gums.</li>
            <li> Further, it breaks the progress down into four sections, two for each jaw (inside and outside of the teeth) and when it hits the 1/4 mark, the brush pauses, beeps one time, and you move from, say the inner lower teeth to the outside of your lower jaw teeth.</li>
            <li> One died within a few months and they sent me a new one.  </li>
            <li> also found that the Sonicare toothbrushes just don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The loudness wasn&#x27;t so bad that it bothered me, but you might be more sensitive to it than me.</li>
            <li> product for less than $50 (but you have to work at it) which is far below the price of competing products .</li>
            <li> my brush developed black gunk inside which started coming out while brushing and after when rinsing the brush head.  </li>
            <li> My previous Oral-B Professional had just that...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Compared to the single brushing mode on the Triaction 1000, the 5000&lt;br /&gt;also includes a \\&quot;deep clean\\&quot; mode which brushes with the same&lt;br /&gt;intensity, but the time intervals are increased to 45s.</li>
            <li> I tested all five modes and had a hard time telling which was which without looking at the \\&quot;Smart</li>
            <li> Since the battery is not easily replaceable, it&#x27;s time for a new toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The new Oral B \\&quot;deep sweep\\&quot; was not too hard to get used to after using the Sonicare--I can see how some Oral B users would have a minor problem using this larger brush but for me it was not a problem.  </li>
            <li> It works very well, what I am not sure is how different it would be to the other inferior models OralB 3000 or 4000...</li>
            <li> If you had any of the older upright brush chargers that also stored the heads in them, you may know the annoyance of how grunged up the brush caddy could get and it was almost impossible to clean.</li>
            <li> If you had any of the older upright brush chargers that also stored the heads in them, you may know the annoyance of how grunged up the brush caddy could get and it was almost impossible to clean.</li>
            <li> It also displays the current mode you are in, and if you are pushing too hard (the toothbrush itself also has a light to indicate that you are pushing too hard).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed lately that the motor just doesn&#x27;t have as much zip as it used to</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the floss action brush head a few times.  </li>
            <li> Should of thrown out my tooth brush out a long time ago.</li>
            <li> It seems to take a long time to charge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They spent all this money on adding a wireless indicator (that still doesn&#x27;t tell you in words which mode you&#x27;re in) and omitted a crucial feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Oral B is a distant 3rd.</li>
            <li> It has some extra buzzer &amp; bells that are really not needed</li>
            <li> + year old one that had trouble charging.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend uses the sensitive setting almost 100% of the time, however, and tells me she seen a 2 shade improvement in just a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> My girlfriend uses the sensitive setting almost 100% of the time, however, and tells me she seen a 2 shade improvement in just a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Instead of spending 10 cents on a quality case, they spend $30 on a remote display that tells you what mode you&#x27;re in and which 30 second period of the 2 min brush cycle you&#x27;re doing.  </li>
            <li> All I can think about is how long before the plastic breaks.</li>
            <li> do not really like the Deep Sweep toothbrush head provided with this unit.</li>
            <li> And there are tiny holes for ventilation, so no moisture will build up when the case is closed.</li>
            <li> He likes the pressure sensor and the timer that is wirelessly connected to the handset showing how long the time has been going.</li>
            <li> It has a timer to help determine how long to brush each section of the mouth.  </li>
            <li> I was looking to upgrade my Sonicare sonic toothbrush that is a few years old.  </li>
            <li> I find that to be a strange oversight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> * after 30 sec this is a short stop.  </li>
            <li> * after 30 sec this is a short stop.  </li>
            <li> Massage mode (the speed oscillates fast to slow to fast)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a fast and a slow speed</li>
            <li> I would have been happier with two - fast and slow.  </li>
            <li> Not very cheap, but definitely cheaper than the sonicare which feels very solid</li>
            <li> It pulsates and \\&quot;sweeps\\&quot; back and forth which is a vastly different sensation than the Oral B Triumph that I previously used.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I ordered some more brush heads since the one that comes with this (and there is just one, not sure why it says there are two) is a little hard.</li>
            <li> The last is probably not a good thing, as the older version was a gunk magnet and required near-constant cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an expensive piece of grooming equipment, but WORTH EVERY CENT!</li>
            <li> so I had to go back to my other toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush reaches areas that traditional toothbrushes or other electrical toothbrushes</li>
            <li> The extra battery life and other brushing modes</li>
            <li> The other improvement I would like to see is a 1 second pause  between quadrants</li>
            <li> I have other Oral B Electric toothbrushes, this is very similar in nature.  </li>
            <li> Initially my gums were sensitive and bled a little; however, by the third day, no more irritation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve spent plenty of money on other electric toothbrushes, and yes, they generally left my teeth</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2T7L4PNWB2JQ7]]I have used an Oral-B Professional electric toothbrush for the past 7 years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;During brushing, the dark blue bristles remain stationary, while the rest produce the sidewise (or up/down, depending on brush orientation)</li>
            <li> As an 89-years old AMATEUR I find it over-powering and noisy.</li>
            <li> &quot; The SmartGuide requires 2-AA batteries (provided) and acts as a visual timer that can be set to count up or count down.</li>
            <li> The second you turn this on the timer begins counting down two minutes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike my older Professional 1000, this Deep Sweep 5000 comes with a travel case, has a smaller charging base, but also a slightly bulkier handler that&#x27;s less comfortable for my small hand.</li>
            <li> At least you have the option to replace the battery rather then buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;negatives&lt;br</li>
            <li> The previous version listed this feature on the box, but it didn&#x27;t actually work while this version has a very clear indicator on the brush if you are pressing too hard.  </li>
            <li> The brush itself is already doing so much work that i don&#x27;t feel the need to press down too hard.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully the battery and the charger unit will last longer than the previous model...</li>
            <li> The newest version of the Braun electronic brush has improved on the previous version by providing a real test for whether you are pressing too hard.  </li>
            <li> If you have used other electric toothbrushes in the past, this is far ahead of them.</li>
            <li> but this 1 is a little different</li>
            <li> brush head itself works well, but is a little larger than what I&#x27;m used to in an electric brush.</li>
            <li> The last one lasted a little over 2 years and was out of warranty.  </li>
            <li> gamification elements such as achievements and since its a wifi product why not scroll news headlines or other such fluff to make the 2 minutes zip by as you stare at the small LCD screen?&lt;br</li>
            <li> out.t&#x27;s loud and at least with this brush head</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it could be a lot smaller without sacrificing usability.</li>
            <li> In fact i owned a Sonicare that i used carefully, tested my teeth for cleanliness, and then tried this Braun.  </li>

            <li> The brush heads are clunky and feel rough in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> The handle beeps when it changes 30 sec intervals.  </li>
            <li> Each one felt too rough on my gums.</li>
            <li> Each one felt too rough on my gums.</li>
            <li> I tested this out myself as I was curious how it works.</li>
            <li> Personally as a long time Oral B electric toothbrush user the large brush feels weird, it feels almost like I&#x27;m using a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush came with the case for the four other brush heads and it was empty.</li>
            <li> course you will say, that&#x27;s why you need the Smart Guide, but with my Sonicare, I never had to put a second, extraneous device on my wall (which, even worse, requires you to support it with batteries, an unnecessary extra expense).</li>
            <li> I bought the Sonicare upon the advice of a dental hygienist and the reviews here and on other sites.  </li>
            <li> As mentioned by other reviewers, this electric toothbrush does it all.</li>
            <li> I just wish the other mistakes hadn&#x27;t been made.</li>
            <li> have not purchased the different types of cleaning heads for this brush yet, but I will in a few days!</li>
            <li> There are also other brush heads like a floss-action head which can help remove lodged food in between your teeth.  </li>
            <li> The other modes are just gimmicks.</li>
            <li> So at first I thought I was either doing something wrong, my electrical outlet didn&#x27;t work, or the toothbrush was defective.</li>
            <li> other thing,</li>
            <li> I also use their floss and other cleaning bristles interchanging (day and night).  </li>
            <li> With this toothbrush I seem to brush longer with the time flying by whereas other toothbrushes I just want to stop under a minute because 2 minutes seemed forever.</li>
            <li> Pulsonic head only moves in small vibration motions, but with the&lt;br /&gt;Triaction 1000, every other row of bristles sweeps rapidly from left&lt;br</li>
            <li> unless they buy one of the other types of brush head to&lt;br /&gt;complement</li>
            <li> /&gt;Further, the brush is paired with the smartguide, a small clock that doubles as a timer and indicator of what brushing style you&#x27;re currently using.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry Oral B, but for me, Sonicare wins hands down over this one.re clearly listed on the handle of the Sonicare - for reference, here the model I have: [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> The only thing that I do not like is the fact that when you use the product it gets a little messy as you are using the brush.</li>
            <li> For something with electronics that are less than 1/10 of&lt;br /&gt;the complexity of an iPhone, there is really no need for it to be this&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is a floss head that I use whenever I eat steak or heavy meals and a regular head for everyday brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But &amp;#34;rotate&amp;#34;, can&#x27;t believe I said that.  </li>
            <li> It is smart but so complicated to install it</li>

            <li> I hold my head down, not level when I&#x27;m brushing my teeth.  </li>

            <li> The name they gave it &amp;#34;DeepSweep&amp;#34; is at the very least not catchy and in my opinion awkward (unlike Philips &amp;#34;SoniCare&amp;#34; that sounds sexy).</li>

            <li> Overall, if you take your brushing seriously and are in the market for an electric toothbrush, here&#x27;s my advice:  </li>
            <li> Also the handle bottom on the sonicare has black stain over the years.  </li>
            <li> Those can be had for less than 1/2 the price of this unit, sometimes much less</li>
            <li> I ordered this unit to replace a less \\&quot;tricked-out\\&quot; Oral-B electric toothbrush that I&#x27;ve used for years.</li>
            <li> It would make a mess on mirror</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it did not work for me due to highly sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> I had hoped for somewhat improved cleaning over and above the performance of my old electric toothbrush but have not found that to be the case - and the replacement brushes are very expensive by comparison.</li>
            <li> little &amp;#34;intense&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> a little whiter and cleaner</li>
            <li> I tried it once and never used it again (since the brush itself does give a little pause when one is supposed to switch to another quadrant.)</li>
            <li> caution that this brush takes a little getting used to.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to the small round heads and the Deep Sweep is significantly larger and feels uncomfortable in my mouth.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised, and requires no special knowledge or unusual (awkward) movements.</li>
            <li> do think the little clock is silly for an adult, but if you have kids, it might be the ticket to get them to brush longer.</li>
            <li> - I had no idea what I was missing.</li>
            <li> When fully charged, the three green lights remain solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The timer/smart guide is a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> i tired the Oral B Deep Sweep 5000.</li>
            <li> Well...it had been a few years since I&#x27;ve seen a dentist.  </li>
            <li> The head must be removed after every bush, rinsed out and air dried.</li>
            <li> ji-normous, heavy display thing.  </li>
            <li> Nobody, nobody is going to use it again after the novelty of using it a few times, again like the</li>
            <li> Not cheap,</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has made me spent at least 2 minutes brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> I got the brush immediately replaced by Amazon and after a few days</li>
            <li> I put it on the charger and the green lights didn&#x27;t immediately start.  </li>
            <li> It works well, but the heads are expensive and it has the notorious old Sonicare problem where gunk builds up inside the unit under the brush head.  </li>
            <li> After using it a few times, I am probably going to just hide it in a drawer somewhere.  </li>
            <li> Beyond that, the LCD screen is sort of overkill and unnecessarily turns brushing your teeth into an entire \\&quot;experience\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It pauses the brush for a few seconds every 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> I saw in the manual you can replace the battery, the reason I switched is the sonicare battery will fade after a few years and won&#x27;t hold a charge or just die.  </li>
            <li> Heavy, scrubbing toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> a few months ago.</li>
            <li> and it is not too heavy</li>
            <li> , after a few months - it is all gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is impossible to explain how much louder this is!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-Pressure warning if you&#x27;re pushing too hard, a lot of people do this and wear down their enamel because toothpaste is abrasive</li>
            <li> In addition&lt;br /&gt;there is a delicate mode which brushes with lower intensity, a&lt;br /&gt;polishing mode where the intensity ramps up and down, and a \\&quot;massage\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;mode, supposedly for your gums, where the intensity ramps up and down,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> Real weak brush action.  </li>
            <li> My problem is that only lasted two weeks before something went wrong and the tooth brush did not hold a charge anymore - it went completely dead.  </li>
            <li> By that I mean the tooth paste and the motion of the brush run down the length of the brush.</li>
            <li> I will report back if the other brush heads are disappointing or if I encounter any problems with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> The brush/without the tracker buzzes after 30 seconds on each quad so not sure why you need the tracker</li>
            <li> The battery life is usually 10 days if you brush twice a day or 20 days if you brush once a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve had in the past did not reach.  </li>
            <li> The case is made of a brittle plastic, so I&#x27;m not sure how well it will hold up in a suitcase compared to the fabric case my Sonicare came with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I was attracted to this feature.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Realistically, very few users will have four brush heads in use</li>
            <li> As it turns out, you need to attach the rectagular plastic compartment to the base first before it will start charging.</li>
            <li> The battery level is divided into three segments, and the battery will last up to 10 days between charges so you can take it on a week long vacation and not have to bring the charging base.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Postscript: I have come to like the wireless indicator, as it shows the brushing time, quadrant, and indicates if you&#x27;re brushing too hard, and serves as a clock when you&#x27;re done brushing.</li>
            <li> Even tells you when you&#x27;re brushing too hard.  </li>
            <li> I like the sensor that tell me if I&#x27;m brushing too hard.  </li>
            <li> 40000 pulsations/minute, 8800 oscillations/minute, a sensor that presumably warns you if you&#x27;re pressing too hard,</li>
            <li> You know when you are pushing too hard.  </li>
            <li> the vibration if you press too hard.</li>
            <li> It also does not allow you to press to hard while brushing.  </li>
            <li> There is a pressure sensor that will stop the brush if you push too hard</li>
            <li> /&gt;Things I have not liked about this product and wish the manufacture would make some changes...</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t give it 5 starts because I found it awkward to choose between the different brushing types.</li>
            <li> The delicate brushing mode may be&lt;br /&gt;useful</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s at least five times louder than a Sonicare and brushes like a 2.99 electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Whitening mode (the speed cycles slow to fast)&lt;br</li>
            <li> but for adults it&#x27;s a bit gimmicky and unnecessary.</li>
            <li> and I mean NOISY.  </li>
            <li> Too bad if you ever move it or it falls off because there is no other way to attach it.  </li>
            <li> Seriously though the power of this thing could have probably shifted the direction of the Titanic.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> I found inside was absolutely appalling.</li>
            <li> This price appalling and a marketing scam.  </li>
            <li> I saw one review where the reviewer stated that in order to charge, the small charging base had to be installed into the larger &amp;#34;base holder&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I plugged it directly into its base, thinking like it works like Sonicare, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The fact that it does not let you brush too hard is a plus!</li>
            <li> and it was or could be quite irritating.</li>
            <li> even worse, let&#x27;s say you find the cleaning mode that works for you.</li>
            <li> My Sonicare came with two chargers - one, a larger UV charging base and a small, travel-size base that I use when I just want it to charge.</li>
            <li> My Sonicare came with two chargers - one, a larger UV charging base and a small, travel-size base that I use when I just want it to charge.</li>
            <li> my hygienist recommended it and it was so expensive</li>
            <li> I was not impressed when comparing it to the sonicare brushes I have owned.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t we hang pictures in our Bathrooms and buy expensive fixtures?</li>
            <li> Yes, this is an expensive electric rechargeable toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with any of the Oral-B toothbrushes</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need all the silly &amp;#34;modes&amp;#34;, the on/off button suits me.</li>
            <li> The shape of the brush also makes it difficult to brush the lower front teeth.</li>
            <li> I cannot envision anyone using this expensive feature</li>
            <li> I must have ordered the wrong model; it must literally be meant for use by &amp;#34;PROFESSIONALS&amp;#34;, i.e.dentists.</li>
            <li> I also used Sonicare for a few days but hated it.  </li>
            <li> I would never purchase this item nor recommend this to anyone mainly due to the outrageous price entrapment it displays .</li>
            <li> Speaking of, the charging base is very small and discreet, but I wish it had a cord wrap of some sort.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s an awkward shape.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a non-symmetrical awkward shape.  </li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this toothbrush and after being unhappy with a sonicare, I thought I might be wasting my money again.  </li>
            <li> but after reading the bad reviews of product not being reliable considering it&#x27;s made in China I&#x27;d figured just to stick with Oral-B electric brushes</li>
            <li> This is something the engineers thought was stupid but marketing thought it was genius.  </li>
            <li> This is annoying.</li>
            <li> The plastic compartment that is attached to the base takes up counter space.</li>
            <li> This is annoying.</li>
            <li> The plastic compartment that is attached to the base takes up counter space.</li>
            <li> Included with the Oral-B is a covered tray that holds 4 brush heads and slips around the charging base.  </li>
            <li> However, the base on the&lt;br /&gt;Smart Guide is tilted so that when it sits on the counter, the LCD&lt;br /&gt;display is angled up at you.</li>
            <li> If you are a Sonicare lover, be prepared for a VERY unpleasant surprise here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> WRONG!!!  </li>
            <li> DISGUSTING AND UNSANITARY!!!  </li>
            <li> STUPID!!!    </li>
            <li> REALLY DISGUSTING AND UNSANITARY!!!</li>
            <li> I got feed up with them and the nasty stain that built up.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a terrible buy.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic.  I&#x27;ve had only about one month. I&#x27;m used to the pause at the end of brushing each quadrant.  I didn&#x27;t mount the clock on the mirror or anywhere else for that matter.  I hold my head down, not level when I&#x27;m brushing my teeth.  So I just lay it on the counter to the left of the sink.  It is a big help to time how much time I&#x27;m brushing within each quadrant.  I&#x27;ve never had a toothbrush this fantastic in my life.  I alternate between the deep sweep brush head and the precision clean brush head.  I&#x27;ve used the floss action brush head a few times.  They are all great for their specific purpose.  Everybody should use this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Love the power!  We used to have another brand that was battery powered and we can tell the difference! Love the timer setting!</li>
            <li> Really love this ... The timer helps so much. Feel so clean after using it</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT! You can switch heads for different focus areas. Definately leaves a clean feeling when using this brush. Should of thrown out my tooth brush out a long time ago.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Professional toothbrush comes with some nice features. Below are some of the pros and cons after trying  this product :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about this product :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Various brushing modes (daily clean, deep clean, sensitive, whitening, massage)&lt;br /&gt;- Smartguide which monitors the brushing cycle and gives us a warning if too much pressure is applied&lt;br /&gt;- a triple zone deepsweep brush head which works well for plaque removal&lt;br /&gt;- strong vibrating action&lt;br /&gt;- availability of a variety of brush heads (not included) for specific applications&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What could be better with this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- the unit is pretty loud and not as easy to manipulate around the hard-to-reach spots&lt;br /&gt;- the smart guide&#x27;s view angle is a bit limited and require proper positioning to view it clearly</li>
            <li> Oral-B&#x27;s &#x27;Deep Sweep Triaction 5000&#x27; Electric toothbrush is a great, premium quality product with a unique feature that distinguishes it from other similar brushes - a small wireless &#x27;Smart Guide&#x27; gadget that serves as a dashboard of sorts to monitor the progress of your toothbrushing session.  This gadget is particularly handy when you&#x27;re toggling between the 5 different brushing modes (eg - &#x27;whitening,&#x27; &#x27;deep clean,&#x27; etc) or just to watch the seconds count down before moving onto the next quadrant.  Overall i do enjoy the sheer novelty that this dashboard provides and would hope that future versions punch up the functionality to include more robust features such as reminders/alerts if your brush hasn&#x27;t been used (a great feature for parents), gamification elements such as achievements and since its a wifi product why not scroll news headlines or other such fluff to make the 2 minutes zip by as you stare at the small LCD screen?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this brush is compatible with Oral-B&#x27;s extensive line of assorted brush heads the &#x27;Deep Sweep&#x27; head (1 unit is included) seems most effective to take full advantage of the triple-action sweep motion the 5000 provides.  Going through a proper 2 minute session (or 3 minutes with the &#x27;Deep Clean&#x27; mode) will leave your mouth refreshed and satisfied and the pulse pause and audible beep every 30 seconds is an idiot-proof nudge to move onto the next quadrant even to the most distracted of brushers.  This unit is great for travel as a full charge is good for 20 brush sessions and also comes included with a stylish, hard plastic carrying case.</li>
            <li> The newest version of the Braun electronic brush has improved on the previous version by providing a real test for whether you are pressing too hard.  The previous version listed this feature on the box, but it didn&#x27;t actually work while this version has a very clear indicator on the brush if you are pressing too hard.  The new brush is also significantly lighter.  I don&#x27;t like the way they provide feedback on charging because the charge state is far less obvious than on the old brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth always come out very clean with this brush which is not something i would say of the Sonicare.  In fact i owned a Sonicare that i used carefully, tested my teeth for cleanliness, and then tried this Braun.  I found the Braun provided a very clear improvement over the Sonicare.  I haven&#x27;t tried the Braun that imitates the Sonicare, but my guess is going to do the same as the Sonicare and won&#x27;t produce as good a result as this, the \\&quot;original\\&quot;, Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that the Braun offers different brush shapes that produce an improved result.  I use the head with the pointy bristles to clean between teeth; its listed as providing cleaning on dentures.  It provides a small, but significant, improvement over the standard brush.  I use it after the \\&quot;standard\\&quot; brush.  The whitening brush is also helpful, but i limit my use to this brush for the same reason that i use Xylitol toothpaste most of the time, and a cleaning paste infrequently, i want to keep my enamel intact more than i want whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> i bought this Oral-B for my wife. She tells me it&#x27;s like going to the dentist. It is so powerful it makes her teeth tingle. She is very happy with it. And so am I.</li>
            <li> Liked it better than sonicare, but was missing an auto shutoff after 2 mins of brushing.  It would make a mess on mirror</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS TOOTHBRUSH, IT MAKES SURE I BRUSH LONGER LOVE THAT.CLEAN TEEETH AND BRIGHT SMILE EACH TIME, NOTHING LIKE IT.</li>
            <li> I works fine. I&#x27;m used to the regular sonic technology in the lighter Oral-B product, but I suppose this one will do the job. I just have to get used to its weight and the way is moves.</li>
            <li> The new brush, being quite large, splashes the whole area with wet toothpaste when in use.  I bought a smaller brush and use that.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot use the wireless system as I have a pace-maker.  There was no warning of this problem before I purchased this item or I doubt that I would have bought it.</li>
            <li> Oral-B Professional Deep Sweep + SmartGuide 5000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush is an interesting product. The actual toothbrush is a terrific product - it has multiple cleaning \\&quot;modes\\&quot; which include settings for sensitive teeth and even for a gum massage. It monitors your cleaning and lets you know if you&#x27;re exerting too much pressure on your teeth by warning you with a red light and sound. And it lets you know when its bristles are getting worn or its battery drained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is accompanied by a \\&quot;SmartGuide,\\&quot; which monitors and times your brushing. As you brush, the guide tells you when you can move to the next \\&quot;quadrant\\&quot; in your mouth with a star and its \\&quot;quadrant circle.\\&quot;  When you finish, you get a smiley face. It&#x27;s not really the type of monitoring and reinforcement that I personally prefer, but it can be helpful for some, and probably is especially handy for children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nice plus, the brush runs for quite some time on one charge, and an overnight charge now and then will keep you going strong.</li>
            <li> First of all, I am a Sonicare user--I did use Oral B about 6-8 years ago and for some forgotten reason went back to a manual toothbrush.  I bought the Sonicare upon the advice of a dental hygienist and the reviews here and on other sites.  The Sonicare does a great job.  I decided to \\&quot;hedge my bets\\&quot; and decided to add this Oral B unit to the arsenal.  Both Oral B and Sonicare do a good job--if both are used properly.  The new Oral B \\&quot;deep sweep\\&quot; was not too hard to get used to after using the Sonicare--I can see how some Oral B users would have a minor problem using this larger brush but for me it was not a problem.  I also tried the Oral B \\&quot;gentle and floss\\&quot; heads--both are the circular type--both o.k. but still prefer the \\&quot;deep sweep\\&quot; head.  The new \\&quot;deep sweep\\&quot; does a good job but the Oral B unit is a bit louder than the Sonicare.  The new \\&quot;deep sweep\\&quot; head is supposed to be better than the Sonicare--I can&#x27;t really tell--both units do a great job--the Oral B unit also \\&quot;vibrates\\&quot; more w/in the mouth--not a problem for me.  I also have a a couple of crowns and a bridge.  I had experienced some irritation around the crowns in the past--not often--but the irritation did happen every few months--even though I thought I was pretty meticulous about keeping them clean with the small periodontal brushes I used. The Sonicare had seemed to alleviate this but it still showed up--once in a while--and it was or could be quite irritating. I decided to add the Oral B \\&quot;pointer brushhead\\&quot;--it is especially designed for crowns/bridgework.  I don&#x27;t use it all the time but usually several times a week(I do brush 2X at least every day)in addition to the \\&quot;normal\\&quot; head I am using on a daily basis.  Since using this \\&quot;pointer head\\&quot; I have not had any irritation around the crowns/bridges--this is about 2 months now. Also, both \\&quot;gels and pastes\\&quot; work well with this unit.  The \\&quot;electronic timer\\&quot; is nice but not always necessary since the brush stops every 30 seconds--however unlike the Sonicare--the unit continues even after the 2 minutes are up--I use this continuation to clean the brushhead under the faucet.  To sum up, the new Oral B \\&quot;deep sweep\\&quot; 5000 is a great unit(BTW, the \\&quot;deep sweep head\\&quot; can also be used on the Oral B 1k, 3K and 4K units)--I will use it AND my Sonicare units to maintain my dental health</li>
            <li> My hygienist complimented me on my clean healthy teeth and gums since using this and water pic.  My teeth feel like I had a professional cleaning every day.</li>
            <li> I have been a SonicCare user for 10 years. Switched to Oral B., and am very impressed. Love it even more than my SonicCare AND more importantly, the replacement heads are affordable.</li>
            <li> I owned the other top brand and this one beats it two to one!</li>
            <li> As mentioned by other reviewers, this electric toothbrush does it all. I am very happy and would buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she likes it. We had the older model so this was an upgrade. The reason for 3 stars instead of 5 is because of the price compared to the charging time. It seems to take a long time to charge.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is just perfect. From the cleaning to the look to the Smart Sensor that has removed my need to constantly ask, &#x27;Have you brushed for two minutes?&#x27; because the clock has already told the kids! I also ordered the generic heads for $7 and change. Love love love...a no brainer when spending a significant amount on the actual toothbrush. Happily the replacement heads look and perform exactly like the included brush head. Two amazing purchases!</li>
            <li> The toothbrush cleaning action is incredible, better than any other toothbrush I&#x27;ve tested (and I have tested many!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Deep Sweep head is so much better than the Floss Action head it&#x27;s incomparable, and it&#x27;s even better than my Sonicare Diamond Clean toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why only three stars?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the designers of this brush dropped the ball in a couple of important ways:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They reduced the size of the display screen on the brush so that you have to guess which mode the brush is in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and even worse, let&#x27;s say you find the cleaning mode that works for you. Does the brush remember the setting so you can use it in the same mode each time, like earlier models did?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope, the neglectful creators of this brush skipped their training in ergonomics and made the brush reset to the standard mode each time you start it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They spent all this money on adding a wireless indicator (that still doesn&#x27;t tell you in words which mode you&#x27;re in) and omitted a crucial feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a shame!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Postscript: I have come to like the wireless indicator, as it shows the brushing time, quadrant, and indicates if you&#x27;re brushing too hard, and serves as a clock when you&#x27;re done brushing. I just wish the other mistakes hadn&#x27;t been made.</li>
            <li> Comparing the Oral-B Professional to the past Oral-B Sonic Complete, the Oral-B Sonic (Complete) brands seems to win without competition from these newer makes and models from Oral-B!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;1) Seems to be able to brush all over the teeth much more so, rather than just glazing over the teeth.  (However, teeth do feel much cleaner after using the Oral-B Sonic Complete brush, completely seemingly nullifying this positive aspect!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;1) Liquids tend to drip and puddle.&lt;br /&gt;2) Feel of the smooth plastic brush seems to condone dripping of liquids.&lt;br /&gt;3) Doesn&#x27;t seem to clean as well as the Oral-B Sonic Complete.&lt;br /&gt;4) Seems more harsh when compared to the Oral-B Sonic Complete lower brushing levels for sensitive teeth and gum areas.&lt;br /&gt;5) Seems more cheaply made, or something of a beta model when comparing to the earlier Oral-B Sonic Complete models.&lt;br /&gt;6) The flashing LED light of this newer model is more quickly repetitive and irritating then the Sonic Complete.  (The earlier Sonic Complete would subtly flash every second or more while charging, and then stay lit as a night light.  However, I prefer using a night light instead of something serving as dual purposes.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There maybe more cons to be listed, but it&#x27;s all I can remember off-hand at this moment.</li>
            <li> This is simply the BEST automatic toothbrush on the market today, period. Here is why:&lt;br /&gt;1) According to independent, scientific medical study it removes 40% more plague than SoniCare (&lt;br /&gt;http://www.dentalcare.com/media/en-US/research_db/pdf/products/8week-eval-benefits-multidirectional.pdf);&lt;br /&gt;2) It does not make an irritating high-pinch ultrasonic sound like SoniCare that many people don&#x27;t like;&lt;br /&gt;3) Unlike oscillating Oral-B toothbrush that requires special technique for brushing, you can use DeepSweep in a same familiar motion as any manual toothbrush;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately Procter &amp; Gamble company that owns Oral-B did a horrible job at marketing it: there are no ads I&#x27;m aware of that promote this wonderful product. The name they gave it &amp;#34;DeepSweep&amp;#34; is at the very least not catchy and in my opinion awkward (unlike Philips &amp;#34;SoniCare&amp;#34; that sounds sexy). The result: there are by far fewer retailers that carry this toothbrush than SoniCare. I believe that by so poorly promoting DeepSweep Procter &amp; Gamble made a huge disfavor to both themselves (as that diminishes their profits) and millions of people who are unaware of how good this product is.</li>
            <li> Everyone should have one!</li>
            <li> I love the digital reminder to brush for 2 minutes.  My teeth definitely feel cleaner with this product.</li>
            <li> Bought for my braces. Works perfectly &amp; keeps my teeth, gums, &amp; braces very clean &amp; healthy. Great product!!!</li>
            <li> I have used Oral-B for quite a few years and this is probably the best toothbrush of the bunch, if only for the reason that you can use pretty much any of the Braun Oral-B heads with this unit.&lt;br /&gt;The battery (so far) is working fine and seems to last quite a while between charges.  I saw one review where the reviewer stated that in order to charge, the small charging base had to be installed into the larger &amp;#34;base holder&amp;#34;.  I traveled with it a few weeks ago and it charged fine with just the small unit.  Hopefully the battery and the charger unit will last longer than the previous model... only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars is that is per the norm with Braun, the batteries in these toothbrushes are not removable and thus not replaceable.</li>
            <li> Strongly urged by my dentist to encourage better dental hygiene.  It is portable with long lasting battery and feels good after brushing.</li>
            <li> Just as good as expected. Though I doubt if 2 min is really enough...</li>
            <li> If I had it to do over again I would get a 1000 model.  I actually had a pretty good system for brushing my teeth with a manual brush where in I felt like I was getting all of my teeth just as clean as with this brush, It must have taken longer though; 30 seconds for each quadrant seems too quick. I don&#x27;t find the coaching beeps particularly useful because left to my own devices without rushing to keep up with the coaching peeps, I actually take the time to do a better job.  I pretty much always just use the daily or deep cleaning modes because by the time you toggle the button to all the other modes, you&#x27;ve already wasted half the time for your first quadrant.  I also don&#x27;t find the pressure sensor particularly useful. I tested by pushing on it with my thumb to make sure it worked, but I have never seen it actually work while brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do generally like using an electric toothbrush, not because it does a better job than a manual  brush, but because it does an equal job a little more quickly. My only regret is spending too much to get all these extra features which I don&#x27;t find useful.</li>
            <li> I had a Oral B electric toothbrush and after 6 yrs or so I wantwd to see what was new.&lt;br /&gt;So I chose the Oral B 5000 deep sweep. and Boy it is Great. My teeth have never felt and looked so clean.  I gums look so much better and I feel the time spent with this brush is well worth the fact of my good dental results. Thank you Oral B.</li>
            <li> This is my second Oral-B tooth brush and I love the just from the dentist feel after brushing. And it is noticeable at the dentist check up and cleaning. They barely have to scrap any tartar off my teeth since starting to use Oral-B brushes. I highly highly highly recommend Oral-B rechargable electric tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt better</li>
            <li> Well made and we like it.</li>
            <li> incredible...my hygienist recommended it and it was so expensive I refused to get one until I found this one: great price PLUS an extra discount&lt;br /&gt;A little &amp;#34;intense&amp;#34; but I hope it lets me get good reviews at the dentist...</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush, love everything about it. Proof is in the better dental appointments, too.</li>
            <li> This is really nice toothbrush. Before this one, i used 3000 series professional one. This is far better than that</li>
            <li> This is my second Oral-B, which the first one is still going strong for 16 months now.  Gave the first to my child.  This one, like the first (4000 model) is giving me a good brushing and my dentist is pleased with the results I&#x27;m getting.  No complaints to the results, however.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I have not liked about this product and wish the manufacture would make some changes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  We don&#x27;t need any fancy bluetooth connectivity at all.  Just a gimmick&lt;br /&gt;2.  Don&#x27;t need the fancy digital read out either.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Please stop with the stop, and go again after 30 seconds.  Just give us a beep at the 30 minute mark to change the area of the brushing.  Simple and less complex I bet.&lt;br /&gt;4.  And if you like the customers, please allow us to replace the battery ourselves to save some cash.  I know, I know, you would like for us to spend more money on your products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I had the same model before this 1 worked great. but this 1 is a little different, dam this thing is loud on the lowest setting it sounds like a locomotive is in my head. literally the first time I used it I brushed for about 10 minutes I head a headache afterword. my girlfriend has the phillips sonic care I wish I would have got that 1.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Even tells you when you&#x27;re brushing too hard.  :)</li>
            <li> Love it, very high-quality, deep-cleaning toothbrush.</li>
            <li> We love it! It&#x27;s helped us do the complete time. Powerful, teeth look great!</li>
            <li> So far I am loving this brush. I have been using an Oral B Vitality and after my last visit to the dentist where things were doing great, I decided to upgrade my brush to, hopefully, make it even better. I can tell the new brush will do just that. It is so powerful and quiet.  I am going to try the pro white brush heads to see if they actually do whiten my teeth. Next dentist visit will tell.  I also thought the smart guide was probably something I wouldn&#x27;t use!  WRONG!!!  I love it.  When not timing my brushing it is a clock.  Love having a clock in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> like going to the dentist twice daily&lt;br /&gt;good built, nice timer adequate power&lt;br /&gt;battery life is awesome, last you like a week on daily use&lt;br /&gt;nice carrying case</li>
            <li> excellent product and good price. I could never bruch my teeth as clean as this does.</li>
            <li> Very Happy with the Oral-B tooth brush.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush comes with a flossing and regular brush head which are great for switching between day and night. The accessory that comes with it is also very useful because it tells you how long you brushed your teeth and when you aren&#x27;t, it tells you the time so you know how much more time you have left to get ready. Once you get this brush, you would not want to go back to something worse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just don&#x27;t like it when it pauses every 30 seconds to tell you to switch sides. You really don&#x27;t need to brush for 2 minutes with this brush and can get the job done in 1.5 mins or even 1 minute if it&#x27;s at night.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Love it</li>
            <li> This is great tool....leaves your teeth and mouth s clean has greatly improved my teeth and gums...&lt;br /&gt;has improved health of my mouth...</li>
            <li> For years and years now I have shyed away from electric toothbrushes because I assumed that they were all like the original Sonicare.  The Sonicare approach was to buzz and vibrate your mouth, teeth, and entire head until it felt like torture.  I mean, it felt like every cell in my head was being agitated with this fine vibration to the point of distraction.  The vibration was so strong it made my head \\&quot;itch\\&quot;, LOL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FINALLY there is a well made electric toothbrush that cleans your teeth and mouth with the good old traditional brushing action.  The standard \\&quot;deep sweep\\&quot; heads are ingenious in that they have they tiny little gears which actually BRUSH your teeth (back and forth action, only FAST!!!) instead of buzzing and vibrating them.  And it brushes and cleans my teeth better that I eve could, and MUCH faster too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an expensive piece of grooming equipment, but WORTH EVERY CENT!</li>
            <li> The Oral-B  Professional Deep Sweep is amazing! I had an older model and didn&#x27;t really need a new one, but decided to splurge.&lt;br /&gt;So glad I did - I had no idea what I was missing. And the smiley face timer is great...I definitely recommend this product. You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> ..I was surprised and delighted at how easy it is to use, especially with that smart little guide to time me.  No break-in, it was great from the start.</li>
            <li> Dentist recommended this and it works just fine.  Like the beep every 30 seconds so I can be sure to brush for a full 2 minutes.  A full charge lasts over 7 days of brushing twice a day for 2 minutes (4 minutes daily), so I don&#x27;t have to carry the charger when I travel. It has a clock that gives you a smiley face and helps you track time, but I threw it away, the beeps are enough for me.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for the Braun/Oral B 3D I had since 2002! The rechargeable battery in that is still working but the unit is slowing down, so it  was time for a &amp;#34;high-tech&amp;#34; replacement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush body is sturdy and water-proof and seems to be made of the same or similar material as was my old electric brush above. But the diameter is larger. The battery indicator has three levels. Each is one more green light on the front. when the brush is charging, you see one light blinking, then two, then finally three blinking lights as it completes the final 1/3 of the charge. When fully charged, the three green lights remain solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The button with the arrow facing down below the power button is the cleaning mode selector and can cycle through 5 cleaning modes. But it is the brush head and the wonderful Smart Guide that made this brush a cleaning guru for me! The smart guide has four 1/4 circles on it, each representing a section or &amp;#34;quadrant&amp;#34; of your mouth: Top right, bottom right, bottom left, top left, in that order. You watch the quarter circles blink and watch the time as your brush that portion of your mouth indicated by the flashing quadrant. This ensures that you give equal amounts of time to each section of your mouth, 1/4 at a time. The time for each mouth quadrant (or section) varies from 30 seconds for standard clean mode, to 45 seconds for professional or intensive clean mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not purchased the different types of cleaning heads for this brush yet, but I will in a few days! The head which comes with it, when combined with the action of the brush mechanism itself, simulates the back and forth and up and down movement of your hands as if you are using a manual hand-held (non-electrical) toothbrush! It&#x27;s what makes this beauty clean like a marvel! My mouth feels perfectly clean. There are also other brush heads like a floss-action head which can help remove lodged food in between your teeth.  And a very useful bonus is that the wall-mountable smart guide has a clock on it, so you know the time of day for those of us who are in a rush when using the bathroom! :)))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be very careful not to take out the brush from your mouth when using it, because unlike more basic electric toothbrushes, this has side-to-side movement and you will get wet toothpaste all over you! But this is standard brushing technique for anyone who is used to using an electric brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this beauty. Knowing how reliable Braun toothbrushes are, it should last a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I did not purchase this from Amazon because it was unavailable at Amazon Canada at the time. I got it from Walmart.ul bonus is that the wall-mountable smart guide has a clock on it, so you know the time of day for those of us who are in a rush when using the bathroom! :)))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be very careful not to take out the brush from your mouth when using it, because unlike more basic electric toothbrushes, this has side-to-side movement and you will get wet toothpaste all over you!

            <li> This is a great electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Love how clean my teeth get after brushing them.  It makes our teeth appear whiter too.</li>
            <li> I have one of these toothbrush sets; I love it!!!  It&#x27;s easy to use. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of space on my dresser. But best of all, it massages the gums and cleans your teeth exceptionally well!  I like the flossing heads the  best.&lt;br /&gt;  I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> Put off buying a new electric toothbrush because Roto-router (?) quality was deemed not as good as the first one I bought and the 2nd electric toothbrush (forgotten the brand) wasn&#x27;t as good as the Roro-router . . .&lt;br /&gt;Loma Linda University Dental School student recommended Oral-B.&lt;br /&gt;Pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;I keep it in the car because I brush my teeth longer on the way to where ever than I do standing at the sink.&lt;br /&gt;The charge lasts forever!</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush!  I have been using another brand electric toothbrush for the past few years, I liked it although it could be a bit messy.  This toothbrush is really great, it has prompts to fine tune your brushing and it makes my teeth feel so clean!  I am very impressed with the performance of this toothbrush and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> high quality, high -tech</li>
            <li> Years ago, my dentist recommended the Braun Oral B so I bought one. That one lasted over 10 years! This is the one I bought to replace it. I prefer the smaller Floss Action brushes due to me sensitive teeth and gums. I love the brush, but I wish I could have done without the expense of the smiley face timer. That would be a nice item to buy separately if you have children. Over all I am very satisfied and so is my dentist!</li>
            <li> Oh so clean. My teeth feel so clean.  I like the sensor that tell me if I&#x27;m brushing too hard.  The one disadvantage is the 2 minute timer is not part of the teeth brush.  The timer is a separate piece which is not very user friendly.</li>
            <li> I received my toothbrush a week ago, and was quite impressed by the many functions, especially as they helped reinforce good brushing habits in my 7-year old daughter. We were VERY happy with our purchase, until the display dropped from her hand onto the sink counter, a distance of maybe 1-2 feet. Since then, the display has been blank. A little internet research leads me to believe that this is a common problem with these units - the connector between the circuit board and the LCD is quite frail, and easily breaks. I took a look to see if I could open it up to reconnect it without any luck - the case is sealed, not screwed. Called customer support - they closed at 6pm Eastern. I guess I&#x27;ll see what they have to say tomorrow when they get back in the office.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush works great.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and they enjoy it twice a day! The bells and whistles with this toothbrush are to rave for.  My husbands cracks me up telling me about the features-LOL!  I&#x27;m almost moved to purchase one, but then again, my $7.99 Oral-B does a good job too-giggles...</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic toothbrush.  My teeth are so clean and white by the time I&#x27;m done brushing that I know even my dentist will see a difference.</li>
            <li> Defiantly seeing improvement in condition of son&#x27;s teeth and gums with this product. Love how it works so well dispite his braces. Packaging and delivery well surpassed my expectations as well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s for my friend&#x27;s gift,and i have not seen it,he don&#x27;t say anything wrong about it,so i think it is good enough</li>
            <li> I like it,Charge 24 hours，three times a day, with five days，i hope the battery would last longer</li>
            <li> great recommendation everyone should get one.</li>
            <li> No complaints here. Love the timer and that it stops at 30 second intervals to let you know how long you&#x27;ve been brushing. Also lets you know if you&#x27;re brushing too hard by stopping and having its light turn red.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare for years, and this gets my teeth cleaner! It makes more noise, but I am very happy with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. The timer keeps you brushing for the proper amount of time. I like the fact that you can use the deep sweep head as well as many of the other Oral B heads.</li>
            <li> Real improvement seen at my latest dental appointment after using this twice daily for a few months.</li>
            <li> It works exactly as advertized, a rarity in todays world.&lt;br /&gt; I realy like the fact that i can brush twice a day for a week before recharging.</li>
            <li> Works very well! I can charge it for the full charge and it last alnost 2 weeks without charging. Love that you can chage the speed of how you can  change the type of cleaning</li>
            <li> This is a great product. The only reason it does not get 5 stars is because the tray/stand that holds the brushes and unit gets kinds of slimy and has to be cleaned every couple of days.</li>
            <li> The BEST electric toothbrush I have ever had !!  This really cleans your teeth and in between your teeth too!  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> The toothbrush was beyond my expections</li>
            <li> It works very well, what I am not sure is how different it would be to the other inferior models OralB 3000 or 4000... Years ago I had a very cheap one which I dont remember the model, but it overall was not that different. Not sure it is worth the additional money.</li>
            <li> I had the toothbrush before, so I knew it really worked. It did everything as advertised.  The timer/smart guide is a waste of money.  I wish I had bought the cheaper model.</li>
            <li> Even my girlfriend who is OCD about her brushing likes it!</li>
            <li> Wish I could have had the tooth brush growing up. I would have saved thousands at the Dentist office. Fanastic performance!</li>
            <li> We got this to replace a major competetor brand that died in under a year and cost a TON more.  My husband LOVES this so much more than the one he had.  He said that he feels like he&#x27;s just left the dentist after each use.  We have had it a couple of months now and have no complaints at all.  HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is smart but so complicated to install it</li>
            <li> Would not go back to regular tooth brush, my teeth feel super clean. I have been using this for 5 months and have no complaints at all.</li>
            <li> Deep Sweep combines the familiar brushing motion of a manual toothbrush with triple-action, deep cleaning technology.&lt;br /&gt;3D cleaning (pulsates and sweeps back and forth) to remove up to 100% more plaque than an ordinary manual toothbrush. This product has helped me and works well.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has more power than my old battery operated one. I love the sweeping brush as it gets around and in between teeth better than a regular brush. The timer is a big help because I found I was no where near the 2 minute brush time. My last checkup was better, much less plaque than before.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel very clean, almost like a polish from the dentist</li>
            <li> I think Oral-B toothbrushes are great!  They last years and pay for themselves.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as the Sonicare.  The brush heads are clunky and feel rough in your mouth.  No idea why my hygienist recommended this thing; I junked it after 6 months.</li>
            <li> I was a tried and true Sonicare user but the heads seemed way too small.  Also i suffer a bit from OCD - this brush is great and now I&#x27;ve got a clean mouth in about 2 minutes.  The LCD guide doubles as a clock in my bathroom.  Use paste not gel or you will find yourself less than satisfied as the paste will not spray as much.</li>
            <li> I am comparing this toothbrush to Sonicare brushes I have owned and do own .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned Sonicare toothbrushes since they have come out and I have always been a fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed a new toothbrush and after what must have been too much research i tired the Oral B Deep Sweep 5000. I was not impressed when comparing it to the sonicare brushes I have owned. I then bought a Sonicare Elite and was happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to see that different things are important to different people when buying anything and that includes the toothbrush. The timing beep for instance is something people want which I personally do not care about. Others are supremely bothered by the beep. The bottom line for me is cleaning. The sonicare Diamond Clean I just bought a week ago and it destroys the competition in my view and I will break down how.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Cleaning. Against this brush both Sonicare brushes win by a mile. This brush is good but the Sonicare are better than they used to be but i have compared the DiamondClean against the Elite and it is even better. People are writing that it does not matter which sonicare you use but I say it does. I tried them several days in a row against each other and the cleaning mode of the DiamondClean Limited is the best brush - period. The Sonicare Elite is a close second and maybe it is the brush heads or the feel but it is a great toothbrush yes, but the DiamondClean is better. The Oral B is a distant 3rd. The Oral B is way better than a manual brush but no way can it give you the feel of the Sonicare lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Design The Sonicare Diamond Clean takes it. Don&#x27;t we hang pictures in our Bathrooms and buy expensive fixtures? It looks way better than the other 2 on the counter. It is worth the extra money just in style. but here is the kicker. With the charger design, you can actually scrub it clean to new looking. The Sonicare Elite and the Oral B, you cannot. The feel of the Oral B and The Sonicare Elite are neck and neck but the feel of the DiamondClean is like you are holding a light precision instrument.  This brush feels good and solid but it lacks the ease of use of the competition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only place where I feel that the Oral B has the advantage is in gum massaging. You can really use the brush to massage your gums where the sonicare brushes simply do it for you and that is that. they clean but do not massage the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beep - if you care, all 3 brushes have a pause and the only one that beeps is the Elite. I do not care at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - If I did not buy the sonicare then this brush would surely have a higher rating from me but since I can compare it against the Sonicare, I would not spend the money here again,  Please - go look up the black Sonicare and buy it. It is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, if I did not know how good the other was, then I would buy this brush again but now that I know - no way would i spend the money here.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel like I&#x27;ve left the dentist with a professional cleaning! The brush/without the tracker buzzes after 30 seconds on each quad so not sure why you need the tracker but it makes a decent looking clock. Wish they had added a texture on handle ca</li>
            <li> Very good except the 110 volts adapter not good if you travel outside US also the battery have a very short life, now mine need to be charged every 2 days and we are only 2 to use it.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Oral-B Professional Deep Sweep for 3 weeks now and it helps keep my teeth from being stained. So my teeth always look like they had a professional cleaning. The only thing that I do not like is the fact that when you use the product it gets a little messy as you are using the brush. By that I mean the tooth paste and the motion of the brush run down the length of the brush. Otherwise, I would recommend it .</li>
            <li> Have needed a new electronic toothbrush for sometime and I like this one.</li>
            <li> This has several settings &amp; it easily syncs with the clock.  Storage container is excellent.</li>
            <li> Superior product. Love it!  Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Works well.  Loud though. Mechanical and sonic action gets your teeth clean.  Bluetooth thingamabob, I think, is a scam to allow company to charge more than they really need to.  Just another piece of clutter.</li>
            <li> Great product. Clean teeth and healthy gums.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush. I had the triumph but the battery ran out. This toothbrush has the features I really wish my old Oral B had - timer I can actually see and notification when the battery is getting low and needs to be re-charged.</li>
            <li> Just had a couple of K ($$) worth of dental work done.  Well...it had been a few years since I&#x27;ve seen a dentist.  Thought I&#x27;d reward my teen by getting a new electric toothbrush for them.  It has some extra buzzer &amp; bells that are really not needed but sure are fun.  The \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; setting and Pressure Sensor are especially nice on my receded and healing gums.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the Oral B it is much better than my 7 + year old one that had trouble charging. Would recommend it also Amazon had all the items to select from not like most stores.</li>
            <li> My Sonicare toothbrush was not doing the best job,especially on plaque. The Oral-B  was another wonder with a selection of brush&#x27;s and brushing pressure. Does an excellent job on plaque and has terrific feed back on time brushing and brushing pressure.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great toothbrush for some people but unfortunately it did not work for me due to highly sensitive gums. so I had to go back to my other toothbrush.</li>
            <li> OMG! LOVE the automatic sensor!! Feel like I just came from the dentist every time I brush!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for nearly 3.5 years.  My favorite part of the tooth brush is the smart guide. It teaches me how much force to put against my teeth while brushing. I also enjoy how you can have two brush heads with different rings.  This way my girlfriend and I share the same device, but use different brush heads. It saves on a toothbrush, which is great.  We also find ourselves seeing who brushes more frequently, or at least who wears out the brush head faster.  Yes, it&#x27;s good to replace the brush heads regularly.  The only item that required fixing/replacing was the battery.  This was not an easy task.  If you don&#x27;t have the proper tools there&#x27;s a good chance that you can break the device.  The difficulty is the same with a sonicare brush, so this really isn&#x27;t a can that gives the competition and edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to this I owned a Sonicare device, but the wireless charger broke.  I can&#x27;t judge which of the two is better.  They both have their pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For sure, I can see myself keeping this tooth brush for another 3-4 years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t give it 5 starts because I found it awkward to choose between the different brushing types. But again, this problem is the same for Sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Simply the best toothbrush on the market. Replaces my one from 6 years ago. Even better now.</li>
            <li> This item is useful for individuals with gum issues who brush to hard. The sensitive light indicator is an awesome feature. Now, I have better awareness and control of my brushing technique.</li>
            <li> Not only do my teeth feel like I just came from a cleaning at the dentist but the timer has prodded me to change my brushing habits to the full 2 minute session.  What could be better?</li>
            <li> LOOKS GOOD, WORKS GREAT.  TIMED BRUSHING WITH QUADRANT CONTROL AND SMILEY FACE ADD NICE TOUCH.  PARTICULARLY LIKE 5 SPEED CONTROL</li>
            <li> Was thinking for the price another brush option would have been included</li>
            <li> This is one of the items you need to have in your home. Excellent product for an affordable price</li>
            <li> Very nice toothbrush.  My dental hygienist gave me a good report.  I like the timer which helps you brush long enough.  The replacement brush heads are easy to find at Wal-Mart and I used a coupon from the newspaper.</li>
            <li> I had an Oral B electric toothbrush before but it was needing to be&lt;br /&gt;replaced. I loved this one from the start. It has 4 modes to choose from&lt;br /&gt;and I feel like I have just been to the dentist every time I use it. It leaves my&lt;br /&gt;mouth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> SIX MINUTES DELIGHT (well, maybe not total delight) and your teeth, gums, tongue and mouth roof are sparkling clean.  No joke, this product really works that well.  Multiple speeds, several different formats, a product you get accustomed to early on and look forward to the next time.  After I discarded several of the space-consuming things such as the large retainer stand that holds multiple brush-heads, it fit nicely on the counter top taking up almost no space.  With all the discount coupons available, and sometimes a &#x27;special&#x27; sale, you can get this $129 +/- product for less than $50 (but you have to work at it) which is far below the price of competing products . . . and far superior to those competitors.  I&#x27;m scaling back my dental hygiene visits from 4 to 2 times per year, thanks to the Deep Sweep.  Buy the product, you&#x27;ll be glad you did and show it with shiny brilliant teeth.</li>
            <li> Love it; far more than the high end Phillips sonic I had previously.</li>
            <li> This replaces a Sonic which I had for almost ten years with no complaints. I bought it from my dentist and it included a rebate offer.  1) When I&#x27;m in the bathroom at 5am while everyone else is still in bed, the last thing the rest of the household wants to hear is me brushing.  TOO NOISY!!!  2) I have to hit the on switch three time to cycle through to get to my \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; preference....BEFORE I apply toothpaste otherwise the toothpaste gets flung everywhere.  TOO MUCH WORK!!!  3) The brush head has internal moving parts which harbor moisture that gets inside. The head must be removed after every bush, rinsed out and air dried. Even in doing so my brush developed black gunk inside which started coming out while brushing and after when rinsing the brush head.  DISGUSTING AND UNSANITARY!!!  4) The \\&quot;Smart\\&quot; brush will not turn itself off after cycling through my two minute brushing. It will just keep going until you turn it off manually, when it&#x27;s still in your mouth of course so the toothpaste doesn&#x27;t get flung all over the mirror. For a \\&quot;Smart\\&quot; brush, that&#x27;s pretty... STUPID!!!    5) After retiring the first brush head, to investigate further my concern for it harboring moisture, I broke it apart with a hammer. The gunk and slime I found inside was absolutely appalling. Trust me, this is nothing you want to be placing in your mouth!!! REALLY DISGUSTING AND UNSANITARY!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best power toothbrush I have ever owned.  It is way better than Sonicare.  My teeth feel like I just had them cleaned.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush! It pauses and beeps every 30 seconds to remind you to change areas. Also has a sensor that alerts you if you&#x27;re using too much pressure.</li>
            <li> This was my first  time using electric  toothbrush  but if you&#x27;re going to  buy  get the best. It&#x27;s  awesome  I love it  and I  don&#x27;t say that much does  it  does  a  superior job at cleaning  and  I highly recommend it . It makes your teeth  feel polished and clean  don&#x27;t wait buy now. No worries  no regrets.</li>
            <li> Great feels like a dental professional clean up</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is like cleaning your teeth with the finger of a hygienist. Seriously though the power of this thing could have probably shifted the direction of the Titanic. The battery life is better than that of my car. This really is the Ferrari of toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift. Individual receiving the gift is very pleased with the gift</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush. My mouth really feels clean and fresh. Would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> Last a good long time even with hard</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. especially the smiley face... the battery life is awesome. my mouth never felt any cleaner.</li>
            <li> This price appalling and a marketing scam.  Highly degenerate to the companies image and reputation.  Which ever employee posted this add should be fired and shunned in the ORAL-B community. I would never purchase this item nor recommend this to anyone mainly due to the outrageous price entrapment it displays . #oral-b</li>
            <li> We have had an Oral B toothbrush for years but we were intrigued by the &amp;#34;Wow&amp;#34; ads so purchased this new Deep Sweep + Smart Guide 5000 toothbrush. It really does make a difference and my mouth has never felt cleaner. I am really glad we purchased this new one. Love it!</li>
            <li> Short form of the Review :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent electric toothbrush with unique features.  It has improved my habits by providing a timer and pressure sensor, and offers 5 different modes, allowing your brushing to be personalized for your needs while still improving your brushing.  The sensitive and deep clean options are especially useful.  What really makes this product unique in my experience, however, is the fact that it moves in all three dimensions, which makes a noticable difference in cleaning spots that a normal brush might easily miss.  It also allows different types of brush heads to be used, again for a tailored experience. To keep this brush in the upper mid range, Oral-B has left out some good features such as automatic santization and an improved charging station.  But within its market, this brush is an excellent product that I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long Form Review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve spent plenty of money on other electric toothbrushes, and yes, they generally left my teeth a little whiter and cleaner feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is something new, and even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, this is not a toothbrush for those who, left to themselves, brush once a day for a minute or so (yes, like I tend to do) out of a sense of obligation and general hygiene, and who don&#x27;t really intend to change.  This is targeted for those who are really devoted to a brighter smile and cleaner feeling, and are willing to work for it.  In other words, it takes a little more time and effort to use this brush at its full potential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean this in a good way. This product is like a coach/toothbrush hybrid.  For those with slack tendencies (ahem...me), its timer helps improve habits by making us more mindful of the time we&#x27;ve spent brushing.  It doesn&#x27;t allow us to rush.  It also monitors the pressure you exert during brushing, and lets you know how it feels about your exertions or lack thereof.  Our rushed lifestyles harm our health in many ways, but they especially prevent us from caring for our mouths.  This brush helps correct this tendency.  A toothbrush that helps you make lifestyle health changes?  Sweet...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, it allows you to choose between 5 settings, the most I&#x27;ve ever had in an electric brush.  My advice:  go with the whitening or daily clean for regular use, and use the \\&quot;deep clean\\&quot; once every two or three days, or after a long meal or when you feel a bit gross.  My girlfriend uses the sensitive setting almost 100% of the time, however, and tells me she seen a 2 shade improvement in just a few weeks.  I told her I hadn&#x27;t noticed because her teeth were beautiful and perfect before, which earned me a smooch, but the point is that it will improve your smile no matter the setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m no engineer, but even I can tell this brush attacks plaque in three dimensions - vertical, horizontal, and axial (pushing into the teeth and the gaps between them).  You can feel the work being done in all three planes/directions.  Especially with the sweeping motion, it reaches more tooth than we naturally cover on our own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is generations ahead of others on the market, and is mid-range priced, though it certainly is an investment if you&#x27;re used to getting the job done with a $3 brush and a little mindfulness and fortitude.  Since its a new product, I can&#x27;t speak to its durability, but it feels very solidly constructed, for what that&#x27;s worth.  Overall, if you take your brushing seriously and are in the market for an electric toothbrush, here&#x27;s my advice:  buy this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were to suggest improvements, I&#x27;d love a better charger and automatic UV sanitization.  Also, the controls aren&#x27;t 100% intuitive for we of the iPhone generation, though they can certainly be mastered with 5 minutes of work.  But this product leaves my mouth cleaner and whiter than the electric brushes I&#x27;ve had, and that&#x27;s what my recommendation comes down to, in the end.but they especially prevent us from caring for our mouths.

            <li> I&#x27;ve had three Sonicare over 8 years, currently 2 being used daily in our house.  I&#x27;ve always wanted to try the Oral-B but never did.  My fiance and I have used this for a couple days and ended up drawing the same conclusions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;-Ability to use different style of brush heads.  This is by far the best part of the toothbrush.  As you can see, you can pick from multiple heads.  Unlike brush modes which do absolutely positively nothing different other than change the length of time or the speed, they have different cleaning patterns&lt;br /&gt;-Way the brush heads attach is much better than the sonicare, it feels more secure&lt;br /&gt;-Pressure warning if you&#x27;re pushing too hard, a lot of people do this and wear down their enamel because toothpaste is abrasive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s noisy and I mean NOISY.  The reason why is clearly the internal gears are all plastic on plastic and they are not very tight fitting.  It is creating a loud resonating sound of cheap plastic clanging against each other.  The sonicare sounds like a high end tool with its vibrating hum, the Oral-B sounds like those cheap $5 AA powered toothbrushes you pick up in the impulse section of Wally-world.  In fact...it uses standard rechargeable batteries you can swap out unlike the sonicare.  The only thing is, all my sonicare brushes have gone easily over 4 years each since it&#x27;s used only a few mins daily and charged daily (keeps the life of the battery good)&lt;br /&gt;-It feels cheaper, like large hollow plastic.  Not very cheap, but definitely cheaper than the sonicare which feels very solid&lt;br /&gt;-Carry case, came warped and didn&#x27;t lock.  Granted you don&#x27;t need a luxury case but geez, for 10 cents more, they could make it a little better.  Given this toothbrush costs over a hundred smackers for a brush, make it a decent case.  I can get a better case at the dollar store...for wanna guess?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Useless:&lt;br /&gt;-Brush modes.  Deep clean mode...extends time by 30 seconds.  Inthe old days, you call it brush your teeth for a few seconds more.  Or with my 3 year old sonicare, push the button again and brush how long you like.&lt;br /&gt;-That ji-normous, heavy display thing.  Instead of spending 10 cents on a quality case, they spend $30 on a remote display that tells you what mode you&#x27;re in and which 30 second period of the 2 min brush cycle you&#x27;re doing.  I love gadgets, I got a digital toilet that warms and self-washes the bowl but this is pointless and a waste of what could of been put into the actual toothbrush and case.  There is no stand and it&#x27;s an awkward shape.  It&#x27;s meant to stick to your wall or mirror with tape they include.  Too bad if you ever move it or it falls off because there is no other way to attach it.  No other way to mount it so currently it&#x27;s just adding more useless clutter to the vanity.  There is no stand.  It&#x27;s huge and it&#x27;s heavy like a hockey puck.  It&#x27;s a non-symmetrical awkward shape.  It&#x27;s not needed, you can do everything exactly the same without it.  The handle beeps when it changes 30 sec intervals.  Huge red lights light up on the handle if you push too hard, so what is it for?  So they can advertise it comes with a LCD display.  This is something the engineers thought was stupid but marketing thought it was genius.  It&#x27;s more useful as a self-defense weapon if anyone ever invades my bathroom.  This is as useless as the Kardashians at a physics fair.  Nobody, nobody is going to use it again after the novelty of using it a few times, again like the, well you get the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual cleaning:&lt;br /&gt;-Sonicare feels more like a professional clean, this feels more like a soft scrub.  I like aspects of both really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final verdict...I was going to give this 3 stars but gave it four because of the exchangeable brush heads.  I want to try all the different ones but I am sticking with my sonicare as I see it as the more precision, high quality cleaning tool.  It&#x27;s hard for me to get over that sound of loose, cheap grinding plastic.  All I can think about is how long before the plastic breaks.</li>
            <li> works VERY well.  the timer is like a coach encouraging systematic and complete coverage of &amp;#60;all&amp;#62; of your gums and teeth.&lt;br /&gt;the fancy brush head works well too.</li>
            <li> I had to replace my Oral-B Sonic Complete electric toothbrush this week after 5 years.  I saw the Oral-B Deep Clean in a commercial and everything they say about it is true.  I didn&#x27;t know my old Oral-B was out of date until I tried the Deep Clean.  I can feel the difference after the first brushing.  The Deep Clean has 5 modes and can take up to 6 different tooth brush heads that help you on your way to healthy gums.  I hope to keep this one for 5 years as well.</li>
            <li> I had a Sonic Care toothbrush and decided to give this a shot after reading the study that showed it did a better job of removing plaque. I really like this toothbrush, it feels pretty similar (although less intense) to the polishing brush they use at the dentist. The different modes are also nice (and differ from each other significantly). 100% recommended.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2T7L4PNWB2JQ7]]I have used an Oral-B Professional electric toothbrush for the past 7 years. I&#x27;ve noticed lately that the motor just doesn&#x27;t have as much zip as it used to and I attribute that to a worn out battery. Since the battery is not easily replaceable, it&#x27;s time for a new toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new Oral-B Triaction 5000 has  5 modes of operation. Each mode uses a slightly different motor speed/variation.  All modes are supposed to be run for 2 mintes which gives you 30 seconds to brush each \\&quot;quadrant\\&quot; of your mouth. The \\&quot;Deep Clean\\&quot; mode only differes from the Daily Clean mode by requiring you to brush for 3 minutes rather than 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the 5 modes:&lt;br /&gt;1. Daily Clean mode&lt;br /&gt;2. Deep Clean mode&lt;br /&gt;3. Sensitive mode (runs at a slower speed)&lt;br /&gt;4. Whitening mode (the speed cycles slow to fast)&lt;br /&gt;5. Massage mode (the speed oscillates fast to slow to fast)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion the different modes are for the most part unnecessary. I believe all you really need is a fast and a slower speed. The other modes are just gimmicks. My previous Oral-B Professional had just that... a fast and a slow speed and it&#x27;s perfectly adequate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush also comes with a large and clunky \\&quot;SmartGuide.\\&quot; The SmartGuide requires 2-AA batteries (provided) and acts as a visual timer that can be set to count up or count down. It also indicates which of the 5 modes your toothbrush is set to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essentially the SmartGuide cues you when to move from quadrant to quadrant while brushing, After 30 seconds, a black bar appears and a star becomes filled in with black to indicate your brushing progress. After you brush for the full 2 minutes, you are rewarded with a smiley face. WooHoo! I imagine that this may actually motivate chidren and hopefully get them to brush the full 2 minutes but for adults it&#x27;s a bit gimmicky and unnecessary. In any case, the toothbrush itself pauses very briefly every 30 seconds so it&#x27;s easy enough to time your brushing without using the SmartGuide at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SmartGuide takes up a lot of counter space but is provided with a piece of double-sided adhesive tape should you desire to attach it to your bathroom mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another feature of the toothbrush is a pressure sensor that will flash a red light in the handle to let you know that you are exerting too much pressure on your teeth while brushing. I had to push so hard for that light to go on, I question its usefullness. However, again, for children perhaps it&#x27;s helpful to them as they learn not to press too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not really like the Deep Sweep toothbrush head provided with this unit. I&#x27;m used to the small round heads and the Deep Sweep is significantly larger and feels uncomfortable in my mouth. This is a personal preference and you may not be bothered by that. Fortunately, Oral-B has a large variety of different brush heads that you can purchase separately. In particular, people with braces should consider purchasing the \\&quot;Ortho Brush Head\\&quot; that is better suited to cleaning teeth with braces. [[ASIN:B008I2IKM2 Oral-B Professional Ortho Brush Kit? Replacement Brush Head 4 Count]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great electric toothbrush but you may be equally as happy with a more basic version that doesn&#x27;t include the SmartGuide and the superfluous modes. You could then consider the [[ASIN:B003UKM9CO Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Precision 1000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush 1 Count]] at about 1/3 the cost. With the savings you could also purchase an Oral Irrigator such as the [[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser]] and then go out to dinner with the leftover savings. Or get the [[ASIN:B008PEMNJY Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Sensitive Gum Care Precision 3000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush And Refill Brush Head 1 Count]] and oral irrigator but forget the dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Electric toothbrushes do a fantastic job cleaning your teeth and masaging your gums.

            <li> I turned it on to use and nothing.  Real weak brush action.  If you have&lt;br /&gt;a Sonic care don&#x27;t throw it away.  The head is way to big to get to your&lt;br /&gt;molar&#x27;s and the bristles barely move.  I&#x27;m keeping my Sonic care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this a joke?</li>
            <li> Really like how  my teeth and mouth feel after using .</li>
            <li> The main difference between most Oral-B&#x27;s is that they have a circular motion mainly concentrating on each individual tooth, while most Sonicare&#x27;s use longer brush heads that sweep back and forth to cover more area. I personally prefer the circular motion as that gives you a more focused clean. You can also attach the longer brush which I have grown to like with this specific package. You can also purchase the Floss Action brush heads which contains rubber &amp;#34;flossers&amp;#34; to clean up gunk between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found that the Sonicare toothbrushes just don&#x27;t last very long. They are more prone to lemons and batteries weakening too early(as short as three months).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B also has a better method of replacing the brush heads, so it&#x27;s more future-proof: several times with Sonicare as new models come out, I found myself unable to use my current brush heads at that time and had to switch to newer heads, so with this method you can save more and not have to worry about buying new brush heads and wasting your old ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 5 brushing modes: daily clean, deep clean, sensitive, massage, and polish. Also included is the Oral-B Wireless SmartGuide, which provides real-time guidance - its quadrant guides help you brush for the recommended 2 minutes (3 minutes with Deep Clean Mode) and it lights up to tell you when you are brushing too hard. It is wall mountable and includes the tape and mount so you don&#x27;t need to buy anything. It also doubles as a clock! The cool thing is you can be in another room and it will still be connected - I&#x27;ve gone as far away as 50 feet and they both still sync.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the carrying case is a bonus, I always had a problem with Sonicare Brushes when traveling and would have to settle with a temporary manual brush. The case hold the brush and 2 brush heads. And there are tiny holes for ventilation, so no moisture will build up when the case is closed. Note that the charging stand can be detached my the larger 4 brush holder shown in the pictures; if you need to travel with that as well. The battery life is usually 10 days if you brush twice a day or 20 days if you brush once a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t bother getting the more expensive 7000 series the carrying case does not offer any ventilation and most the features you will be using it on this brush. Save your money and get the 5000 series. I bought it when it was on sale for $90.he larger 4 brush holder shown in the pictures; if you need to travel with that as well.

            <li> I use an Oral-B professional care 7500 - have been using it for about 5 years and it has worked well. I was excited to try this new one because it doesn&#x27;t have a round brush head (even though I could put the round brush heads on this one also; they&#x27;re perfectly compatible).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am indifferent. I don&#x27;t feel that it cleans any better than my old one, and I don&#x27;t personally like how it stops and beeps every time it wants you to change side. The pressure sensor is useful, but I don&#x27;t always care about the pressure I put on my teeth anyway, since I don&#x27;t think I am too hard on them, but supposedly too much pressure will eat away your enamel eventually, so I guess the sensor could be useful for some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the round heads more personally, since I don&#x27;t have a large mouth and the larger head makes it harder to get around inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband, on the other hand, likes it more than his professional care 1000. He likes the pressure sensor and the timer that is wirelessly connected to the handset showing how long the time has been going. He believes it cleans better than his old one as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, however, neither of us think it&#x27;s worth the extra money spent on it. The cheaper ones we have are good enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> Needed a replacement for my old oralB that was lost in action on a buenos aires trip. Sweet deal, love the travel case and the battery basically lasts forever - I don&#x27;t even have to bring charger anymore. Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> product is as advertised and works magically my teeth feel so clean after using this brush.</li>
            <li> This is my second Oral B electric toothbrush, and I am very pleaased with the results.  I can really feel the difference in  how smooth and clean my teeth feel verse a regular toothbrush.  Not cheap, but this product does a great job.</li>
            <li> Read great reviews on Deadspin Deals and decided to go with this Toothbrush. Best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a while.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace an older Braun Oral B electric toothbrush. I have been using it for a week now and am loving it. My teeth feel cleaner than when I visit the dentist! At first, I thought the clock/timer was overkill, but the positive reinforcement smiley face when finished is a nice touch. Initially my gums were sensitive and bled a little; however, by the third day, no more irritation. For the first time, I can&#x27;t wait until my next dental appointment to see if they can see a difference as well.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this toothbrush and after being unhappy with a sonicare, I thought I might be wasting my money again.  However, I decided to take the plunge when I read the fair return policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t decide which unit or brush head to buy so I read the reviews and took the quiz and found the results are perfect for me.  My teeth felt much cleaner and my mouth stayed fresher longer after my first use.  I don&#x27;t really need the timer but it was interesting to discover that I brush my teeth longer than required.  I also like the warning for when you&#x27;re brushing too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I went back to the dentist for a scheduled procedure, he noticed a difference and asked me about it.  I told him I took his recommendation and I think it cheered him up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, was exactly as described</li>
            <li> This is a very nice toothbrush.  It is fast and thorough.  It has a timer to help determine how long to brush each section of the mouth.  It is aggressively complete in deep cleaning the mouth.  The feel-clean feeling following brushing lasts and feels like you just left the dentist&#x27;s for a cleaning.</li>
            <li> Bought for significant other. She loves this and it has some really nice features but you will have to read the manual a little to understand them and the display.......smiley face just cracks me up!</li>
            <li> This made a perfect gift.  I have used this product for many years when I needed to replace a too tired, old one with a new model.  It is especially good got people who don&#x27;t have large mouths.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Professional Triaction 5000 does a very fine job of cleaning my teeth using side to side rather than rotary motion. The brush that comes with this ergonomically designed handle is unique because it swivels from side to side, thus enabling the user to use easily ideal brushing techniques. I having been using rotary toothbrushes for more than 40 years and I am delighted with the cleaning power of this particular arrangement. So, for brushing, for those of us who know how to brush properly, this is ideal. The kit, regrettably, comes with only one brush, yet the stand that accompanies the product and the instructions have the capacity for four brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit also comes with an extra, and in my case unnecessary, \\&quot;SmartGuide\\&quot; with a battery operated interactive display screen to show you with icons how to brush, how mush pressure to apply, spending at 30 seconds on each quadrant of your mouth and for those who need to learn proper oral health care and brushing techniques a smiley face and stars when success (achieving the recommended levels of attention to one&#x27;s teeth) is achieved. This might be a useful feature for those who need to pay more attention to their teeth, are young or are motivated by seeing icons, stars and smiley faces of encouragement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I would give this product 5 stars for the brushing unit itself, I deducted a star because they only included on brush head and these are new types of heads for Oral-B and not yet readily available. I checked two big discount clubs and they only carry the rotary replacement heads. This unit can accommodate any type of Oral-B brush, but the swivel brush is the best I have ever used. I don&#x27;t understand why they didn&#x27;t include at least one more brush instead of the travel case.</li>
            <li> I have the [[ASIN:B0085RZLVI Philips Sonicare Flexcare with Sanitizer Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]] with the  UV brush head sanitizer and have been using that for the past year. I have been happy with it but was eager to give this Oral-B electric toothbrush a try since I&#x27;ve heard good things about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the setup - like most electric toothbrushes, easy and intuitive to set up. But I want to warn you of one thing, when you first place the toothbrush on the charger it doesn&#x27;t immediately light up, it takes more than a few seconds. So at first I thought I was either doing something wrong, my electrical outlet didn&#x27;t work, or the toothbrush was defective. But then the light came on and sure enough, when I read through the instruction booklet it tells you this could happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing, and this is probably a huge DUH for most everyone else but myself, the Smart Guide is wireless and you don&#x27;t have to do anything to get it to team up with the toothbrush - just put in the batteries and when you start the toothbrush you will see the guide start working. For some reason I thought you&#x27;d have to do something more to get it to connect but you don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the Smart Guide, personally, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using it much, but  for some it&#x27;s nice to have just because you can easily see what setting you&#x27;re on. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s all that helpful to have it show you how far you&#x27;ve progressed in quarter increments - you can figure that out because the toothbrush pauses briefly as a warning to tell you to switch to another part of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as to the comparison of the Sonicare vs. Oral-B - I think this Oral-B gave me a better cleaning. I ordered some more brush heads since the one that comes with this (and there is just one, not sure why it says there are two) is a little hard. But as to the cleaning and vibration,  I definitely felt like it was the Sonicare on steroids. Now that&#x27;s good news and bad - it&#x27;s powerful but it&#x27;s loud and at least with this brush head, I felt my whole head vibrating and I didn&#x27;t like that. I will report back if the other brush heads are disappointing or if I encounter any problems with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note - where the Sonicare clearly beats this is in having the UV brush head sanitizer. I just love that and feel like it gives the brush heads a much more thorough cleaning than simply rinsing them in the water after you clean your teeth. That&#x27;s an important feature for me but as far as the cleaning itself, I think the Oral-B wins out.t&#x27;s loud and at least with this brush head, I felt my whole head vibrating and I didn&#x27;t like that.

That&#x27;s an important feature for me but as far as the cleaning itself, I think the Oral-B wins out.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush! This is the first electric toothbrush I ever owned in my life. So, I can only compare it with a manual toothbrush. Unlike a manual toothbrush, this toothbrush does most of the work for me. I only need to guide it around my mouth. It comes with 5 modes even though all you need is just one mode. The smart guide is a fantastic wireless feature. It syncs in with the toothbrush and shows how much time I spend brushing my teeth. When not in use, it displays the time. I glued it on the mirror so I can see the time while brushing my teeth. This toothbrush has made me spent at least 2 minutes brushing my teeth. It is great for someone like me who doesn&#x27;t spend enough time brushing. I highly recommend to someone who is looking for a high tech toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Choosing the right electric toothbrush is of great importance to me because I have serious gum recession - one dentist recommended gum surgery but luckily another suggested I just use Sonicare, floss every night, and dab Listerine on my gums. Thanks to his suggestions, I&#x27;ve managed to keep the gum pockets stable and from getting deeper for about fifteen years. My biggest nightmare is to lose my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I ordered this product for review, I was really excited. I couldn&#x27;t wait to try out Oral B. I was on my fifth Sonicare toothbrush and like a long love affair, wanted to check out something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I already own several Sonicare toothbrushes, I didn&#x27;t bother reading the instructions for the Oral B, thinking, well, they all work alike, don&#x27;t they? As it turned out, not so. I plugged it directly into its base, thinking like it works like Sonicare, but it doesn&#x27;t. As it turns out, you need to attach the rectagular plastic compartment to the base first before it will start charging. I wasn&#x27;t sure why the plastic part was so essential. Since the extra compartment takes up counter space, I found this annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This package comes with one toothbrush and I eagerly put it in. I saw it came with a \\&quot;Smart Guide\\&quot; timer but thought it was some extra bath accessory, thinking I didn&#x27;t really need it. That was a mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I tried it for a week, and now I&#x27;ve decided to go back to Sonicare. Why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) The brush head is too big for my mouth and feels cumbersome. The handle is thicker than Sonicare&#x27;s even though it has only two buttons. I tested all five modes and had a hard time telling which was which without looking at the \\&quot;Smart Guide\\&quot; timer on the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course you will say, that&#x27;s why you need the Smart Guide, but with my Sonicare, I never had to put a second, extraneous device on my wall (which, even worse, requires you to support it with batteries, an unnecessary extra expense). The different modes were clearly listed on the handle of the Sonicare - for reference, here the model I have: [[ASIN:B0085RZLU4 Philips Sonicare HX6972/30 Flexcare Plus Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]&lt;br /&gt;However, even without looking at the panel, I could usually guess which mode it was by the motion and the sound alone. Here, all modes sounded alike to me. Each one felt too rough on my gums. After I decided to give it one more chance (my seventh try), I was astonished to see that my gums had actually receded a little on the top. I stopped using the Oral B immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) With the Sonicare,I was able to use the included brush immediately. In the case of Oral B, the brush isn&#x27;t \\&quot;one size fits all\\&quot;. This means I&#x27;ll have to run out and pay extra for one of the many choices Oral B offers. This is annoying. Oral B should have included a sample selection of toothbrushes so that the customer could figure out which one was best without having to pay extra for his/her first kit.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**NOTE: According to the product description, my kit was supposed to come with 2 brushes, but I received only one. I will be interested to see if I had received a damaged product, or if another person, like me, received something different than what was in the Amazon description.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) Too loud. Sonicare offers a pleasant hum while you&#x27;re brushing. When I used Oral B, it sounded like I was doing drilling and construction work on my teeth. It is so loud that it adds to my general impression that Oral B is simply too rough for my tender gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(4) The plastic compartment that is attached to the base takes up counter space. My Sonicare came with two chargers - one, a larger UV charging base and a small, travel-size base that I use when I just want it to charge. As I mentioned before, the Oral B won&#x27;t charge unless the plastic compartment comes along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry Oral B, but for me, Sonicare wins hands down over this one.re clearly listed on the handle of the Sonicare - for reference, here the model I have: [[ASIN:B0085RZLU4 Philips Sonicare HX6972/30 Flexcare Plus Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]&lt;br /&gt;However, even without looking at the panel, I could usually guess which mode it was by the motion and the sound alone.

            <li> Bought this for my 9yr old so he could keep track of how well he&#x27;s brushing his teeth. I&#x27;ve never had a cavity in my life and I&#x27;m trying to get my son&#x27;s to have the same oral hygiene that I have. I tested this out myself as I was curious how it works. I was pretty impressed! It tells you if you&#x27;re using too much pressure and there&#x27;s a monitor to tell you when to move from one side to the next. It gives star rating at the end and stays on there until the next time you brush, so it&#x27;s nice to be ably to quickly see whenever I use his bathroom to see how he&#x27;s been brushing. There are also different settings you can use. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Bought as a replacement for an old Oral-B brush which had finally given up the ghost after ~10 years of use. As a toothbrush it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to - my visits to the dentist became significantly shorter/happier experiences since I started using the Oral-B brushes (compared to manual brushes and a Sonicare brush I once had). The one question mark i had was whether i really needed the gimmicky remote display/countdown but it does serve its purpose of coercing you to brush for the proper amount of time. 30 second rush jobs as you head out to work become the full 2 minutes they&#x27;re supposed to be.</li>
            <li> It makes your mouth feel much fresher and it was recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize how much I would like an electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> this is the best electric toothbrush out there. great price, quick delivery. I tried 3 other electric toothbrushes and this one works the best of all. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Have been using Braun since 10+ years.  I also used Sonicare for a few days but hated it.  Braun does the job splendidly.  My dentist says the my teeth are clean.  Thanks to Braun and the excellent product.  I also use their floss and other cleaning bristles interchanging (day and night).  Go for it.  You will be quite pleased with this worthy investment.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!  How it feels, its deep cleaning, it is fabulous.  This toothbrush reaches areas that traditional toothbrushes or other electrical toothbrushes I&#x27;ve had in the past did not reach.  At first I thought its brush head was kind of small, having gone for full size brush heads in the past, but it is actually a perfect size.  The fact that it does not let you brush too hard is a plus!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo17LX29MOE1FWD]]The Oral-B 5000 electric toothbrush makes a fine toothbrush on its own, but it&#x27;s the nifty Smart Guide that makes this toothbrush a standout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B is very nicely done in white, silver, and green.  The front and back of the brush are rubberized, while the sliver sides are done in a smooth plastic.  It feels comfortable in the hand and is easy to hold.  On the front of the handle are the power button, the mode button, the smart guide indicator light, and the battery level lights.  The battery level is divided into three segments, and the battery will last up to 10 days between charges so you can take it on a week long vacation and not have to bring the charging base.  Speaking of, the charging base is very small and discreet, but I wish it had a cord wrap of some sort.  Included with the Oral-B is a covered tray that holds 4 brush heads and slips around the charging base.  A plastic case that holds the brush and two heads also comes with the Oral-B.  The case is made of a brittle plastic, so I&#x27;m not sure how well it will hold up in a suitcase compared to the fabric case my Sonicare came with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the Oral-B is very simple; you just slip on the brush head until it snaps in place, and then press the power button.  From there it will enter normal cleaning mode (2-minutes of brushing), but by pressing the mode button you can cycle through the other modes.  There is Deep Clean (3 minutes of brushing), Sensitive (slows the brush head down), Whitening (brush head ramps up and down), and Massage (the brush head speed pulses).  While brushing the toothbrush will pause and beep letting you know to move to another quadrant.  It&#x27;s a simple as that.  Sound-wise, the Oral-B is no worse than an electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now let&#x27;s talk about the Smart Guide.  The Smart Guide is a small device (about the size of a deck of playing cards) that counts your brushing time, and shows you which quadrant you should be working on.  It also displays the current mode you are in, and if you are pushing too hard (the toothbrush itself also has a light to indicate that you are pushing too hard).  You can mount the Smart Guide on the wall with an included bracket, but I like to place mine on the countertop.  It has a slightly rubberized bottom and a tilted display so it works perfectly there.  While the Smart Guide might seem like a gimmick, I find it quite helpful as I tend let my mind drift while I brush my teeth and always forget how long I&#x27;ve been brushing, or what quadrant I&#x27;m supposed to be brushing.  The Smart Guide keeps me on track.  One other nice feature of the Smart Guide is when you are not brushing your teeth it displays the current time.  The Smart Guide runs off of 2 AA batteries (they are included).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning performance of the Oral-B is every bit as good as my Sonicare.  I like to do the standard 2 minute cycle, and then finish up with 30 seconds of the massage cycle for my gums.  My teeth feel very clean when I&#x27;m done, and my breath is fresh.  I&#x27;ve been using an electric toothbrush of one sort or another for years now, so my mouth is used to it.  If, however, this is your first electric tooth brush I would recommend starting in Sensitive mode so that your gums can adjust and not bleed.  The Oral-B&#x27;s included toothbrush head is one that is oval shaped and has brushes that alternate in direction.  I find it works well for me, but the nice thing about Oral-B is that they have a number of other heads to choose from based on your needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all... a great brush with a handy Smart Guide.also displays the current mode you are in, and if you are pushing too hard (the toothbrush itself also has a light to indicate that you are pushing too hard).  You can mount the Smart Guide on the wall with an included bracket, but I like to place mine on the countertop.  It has a slightly rubberized bottom and a tilted display so it works perfectly there.  While the Smart Guide might seem like a gimmick, I find it quite helpful as I tend let my mind drift while I brush my teeth and always forget how long I&#x27;ve been brushing, or what quadrant I&#x27;m supposed to be brushing.  The Smart Guide keeps me on track.  One other nice feature of the Smart Guide is when you are not brushing your teeth it displays the current time.  The Smart Guide runs off of 2 AA batteries (they are included).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning performance of the Oral-B is every bit as good as my Sonicare.  I like to do the standard 2 minute cycle, and then finish up with 30 seconds of the massage cycle for my gums.  My teeth feel very clean when I&#x27;m done, and my breath is fresh.  I&#x27;ve been using an electric toothbrush of one sort or another for years now, so my mouth is used to it.

            <li> it worked really great when i first got it. a month into using it twice a day for 3 minutes each brush cycle it started to indicate that i was brushing to hard even when it was touching nothing. also, it shifted automatically between brush modes while i was brushing and could not get it to brush with the 3 minute mode (deep clean) would not allow me to set it there. I am pleased with amazon they sent me a new one to exchange we will see if this one works.....LOL</li>
            <li> I like the way it works and it appears to do a better job than my Sonic brush but only time will tell.  My problem is that only lasted two weeks before something went wrong and the tooth brush did not hold a charge anymore - it went completely dead.  I got the brush immediately replaced by Amazon and after a few days all seems fine again.  I&#x27;ll update this if I get another failure or the brush continues to operate normally for a year or more.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush. Really, it leaves my mouth feeling like I just got back from the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the extra module that shows how much more time left to brush and also displays a handy clock when not in use. My only complaint is that it could be a lot smaller without sacrificing usability. It would be just as good without the large smiley face that appears after the brushing is complete, and that might allow them to make the housing smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush head itself works well, but is a little larger than what I&#x27;m used to in an electric brush. Not so large that it gets in the way, but it does take a bit of getting used to. I tend to prefer smaller brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The loudness wasn&#x27;t so bad that it bothered me, but you might be more sensitive to it than me. If this is a concern, you may want to see if you can try out a friend&#x27;s model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only came with one brush, which surprised me at this price-point. I expected a pack of three, which would be more appropriate for multiple users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The multiple brush modes seem like gimmicks. What is the difference between deep clean and whitening? I dunno. I would have been happier with two - fast and slow.  Or even one, since I never used the slow speed on my last toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sean P. Logue, 2013</li>
            <li> This is a great electric toothbrush with 5 different modes. Personalize your brushing. The brushes move in all three dimensions. Would prefer automatic santization and an improved charging station, but it&#x27;s still great.</li>
            <li> This was designed to replace another oral b triumph product that&#x27;s battery no longer held a charge.  It took some getting use to the new design.  It cleans up easier than my old one!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for the last couple of days, and it really is a gadget lovers dream.  In the box was a case, the handle, one brush head (not sure why the description states that there are multiple refill heads, mine didn&#x27;t include them), the smart guide (included Duracell batteries which I thought was great), and the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Setup was pretty easy, one thing that through me though is that the brush is delivered with zero charge.  I put it on the charger and the green lights didn&#x27;t immediately start.  I suspected it was defective, but the lights did start after about 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I setup the time on the smart guide, that was the only setup necessary.  The smart guide makes a nice little clock for the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In use I&#x27;ve gotta say this thing is noisy.  Pretty much the same as my other Oral B brush, but significantly noisier than a Sonicaire.  The brush beeps every 30 seconds to tell you to move to a new quadrant, this is also shown on the smart meter.  If you press too hard the brush flashes red, and a red light flashes on the smart meter.  It cleans better than my low end Oral B, and probably equal to or better than the Sonicaire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very pleased.  There is a coupon in the box for refill heads, and if you register you will get in even better coupon, so don&#x27;t throw that paper out!</li>
            <li> Yes, this is an expensive electric rechargeable toothbrush.  However, it is so very nice.  It could be called the Porsche of toothbrushes.  Though it is a little louder than other electric toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used, it is much more solid and feels like it cleans more deeply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery lasts for around 4 days (2 brushes per day) and the built in timer (and separate clock) are great accessories.  A nice little travel case comes with the brush as well.  Several people can use this brush (you just switch the heads); this might be factored into the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, yes, it costs quite a bit.  But it is a solid well-built product.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> I was looking to upgrade my Sonicare sonic toothbrush that is a few years old.  It works well, but the heads are expensive and it has the notorious old Sonicare problem where gunk builds up inside the unit under the brush head.  I liked the idea of being able to use different style brush heads with this model, as well as having five different cleaning modes.  The LCD screen also looked cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the first things I realized after turning it on the first time was that it wasn&#x27;t a sonic toothbrush.  I mistakenly assumed that it was at this price range and with these features.  It is mechanical and although it is fast, it is not sonic.  If you are a fan of sonic toothbrushes, you may not be a fan of this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The five cleaning modes leave me a little perplexed.  Except for the massage mode, it seems like all of the other modes would clean in the same way but with different patterns.  The cleaning modes are fairly unnecessary even though they seem like an attractive feature on the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The elephant in the [bath]room is the LCD SmartGuide.  I&#x27;m not sure why I was attracted to this feature.  After using it a few times, I am probably going to just hide it in a drawer somewhere.  It is big and clunky and the only feature I like is the timer... but the toothbrush vibrates every 30 seconds so you don&#x27;t even need the LCD screen for the countdown.  I was surprised that the screen doesn&#x27;t come with a stand.  It comes with double-sided sticky tape (yikes!) for permanent mounting.  It would have been nice for it to at least come with a stand or with some other non-permanent mounting method like Command Removable Adhesive strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a covered case that can hold up to 4 toothbrush heads.  But the toothbrush doesn&#x27;t come with a cover for individual heads.  So if you are the only person using this toothbrush, it doesn&#x27;t make sense to use the 4-pack case, but you are not provided with a plastic cover for your toothbrush head.  I find that to be a strange oversight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush does everything that it advertises, and it cleans well.  If you have some younger people in the house that could benefit from the LCD guide, this may be a great model for them.  If you are prone to brushing too hard, this also could be good for you since the LCD screen shows you when you are brushing too hard.  Beyond that, the LCD screen is sort of overkill and unnecessarily turns brushing your teeth into an entire \\&quot;experience\\&quot;.find that to be a strange oversight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush does everything that it advertises, and it cleans well.

            <li> The Oral-B Triaction 5000 is a good, top-of-the-line toothbrush.  However, the many features that make it so are also largely unchanged from the previous top-of-the-line [[ASIN:B008PEMOV6 Oral-B Professional Precision 5000]], save for a $20 price increase and a fancy new brush that many people won&#x27;t use.  3 stars; it&#x27;s a good brush but most people will find the older model to be a better value proposition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B makes very good toothbrushes, but their marketing leaves a bit to be desired; this is far from a breakthrough.  You&#x27;ll get a very good cleaning from this one, but is it any better than what you&#x27;d have gotten from their previous top-of-the-line model?  Iffy.  The main differences between the two are that the newer model has a more clearly marked button to switch between the 5 cleaning modes, stops and chimes every thirty seconds instead of simply vibrating, has a green plastic backing instead of a blue one, has a green LED instead of an LCD to show battery charge, and uses the older version of the charging stand with a dimple in the middle instead of the newer ring one.  The last is probably not a good thing, as the older version was a gunk magnet and required near-constant cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, they&#x27;re pretty much identical: 40000 pulsations/minute, 8800 oscillations/minute, a sensor that presumably warns you if you&#x27;re pressing too hard, nominal 10 day battery life (which is a little bit lower under field conditions, and there&#x27;s a noticeable difference between a new battery and an older one for both life and strength of brushing) , and a wireless SmartGuide that you&#x27;ll probably throw in a drawer and ignore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That leaves the new brush head, which twists and turns as well as rotating, as the only real difference between the two.  Of course, you can simply go out and buy a pack of the new brush heads and put them on the older model if you&#x27;d like; both use the exact same stem.  It&#x27;s probably not advisable to do so, though, as most dentists recommend gentle bristles for electric toothbrushes and the new brush head definitely doesn&#x27;t qualify.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good toothbrush, but it&#x27;s not worth $20 more than the previous year&#x27;s version unless for some reason you either really like the older base stand or have fallen in love with the new brush head.  If the price differential vanishes, I&#x27;ll raise the rating as it&#x27;s a very good toothbrush.  For now, though, 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Let me just say, my teeth felt extremely clean after using this 2x a day for 7 days. It pulsates and \\&quot;sweeps\\&quot; back and forth which is a vastly different sensation than the Oral B Triumph that I previously used.&lt;br /&gt;This brush has 5 cleaning modes, which I think is a little bit of overkill for me, HOWEVER, if you have sensitive gums, this might be perfect for you as the settings are:  Whitening (a polishing mode), Daily clean, Deep clean, SENSITIVE and massage mode.&lt;br /&gt;I tend to brush too hard and the \\&quot;gum care pressure sensor\\&quot; kept me from tearing up my gums, thankfully. It went off about 5 times per brushing the first couple of times I used it, but that was just the way I was used to brushing with the Triumph model.  I just relaxed and stopped pressing so hard , and got a great cleaning!&lt;br /&gt;I do think the little clock is silly for an adult, but if you have kids, it might be the ticket to get them to brush longer.</li>
            <li> We had a previous model and liked it.  This was is so much better.  The brush head storage, clock time and pressure sensor all work great.</li>
            <li> I think the motor could be a little more quieter. That&#x27;s why I rated it a 4 star. Great tool for getting super clean teeth and a germ free mouth. Teeth are exceptionally clean and my mouth feels clean!!</li>
            <li> Very nice product, I bought the Braun 7000 before this and I think that is even better.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to buy it strongly</li>
            <li> I wanted it because of the certain types of brush but I don&#x27;t use the timer...probably paid too much since I don&#x27;t use it.  The brush works great...  I love the massage head the most.</li>
            <li> Love this new electric toothbrush.  My mouth feels incredible.</li>
            <li> Came quickly, thank you.  Works great!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a Christmas gift for our daughter.  She just loves it.&lt;br /&gt;I love shopping at Amazon, can always find what I am looking for, and&lt;br /&gt;it is all quality merchandise.</li>
            <li> Love the timer feature. It pauses the brush for a few seconds every 30 seconds.  By segmenting your mouth into 4 sections (e.g. outside left, outside right, lower inside and upper inside) you can systematically be sure you&#x27;ve hit all the right spots.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this toothbrush.  I had an older model Oral-B which was still going strong though the battery life seemed a bit shorter and not quite as powerful as when I originally purchased it. I decided to get the bigger brush head.  I&#x27;m glad I did. I feel a noticeable difference in how clean my teeth are after brushing.  They also seem to be whiter though that could be my imagination.  At any rate, I&#x27;m glad I upgraded.  It was definitely worth it.  I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with any of the Oral-B toothbrushes but this one is a great buy!!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. Enjoy using it. Has timer that can be displayed anywhere you would like. Also has a variety of settings. With this toothbrush I seem to brush longer with the time flying by whereas other toothbrushes I just want to stop under a minute because 2 minutes seemed forever.</li>
            <li> Item was described perfectly!</li>
            <li> Bought as gift, he really likes it a lot.</li>
            <li> A few extra features that I didn&#x27;t need but still a good product.</li>
            <li> Having many family members, this is a heavily used product in our house.  Everyone likes this toothbrush.  I may have to buy another</li>
            <li> There is nothing to dislike about the product. The best I&#x27;ve ever bought. Ilove the meter that&lt;br /&gt;comes with it.For once I&#x27;m sure my theeth are properly cleaned</li>
            <li> The toothbrush came with the case for the four other brush heads and it was empty. My husband bought the exact same toothbrush a little cheaper and with four extra brush heads!</li>
            <li> A great sensation of really clean teeth.  You know when you are pushing too hard.  Timer helps you get a very clean mouth.</li>
            <li> I been a sonicare user since 2006 or 7.  I gone threw 3 of them.  One died within a few months and they sent me a new one.  The last one lasted a little over 2 years and was out of warranty.  I got feed up with them and the nasty stain that built up.  So I decided to give oral-b a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare has been tested to do a tad better then oral-b design.  But this model, Oral-B finally added pulsating.  Oral-b circular brush just shrub, but now it can pulsate.  So far so good, but I do missed the sonicare vibration/pulsating clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;+ I think it clean just as good and it actually shrub your teeth, where sonic care just vibrate the brush.&lt;br /&gt;+ The timer/ clock is nice to see things the duration and mode, but I wished it didn&#x27;t use battery and was part of the charger.&lt;br /&gt;+ less stain and residue on the brush.  The original sonic care had bacteria or some junk between the head and body.  The newer sonicare is like oral-b but it still have more area where bacteria build up.  Also the handle bottom on the sonicare has black stain over the years.  I been drying my 5000 so no black stain yet after 1-2 months of use.&lt;br /&gt;+ Brush head replacement are cheaper on average then sonicare&lt;br /&gt;+ well built like sonic care.&lt;br /&gt;+ there are tons of cleaning modes here.  I use the basic, deep clean and sometime whitening mode.&lt;br /&gt;+ I saw in the manual you can replace the battery, the reason I switched is the sonicare battery will fade after a few years and won&#x27;t hold a charge or just die.  At least you have the option to replace the battery rather then buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;negatives&lt;br /&gt;- at first i missed the sonic care vibrate, but this is really the same thing and it brushes.&lt;br /&gt;- again the clock should have been part of the charger.  Wasteful to toss battery, so far I am on the orginal battery, so I don&#x27;t know how long that will last before replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;noticeable:&lt;br /&gt;* some people say oral-b is noisier then sonicare, it is true but I won&#x27;t lose any sleep over it.&lt;br /&gt;* if the screen was on the brush we wouldn&#x27;t need the the clock, kind of unnecessary, but I do like looking at it.&lt;br /&gt;* after 30 sec this is a short stop.  Sonicare made a been or something but didn&#x27;t stop.  Sonicare stops after 2 minutes, but you can turn it on again.  This one will go on until you turn it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I am happy of the switch and gotten used to oral-b with this new brush head design.  If Oral-b only have the circular brush, I won&#x27;t have switched.  There are positive and negative to both design, but with the 5000 (vibrate/ pulsating head) I think Oral-b is equal or better then sonicare brushing design.is true but I won&#x27;t lose any sleep over it.&lt;br /&gt;* if the screen was on the brush we wouldn&#x27;t need the the clock, kind of unnecessary, but I do like looking at it.&lt;br /&gt;* after 30 sec this is a short stop.

            <li> I love the timer it helps me make sure I brush long enough.  The battery life is excellent and my teeth feel like I just came from the Dentist.  I just read I can use 5 different heads. Yippee.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush. Was delivered as promised.  Works great. Have been using an electric toothbrush for several years now but this one is the best.</li>
            <li> Product performed as advertised.  Lots of options for brush heads and movements.  Useful for anyone wanting to thoroughly clean their teeth.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re still using a manual toothbrush, do yourself a favor and read all the reviews on this toothbrush, then buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This electric toothbrush is as &#x27;intelligent&#x27; as you get and it&#x27;s many features will leave you with healthier and possibly whiter teeth too. Most people don&#x27;t brush properly or long enough if they do.  This is the first issue the Oral-B Professional Deep Sweep solves.  First, the timer lets you know how long to brush and the toothbrush takes care of the proper brushing. For those that have never used an electric toothbrush, this will likely wow you with how your teeth feel &#x27;dentist clean&#x27; every day.  If you have used other electric toothbrushes in the past, this is far ahead of them. It&#x27;s to the point if for some reason I brush without it, my teeth don&#x27;t feel clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are five modes, Daily Clean, Deep Clean, Sensitive, Whitening and Massage. I have only used the cleaning and whitening modes and they are very good. I honestly can&#x27;t say that my teeth are whiter yet, but give it some more time and I can say. I can say that my teeth are exceptionally clean and this toothbrush makes sure that I brush properly for 2 or 2.5 minutes at a time. I haven&#x27;t used the Smart Guide, as I am quite used to what I am doing, but it&#x27;s a nice touch to those that are new to the Oral-B Professional Deep Sweep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist had been after me to get an electric toothbrush for a while and my first was another brand that was good, this one is just excellent. I am very happy with Oral-B Professional Deep Sweep and I recommend it wholeheartedly.</li>
            <li> After 1 month I&#x27;m very happy with this e-brush. I don&#x27;t need all the silly &amp;#34;modes&amp;#34;, the on/off button suits me. I would recommend this model/style.</li>
            <li> Great product. Keeps my teeth looking white.</li>
            <li> Great product!!!!!!! Great quality! You&#x27;ll never go back to a regular brush</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is worth paying the price. If you have sensitive gum, this product will not damage your gum more: there is sensor preventing you from being too hard when you brush your teeth. The battery can last 3 or 4 days (depending how often you brush your teeth). The external device is not necessary since the toothbrush will actually makes some noise when you have to change the side of brushing.  It is a good and durable product.</li>
            <li> Too noisey/loud!  The brushing part was nice and gentle though.</li>
            <li> Love my Oral B Tooth Brush ! It tells me when to change brushing areas also has a variety of cleaning modes. I would definitely recommend it !</li>
            <li> Heavy, scrubbing toothbrush.  I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  This also has a light that flickers when you are using it too hard.  This brush also has a timer with it.  The second you turn this on the timer begins counting down two minutes.</li>
            <li> Price was the best on this item that I found, it was delivered as promised. Packaging was secure and appropriate in size. The item was as represented in pictures and description. After the initial (24 hour) charging period, I have used the Oral-B Deep Sweep regularly. It works as advertised, and requires no special knowledge or unusual (awkward) movements. After use, my mouth feels cleaner and my teeth do appear to look brighter. I like both the indicator that warns of excessive pressure and the Smart Guide countdown, as making certain of proper brushing (time and amount of pressure applied to teeth by brush) can be indefinite or uncertain without the warning and timer functions.</li>
            <li> This Oral-B product has been an exceptional performer. It has been better than its predecessor - another Oral-B - which lasted 10 years. The Amazon price was also excellent.</li>
            <li> I had an older Oral-B electric toothbrush that was showing its age (battery was wimping out, etc.), it was probably about six years old. So I bought this, expecting just a new version of what I had before. Turns out, this is a completely different animal -- in a good way. The brushing action is much stronger (so the &amp;#34;you&#x27;re brushing too hard&amp;#34; indicator is necessary!), the battery is EXTREMELY GOOD (I&#x27;m getting more than a week out of a single charge and have not let it run out all the way yet), and the crazy wireless sensor thing actually helps me get my brushing done. Somehow, watching the timer countdown (4x 30-second increments) makes me more inclined to finish a 2-minute brushing session than before, when I&#x27;d just brush while staring at the wall and wait for the toothbrush to buzz at the right times.  It was easier to stop early without a thing to look at, basically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, if you had an older model, I highly recommend you try this. It&#x27;s dramatically better in every conceivable way. Plus you get the wireless thing that smiles at you!</li>
            <li> Excellent deep cleaning!</li>
            <li> This is a very excellent toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Oral B Professional 1000, Professional 4000, and now this, the 5000 Deep Sweep.  I think they all do a fine job.  My Professional 1000 and 4000 did not come with a Smart Guide, which is a 2:00 LCD timer wirelessly linked to the brush.  If you have kids, the Smart Guide might be fun to have; it flashes, gives stars for every part of the brushing routine, and displays a smiley face at the end of the cycle.  If you&#x27;re an adult, though, the Smart Guide likely will just take up wall or counter space.  It&#x27;s best to store it away, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest difference between the Pro 4000 and the Deep Sweep 5000 is the new brush head, which I do think is slightly superior to older brush heads.  The replacement packages for the new-style brush heads say they are only compatible with this particular model, but I put the new-style brush head on my 1000 and 4000 and couldn&#x27;t tell the difference in brushing quality.  Given that the Pro 1000 costs much less than this model and does an extremely good job, I&#x27;d be tempted to just buy it if I were new to Oral B.  Those can be had for less than 1/2 the price of this unit, sometimes much less (I paid 1/6 the price of the 5000 Deep Sweep for my Pro 1000).  If the monetary difference isn&#x27;t that important to you, then the 5000 Deep Sweep would be a worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li> I had hoped for somewhat improved cleaning over and above the performance of my old electric toothbrush but have not found that to be the case - and the replacement brushes are very expensive by comparison. The shape of the brush also makes it difficult to brush the lower front teeth.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is the premium model of the Triaction 1000 which I&lt;br /&gt;reviewed a few months ago. The Triaction 5000 includes some additional&lt;br /&gt;accessories and brushing modes, but otherwise it&#x27;s identical, so I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;including my Triaction 1000 review below since it all applies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---- From my Triaction 1000 review ----&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Electric Toothbrush, so most&lt;br /&gt;of my review is in comparison to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll start with the biggest issue I&#x27;ve found with the Triaction 1000,&lt;br /&gt;since it may be a dealbreaker for some. If you take the brush head out&lt;br /&gt;of your mouth even partially, such as to clean your gum line with the&lt;br /&gt;tip, then the movement if the brush head sprays froth everywhere. For&lt;br /&gt;me, it got on the bathroom mirror and my chest! This does not happen&lt;br /&gt;with the Pulsonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as I can tell, the frothing is due to the \\&quot;deep sweep\\&quot; action.&lt;br /&gt;The Pulsonic head only moves in small vibration motions, but with the&lt;br /&gt;Triaction 1000, every other row of bristles sweeps rapidly from left&lt;br /&gt;to right, moving through about 1/4 inch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of features, it&#x27;s a wash (no pun intended) compared to the&lt;br /&gt;Pulsonic. They both have a built in timer for the recommended brushing&lt;br /&gt;time; the brush head pauses for a second to indicate when to move to&lt;br /&gt;the next quadrant of your mouth or finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pulsonic included a separate fine head for cleaning your gum line&lt;br /&gt;which I find very effective. With the Triaction, if you need this, you&lt;br /&gt;need to buy it as an optional accessory. Also, the Pulsonic has two&lt;br /&gt;vibration speeds while the Triaction 1000 has just one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In favor of the Triaction, it has a battery charge level indicator&lt;br /&gt;which the Pulsonic does not, and it has a pressure sensor that shuts&lt;br /&gt;off the vibration if you press too hard. The Triaction is also&lt;br /&gt;chunkier than the Pulsonic, but not as much as the Philips Sonicare&lt;br/&gt;Essence Power Toothbrush, which I&#x27;ve also tried. This may be a pro or&lt;br /&gt;con depending on your preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, the Triaction has comparable features and seems to clean&lt;br /&gt;just as well as the Pulsonic. The manufacturer claims the sweeping&lt;br /&gt;action is even better at removing plaque than other electric&lt;br /&gt;toothbrushes. It may take some getting used to if you currently use an&lt;br /&gt;electric toothbrush with the traditional vibrating motion. But, the&lt;br /&gt;dealbreaker may be the frothing.&lt;br /&gt;---- ----------------------------- ----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, getting down to the differences between the Triaction 1000 and&lt;br /&gt;the 5000. It&#x27;s clear that Oral-B are marketing the 5000 as their&lt;br /&gt;premium product. In addition to what you get with the 1000, you also&lt;br /&gt;get a travel case, the wireless \\&quot;Smart Guide\\&quot; to guide your brushing&lt;br /&gt;(more on that later), a covered brush head rack that attaches to the&lt;br /&gt;charger and holds four heads, an extra brush head, four additional&lt;br /&gt;brushing modes, and the battery life is listed as up to 10 days,&lt;br /&gt;rather than up to 7 for the 1000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Smart Guide is a battery powered LCD display (about the size of an&lt;br /&gt;iPhone, but more than twice as thick), that communicates wirelessly&lt;br /&gt;with the toothbrush, counting up or down in the ADA recommended 30s&lt;br /&gt;intervals you should spend on each quadrant of your teeth. It also&lt;br /&gt;highlights the quarter circle corresponding to the quadrant you should&lt;br /&gt;currently be brushing. It also displays an icon indicating the&lt;br /&gt;selected brushing mode, and if you press too hard, in addition to the&lt;br /&gt;warning light on the toothbrush that the Triaction 1000 shares, a&lt;br /&gt;warning icon and red light will appear on the Smart Guide. When not in&lt;br /&gt;use, the Smart Guide doubles as a clock. Thankfully, you don&#x27;t have to&lt;br /&gt;use the Smart Guide if you don&#x27;t want to. The vibration of the brush&lt;br /&gt;also pauses at the 30s intervals to let you know it&#x27;s time to move to&lt;br /&gt;the next quadrant. The 5000 also beeps once after the first quadrant,&lt;br /&gt;twice after the second, etc., but the volume is so low that it can&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;be reliably heard over the noise of the toothbrush and a running tap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the single brushing mode on the Triaction 1000, the 5000&lt;br /&gt;also includes a \\&quot;deep clean\\&quot; mode which brushes with the same&lt;br /&gt;intensity, but the time intervals are increased to 45s. In addition&lt;br /&gt;there is a delicate mode which brushes with lower intensity, a&lt;br /&gt;polishing mode where the intensity ramps up and down, and a \\&quot;massage\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;mode, supposedly for your gums, where the intensity ramps up and down,&lt;br /&gt;but at a somewhat gentler level. I&#x27;m not a dentist, but I find it hard&lt;br /&gt;to imagine how it could be good for your gums. It&#x27;s still much more of&lt;br /&gt;a fast vibration than a gentle massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of the extra features, I think the travel case and the extra&lt;br /&gt;brush head add the most value. The delicate brushing mode may be&lt;br /&gt;useful for some, and the Smart Guide could be useful if people have&lt;br /&gt;trouble following the pauses in the brushing action that convey the&lt;br /&gt;same information. The extra battery life and other brushing modes&lt;br /&gt;won&#x27;t be used by most people, and they probably won&#x27;t use the rack&lt;br /&gt;either unless they buy one of the other types of brush head to&lt;br /&gt;complement the one supplied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While reviewing the Triaction 5000, I also had the following criticisms...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Two different brush heads should be included, like the Oral-B&lt;br /&gt;Pulsonic, instead of two of the same&lt;br /&gt;* The brushhead rack is quite bulky. With it attached, it takes up&lt;br /&gt;around three times as much counter space as the charger alone.&lt;br /&gt;Realistically, very few users will have four brush heads in use&lt;br /&gt;simultaneously. It would have made much more sense to have it hold two&lt;br /&gt;brush heads instead. Note that you don&#x27;t have to attach this rack if&lt;br /&gt;you don&#x27;t want to. The charger can be used alone.&lt;br /&gt;* The Smart Guide slides into a holder than you can mount on your&lt;br /&gt;bathroom mirror or wall with an included adhesive strip. It would be&lt;br /&gt;nicer if this was attached with a suction cup so that you could&lt;br /&gt;reposition it and also not have to worry about removing the adhesive&lt;br /&gt;gunk from your mirror if you need to move it. However, the base on the&lt;br /&gt;Smart Guide is tilted so that when it sits on the counter, the LCD&lt;br /&gt;display is angled up at you. You can read it quite clearly in this&lt;br /&gt;position, so I don&#x27;t think most users will have a need to mount the&lt;br /&gt;Smart Guide with the adhesive strip.&lt;br /&gt;* As I mentioned above, the Smart Guide is more than twice as thick as&lt;br /&gt;an iPhone. For something with electronics that are less than 1/10 of&lt;br /&gt;the complexity of an iPhone, there is really no need for it to be this&lt;br /&gt;bulky.&lt;br /&gt;* In 12h mode, the Smart Guide clock has no way to indicate am/pm.&lt;br /&gt;* Although the travel case can hold the toothbrush and two brushheads,&lt;br /&gt;there is no case for the charger or the Smart Guide. For most travel,&lt;br /&gt;this won&#x27;t be an issue, since the battery should last many days, but&lt;br /&gt;if you need to bring the charger, you&#x27;ll probably want to put it in a&lt;br /&gt;separate bag to avoid getting toothpaste stains on your clothes.&lt;br /&gt;Unless you&#x27;re super fastidious about cleaning the charger!&lt;br /&gt;* The charger is not universal voltage, so the US version won&#x27;t work&lt;br /&gt;in Europe, and vice versa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, if you need any of the added features or accessories of&lt;br /&gt;the Triaction 5000, and you can tolerate the frothing, then get that.&lt;br /&gt;If the Triaction seems like a better fit for you than the Pulsonic,&lt;br /&gt;and you can tolerate the frothing, get the 1000. Otherwise, go with my&lt;br /&gt;choice, the Pulsonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure: I received a test model to review but was not otherwise compensated. It is possible that the test model is slightly different from the final retail model.</li>
            <li> I own an older Oral B Professional 1000, so I can compare this newer Oral-B Deep Sweep + Smart Guide Triaction 5000 with that product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both models have a timer that pauses briefly every so often to \\&quot;prompt\\&quot; you to switch quadrant, display indicators to show charge life / status (\\&quot;red\\&quot; means it&#x27;s time to recharge the toothbrush, blinking \\&quot;green\\&quot; means the toothbrush is still charging, etc); and a pressure sensor / indicator to warn you when you&#x27;re brushing too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike my older Professional 1000, this Deep Sweep 5000 comes with a travel case, has a smaller charging base, but also a slightly bulkier handler that&#x27;s less comfortable for my small hand. Instead of the usual small and round brush head, the new product comes packaged with a new bigger brush head that gives it more of a manual toothbrush look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles on the newer brush head have different lengths and colors: those at the tip of the head are the longest and are light blue in color, the remaining rows of bristles are either dark blue or white in color, and the white bristles are slightly longer than the dark blue ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During brushing, the dark blue bristles remain stationary, while the rest produce the sidewise (or up/down, depending on brush orientation) \\&quot;sweep\\&quot; motion that helps stimulate the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Deep Sweep 5000 is currently more expensive than the older Professional 1000 because it is the more versatile of the two models.  It offers five brushing modes instead of one:  Daily Clean (30 seconds per quadrant), Deep Clean (45 seconds per quadrant), Sensitive (slower speed for gentler brushing), Whitening (for a \\&quot;polishing\\&quot; experience) and Massage (for gum stimulation).  If you don&#x27;t need this kind of versatility, the older Professional 1000 is a good alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Deep Sweep 5000 is compatible with a range of brush heads, so if you don&#x27;t like the new bigger one that comes packaged with it, you have other choices that could potentially fill your needs better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric toothbrushes my entire life. It started with Interplak when I was a child (remember those) and then moved on to Sonicare (in all of its incarnations). My current Sonicare is the [[ASIN:B0019ZGU1S HealthyWhite]]. It is phenomenal ... I have literally never had better reports from my hygienist. It is one of those few items in my life without which I simply cannot live. Therefore, when I was afforded the opportunity to review this Oral-B Deep Sweep, I was fairly certain that nothing could possible match the quality of Sonicare. Well, I am pleased to report that the results Oral-B are fairly comparable in many aspects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B fits nicely in one&#x27;s hand. Much like the Sonicare, it is ergonomically sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the performance style varies greatly from the Sonicare. Instead of intense vibration of the Sonicare, the Oral-B has stationary blue bristles with white bristles that move rapidly oscillate from side to side. Now, this is referring the brush-head that accompanies this kit. Unlike Sonicare, Oral-B has a variety of brushes that one can purchase for the handle (depending on one&#x27;s needs). Additionally, it has a really amazing feature (not available on any Sonicare I&#x27;ve ever seen): the back of the handle lights-up if one applies too much pressure. The large, glaring, red strip is unmistakeable and handily prevents the user from damaging his/her gums. Really neat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the Healthy White, the Oral-B has a regular setting and a setting for \\&quot;whitening.\\&quot; Additionally, it has sensitive, massage, and deep clean options. Now, since I have used these types of toothbrushes throughout the years, I began with the deep clean ... it has a longer duration. I was a little worried that this new approach to cleaning could affect my gums. It did not. However, I would caution those who have strictly used manual brushes to begin on sensitive and work your way up to \\&quot;deep clean.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The separate, cumbersome, digital guide is inconsequential to anyone accustom to these toothbrushes. I tried it once and never used it again (since the brush itself does give a little pause when one is supposed to switch to another quadrant.) I cannot envision anyone using this expensive feature ... let alone sticking it on one&#x27;s wall?!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall effect was entirely comparable to what I have experienced with Sonicare ... an incredibly clean feeling. However, there is one giant strike against this brush. It is MUCH, MUCH, MUCH louder than my Sonicare. It is impossible to explain how much louder this is! For instance, I was tinkering with the toothbrush before it was fully charged and was alarmed at the sound. I thought it was simply because it wasn&#x27;t completely ready for use. Imagine my shock when it was fully charged and remained SUPER, SUPER loud. If you are a Sonicare lover, be prepared for a VERY unpleasant surprise here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I am not a convert (mostly as a result of the noise but a little because my dentist solely endorses Sonicare), I plan to keep it as a back-up (I plan on taking it on vacations since it has a better travel case). If one is seeking a great clean, this will definitely provide that. However, if you have a low tolerance for noise, this may not be your best choice. (Go with the Sonicare and its quiet, mechanical \\&quot;bzzzzzzzzzzzzzz\\&quot;!)</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m sort of a minimalist, I don&#x27;t like a lot of junk cluttering around my house. At the same time, I tend to buy the latest and greatest, thinking that it&#x27;s better. For this review I&#x27;m going to compare the Oral B 5000 (this one) to the 4000 because my husband and I have both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the box and I saw the \\&quot;My Guide\\&quot;, the visual thing that you stick on your wall, my initial thought was \\&quot;what the heck is this?\\&quot; Aside from the My Guide, the tooth brush is basically exactly the same as the 4000. Looks exactly the same, has the same modes, uses the same toothbrush heads, etc. What&#x27;s nice about it, I suppose, is that the My Guide will visually let you know when you&#x27;ve brushed exactly as long as it wants you to, instead of only relying on the pulses as an indication. If you don&#x27;t brush as long as you should, the My Guide&#x27;s display will shame you to the rest of your family members until you brush again next time. The toothbrush will work without the My Guide, if you go on vacation or something (although you can take it with you), and will function like the Oral B 4000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main difference between the two, however, is the price. At the time of this review, the 5000 costs about $40 more. It&#x27;s a personal choice, but I prefer the 4000.</li>
            <li> There are some out there who have not &#x27;sunk their teeth&#x27; into the new dental technology. And they should and this is the perfect product to start with. The device is of high quality while the brush (Oral-B) is the top recommended tooth brush among the dental care professionals. Taken together, this is one powerful combination. I love this toothbrush. One thing that really made the difference for me is the fact that there is significantly less vibration that other products I&#x27;ve used so far. It makes the perfect gift as well. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I ordered this unit to replace a less \\&quot;tricked-out\\&quot; Oral-B electric toothbrush that I&#x27;ve used for years. I&#x27;ve been pretty loyal to Oral-B for both electric and conventional toothbrushes for quite a long time. I am very satisfied with this one. The charge is long-lasting. The motions feel very effective. The advanced features are handy, but I mostly like the more basic features such as the timer that helps me take the time to brush thoroughly. For me, the most useful feature is probably the pressure sensor that lights bright red if I&#x27;m pushing too hard on my teeth with the brush. Over the years, several dentists have warned me that I&#x27;m damaging my teeth by brushing too hard. This sensor reall helps.</li>
            <li> My wife asked for this for Mother&#x27;s Day and loves it. She likes the brushing action and hand fit of this model.</li>
            <li> Loved it! works great and it is not too heavy</li>
            <li> very good tooth brush</li>
            <li> Well made. I&#x27;be used Oral-B toothbrushes over the years and have had no problem with them. They work well and clean efficiently and do not break after a year of use (like the Sonicares).</li>
            <li> I must have ordered the wrong model; it must literally be meant for use by &amp;#34;PROFESSIONALS&amp;#34;, i.e.dentists. As an 89-years old AMATEUR I find it over-powering and noisy.</li>
            <li> This brush WORKS! Totally excited about this product after a full year of use. Strongly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best electronic toothbrush!!!  It has five different brushing modes and I have used them all.  I feel that I have just had my six month cleaning from the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> I agree with the rest of the reviewer this a pretty good toothbrush, but at this point of writing it&#x27;s a terrible buy. For the price of this toothbrush($133.32), you could have bought [[ASIN:B008PEMOV6 Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Floss Action Precision 5000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush And Refill Brush Head 1 Count]]($109.99)and [[ASIN:B00ARTKAPE Oral-B Professional Deep Sweep Replacement Brush Head 4 Count]]$30.21). Performance wise it would be the same, because the only difference between this and the old 5000 is deep sweep brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case anyone is wondering the charger is 100v charger, thus please check your destination voltage before bring it overseas. The first charge takes about a day for me, and it takes hours and hours for the battery indicator to increase a single bar. Personally as a long time Oral B electric toothbrush user the large brush feels weird, it feels almost like I&#x27;m using a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought this new toothbrush about 2 months ago and am so impressed with it. My teeth are much&lt;br /&gt;cleaner and my dentist is very happy with my teeth and improved gums. I&#x27;ve retired my Sonic Care after&lt;br /&gt;using that toothbrush for years. I now brush my teeth over 2 minutes at a time. This was very much worth&lt;br /&gt;the money since it will keep my teeth healthy.</li>
            <li> I actually look forward to brushing my teeth.  I have a post dental cleaning feel every time.  my dentist and hygienist noticed a huge change in my teeth.  worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> I was going to purchase the new Sonicare Diamond Clean but after reading the bad reviews of product not being reliable considering it&#x27;s made in China I&#x27;d figured just to stick with Oral-B electric brushes and I believe it&#x27;s the best decision I made while also saving almost 70 dollars from purchasing  the Sonicare. This brush does the exact same task, and has the same options as the Diamond Series from Sonicare, but it&#x27;s even better since this product is very well made and the electric mechanism inside the brush is manufactured by Braun which is a very reputable manufacturer of shavers, trimmers and etc. This brush is made in Germany so I know it will last just as long as my previous Triumph toothbrush which is over 3 years old but still going strong. So take my advice and ranting and just buy this product and I promise that you will not regret this decision.</li>
            <li> Both of the electric toothbrushes I&#x27;ve tried have had some sort of timer in them, but it&#x27;s been some form of pausing or pulsing to indicate that you&#x27;re done with a certain section of teeth. The 5000 has so far proved more useful because it takes this two steps further by doing things the others haven&#x27;t. It not only pauses but also beeps to indicate your progression. Further, it breaks the progress down into four sections, two for each jaw (inside and outside of the teeth) and when it hits the 1/4 mark, the brush pauses, beeps one time, and you move from, say the inner lower teeth to the outside of your lower jaw teeth. At the 1/2 mark, it does this again, but beeping twice. You get the progression.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further, the brush is paired with the smartguide, a small clock that doubles as a timer and indicator of what brushing style you&#x27;re currently using. It&#x27;s one thing to hear that it&#x27;s time to move to a new section, but it&#x27;s another to know that you have been brushing that section for 20 seconds. And, if you use the same brushing style every day, like the standard one that I currently use, you&#x27;ll know that at 30 seconds you&#x27;ll be prompted to move on, so you can keep your brushing on track and make sure all your teeth are properly attended to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another neat trick this brush is capable of is changing its brushing style. Below the on/off switch is another button that triggers changes in the brushing program. While I stick to the standard cleaning mode, which is two minutes long, there&#x27;s also a variation of this called \\&quot;deep clean mode.\\&quot; If you use the sweeping-head brush that comes with the kit, it doesn&#x27;t appear to change the side-to-side behavior of the moveable portion but instead extends the brushing time of each segment by 15 seconds to 45 seconds each, or 3 minutes total. It feels like a pretty long time. I didn&#x27;t use the massage mode or teeth whitening mode, but the brush actually changes how it moves the head for those modes rather than change the brushing time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some nice touches: a fairly strong looking travel case for the brush and brush heads (the battery will supposedly last up to 10 days without a charge); a removable charge base so the charger can be used on its own; and a brush-head caddy that open completely up. If you had any of the older upright brush chargers that also stored the heads in them, you may know the annoyance of how grunged up the brush caddy could get and it was almost impossible to clean. This new style won&#x27;t suffer that same fate since it can be simply wiped out. Another nice touch is that when the brush is done charging, the very bright power light goes out instead of staying on all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus that I can only attribute to this brush and the particular \\&quot;sweep-style\\&quot; brush head that comes with this brush is that my teeth actually feel cleaner than my old Oral B ever did with the twist-style head that it has. Even brand new, my teeth never felt this clean - this is very close to that \\&quot;just from the dentist\\&quot; feeling of clean.rushing time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some nice touches: a fairly strong looking travel case for the brush and brush heads (the battery will supposedly last up to 10 days without a charge); a removable charge base so the charger can be used on its own; and a brush-head caddy that open completely up.

            <li> Okay, I know mechanical brushes - and this is the BOMB of all brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t bother with the gray fancier version of this - you&#x27;re not missing anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I know is that I had plague on my back teeth and on the inside of my mouth - this according to my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, after a few months - it is all gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just use a variety of heads - don&#x27;t just stay with only one head.  There is a floss head that I use whenever I eat steak or heavy meals and a regular head for everyday brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But &amp;#34;rotate&amp;#34;, can&#x27;t believe I said that.  But anyways, use a different head every couple of days - I have like 5 different that I like to use and it has given me a brighter smile and a better check up.</li>
            <li> Strong function, good quality and low price, especially toothbrush head comes too strong, with more than one month of both very strong. Yes!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s at least five times louder than a Sonicare and brushes like a 2.99 electric toothbrush. Go with Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;Oral B doesn&#x27;t honor their rebates, either. They sent mine back stating I didn&#x27;t send the original UPC from the box, when I did. I had a scanned copy of what I had sent them, and they denied it because it wasn&#x27;t the original. Call their customer service and you get bounced to different departments, that don&#x27;t care about YOUR money only theirs. The company probably spent more money denying my rebate (which was only $20) than if they had honored it as advertised. Again, Go with Sonicare, Sonicare makes a Much quieter and MUCH more effective bush.</li>
            <li> As for cleaning, it&#x27;s excellent I was never been able to clean my teeth so efficiently, you will definitely feel the difference after using it a few times. It&#x27;s easy to use and to clean the brush itself, the battery is big for many times of use without charging. The 4 stars rating is because it a little too load, especially in the quiet of early morning when the rest of the house is asleep. Also there should be a simpler way to change the cleaning program and duration or, a way to change the default program permanent instead of having to change it every time e.g the default program is normal cleaning and the default duration is 2 minutes, I prefer the deep cleaning and 3 minutes and I have to set them manually each time which takes  some time, if  I were able to make these setting permanent it would save a lot of time and hassle in the long run. The other improvement I would like to see is a 1 second pause  between quadrants so I  can move the brush between different parts of my mouth without having to stop it or splash toothpaste all over.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Oral B tooth brushes for a long time and this one is very good. I especially like the smart guide, the best ever!</li>
            <li> This was my second battery operated toothbrush and I&#x27;ll never change it. Works very well and leaves my mouth and teeth feeling fresh and clean. It also gently massages your gums. A really great buy.</li>
            <li> I have other Oral B Electric toothbrushes, this is very similar in nature.  I love the time it comes with!! It comes with: Rechargeable toothbrush handle, charging Station with Brush Head Storage, SmartGuide timer, travel Case and 2 refill Heads, a deep sweep and a sensitive. It has 5 settings to customize the type of \\&quot;cleaning\\&quot; you&#x27;re looking for.  Very interesting.  It also does not allow you to press to hard while brushing.  Very great gadget!!</li>
            <li> I think what is most impressive to me about this electric toothbrush is that I&#x27;ve noticed that my teeth stay cleaner longer than they did when I brushed with a regular toothbrush.  With normal brushing I&#x27;d sometimes notice a film on my teeth by the end of the day.  However, with the Oral-B I no longer notice that.  In fact, even by the end of the day my teeth feel like i just brushed them.  To me this suggests that the brush must be doing a really good job removing all the bacteria from the surfaces of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I caution that this brush takes a little getting used to.  Even on the \\&quot;feather\\&quot; setting I found it pretty hard to get used to.  My gums bled the first few times I used it though they don&#x27;t anymore.  There is a pressure sensor that will stop the brush if you push too hard but i have never even come close to triggering it.  The brush itself is already doing so much work that i don&#x27;t feel the need to press down too hard.  Though i suspect that may change over time as my teeth and gums adjust to the more vigorous scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush comes with a wireless timer that you hang on the wall in front of you.  It is wirelessly connected to the brush so it knows when you turn it on.  It will time how long you are brushing and that is a feature that I have very quickly come to appreciate.  Often when I&#x27;m in a rush it is easy to think I&#x27;ve been brushing a long time but then I look at the timer and realize it is only 45 seconds.  Initially I had some problems with drooling but what I discovered is that if I brush standing up straight that isn&#x27;t a problem.  Also, a tip, you can hit the power button to take a break, and spit, as needed.  When you hit the power button again the timer will pick up where you left off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really like it.  It is very well made and powerful.</li>
