            <li> I am a hairdresser and needed these badly.  They were so expensive at beauty supply store and I can&#x27;t believe I got 18 rollers for such a great price. Received promptly and they were exactly what I was expecting. Can&#x27;t wait to use.</li>
            <li> Love these!!! Easy to use and it comes in the perfect amount! I use them everyday!</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t stay in my hair without Bobbi pins and larger than I ordered</li>
            <li> I knew better than to buy these. I love the amount you get for the money so two stars, but they didnt do any thing for my hair. I have long thick wavy hair and wouldnt hold the curl.</li>
            <li> The Velcro Rollers worked well.  However, you must be very careful or it will get caught in your hair.  A clip must be used to hold the roller in place, and not all clips worked.</li>
            <li> Great value for the price.  Thinking about buying more.</li>
            <li> These rollers work great!  My hair is curly, short and not very thick. It straightens and smooths out my hair making big, soft curls.  They also stay in my hair without any pins and do not tangle when removing.</li>
            <li> Adds volume and wave to my hair!</li>
            <li> I wanted to love these but I didn&#x27;t really get the style I wanted after using them. Because they are velcro, my hair gets stuck to them and as I pull it out if just gets frizzy. I have tried a few different ways of using these are so far I haven&#x27;t found a way to make these work quickly or easily.</li>
            <li> Roller was not as soft as expected.</li>
            <li> Great curlers for the price-  arrived  well packed and exactly as described</li>
            <li> Great deal. Love them. And my new &amp;#34;do&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> These are great. They give you that &amp;#34;blowout&amp;#34; look. And you get 18 rollers for a good price.</li>
            <li> Wish I had found these years ago. So easy and simple to use. Great way to give my hair a fuller look. My hair is thin and fine, these really help!</li>
            <li> great  I have longer hair now and these work great</li>
            <li> These are wonderful gives a lot of lift to my hair.  I used them on dry hair and a hot blow dryer. Works great!!</li>
            <li> Got stuck in my hair and made it frizzy.  I used these when my hair was almost dry and blow dried it the rest of the way with these in it.  Maybe I did it wrong?</li>
            <li> These are great rollers, perfect for my layered hair. They stay in, and there are so many rollers that I kept a pack aside to send to my sister!</li>
