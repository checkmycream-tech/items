    <ol>
            <li>Great buy!</li>
            <li>And it says it&#x27;s not the best in the shower.</li>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>Great size, great speed.</li>
            <li>I will give it 4 starts, great product but could have a charger.</li>
            <li>Shaves close, no irritation, great results.</li>
            <li>Very nice product.</li>
            <li>My partner was very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Works great, easy to use, serves the purpose.</li>
            <li>Nice appearance but doesn&#x27;t work how is supposed to.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, I&#x27;ll look for something better than this.</li>
            <li>This does an acceptable job, so it&#x27;s ok for the price paid.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it is fine when using the comb head but scissors could be just as easy.</li>
            <li>It takes about 3-4 runs over the same spot to get rid of all the fine hair, so I&#x27;m not so sure it would do much better in the bikini region.</li>
            <li>Works well - trims in all the right spots and the shaver does it&#x27;s job.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely didn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li>I only use this with the trimmer attachment (what I prefer), and I love the length it gives me.</li>
            <li>This razor does exactly what it&#x27;s designed to do.</li>
            <li>Got a severe yeast infection after first use, haven&#x27;t used it since.</li>
            <li>The shaver also doesn&#x27;t shave very closely, so expect stubble right out of the gate.</li>
            <li>very spotty and inconsistent</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t trim very close.</li>
            <li>For this to be a Phillips products, I expected better.</li>
            <li>The shaving head doesn&#x27;t shave hair unless it&#x27;s cut short first.</li>
            <li>After using this item for two months, it has completely stopped working.</li>
            <li>naturally I wanted to get rid of them.</li>
            <li>Also, the first five or six times I used it, some sort of black residue (lubricant?) was streaked across my skin.</li>
            <li>First problem: the clam shell packaging--wasted half an hour and hurt my hand.</li>

            <li> This trimmer has a compact design and is pretty foolproof, but the shaving and trimming action is only mediocre.</li>
            <li> I use it dry and in the shower and its always given me the results that I want.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This trimmer has a compact design and is pretty foolproof, but the shaving and trimming action is only mediocre. With the trimmer head in place, it takes several passes to do the same job that the Venus trimmer does without power. The shaver also doesn&#x27;t shave very closely, so expect stubble right out of the gate. I wish the Venus bikini trimmers were easier to find, I&#x27;d switch back in a heart beat. In the meantime, I&#x27;ll look for something better than this.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. My partner was very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Horrible product! Absolutely didn&#x27;t work! It won&#x27;t even catch one hair, forget close shave! Returned it next day after arrival.</li>
            <li> After using this item for two months, it has completely stopped working. It hardly trims the hair at all anymore.</li>
            <li> Unable to do anything with this.  Did not work at all</li>
            <li> I only use this with the trimmer attachment (what I prefer), and I love the length it gives me. It&#x27;s not so short it causes itching. I use this wet, I just let it air dry. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.</li>
            <li> Confession: I use this to trim my kinda-sorta lip-stache and not my bikini area I have a few dark upper lip hairs and some pale blond ones that taunt me when I use my 10x magnifier mirror, so naturally I wanted to get rid of them. This does an acceptable job, so it&#x27;s ok for the price paid. It takes about 3-4 runs over the same spot to get rid of all the fine hair, so I&#x27;m not so sure it would do much better in the bikini region. Also, the first five or six times I used it, some sort of black residue (lubricant?) was streaked across my skin.</li>
            <li> It didnt work for me as I expected .</li>
            <li> Great size, great speed. and has the proper tools you will need. Still think that for the price it should be rechargeable. I will give it 4 starts, great product but could have a charger.</li>
            <li> Great buy! Makes shaving the bikini area easier. Also gives a close shave</li>
            <li> This razor does exactly what it&#x27;s designed to do. Shaves close, no irritation, great results.</li>
            <li> very spotty and inconsistent</li>
            <li> Foil attachment does not cut hair at all. Trimmer works well. Overheats quickly so be careful.</li>
            <li> Did not perform well. Does not shave close</li>
            <li> Works well - trims in all the right spots and the shaver does it&#x27;s job.  Both didn&#x27;t cut either of us.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed.  The shaving head doesn&#x27;t shave hair unless it&#x27;s cut short first. And it says it&#x27;s not the best in the shower. hmmm. Otherwise it is fine when using the comb head but scissors could be just as easy.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Provides a closer cut (guard removed) to my previous trimmer (brand unknown)</li>
            <li> Expensive and poor quality. Nice appearance but doesn&#x27;t work how is supposed to. The trimmer doesn&#x27;t cut anything and the shaver is worse. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t trim very close.</li>
            <li> First problem: the clam shell packaging--wasted half an hour and hurt my hand. Next:  This is a useless item. Ladies, save your manicure scissors and your razor, because you will need them. I threw this item into the trash; yes, I did. I would have sent it back, but, well, you know . . .</li>
            <li> Is bigger than I imagened</li>
            <li> Works great, easy to use, serves the purpose.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is fine but the shaver is awful. The shaver is rough and have to go areas over and over and doesn&#x27;t even give a close shave. Packaging was also extremely hard to open.</li>
            <li> misses a lot of hairs using the trimmer. the other shaver attachment doesn&#x27;t work at all on mine</li>
            <li> Works great! I use it dry and in the shower and its always given me the results that I want.</li>
            <li> doesnt work, not even my husband could use it in his face</li>
            <li> Only used once since I received it. Got a severe yeast infection after first use, haven&#x27;t used it since. Not sure if the shaver was the cause of it, but plan to disinfect it before next use.</li>
            <li> Horrible. Doesnt do anything</li>
            <li> Not at all a close shave.</li>
            <li> It does not give as close of a shave as I would like.  For this to be a Phillips products, I expected better.</li>
