            <li>Great shampoo.</li>
            <li>Reordering a great product.</li>
            <li>This is a great product</li>
            <li>Another great product from CREW.</li>
            <li>Bought this as a gift for my husband (stocking stuffer at Christmas) and he loved it.  </li>
            <li>Great shampoo for men and women has a more manly scent and cleans well too</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>The price was amazing.  </li>
            <li>smells great and clean</li>
            <li>Great smell and does not over clean hair.</li>
            <li>The free crappy hotel foreignmadeshampooinapacket is easily as good as this</li>
            <li>Great product, delivery was quick package secure.  </li>
            <li>Love the scent and fell it gives after washing out pomade from my hair</li>
            <li>Why pay more at the shops?</li>
            <li>Used it for many years</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>my husband love this shampooing..</li>
            <li>Great product, very inexpensive for the amount offered.</li>
            <li>I love it and use it every time I put my hair up with hair spray.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a spot-on reproduction, nor is it meant to be, but it is something I can well recommend to anyone who is looking for a replacement to the Classic line or otherwise wanting a great shampoo.</li>
            <li>Great price for a high quality product.</li>
            <li>Hair clean, gunk out, fantastic price!</li>
            <li>Love the mild scent and the size of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Price is cheap, so is the feel after you shower.</li>
            <li>I just switched from Original (Classic) to this one.</li>
            <li>and sure enough they did.  </li>
            <li>This Power Cleanser Style Remover shampoo, although excessively titled, is a close approximation to what the Classic used to be - clear, clean, and pleasantly herbal.  </li>
            <li>But I also wash with my normal shampoo and conditioner afterwards.</li>
            <li>You can really feel the difference especially when your hair dries!  </li>
            <li>Used and loved American Crew Classic for years until they recently changed the formula for the worse.  </li>
            <li>I only use Crew products first of all and had seen reviews of people saying that this was a different formula....let me assure you that is not the case.</li>
            <li>Gets out any of the previous day&#x27;s gel or pomade and leaves you feeling manly and refreshed, ready for what the next day holds</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t like this compared to the other Crew shampoo products. This doesn&#x27;t feel like a Crew Shampoo. Price is cheap, so is the feel after you shower.</li>
            <li> I had a sample of this and that it was great.  But I don&#x27;t seem to be getting same results with this order.</li>
            <li> Great price for a high quality product.</li>
            <li> smells great and clean</li>
            <li> Totally removes the pomade/gel/fiber combination that I use daily.  You can really feel the difference especially when your hair dries!  Great if you can get it.</li>
            <li> Gets out any of the previous day&#x27;s gel or pomade and leaves you feeling manly and refreshed, ready for what the next day holds</li>
            <li> Great deal and the product is of quality and as described.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for men and women has a more manly scent and cleans well too</li>
            <li> This smells great and cleans as it promises. I wear American Crew Fiber every day, and it totally rinses it out of my hair. It DOES make my hair frizzy if I don&#x27;t follow it with conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using American Crew shampoo for years but it is getting harder to find the larger size locally so I checked Amazon since they usually have everything and sure enough they did.  The price was amazing.  Great shampoo.</li>
            <li> Reordering a great product.</li>
            <li> My wife picked some of this up for me. It&#x27;s terrible. It doesn&#x27;t lather. Smells bad. And it was $12 for 8oz. The free crappy hotel foreignmadeshampooinapacket is easily as good as this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what hemorrhoid cream smells like, but I&#x27;m guessing it smells like this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad batch? maybe. I&#x27;m not trying it again!</li>
            <li> Love the scent and fell it gives after washing out pomade from my hair</li>
            <li> Hair clean, gunk out, fantastic price!</li>
            <li> Great product, delivery was quick package secure.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Why pay more at the shops? I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo! Love the mild scent and the size of the bottle.  Bought this as a gift for my husband (stocking stuffer at Christmas) and he loved it.  I&#x27;ve used it a few times and it gets the residue from mousse and hairspray, no problem.</li>
            <li> This is a great product</li>

            <li> Another great product from CREW. I love this shampoo. I use it everyday. I just switched from Original (Classic) to this one. It is perfect. Definitely I recommend it to everybody.</li>
            <li> I only use Crew products first of all and had seen reviews of people saying that this was a different formula....let me assure you that is not the case. I compared the two as soon as I opened it. Great price!</li>
            <li> my husband love this shampooing..he has oily scalp and it work for him</li>
            <li> Great product, very inexpensive for the amount offered.</li>
            <li> I have never found anything that takes all the hair spray out of my hair. THis product I had gotten as a smaple and ended up buying the big bottle. I love it and use it every time I put my hair up with hair spray. It does have a male smell to it. But I also wash with my normal shampoo and conditioner afterwards.</li>
