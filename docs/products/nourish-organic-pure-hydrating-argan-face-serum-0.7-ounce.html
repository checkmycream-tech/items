            <li>This is an awesome product.</li>
            <li>and it always leaves it perfectly moisturized without being greasy, but</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m ordering this because it is absolutely wonderful for winter moisturizing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product is great tried it from ipsy.  </li>
            <li>Great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!!</li>
            <li>very light and smells great!</li>
            <li>My face has never felt more wonderful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good moisturizer to get me through the winter, but this is what I should have been looking for all along.</li>
            <li>Awesome Awesome Product for very dry skin.</li>
            <li>This serum feels/smells amazing.</li>
            <li>but this thing is amazing.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is nice too.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I am pretty sure this is not a moisturizer for summer and hit climates, but for winter it is a wonderful addition to your beauty routine.</li>
            <li>The scent is fabulous and this is a light oil that absorbs nicely and makes me happy to use and put on.  </li>
            <li>I am still using this after pregnancy, I love the dewy glow it gives my skin.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have nothing against this brand, I love their face lotion.</li>
            <li>I love subscription boxes, but, until this product which was in the PopSugar February Must Have box, have never been tempted to purchase any of the products or samples I&#x27;ve gotten.</li>
            <li>Light and absorbs well!</li>
            <li>cuticles regularly - I am thoroughly impressed with the results!</li>
            <li>My aging hands appear noticeably more youthful and my nails have never been healthier and longer.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for my skin type which is aging combination skin with some extremely dry pesky patches.  </li>
            <li>Light oil with nice light scent.</li>
            <li>The product is proudly stating organic but the last ingredient is Vitamin E which I verified to be made of soy.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to smells and the smell of the product is nice and light.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried it with the Nourish Face cream and that combo will be great in the winter when it gets really dry out.</li>
            <li>I use this as part of the whole skin care system and love it.  </li>
            <li>The smell is great - I usually don&#x27;t like orange based smells but it has a great balance and stops short of bring too rindy or orange-y.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs in my skin quickly without leaving it all greasy.</li>
            <li>This soaks in very quickly for me (although my skin is quite dry) and my make-up looks so much better because my skin is hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I never would have considered purchase as I have fairly oily skin and live in a moderate climate.</li>
            <li>I apply it first and find it helps my BB cream go on easier.</li>
            <li>I figured I could try this in my hair since I&#x27;m an avid user of argan oil in my hair</li>
            <li>Other serums give your skin a tacky feel, this is not overly greasy and smooths in nicely.  </li>
            <li>But this felt like pure bacon grease.</li>
            <li>I got this for free, initially.</li>
            <li>Love the scent.. not too heavy</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for oily or even normal skin.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin and there aren&#x27;t many facial creams that I don&#x27;t have to put on twice.</li>
            <li>Def a new staple.</li>
            <li>instructions tell you to use it in the morning under your daily moisturizer, but this is basically pure oil</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff and use it daily.  </li>
            <li>I have very dry skin all year round and have found only one product that hydrated my skin better than this, but the cost  is four times as much</li>
            <li>My skin is really well hydrated after a really dry East Coast winter and frankly no other face cream has succeeded in preventing me from flaking.</li>
            <li>I tried a tiny dab on my dry face and while it probably moisturized, it left it a huge oily mess.</li>
            <li>I live in Colorado which is very dry.</li>
            <li>My skin is on the dry sensitive side.  </li>

            <li> I switched to using this as a moisturizer during pregnancy due to the simple ingredients.  </li>

            <li> It is a small bottle, but bottle lasts me about 2-3 months applying once or twice a day depending on how dry my skin is.</li>
            <li> I pat it on, so it soaks in within few min.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure why you would even need moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have never been so obsessed with a product before.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t get annoying flaking all day.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> very light and smells great! no junk in it and totally locally made</li>
            <li> Product is great tried it from ipsy.  The packaging sucked and all the oil leaked out prior so when it arrived it was empty.</li>
            <li> I switched to using this as a moisturizer during pregnancy due to the simple ingredients.  Other serums give your skin a tacky feel, this is not overly greasy and smooths in nicely.  The fragrance is nice too.  My skin is on the dry sensitive side.  I am still using this after pregnancy, I love the dewy glow it gives my skin.  It is a small bottle, but bottle lasts me about 2-3 months applying once or twice a day depending on how dry my skin is.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! I can&#x27;t use it in the summer time in Colorado but in the winter (and dryer climates), it is a life saver!</li>
            <li> shipped just as promised. Love the scent.. not too heavy</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer. Absorbs in my skin quickly without leaving it all greasy. Great product!</li>
            <li> I got this for free, initially. I wouldn&#x27;t have spent $20 on such a small amount. However after trying it, I&#x27;m hooked. I have really dry skin, especially in my T-zone. This serum feels/smells amazing. it hydrates my skin and I don&#x27;t get annoying flaking all day. Awesome Awesome Product for very dry skin. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for oily or even normal skin. Its basically an oil.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll continue using this through the summer, but my skin just drinks it up in the winter.  I swear it makes my skin look younger, too.  It is oily, which I thought I would dislike, but it absorbs into my skin almost instantly.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a good moisturizer to get me through the winter, but this is what I should have been looking for all along.</li>
            <li> I have never used a facial oil but this thing is amazing.  The smell is great - I usually don&#x27;t like orange based smells but it has a great balance and stops short of bring too rindy or orange-y.  My skin is really well hydrated after a really dry East Coast winter and frankly no other face cream has succeeded in preventing me from flaking. I have never been so obsessed with a product before.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff and use it daily.  I apply it first and find it helps my BB cream go on easier.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product. I love it. I have dry skin and there aren&#x27;t many facial creams that I don&#x27;t have to put on twice. However, this is a product that solves that problem. If you have oily skin then I wouldn&#x27;t use this product. If you do decide to try it, then you&#x27;ll see that a little of this this goes a long way as well. My face has never felt more wonderful.</li>
            <li> This stuff is basically like slathering your face in grease. I tried a tiny dab on my dry face and while it probably moisturized, it left it a huge oily mess. I figured I could try this in my hair since I&#x27;m an avid user of argan oil in my hair and it always leaves it perfectly moisturized without being greasy, but nope. A tiny, tiny amount left my hair looking like I showered in bacon grease. I have nothing against this brand, I love their face lotion. But this felt like pure bacon grease.</li>
            <li> I love subscription boxes, but, until this product which was in the PopSugar February Must Have box, have never been tempted to purchase any of the products or samples I&#x27;ve gotten. Now I&#x27;m ordering this because it is absolutely wonderful for winter moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions tell you to use it in the morning under your daily moisturizer, but this is basically pure oil so I am not sure why you would even need moisturizer. I live in Colorado which is very dry. My skin just soaks this stuff up and remains moist and supple all day long. I moved here from Chicago and how I wish I&#x27;d have found this product living there. My facial skin during Chicago winters would be so dry even after heavy moisturizing my skin would crack and flake. I started to get the flakiness here, but after using this the dreaded flakes and cracks are a thing of the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pretty sure this is not a moisturizer for summer and hit climates, but for winter it is a wonderful addition to your beauty routine.</li>
            <li> This product clogged my pores and made my face &amp; neck break out. Will be returning it.</li>
            <li> The product is proudly stating organic but the last ingredient is Vitamin E which I verified to be made of soy. It is made from non organic soy which means it is likely sprayed with pesticides.  Customer service noted that the Vit. E is not organic but also NOT GMO. If you are allergic to soy don&#x27;t use this product especially if you are suffering from auto immune.</li>
            <li> Light and absorbs well! Def a new staple. I&#x27;ve tried it with the Nourish Face cream and that combo will be great in the winter when it gets really dry out. For the summer, this is all I need</li>
            <li> Unsure as to how it performs as it arrived with the lid partially unscrewed and it had leaked everywhere. I returned it for my money back, but I was not given the option of a replacement.</li>
            <li> Light oil with nice light scent. I pat it on, so it soaks in within few min.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer, I received the Nourish Organic Argan Face Serum in a PopSugar subscription box. I never would have considered purchase as I have fairly oily skin and live in a moderate climate. I have kept this product next to my desk for several weeks now and have applied to the back of my hands and nails/cuticles regularly - I am thoroughly impressed with the results! My aging hands appear noticeably more youthful and my nails have never been healthier and longer.  Using this serum will become a part of my daily regime!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I have very dry skin all year round and have found only one product that hydrated my skin better than this, but the cost  is four times as much and it is not organic.  I am very sensitive to smells and the smell of the product is nice and light.  This soaks in very quickly for me (although my skin is quite dry) and my make-up looks so much better because my skin is hydrated.  I would recommend this product and plan to buy it again.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my skin type which is aging combination skin with some extremely dry pesky patches.  I use this as part of the whole skin care system and love it.  The scent is fabulous and this is a light oil that absorbs nicely and makes me happy to use and put on.  Softened up those spots on my face until they dissapeared.  Definitely get it on sale!</li>
