            <li>Great shipping speed!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Covergirl pressed powder for decades as have always been happy with it.</li>
            <li>My skin felt great.</li>
            <li>This is a good powder and the color matched my skin.</li>
            <li>I received this powder along with the accompanying foundation in Fair as part of a Bzz Agent campaign.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the Covergirl &amp; Olay partnership!  </li>
            <li>I think it looks better on me!\\&quot;  \\&quot;Nice Try, but it looks great on me :)</li>
            <li>Its a used and ruined product, how can this kind of thing be sold to the costumers?</li>
            <li>/&gt;Photo #1 shows the nice the nice applicator that came with the powder.</li>
            <li>The compact has a handy mirror</li>
            <li>Kind of shimmery.</li>
            <li>Simple perfect....!!!</li>
            <li>Will try it again during the summer months to see if it will work better for me.</li>
            <li>I love how this powder doesn&#x27;t clump on your have when it&#x27;s applied over moist foundation.</li>
            <li>You can see the more even color of my skin after the make up was applied.</li>
            <li>The compressed powder comes in a cute compact with a mirror.  </li>
            <li>I love that the pressed powder comes with a mirror in the compact--a rarity these days.</li>
            <li>I love this product however it was packaged with a rubber dog toy.</li>
            <li>Just wanted to let you know that the packaging needs to be better.</li>
            <li>Maybe Oprah&#x27;s staff is magically immune from clogged pores?</li>
            <li>But I would for sure buy again.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be so excited to wear it!</li>
            <li>I have always been a huge fan of both Olay &amp; CoverGirl products.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth.  </li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s important to me.</li>
            <li>Cheap face powder clogs up skin and leads to breakouts.</li>
            <li>I normally wear powder and had just run out of my regular brand so perfect timing to try this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was my first experience with powder and it took a bit more work than the liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>I use both on a regular basis, so I was excited to find out that CoverGirl had made a foundation &amp; powder with Olay in it and even more excited to try it.</li>
            <li>I do not wear much, just a quick light dusting because I do not want it looking like it is caked on.</li>
            <li>The Covergirl &amp; Olay powder overall did a nice job covering up my problem</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>The powder goes on smoothly, covers lightly, doesn&#x27;t stink, contains no noxious chemicals, and generally does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>Now I just have to wait until further in the season to lose a little tan so that the foundation is a perfect match</li>
            <li>and I like the reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I really helped make powder invisible on my face.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Clear skin is clearly worth the splurge.</li>
            <li>Really love it, but it was a shade lighter than expected.</li>
            <li>Its always hard trying to find makeup that matches my skin and this matches great and has some nice subtle reflecting powder to brighten the face.</li>
            <li>First day after I started to use it my 16 year old tried it and was like \\&quot;can</li>
            <li>This CoverGirl pressed powder came highly rated by Oprah&#x27;s magazine beauty editors.</li>
            <li>I am surprised at how much I like this powder--I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li>After the first application I noticed a bit of powder specs visible to the naked eye.</li>
            <li>I am 48 yrs old</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Since I am almost out of my old powder compact, I intend to work with it.</li>
            <li>sorry I took so long to qualify, but the shipping company Liberty Express take long to make my delivery, but now that I can say it is a great product, thanks</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the color was a little light for my current Summer tan, so it&#x27;s hard to say how well the color blended, but it did go on super smooth, had no offensive odor &amp; did not break out my skin.</li>

            <li> This is an unusual occurrence considering I am decades past the acne zone in life.</li>
            <li> I have used various Covergirl products for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin in the winter, and found this powder to be way too dry for me, even when applying with a brush.  </li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s what I wanted, it came late (we have prime) and the compact looked like it got dragged across concrete 50 times.</li>
            <li> Downside, i opened my package and the entire envelope was filled with broken powder.!!</li>
            <li> Not sure what&#x27;s going on, but somehow, with an effect that quick and that dramatic, I can&#x27;t believe I am the only one who would experience it.</li>
            <li> But after two weeks of daily application, my face breaks out with little clogged pores all over.</li>
            <li> Not really what I want from a powder.</li>
            <li> also, sells for $10 at all other places.</li>
            <li> The spot is not totally gone, but I only like applying a thin layer of make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am going back to my long-time standby--the hideously expensive but completely trouble-free, Jane Iredale face powder.</li>
            <li> I have a dark spot on one of my cheeks that I always try to cover up with make up.</li>
            <li> After unpackaging the messy box, the whole powder case was filled with broken powder!!!!!</li>
            <li> In the past I used liquid foundation rather the powder, so I was curious to see how pressed powder will work for me.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t usually like powder.</li>
            <li> Some of the powder was broken and snap was a little off.</li>
            <li> Then I read the instructions to see if I did it wrong, and yes I missed a step.</li>
            <li> When I received the product, I was completely shocked.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used Covergirl pressed powder for decades as have always been happy with it. It&#x27;s not covering up all imperfections, but it helps.</li>
            <li> Excellent coverage, doesn&#x27;t get caught up in wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Simple perfect....!!! Good for my oily skin....!!</li>
            <li> perfect match to my skin tone. also, sells for $10 at all other places. Must have!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin in the winter, and found this powder to be way too dry for me, even when applying with a brush.  Will try it again during the summer months to see if it will work better for me.</li>
            <li> When I received the product, I was completely shocked. Inside the package, the product was open and scratched but someone. Its a used and ruined product, how can this kind of thing be sold to the costumers?</li>
            <li> I love how this powder doesn&#x27;t clump on your have when it&#x27;s applied over moist foundation.</li>

            <li> I have used various Covergirl products for a long time. I like the products and I like the reasonable price. In the past I used liquid foundation rather the powder, so I was curious to see how pressed powder will work for me. I have a dark spot on one of my cheeks that I always try to cover up with make up. The Covergirl &amp; Olay powder overall did a nice job covering up my problem area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am attaching a collage of three photos labeled 1 through 3 under customers photos:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Photo #2 show before and after of the problem spot of before and after photo. You can see the more even color of my skin after the make up was applied. The spot is not totally gone, but I only like applying a thin layer of make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Photo #1 shows the nice the nice applicator that came with the powder. I really helped make powder invisible on my face. The compact has a handy mirror so you can apply make-up on the go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Photo #3 shows the compact in its blister pack as it arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first experience with powder and it took a bit more work than the liquid foundation. After the first application I noticed a bit of powder specs visible to the naked eye. Then I read the instructions to see if I did it wrong, and yes I missed a step. After the powder is applied with an applicator sponge you need to work the powder into you skin with the tips of your fingers. After that step the powder specs were gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
            <li> I LOVE the Covergirl &amp; Olay partnership!  The compressed powder comes in a cute compact with a mirror.  First day after I started to use it my 16 year old tried it and was like \\&quot;can I have this mom? I think it looks better on me!\\&quot;  \\&quot;Nice Try, but it looks great on me :)\\&quot;  I am 48 yrs old and I don&#x27;t usually like powder. It goes on so smooth.  It doesn&#x27;t settle into wrinkles or look like it&#x27;s just sitting on my face. I am surprised at how much I like this powder--I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Great shipping speed! Downside, i opened my package and the entire envelope was filled with broken powder.!! After unpackaging the messy box, the whole powder case was filled with broken powder!!!!!</li>
            <li> I always buy this in the store but I couldn&#x27;t find the shade I needed so I ended up buying it on amazon. This powder stays on all day and even with water and humidity. Although it&#x27;s what I wanted, it came late (we have prime) and the compact looked like it got dragged across concrete 50 times. So it doesn&#x27;t stay shut.</li>
            <li> Kind of shimmery. Not really what I want from a powder.</li>
            <li> This is a good powder and the color matched my skin. I have oily skin so I have to reapply if I want it on all day since throughout the day, it does wear off. I do not wear much, just a quick light dusting because I do not want it looking like it is caked on.</li>
            <li> I have always been a huge fan of both Olay &amp; CoverGirl products. I use both on a regular basis, so I was excited to find out that CoverGirl had made a foundation &amp; powder with Olay in it and even more excited to try it. I received this powder along with the accompanying foundation in Fair as part of a Bzz Agent campaign. I love that the pressed powder comes with a mirror in the compact--a rarity these days.

I have sensitive skin so that&#x27;s important to me. My skin felt great. Now I just have to wait until further in the season to lose a little tan so that the foundation is a perfect match and I&#x27;ll be so excited to wear it!</li>
            <li> Fell all powder fell out and broke...oredered another one...</li>
            <li> I love this product however it was packaged with a rubber dog toy. Some of the powder was broken and snap was a little off. Since I am almost out of my old powder compact, I intend to work with it. Just wanted to let you know that the packaging needs to be better. Thanks.</li>
            <li> This CoverGirl pressed powder came highly rated by Oprah&#x27;s magazine beauty editors. I decided to give it a try. It&#x27;s inexpensive, so what is there to lose, right? The powder goes on smoothly, covers lightly, doesn&#x27;t stink, contains no noxious chemicals, and generally does what it says it will do. But after two weeks of daily application, my face breaks out with little clogged pores all over. This is an unusual occurrence considering I am decades past the acne zone in life. Surprise! Cheap face powder clogs up skin and leads to breakouts. Maybe Oprah&#x27;s staff is magically immune from clogged pores? Not sure what&#x27;s going on, but somehow, with an effect that quick and that dramatic, I can&#x27;t believe I am the only one who would experience it. I am going back to my long-time standby--the hideously expensive but completely trouble-free, Jane Iredale face powder. Clear skin is clearly worth the splurge.</li>
            <li> Really love it, but it was a shade lighter than expected. But I would for sure buy again.</li>
            <li> Its always hard trying to find makeup that matches my skin and this matches great and has some nice subtle reflecting powder to brighten the face.</li>
