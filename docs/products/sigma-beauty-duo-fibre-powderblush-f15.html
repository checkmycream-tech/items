            <li>Thank you, Sigma, for amazing quality brushes made affordable!!</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t shed and work great, very good quality.</li>
            <li>Beautiful brush.</li>
            <li>Great brush for powder/cream/liquid.  </li>
            <li>This one is great for blush.</li>
            <li>This brush works great with my mineral blush makeup.</li>
            <li>Great feel and texture.</li>
            <li>A nice brush for blusher!</li>
            <li>I just received this brush from Sigma and its the PERFECT brush to apply my tarte Amazonian Clay Blushes, they are very pigmented and this brush picks up the perfect amount!</li>
            <li>They are easy to use, perfect for the job they are described for</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>Good purchase.</li>
            <li>but I am happy Amazon was able to give me a replacement for it.</li>
            <li>My makeup looks better than it ever has!</li>
            <li>I love Sigma brushes and this is a must have!</li>
            <li>Love this for blush!  </li>
            <li>That brush was magic!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used what I thought were decent brushes, but this Sigma F15 is the best brush I own.  </li>
            <li>This is great and very soft.</li>
            <li>So glad I read a review on this brush and picked one up, because this Sigma F15 is such a great blush brush.  </li>
            <li>It blends things out really easily and smoothly.</li>
            <li>This brush was also really easy for me to clean.</li>
            <li>i really enjoy all my sigma brushes, i have been buying them for almost a year already</li>
            <li>At first I was very excited about the brush</li>
            <li>it just looks so much better and more natural.  </li>
            <li>The brush is a good quality, much better than other brushes I have.</li>
            <li>Creates a nice soft diffused look.</li>
            <li>LOVE it and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok, I own several Sigma brushes and this one in particular is lacking enough fibers (synthetic hair) for my taste.</li>
            <li>and i must say this brush is soft and gives a smooth even finish when applying both powder and blusher.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed and intend to order the F50 within the next few days!</li>
            <li>I have used many different expensive brushes, these are the best quality Iv&#x27;e found.</li>
            <li>i enjoy doing my makeup with these professional brushes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that I can describe why I like it, but it just works really well to pick up and distribute blush without clumping it all on the first place the brush lands.  </li>
            <li>When I first used this, I picked up wayy too much product.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for someone who wants to dust on powder instead of packing it on.</li>
            <li>Really anything.</li>
            <li>oh so much</li>
            <li>After using just OK brushes in the past, I have purchased a full Sigma face and eye kit plus several others.</li>
            <li>This brush, in contrast to the other brushes I&#x27;ve used, lightly distributes my blush wherever I sweep the brush.  </li>
            <li>brush to slippery soft</li>
            <li>There is no other brand this affordable for prestige, professional makeup brushes!</li>
            <li>guess next time I&#x27;ll have to order directly from Sigma.</li>
            <li>I love the tips of this brush, it&#x27;s firm but not too firm where it creates lines on your face, but firm enough to hold the blush without constantly going back for more.</li>
            <li>BUT, this brush cant do as much as the other.</li>
            <li>I like the long handle and the bristles are soft and plush.</li>

            <li> I would recommend this product for someone who wants to dust on powder instead of packing it on. I use it to dust on translucent powder to set my foundation.</li>
            <li> I just received this brush from Sigma and its the PERFECT brush to apply my tarte Amazonian Clay Blushes, they are very pigmented and this brush picks up the perfect amount! I also use it for my bronzer as well. After using just OK brushes in the past, I have purchased a full Sigma face and eye kit plus several others. My makeup looks better than it ever has! They are easy to use, perfect for the job they are described for and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use any other brand, no shedding at all. Thank you, Sigma, for amazing quality brushes made affordable!!</li>
            <li> I love the tips of this brush, it&#x27;s firm but not too firm where it creates lines on your face, but firm enough to hold the blush without constantly going back for more. Because this brush hold the powder so well you don&#x27;t have to over do it, the blush isn&#x27;t going anywhere.</li>
            <li> brush to slippery soft</li>
            <li> This brush was not the one i meant to order as the F15 is intended for use with powder and blushers and i meant to order the F50 for liquid foundation, however i decided to keep it any way and i am very impressed! Not used Sigma before and only heard about them through reviews and i must say this brush is soft and gives a smooth even finish when applying both powder and blusher.  I&#x27;m very impressed and intend to order the F50 within the next few days!</li>
            <li> Where has this been?!  So glad I read a review on this brush and picked one up, because this Sigma F15 is such a great blush brush.  I don&#x27;t know that I can describe why I like it, but it just works really well to pick up and distribute blush without clumping it all on the first place the brush lands.  This brush, in contrast to the other brushes I&#x27;ve used, lightly distributes my blush wherever I sweep the brush.  I don&#x27;t end up with all the blush in one spot- it just looks so much better and more natural.  I&#x27;ve always used what I thought were decent brushes, but this Sigma F15 is the best brush I own.  LOVE it and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Beautiful brush. I love Sigma brushes and this is a must have! Can be used for minerals/powders /blush. Really anything.</li>
            <li> Sigma brushes are the best. They don&#x27;t shed and work great, very good quality. I have used many different expensive brushes, these are the best quality Iv&#x27;e found.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered 4 sigma brushes from amzon now, and I am very happy with the performance and the price.  I did think I would still receive the &#x27;over $30 gift, but I guess not...guess next time I&#x27;ll have to order directly from Sigma.</li>
            <li> Sigma always delivers great quality brushes! Great brush for powder/cream/liquid.  There is no other brand this affordable for prestige, professional makeup brushes! 5 stars for the brand, product and delivery service!</li>
            <li> Sigma brushes are the best. This one is great for blush. It allows you to build the color. Other brushes cake it on. This is great and very soft.</li>
            <li> This brush works great with my mineral blush makeup. I like the long handle and the bristles are soft and plush. A nice brush for blusher! Good quality.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush I have ever used for applying foundation. It blends things out really easily and smoothly. This brush was also really easy for me to clean.</li>
            <li> When I first used this, I picked up wayy too much product. Apparently I&#x27;m used to bad brushes because this is able to pick up the smallest bit of blush to apply to my face. Great feel and texture. Good purchase.</li>
            <li> At first I was very excited about the brush but when I did my research I realized that my brush was a fake. I now know NEVER to order brushes from here again.</li>
            <li> Ordered this brush for both my daughter-in-law and myself.  The brush is a good quality, much better than other brushes I have.</li>
            <li> Love this for blush!  Creates a nice soft diffused look.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok, I own several Sigma brushes and this one in particular is lacking enough fibers (synthetic hair) for my taste. I kept it, but don&#x27;t use it at all. I do use all my other Sigma brushes as well as my IT Cosmetic brushes.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement brush from amazon for the Duo Fibre brush that came in the essential kit. All I can say is I wish my Duo Fibre did not break! I miss that brush oh so much but I am happy Amazon was able to give me a replacement for it. BUT, this brush cant do as much as the other. Although it says it is a Powder/Blush brush, I don&#x27;t think it can be used for Blush. I use it to highlight and set my under eyes but thats about it. I&#x27;m buying my Duo Fibre F50 again from in store. That brush was magic!</li>
            <li> i really enjoy all my sigma brushes, i have been buying them for almost a year already and i have nothing negative to say. i enjoy doing my makeup with these professional brushes.</li>
