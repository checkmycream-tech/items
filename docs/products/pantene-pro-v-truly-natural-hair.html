            <li>Just make sure you read the instructions for applying it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an oil product, more of a cream.</li>
            <li>But most importantly... it works!</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>but you need to use more product than it says you do.</li>

            <li>Ordering online is really easy</li>
            <li>But after stopping the chemical treatment of my hair, found it to have adorably easy manageable curls.</li>
            <li>My curls look great, well defined and my hair feels clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair for curly hair with lots of frizzes if it&#x27;s humid.</li>
            <li>soft , smooth no frizz and pleasant smell</li>
            <li>Fantastic stuff makes my curls not frizzy.</li>
            <li>I smooth some into my damp hair</li>
            <li>rcvd 3 pack with a coupon for next to nothing....was a great deal....</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t fantastic</li>
            <li>For a great long time I did not even like my hair to have any curl.</li>
            <li>Bought a 3 jar pack and wish I&#x27;d had more sense to try one jar first.</li>
            <li>I have spent so much money trying to find the perfect hair curling product.</li>
            <li>It really keeps your hair smooth and from flying away :)</li>
            <li>It is very watery and this is why you need more.</li>
            <li>I was saddened to find the product no longer sold at local stores but am glad to be able to purchase it online.</li>
            <li>I have found this at my local superstore, but the price here is a lot better!</li>
            <li>I use this daily and love it!</li>
            <li>I have very curly fine hair</li>
            <li>Love make my hair soft and manageable with been too greasy.</li>
            <li>and I believe it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>As someone who has struggled with frizz my entire life, it is nice to have found a product that gets the job done.</li>
            <li>it keeps all of my frizzy hair  down an beauitful an has a good smell to it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy to have found a product to tame this mane!</li>
            <li>It is not sticky, does not make my hair hard and creates a great wave.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair light and natural feeling.  </li>
            <li>Helps me comb through my hair, l;eave is soft and friz free.</li>
            <li>I apply this after washing my hair and my day stay soft and tame the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the container, easy to get product, consistency is good, smells</li>
            <li>product is awesome for my hair type (curly, dry and frizzy) product works perfectly to tame my hair.</li>
            <li>But the only thing is you have to apply a lot of it on ur hair and so makes it having a strong scent.</li>
            <li>We usually buy the green one which we love, but this was also great.</li>
            <li>Has a nice soft feel to it when dry and isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;crunchy&#x27;</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>I really like the Pantene pro-v ant-frizz curl creme</li>
            <li>Really do like this anti curl cream.</li>
            <li>I have very frizzy/naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>If really appreciate it if anyone tht has used this product could tell me.  </li>
            <li>none really make me want to repurchase them.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>And it holds curls very well.</li>
            <li>Really defines curls…great for frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>This is one of a few product I tried and liked.</li>
            <li>This is the only gel that actually makes my hair look really nice.</li>
            <li>Smells good, not too tacky, but I don&#x27;t think my hair looked any different than any other product I use and this product</li>
            <li>My natural hair is pretty wavy and frizzy, with fly-a-ways around my hairline.</li>
            <li>This however I love, it keeps my fuzzy hair under control without making it weighted down and greasy.</li>
            <li>but I have one main question: does this product help to straighten hair,</li>
            <li>Not as good as other, much more expensive products.  </li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair, when I put it all into a pony tail, it is only about as big around as my index finger.  </li>
            <li>This product works just as well as some of the much higher priced hair curling cremes - I use it daily, and don&#x27;t wash my hair every day.</li>
            <li>I do wish these companies would stop trying to improve when they got the right product the first time..or at least continue to support the first one while messing around with the formula for others.</li>
            <li>I would not expect your hair to be completely un-frizzed if you need it to be using this item.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>I like the natural curls..</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair soft.</li>
            <li>I use it right out of the shower, when hair is still wet, just comb it through and style as usual.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>it was a little heavier, as I went thru 3 bottles fairly quick.</li>
            <li>So far this is the only thing that does.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy/curly long hair.</li>
            <li>This seems to weigh it down too much.</li>

            <li> I do wish these companies would stop trying to improve when they got the right product the first time..or at least continue to support the first one while messing around with the formula for others.</li>
            <li> I would not expect your hair to be completely un-frizzed if you need it to be using this item.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> I like the natural curls..</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair soft.</li>
            <li> I use it right out of the shower, when hair is still wet, just comb it through and style as usual.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> it was a little heavier, as I went thru 3 bottles fairly quick.</li>
            <li> So far this is the only thing that does.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy/curly long hair.</li>
            <li> This seems to weigh it down too much.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really help keep frizz down for too long either.</li>
            <li> and I use a round \\&quot;porcupine\\&quot; hairbrush and a blow dryer and my hair gets very nicely straight and stays straight all day without feeling sticky or stiff -</li>
            <li> I have tried probably around 100 different shampoos, conditioners and leave in oils and such from expensive to cheap</li>
            <li> My hair stays straight and styled all day, and even the next day (I was running late one day and didn&#x27;t have time to wash my hair before work</li>
            <li> It tends to straighten my natural curl and do little for the frizz.</li>
            <li> I have a natural curl, but not super curly - if I let it dry naturally, it gets fluffy with some ringlets.  </li>
            <li> I just had my hair cut into long layers</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that works without making my hair look wet or feel crunchy.</li>
            <li> I do have pretty thick and frizzy hair, but I was also using this in combination w other products</li>
            <li> I also forgot my jacket the other day while shopping and had to walk to and from the car in the rain several times and my hair didn&#x27;t frizz or curl up.  </li>
            <li> Does the job of smoothing dry, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> I use it for my curly hair or put it in while my hair is wet, blow dry then straighten it.</li>
            <li> The only thing is after 24 I tend to become a little frizzy compared to 24 hours with mouse.</li>
            <li> I use it when my hair is wet and just before it dries.</li>
            <li> I put it in my hair when it&#x27;s wet</li>
            <li> helps tame the massive frizz problem I have going on!</li>
            <li> This is unlike any other product I&#x27;ve tried...</li>
            <li> It is an upgrade from other conditioners.</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking it was the other Pantene straightening creme.</li>
            <li> I have very coarse, thick, curly hair which I always straighten and this product is on par with every other one.  </li>
            <li> It is very pretty wet, but once it dries it&#x27;s a crazy mess!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all, which I like.  </li>
            <li> Seems to keep the frizz down.</li>
            <li> The amount vary slightly depending on the length of your hair, but it does work.</li>
            <li> just a slight curl that is just a frizzy mess</li>
            <li> Though I had stowed it away for sometime, not liking my hair fluffy or frizzy.</li>
            <li> This one does make your hair a bit stiff.</li>
            <li> This did nothing to tame my curls whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I happened upon this product finding it to tame the frizzyness of the curls.</li>
            <li> Darn this was to replace the pro curl Pantene they stopped making which helped stop frizz and tame the humidity</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t straighten my hair, but use it to help tame</li>
            <li> The only place I can find it is my grocery store which is weird.</li>
            <li> Less expensive than other products, but works just as well.</li>
            <li> My daughter has curly hair and its hard to keep up.</li>
            <li> I got my friend with extremely curly hair addicted too!</li>
            <li> When I say rain, I mean Portland, Oregon rain!  </li>
            <li> My bad hair days, the count is going down.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely useless in curly/wavy dry/frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Which also means it is basically useless to anyone who would want to use it.</li>

            <li> Love make my hair soft and manageable with been too greasy.</li>
            <li> I read a tip that made me LOVE this... Curly haired girls listen!!!!: Put this on your hair as soon as you turn the shower off, before towel drying. Works GREAT!</li>
            <li> Good price. No hassle. Was looking for this for quite some time. Ordering online is really easy and you don&#x27;t have to run around and shop.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle creme , just love it .. soft , smooth no frizz and pleasant smell</li>
            <li> I switched from mouse and was looking for a curl cream that worked. So far this is the only thing that does. Leaves my hair light and natural feeling.  The only thing is after 24 I tend to become a little frizzy compared to 24 hours with mouse.</li>
            <li> Anti-frizz?  Hah.  Not if you have curly hair anyway...This did nothing to tame my curls whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Fantastic stuff makes my curls not frizzy. Love this stuff</li>
            <li> Smells good, not too tacky, but I don&#x27;t think my hair looked any different than any other product I use and this product (at the time I bought it) was alittle more expensive. I would not expect your hair to be completely un-frizzed if you need it to be using this item.</li>
            <li> Bought for my granddaughter and it totally tamed her frizz. Great job, pantene!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received this product at a discounted price and I believe it is worth every penny. Thank you so much. Excellent quality. I promise to update whenever I receive my order</li>
            <li> Great packaging, arrived as described. Got three product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is awesome for my hair type (curly, dry and frizzy) product works perfectly to tame my hair. I apply this after washing my hair and my day stay soft and tame the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the container, easy to get product, consistency is good, smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will continue using this product, best hair creme for my curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this item in a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> Works great keeping my frizzy hair under control.  Has a nice soft feel to it when dry and isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;crunchy&#x27;</li>
            <li> I really like the Pantene pro-v ant-frizz curl creme it keeps all of my frizzy hair  down an beauitful an has a good smell to it I&#x27;m so glad that I found something that works on my frizz hair now I have no frizz because I&#x27;ve been using Pantene ant -frizz creme.</li>
            <li> Love how smooth this is making my hair. I no longer have to worry about how my hair will look in the Georgia humidity! :) I love that it comes in a pack of three! :D</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  helps tame the massive frizz problem I have going on!</li>
            <li> Since I have mixed heritage it is often troublesome to find a proper product that will suit my hair. But having found a bottle of this on clearance brought me great pleasure with my hair. Though I had stowed it away for sometime, not liking my hair fluffy or frizzy. For a great long time I did not even like my hair to have any curl. But after stopping the chemical treatment of my hair, found it to have adorably easy manageable curls. I happened upon this product finding it to tame the frizzyness of the curls. I was saddened to find the product no longer sold at local stores but am glad to be able to purchase it online. If you have mixed hair, and like your curls this product is for you. Just make sure you read the instructions for applying it. The amount vary slightly depending on the length of your hair, but it does work.</li>
            <li> I love this curl cr&amp;egrave;me!  It&#x27;s got a great texture and leaves my hair looking great!</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair, when I put it all into a pony tail, it is only about as big around as my index finger.  I have a natural curl, but not super curly - if I let it dry naturally, it gets fluffy with some ringlets.  I just had my hair cut into long layers and I wanted a sleek look, so I bought some of this at a store (about five bucks) I smooth some into my damp hair and I use a round \\&quot;porcupine\\&quot; hairbrush and a blow dryer and my hair gets very nicely straight and stays straight all day without feeling sticky or stiff - it&#x27;s soft and silky.  I am very happy with this product.  Update:  After 2 weeks of using this I find I actually love it!  My hair stays straight and styled all day, and even the next day (I was running late one day and didn&#x27;t have time to wash my hair before work and the style stayed through my work shift) I also forgot my jacket the other day while shopping and had to walk to and from the car in the rain several times and my hair didn&#x27;t frizz or curl up.  When I say rain, I mean Portland, Oregon rain!  I will definitely keep using this!</li>
            <li> Darn this was to replace the pro curl Pantene they stopped making which helped stop frizz and tame the humidity anyway no where as good. Bought a 3 jar pack and wish I&#x27;d had more sense to try one jar first. It tends to straighten my natural curl and do little for the frizz. I have fine hair for curly hair with lots of frizzes if it&#x27;s humid. I like the natural curls..but this does not perform. I do wish these companies would stop trying to improve when they got the right product the first time..or at least continue to support the first one while messing around with the formula for others.</li>
            <li> Worked great on my hair!! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair soft.</li>
            <li> I always thought I would have to use a salon product to get results this good! This is unlike any other product I&#x27;ve tried... It&#x27;s not an oil product, more of a cream. It goes on smooth and smells great! But most importantly... it works! My natural hair is pretty wavy and frizzy, with fly-a-ways around my hairline. This product smoothes the shorter hairs and helps them stay in place throughout the day. I use it right out of the shower, when hair is still wet, just comb it through and style as usual.&lt;br /&gt;And Amazon has a great price on the three pack! I have found this at my local superstore, but the price here is a lot better! I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it... Smells nice, feels good in the hair (not greasy or crunchy at all), and its a great smoothing frizz tamer! If anything I wish the bottles were bigger or it was a little heavier, as I went thru 3 bottles fairly quick. I do have pretty thick and frizzy hair, but I was also using this in combination w other products</li>
            <li> Love this product! I use it for my curly hair or put it in while my hair is wet, blow dry then straighten it. My hair doesn&#x27;t frizz &amp; always looks nice :)</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely useless in curly/wavy dry/frizzy hair. Which also means it is basically useless to anyone who would want to use it.</li>
            <li> This creme works very nice on my natural curly hair. I use it when my hair is wet and just before it dries. Keep the curls in control and its a plus that it smells great!</li>
            <li> Does the job intended but you need to use more product than it says you do. It is very watery and this is why you need more. Price is comparable to local retailers.</li>
            <li> Really do like this anti curl cream. It is an upgrade from other conditioners. So glad I found it!</li>
            <li> Does the job of smoothing dry, frizzy hair.  Not as good as other, much more expensive products.  This one does make your hair a bit stiff.</li>
            <li> The best product when you have curly hair. My curls look great, well defined and my hair feels clean and soft.</li>
            <li> rcvd 3 pack with a coupon for next to nothing....was a great deal....had never used before....i feel that it works and it smells nice....not sticky and didnt leave my hair CRISPY</li>
            <li> Works good for my hair</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy/naturally curly hair. This product works well. I would say it&#x27;s comparable to similar products in it&#x27;s category.</li>
            <li> Good shipment time and good product</li>
            <li> This product is okay.  It works well for anti-frizz, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it helps my curl at all.  I don&#x27;t have overly curly hair...just a slight curl that is just a frizzy mess if I don&#x27;t put something on it.  I find the curl mousse in this brand works much better for my hair.  This seems to weigh it down too much.</li>
            <li> This product works just as well as some of the much higher priced hair curling cremes - I use it daily, and don&#x27;t wash my hair every day. It doesn&#x27;t seem to leave buildup. Great find!</li>
            <li> fiance loves this stuff and can&#x27;t find it locally.</li>
            <li> It smells good, but makes my hair feel kind of sticky. It doesn&#x27;t really help keep frizz down for too long either.</li>
            <li> My daughter has curly hair and its hard to keep up. This is one of a few product I tried and liked. Smells good and helps with frizz</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! the smell is great and it leave my hair soft and no frizz!!!! Would reccomend this product to anyone with curly hair!</li>
            <li> Curly, Frizzy Hair in South Florida.&lt;br /&gt;Blow Drying Straight can be acomplete Waste of Time.&lt;br /&gt;This Product applied to damp hair Relaxes The Curl and Frizz and makes me Feel Much more Comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I am actually Happy With My Hair!</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking it was the other Pantene straightening creme. An I read the directions but I have one main question: does this product help to straighten hair, bc I have very curly fine hair but I&#x27;d like to get rid of the curl and straighten my hair without heat. If really appreciate it if anyone tht has used this product could tell me.  :)</li>
            <li> I love Pantene and this product doesn&#x27;t disappoint!</li>
            <li> I have spent so much money trying to find the perfect hair curling product. Finally, after months of trying I found this product. It is not sticky, does not make my hair hard and creates a great wave. I do use frizz ease serum with it since I have frizzy roots. I love love love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have curly hair and use this as my daily product. I don&#x27;t straighten my hair, but use it to help tame/control my curls and frizz. This is the only thing that works without making my hair look wet or feel crunchy. It&#x27;s the best!!</li>
            <li> This works great in my wavy hair.  Controls frizz and allows me to scrunch some curl into my hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all, which I like.  Seems to keep the frizz down.</li>
            <li> Oh my god. This thing does the trick. My bad hair days, the count is going down. I&#x27;m too much in love. I need more.</li>
            <li> I have tried probably around 100 different shampoos, conditioners and leave in oils and such from expensive to cheap none really make me want to repurchase them. This however I love, it keeps my fuzzy hair under control without making it weighted down and greasy. It also smells great. It is a lot cheaper and only about $5 if you can find it in a store. The only place I can find it is my grocery store which is weird. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This product is okay.  I have used another Pantene Straightening Creme and it is AMAZING, but I cannot find it anywhere.  I was hoping this was similar but it isn&#x27;t.  I have very coarse, thick, curly hair which I always straighten and this product is on par with every other one.  It isn&#x27;t fantastic but I imagine its doing something....</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy/curly long hair. It is very pretty wet, but once it dries it&#x27;s a crazy mess! I have really loved this product. I put it in my hair when it&#x27;s wet and then when it dries, it stays nice and frizz free. I&#x27;m so happy to have found a product to tame this mane!</li>
            <li> It does work well without make your hair looks too oily. But the only thing is you have to apply a lot of it on ur hair and so makes it having a strong scent. (of course if you like that it&#x27;s even better..)</li>
            <li> This is the only gel that actually makes my hair look really nice. And it holds curls very well. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different brands and products and only this one works well for me. Also, it smells good. :)</li>
            <li> This cream helps my hair not to be frizzy and sticking up everywhere during the winter when there is so much static and fly away hair. I received this product at a discount in exchange for am honest and unbiased review</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff for my frizzy hair. It&#x27;s the only thing that tames my curls. Love it. Smells amazing.</li>
            <li> stops friz its awesome</li>
            <li> This works great on my curly hair. As someone who has struggled with frizz my entire life, it is nice to have found a product that gets the job done. Pantene comes through, as always.</li>
            <li> Really defines curls…great for frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I use this daily and love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this product at this moment, I like hoe is leaving my hair, my waves are bouncing lol the most important thing is that my hair is not frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have never rated this product by given it any star; and I have never wrote a review for this product!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Ms. Marlene Farrell-Trent</li>
            <li> I would spend a lot of money on Biolage leave in until they stopped making it! This is very similar. Helps me comb through my hair, l;eave is soft and friz free. I use this every day and before I straighten my hair. I got my friend with extremely curly hair addicted too! She loves it. Mines wavy and i color a lot.</li>
            <li> We usually buy the green one which we love, but this was also great. It really keeps your hair smooth and from flying away :)</li>
            <li> Great for curly hair!  Less expensive than other products, but works just as well.</li>
