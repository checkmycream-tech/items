            <li> Affordable hair spray that is not too stiff but long lasting.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have with it is that it can leave your hair a little gunked up.</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff and sticky with that unnatural shiny look.  </li>
            <li> No strong odor.</li>
            <li> It does need to be reapplied during the day, but that is a small trade off.  </li>
            <li> Always keeps my hair styled without looking artificial or stiff.  </li>
            <li> YOU CANNOT RETURN THIS ITEM -- EVEN WHEN THEY SEND YOU THE WRONG THING.</li>
            <li> My concern is not that they sent the wrong thing (mistakes do happen), but that it was not indicated on the purchase page that you could not return the item.</li>

            <li> Great product and great price.  Only problem is the spray nozzle detaches.</li>
            <li> YOU CANNOT RETURN THIS ITEM -- EVEN WHEN THEY SEND YOU THE WRONG THING. The product listed on this page is absolutely perfect for me. I don&#x27;t want to use any other hair spray. The hairspray gets a \\&quot;10\\&quot; on my scale. It has a wonderful natural hold even in high humidity. However, that is not what I got. Instead of just the plain ultra fine mist, I received ultra fine mist 3 FIRM CONTROL, which is too strong in my high humidity area (I&#x27;ve tried both--I have to wash my hair twice as often with the #3 firm control). I know I take a risk in ordering online, but Amazon.com has a fantastic record with me over the years, so I ordered the six cans. My concern is not that they sent the wrong thing (mistakes do happen), but that it was not indicated on the purchase page that you could not return the item. I would not have taken a chance with 6 unreturnable cans, maybe one. The 6 cans I received are not what are pictured and stated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AMAZON: PLEASE put this type of information on the purchase page of ALL ITEMS it affects; it&#x27;s only fair to the consumer.

            <li> I love TRESemme hair spray.  It holds the hair in place for a long time, but has a relatively soft feel. When I first apply, it seems that I put too much on, but then about ten minutes later it feels soft, but still holds the hair forever.</li>
            <li> I’ve always used this and it’s a very strong hold. The only issue I have with it is that it can leave your hair a little gunked up.</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray and nice to have a quantity on hand.</li>
            <li> Affordable hair spray that is not too stiff but long lasting.</li>

I really like it and recommend it.</li>
            <li> This came about 10 days earlier then expected. Not really disappointed, but surprised. The package was heavy but packed a great deal as to not be damaged or make a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EVERYTHING come as described. It was perfectly packaged for protection. There were 6 all together, and none you could tell where used, or damaged at all in any way. Can&#x27;t wait to use and make the curls in my hair with this. Holds great, just like the average 1 can. Great deal compared to the average one as well.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this product I was looking for a hairspray that would leave your hair soft to the touch.  The hairspray has a #3, but it was not visible on the picture of the can when I placed the order, and since it said ultra fine mist I thought it was the #2.  When I received it i was very disappointed cause it wasn&#x27;t the product I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Always keeps my hair styled without looking artificial or stiff.  Gentle fragrance.  Works especially well in humid and windy conditions.</li>
            <li> great product,good price,fast shipping</li>
            <li> I use this hairspray daily. It has a light hold that last all day long and has a nice sent that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Great value and love to have it in the closet and not have to run out to purchase.  Holds well for both myself and my husband.  No strong odor.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave residue.  Use sparingly.  Keeps my hair great for a few days.</li>
            <li> This is the best inexpensive, non stiff hairspray that I&#x27;ve ever tried. I believe it&#x27;s just as good as Sebastian or Salon Grafix</li>
            <li> I buy this in bulk and our students and in air talent love it ! Great spay and a great price!</li>
            <li> Great hairspray for fine hair.  Looks very natural!</li>
            <li> Bought it cheap! got all 6 for half the portion of the price. Love Tresemme product and its quality. I&#x27;ve been using it for many years and would continue!</li>
