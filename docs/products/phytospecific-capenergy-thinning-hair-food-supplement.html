            <li>Effective medication for thinning hair.</li>
            <li>These are great vitamins, but I think the original ones in the bottle work better.</li>
            <li>I love Cap&#x27;Energy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years since I&#x27;ve proved to myself that it does make my hair grow more with it than without it</li>
            <li>I like the texture of my hair better and it is shiny.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery &amp; great pricing</li>
            <li>the parts that are still growing look pretty good.</li>
            <li>I can see just a light difference on my hair.</li>
            <li>it works fast and your hair feels healthy, strong and lustrerous</li>
            <li>I will give it a full year and then decide whether to continue these as they are expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have always found myself coming back to this product and with good reason.</li>
            <li>There is also an added benefit in the fact that it strengthens and grows your nails quick.</li>
            <li>these are the best supplements for my hair, it&#x27;s the second round</li>
            <li>I have coarse hair and thought I would get better results, but I didn&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li>I just finished my first 2 month set of capsules and....</li>
            <li>First off,  my nails are stronger than they have ever been.</li>
            <li>Works however must be consistent with your use and give it 3 months before deciding, it worked for me.</li>
            <li>This vitamin really works.</li>
            <li>I have been taking this supplement for 2 months now and have noticed that my hair is not falling out as much.</li>
            <li>and I think the 2 products together are working very well.  </li>
            <li>But I am sensitive to vitamins or supplements causing breakouts and this absolutely caused my face to break out, so I had to lower my dosage and not take them as often, but they absolutely do work.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>They are small and are very easy to swallow.</li>
            <li>I first found these on Ulta &#x27; s website, and decided to buy from here because of the major difference in price.</li>
            <li>Will keep using it for a few more months.</li>
            <li>Not sure why but these are not verified safe by any organization, so not sure what to say, except take at your own risk.</li>
            <li>This has really helped to prevent any further hair loss and it appears that I have a little more hair.</li>
            <li>First, I thought my husband changed the way he brushed his hair to hide his bald spot</li>
            <li>Caused mild cystic acne along jawline and  pimples all over due to the Biotin (even after bumping my water intake to 1gallon per day).  </li>
            <li>I clearly saw growth that I hadn&#x27;t seen before using them.</li>
            <li>Overall my hair looks and feels much healthier.</li>
            <li>Just wow...</li>
            <li>I had plans to counteract the biotin side effects but could not figure out exactly how much biotin was in the product due to the French measuring system listed on the supplement facts.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t using my flat iron as often,  and by the time it was time to relax my hair again, I could barely notice the frizz from the new growth.</li>
            <li>They are a little expensive, but I have found good vendors here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Due to recent health problems and new medications, I was losing my hair.</li>

            <li> I have been taking hair,  skin and nail supplements for years, but I find it is very difficult for my hair to grow any longer than where it is without breaking.</li>
            <li> My bad, I can&#x27;t frankly measure the diameter of a hair strand, then I assume the hair  is thicker and fuller.</li>

            <li> I have only been taking the supplement for a little over a month but I can already see the difference. I expect the growth to continue. I will check back for an update.</li>
            <li> This vitamin really works. They are small and are very easy to swallow.</li>
            <li> My hair was starting to thin at the crown of my head, thanks to my mother who had the same problem.  My stylist suggested these capsules and I haven&#x27;t looked back.  My crown is now just as thick as the rest of my hair which has also grown considerably in length.  Overall my hair looks and feels much healthier.</li>

            <li> This product is wonderful. Due to recent health problems and new medications, I was losing my hair. This has really helped to prevent any further hair loss and it appears that I have a little more hair. I would recommend this!</li>
            <li> I love Cap&#x27;Energy even though I don&#x27;t have thinning hair.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years since I&#x27;ve proved to myself that it does make my hair grow more with it than without it and I also haven&#x27;t had any side effects some people have mentioned with Phyto&#x27;s other pills.  It comes in sheets of blister-packed so I can keep one at work, another in my purse and the rest at home in case I forget to take it in the morning).</li>
            <li> I believe the vitamins work. I clearly saw growth that I hadn&#x27;t seen before using them. But I am sensitive to vitamins or supplements causing breakouts and this absolutely caused my face to break out, so I had to lower my dosage and not take them as often, but they absolutely do work. And I will purchase them again.</li>
            <li> I have been taking this supplement for 2 months now and have noticed that my hair is not falling out as much. I like the texture of my hair better and it is shiny. I also use a topical solution by Phyto and I think the 2 products together are working very well.  also noticed that my nails are stronger. Will keep using it for a few more months.</li>
            <li> These supplements is great for hair and nail growth. it works fast and your hair feels healthy, strong and lustrerous</li>
            <li> Had very thin hair started using this my hair stopped shedding as much and a lot baby hair started to grow</li>
            <li> I like this product can you can actually see the results within a month of use. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These are great vitamins, but I think the original ones in the bottle work better. I have coarse hair and thought I would get better results, but I didn&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these pills...highly recommend!</li>
            <li> One of the best food supplements that I have tried.  Noticeable results in a relatively short period of time.  Good product.</li>
            <li> these are the best supplements for my hair, it&#x27;s the second round and my hair stopped falling out. I definitely can tell the difference, it was very obvious that these supplements contribute to reverting back my hair to health</li>
            <li> I am a repeat customer. The product helps my hair maintain its luster and length, It works for me. My husband loves the way my hair looks and feels. (From Bwana&#x27;s wife because he lets me use his account).</li>
            <li> Fast delivery &amp; great pricing</li>
            <li> I am African American with shorter, relaxed hair (just above my shoulders). I have been taking hair,  skin and nail supplements for years, but I find it is very difficult for my hair to grow any longer than where it is without breaking. I first found these on Ulta &#x27; s website, and decided to buy from here because of the major difference in price. I just finished my first 2 month set of capsules and.... Just wow... First off,  my nails are stronger than they have ever been. My hair has definitely improved as well. After month 1 I noticed my hair has stayed straighter longer. I wasn&#x27;t using my flat iron as often,  and by the time it was time to relax my hair again, I could barely notice the frizz from the new growth. I did still see some breakage when I brushed, but after month 2 I have seen about a half inch to an inch of growth and less breakage. I will continue using this product through the end of the year, hopefully with even greater results!</li>
            <li> I switched over to these from phytophanere after researching the phytospecific brand. I&#x27;ve taken them for 3 months and I&#x27;m happy with the look and feel of my hair. It seems to be working. I&#x27;m still losing my hair but the parts that are still growing look pretty good. I&#x27;ll update in three months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/19/12 Update:  I&#x27;m still using these.  I have not notice any increased growth.  I get the same 1/8\\&quot; a month  but my hair looks healthier and thicker than it did when I started these 7 months ago. The bald spot did not grow back at all.  I will give it a full year and then decide whether to continue these as they are expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;07/12 update:  Ive discontinued these.  The price point is a lot for what I was actually getting.  I can say I saw some minor growth with these after taking them for a year.  Nothing like I expected and no affects on my AGA. at all.</li>
            <li> Caused mild cystic acne along jawline and  pimples all over due to the Biotin (even after bumping my water intake to 1gallon per day).  I had plans to counteract the biotin side effects but could not figure out exactly how much biotin was in the product due to the French measuring system listed on the supplement facts.  I&#x27;ve considered going back to them once a week rather than 2 a day as suggested</li>
            <li> I bought this product to treat hair loss. It took 2 months to notice some difference. First, I thought my husband changed the way he brushed his hair to hide his bald spot but he assured me that he  has not done a thing. My bad, I can&#x27;t frankly measure the diameter of a hair strand, then I assume the hair  is thicker and fuller. Effective medication for thinning hair. I will give 4 stars because it produces a mild-moderate change benefit.</li>
            <li> These are great vitamins.  I noticed a difference in my hair within two months.  They are a little expensive, but I have found good vendors here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any results with my hair</li>
            <li> Works however must be consistent with your use and give it 3 months before deciding, it worked for me.</li>
            <li> Seemed to work after a month and half.</li>
            <li> I started getting sick and my urine turned dark after 1 month of following dosage instructions on the packaging...is that good or bad? I stopped before anything else happened. Not sure why but these are not verified safe by any organization, so not sure what to say, except take at your own risk.</li>
            <li> I have been using PhytoSpecific Cap&#x27;Energy for a few years now. I use to use the Phytophanere, but was introduced to this version by my former stylist.It is the best supplement for hair/skin/nails in my opinion. I have tried the other &amp;#34;popular&amp;#34; supplements like Hairfinity and Viviscal as well as other drugstore brands. I have always found myself coming back to this product and with good reason. The effects are immediate, from hair thickening, hair growth and nail growth/strengthening (I have been blessed not to have problem skin, therefore I cannot attest to the effects in that area). There is also an added benefit in the fact that it strengthens and grows your nails quick. As an avid &amp;#34;gel polish&amp;#34; manicure junkie, it is widely known that these types of manicures, thin out your nails (removal of gel process). This supplement is the remedy!!! It keeps your nails strengthened. Whenever I stop use of this product I can always tell the difference in my hair and nails. Lesson Learned!! I will always keep this product in my regimen.</li>
