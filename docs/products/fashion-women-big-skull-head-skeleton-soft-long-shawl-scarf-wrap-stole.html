            <li>Received quick</li>
            <li>Great price, wore it yesterday with a black tank, jeans, and heels.</li>
            <li>defenitly worth</li>
            <li>so I could wear it running around a hot pharmacy.  </li>
            <li>My sister loves it so comfortable and soft</li>

            <li>But it is a very soft lightweight scarf</li>
            <li>Very soft and hangs well around my neck.  </li>
            <li>first off, there are TWO different scarfs pictures above</li>
            <li>It is very soft and sheer.</li>
            <li>Its nice enough to use as a scarf when it&#x27;s chilly and stylish enough to use as a headband or other accessory when I want to!</li>
            <li>It is a fashion scarf and not heavy enough for a winter scarf.</li>

            <li> It is a fashion scarf and not heavy enough for a winter scarf.</li>
            <li> Mine has the large skulls in the middle and the border of small skulls around the outside.</li>
            <li> The scarf I received does not have the small skull border and is much shorter than the one pictured.</li>
            <li> Very classy but edgy look.  </li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all.</li>
            <li> The scarves are smaller and don&#x27;t have the border of small skulls.</li>
            <li> the wraps I usually buy are much much larger and thicker.</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t ever wear it because I don&#x27;t wear neck scarves I like long ones, so it turned out to be a little bit of a waste.</li>
            <li> The print is still fun, but I feel a little frustrated that the image did not reflect the product itself.</li>
            <li> and I received the one WITHOUT the small skulls around the edges.</li>
            <li> Not good quality and it is not what i was looking for</li>
            <li> Overall, I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> Just not great quality.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> I received the scarves in the mail and was disappointed to find they do not look like the image shown.</li>

            <li> recommended relative to price.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Fast shipping. Recommended.</li>
            <li> People commented on how lovely my scarf was without even realizing they were skulls!  But it is a very soft lightweight scarf so I could wear it running around a hot pharmacy.  Great buy</li>
            <li> The scarf is ok it looks better in the picture than it does in front of me the biggest downfall it honestly has is that it looks longer in the picture so I thought it would be different. I probably won&#x27;t ever wear it because I don&#x27;t wear neck scarves I like long ones, so it turned out to be a little bit of a waste.</li>
            <li> My sister loves it so comfortable and soft defenitly worth the money would buy again , great product and fast shippping</li>
            <li> This cannot be tied the way it is shown in the picture. It has to be two scarves in the picture, deceiving. Shipping was fast and I can still wear it as a hair band.</li>
            <li> I LOVE my knew scarf!  I am a huge fan/celebrator of Dia de los Muertos, so this fits perfectly in my collection!</li>
            <li> Very poor quality. Not what I expected at all. Just not great quality.</li>
            <li> This is such a cute scarf, I need to get it in different colors. The length is perfect. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> SO cute! perfect length, not cheap at all! If you found this anywhere in a store it&#x27;d probably be likt 19.99. Great price, wore it yesterday with a black tank, jeans, and heels. Totally set the outfit off. Would deff buy again!!</li>
            <li> Huge fan off all things skully! This is just fabulous! Its nice enough to use as a scarf when it&#x27;s chilly and stylish enough to use as a headband or other accessory when I want to! Also loved the price. I&#x27;ve seen similar items at stores for 10-15 dollars! Pretty sure the 2.99 shipping was more than I paid for the scarf itself! Completely happy with this!</li>
            <li> I ordered these scarves for an upcoming halloween trip I&#x27;m taking with the sister. I received the scarves in the mail and was disappointed to find they do not look like the image shown. The scarves are smaller and don&#x27;t have the border of small skulls. The print is still fun, but I feel a little frustrated that the image did not reflect the product itself.</li>
            <li> The scarf I received does not have the small skull border and is much shorter than the one pictured. It is very soft and sheer. It could not be used as a shawl or stole. It is more a short scarf or head wrap. Overall, I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> first off, there are TWO different scarfs pictures above and I received the one WITHOUT the small skulls around the edges. the scarf is very sheer and light so its only an accent piece. Not for winter season at all and should not be concidered a wrap. the wraps I usually buy are much much larger and thicker. Other than that the print is okay and I guess I could wear it next fall season when its not too freezing out.</li>
            <li> Very soft and hangs well around my neck.  Very classy but edgy look.  It is a fashion scarf and not heavy enough for a winter scarf.</li>
            <li> Looks way larger on the picture!</li>
            <li> Exactly what the image looks like, very happy with my purchas. Received quick</li>
            <li> Looks like an Alexander McQueen. I could never afford the real thing, but this scarf is the perfect look alike. Mine has the large skulls in the middle and the border of small skulls around the outside. It was shipped from somewhere in Asia and took about 3 weeks to arrive. It&#x27;s a great fashion accessory!</li>
            <li> Not good quality and it is not what i was looking for i was looking for a longer scarf it is too short</li>
