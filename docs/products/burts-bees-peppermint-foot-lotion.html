            <li>It is my favorite of all the products Burt&#x27;s Bees makes!</li>
            <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m already seeing some improvement, plus the product has a refreshing peppermint smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering, and it&#x27;s all-natural so no chemicals!</li>
            <li>I love this lotion!</li>
            <li>I love the smell too!</li>
            <li>Plus the smell is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This peppermint foot lotion has a great light smell and makes the feet tingle a bet.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice peppermint sent and soothing when applied to feet after being inside my work boots for 10 hrs. ...</li>
            <li>I love most Burt&#x27;s Bees products, but this one is a really great find.  </li>
            <li>It is getting challenging to always find this in the stores so to be able to find this on Amazon is great.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s not just effective foot lotion, but also a foot deodorizer.</li>
            <li>I have to be honest.</li>
            <li>It spreads nicely and I even have spread it upwards onto my ankles and lower legs.</li>
            <li>I have to have abundantly.</li>
            <li>Love it, it is cooling and refreshing, and moisturising, too!  </li>
            <li>The most amazing think I should mention though</li>
            <li>I love that there&#x27;s a product so effective that also isn&#x27;t tested on animals.  </li>
            <li>I am thrilled to find that it&#x27;s available on Amazon!</li>
            <li>This lotion keeps my feet smelling good and feeling comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly!</li>
            <li>I find it very pleasant and the fact that their products are 100% natural really means a great deal to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rich, but not greasy, smells wonderful of peppermint and gives your skin fresh cool and tingling.</li>
            <li>I even massage some onto my legs at night, which I love.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do anything for my callouses, but I love the tingly sensation.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is so soothing and cooling, I don&#x27;t know what more I can say about it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay but doesn&#x27;t have the tingle like the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>This was okay.</li>
            <li>The smell is refreshing but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Fantastic foot cream!  </li>
            <li>and she loves it even more when I use this.</li>
            <li>Great quality and very efficient.</li>
            <li>likes it :)</li>
            <li>love this stuff and Amazon price is better than Walmart</li>
            <li>This stuff has such a great scent!</li>
            <li>:).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still my favorite foot lotion after many years.</li>
            <li>Personally, I mostly use this peppermint foot lotion at night while sleeping, but have used it during the day as well.</li>
            <li>I have used this for a couple of years and like the fact I can get it here at Amazon as many retailers don&#x27;t seem to carry it.</li>
            <li>And it smells so lovely.  </li>
            <li>This, however, has become my favorite product.</li>
            <li>This is a favorite for my mom</li>
            <li>So glad to find it on Amazon and NO SHIPPING cost or tax with my Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Better than the coconut Foot Lotion, as this is not oily.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over a year and love it.</li>

            <li>I was expecting it to be more pepperminty.</li>
            <li>I love peppermint and this product is not overly scented.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for several years and it is a wonderful item to get via Subscribe and Save.  </li>
            <li>I like the way it makes my feet smell better</li>
            <li>This one is a traditional lotion that is wonderful at any hour.</li>
            <li>I LOVE Burts Bees</li>
            <li>Refreshing moisture softening lotion</li>
            <li>I did however find a Shaklee cream that is for the joints that works amazing on both hot tried legs and feet, and that I love!</li>
            <li>Great minty smell for lasting fresh feet!!!</li>
            <li>Regardless of what others say, it has a pleasant fresh smell, sort of minty, and does give your feet a cool feel, though not overly so.</li>
            <li>It really works and as an added bonus it smells good.</li>
            <li>and I get a full night&#x27;s sleep!  </li>
            <li>This is a great product for keeping the feet soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was so pleased with this product, but then again as far as I am concerned I am very pleased with ALL the Burt&#x27;s Bees products I have tried.  </li>
            <li>After a long day at work and being on my feet all day, it feels so good!</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees Peppermint Foot Lotion is my absolute favorite foot lotion of all!</li>
            <li>Product smells great and softens feet when used regularly.</li>
            <li>I wear heels all day and it helps my feet to feel smooth and comfortable.</li>
            <li>My feet are silky smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees is a FANTASTIC company.</li>
            <li>After my first application, I fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>smells edible, like fresh peppermint!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Trust in Burt&#x27;s Bees and liven your morning with fresh peppermint on your tootsies!</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try using it after a shower with the Burt&#x27;s Bees Peppermint and Rosemary body wash for a super fresh, wake you up and make you feel energized combination!  </li>
            <li>The peppermint soothes and makes your feet feel cool.</li>
            <li>Good enough!</li>
            <li>This Peppermint foot lotion is the only thing that can make my feet feel good after a 14 hour day of standing.  </li>
            <li>Super sweet and pepperminty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It absorbs well and fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>When applying the lotion it is creamy (not greasy) and absorbs fairly quickly and does have the peppermint scent.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees really does it right on many of their products.</li>
            <li>honestly don&#x27;t think this does a whole lot more than regular lotion.</li>
            <li>Hope this helps and that you enjoy this as much as I have.&lt;br</li>
            <li>is by far my favorite;</li>
            <li>Definitely plan on buying this again and getting some for friends as well since this softens nicely and is affordable.</li>
            <li>I thought that with all the natural ingredients I should be okay</li>
            <li>It gives my dogs a fresh feeling, and I use it every night.</li>
            <li>Love the way this classically, natural, tingling recipe feels.</li>
            <li>I purchased more and plan on continued future use of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very fresh smelling, creamy, fast absorbing lotion that will leave your feet feeling, softer, and very fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>It is a rich, thick, creamy lotion that has great moisturizing properties.  </li>
            <li>I use it right before I put on socks.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees products are generally hit-or-miss: the hand salve and lip balms are excellent, while a lot of the body care items -- lotions, soaps, etc -- are uneven in quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It might be slightly more hydrating, but I don&#x27;t think that its really worth buying a separate product just for feet unless it works way better than plain lotion.</li>
            <li>Very soothing especially when the weather gets warm.</li>
            <li>The cream is very slippery but not greasy, and soaks into skin fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>The coconut is more of a thick translucent ointment, which is nice for intensive treatment with socks at night.</li>
            <li>I first tried Burt&#x27;s Bees Peppermint Foot Lotion when I got a free sample package of several Burt&#x27;s Bees products as a free gift with an office depot order.  </li>
            <li>It contains natural ingredients which was a huge plus for me and</li>
            <li>Love the peppermint fragrance and the cooling feeling on my feet, especially during the summer when the weather is hot.  </li>
            <li>You do need socks for wearing to bed though, because there is a residue left (a layer to sit on top of skin as a protectant)</li>
            <li>I also like to use it when I first get out of the shower in the mornings.</li>
            <li>The cooling sensation was....not present, in any meaningful sense.</li>
            <li>and your feet are smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I have tried many different brands of peppermint foot lotion</li>
            <li>Many foot lotions only moisturize your feet</li>
            <li>I only wish it had more of the consistency of the hand repair cream.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I&#x27;m in the shower I use a very strong exfoliant on my feet every single night.</li>
            <li>Or maybe I just love the product so much, that I use it constantly.</li>
            <li>This lotion is great for hot tired feet</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t want it on your sheets because some oils will stain certain fabrics and not ever come out.</li>
            <li>However, it certainly doesn&#x27;t take away how well this product works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;And then all my aspirations for smooth, lovely, fragranced appendages fell flat: the peppermint smell is moderate, but not strong (though quite refreshing!).</li>
            <li>I suffer from multiple chronic pain issues, which travels to my feet, so utilizing peppermint on &amp;#34;tender&amp;#34; areas have huge benefits.</li>
            <li>Another great Burt&#x27;s product for my tired feet.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this foot lotion!</li>
            <li>I use to while massaging my feet before bed, and when I wake up my feet are so much smoother than before.</li>
            <li>I know Burt&#x27;s Bees has another foot lotion product designed for overnight use with socks, but this works very well too.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I sometimes don&#x27;t use the exfoliant and I use a pumice stone instead, depending on how much time I have.</li>
            <li>Softens skin and relieves tired feet (smells great, too...</li>
            <li>It really helps with foot odor problems.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely understand why she loves it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Although, it goes by fast.</li>
            <li>This one really goes beyond that and soothes the feet.</li>
            <li>I really hope it hasn&#x27;t been discontinued.</li>
            <li>It feels very soothing.</li>
            <li>I had used the coconut foot cream and was really looking forward to this one.</li>
            <li>It seems like it just sits on the skin rather than really moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Very relaxing, work just as it says.</li>
            <li>The peppermint gives your feet a very fresh and cooling sensation, and it really does make them much softer and smoother the next day.</li>
            <li>Though the lotion was nice - it was easy to apply, wasn&#x27;t greasy or clumpy or hard to rub in - it definitely did not have the effect that I was expecting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my feet a lot and in spite of wearing special insoles I need a daily foot lotion to bring my feet relief.</li>
            <li>Love the strong peppermint smell and the peppermint oil re-energizes tired over worked feet.</li>
            <li>Definitely has a nice, fresh, smell and cools down those heels!</li>
            <li>First of all this product is all natural.</li>
            <li>Just wish there were larger size as 3.38 ounces is used up quickly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li>I find that the quality of this lotion is high - as 8-10 hours after an application - I still feel the comfort of the lotion.</li>
            <li>Thickness is a little more dense than regular lotion worth a try</li>
            <li>I was expecting this to be something like icy hot with a cooling finish, but it is just hot.</li>
            <li>Also leaves your skin very soft.</li>
            <li>I wanted something that would really soothe my hot achey legs after a long day of being in heels, and this product does not do that!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this foot lotion: the peppermint would be cooling and comfortable, the moisturizer would aid my dry feet.</li>
            <li>The only other foot lotion that I&#x27;ve liked as much as this one is The Body Shoppe&#x27;s peppermint foot lotion which is a bit more expensive.</li>
            <li>So I give back the half star :)</li>
            <li>and after I clear it up I use Jason vitamin e moisturizer to get rid of the remaining dryness.  </li>
            <li>I tend to have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>But I totally prefer Burt&#x27;s Bees Mama Bee Leg and Foot CrÃ¨me because it&#x27;s content of peppermint is much stronger</li>
            <li>It leaves my feet silky soft without feeling greasy or sticky.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of those old-fashioned, soft peppermint nougat candies you could get at Christmas.</li>
            <li>so soft on the skin, not oily.</li>
            <li>I also like this product because it&#x27;s 100% natural in a recycled container and made in the USA.</li>
            <li>I can not put this on sensitive parts of my body, like the tops of my feet.</li>
            <li>The smell is okay but not great, and the lotion lacks any real moisture.</li>
            <li>I also like to put a tiny dab behind ears and knees for a refreshing tingle!</li>
            <li>The peppermint is refreshing, but the lotion itself isn&#x27;t creamy or thick enough to make any difference on the feet.</li>
            <li>The lotion soothes, cools and hydrates dry and/or tired feet exceptionally well and helps rough areas become softer and smoother, though it will not affect hardened callouses that much.</li>
            <li>really works for dry skin of feet!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little bit pricey if you think about it, but it is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>He keeps the peppermint cream in the fridge so it really helps cool my tired feet.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I just have an overly sensitive nose and others will only smell the peppermint.</li>
            <li>but I love this product for tired, achy feet.</li>
            <li>The smell was subtle and it actually made my feet smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>and I find that I have to apply more lotion thirty minutes later because my feet are still tired.  </li>
            <li>It looses one star for the price (just a little too much) and the fact that I cannot find it locally.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s even better if you keep it in the refrigerator!</li>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love everthing about this product!</li>
            <li> It is my favorite of all the products Burt&#x27;s Bees makes!</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m already seeing some improvement, plus the product has a refreshing peppermint smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering, and it&#x27;s all-natural so no chemicals!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!</li>
            <li> I love the smell too!</li>
            <li> Plus the smell is amazing.  </li>
            <li> This peppermint foot lotion has a great light smell and makes the feet tingle a bet.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> Nice peppermint sent and soothing when applied to feet after being inside my work boots for 10 hrs. ...</li>
            <li> I love most Burt&#x27;s Bees products, but this one is a really great find.  </li>
            <li> It is getting challenging to always find this in the stores so to be able to find this on Amazon is great.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s not just effective foot lotion, but also a foot deodorizer.</li>
            <li> I have to be honest.</li>
            <li> It spreads nicely and I even have spread it upwards onto my ankles and lower legs.</li>
            <li> I have to have abundantly.</li>
            <li> Love it, it is cooling and refreshing, and moisturising, too!  </li>
            <li> The most amazing think I should mention though</li>
            <li> I love that there&#x27;s a product so effective that also isn&#x27;t tested on animals.  </li>
            <li> I am thrilled to find that it&#x27;s available on Amazon!</li>
            <li> This lotion keeps my feet smelling good and feeling comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly!</li>
            <li> I find it very pleasant and the fact that their products are 100% natural really means a great deal to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rich, but not greasy, smells wonderful of peppermint and gives your skin fresh cool and tingling.</li>
            <li> I even massage some onto my legs at night, which I love.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do anything for my callouses, but I love the tingly sensation.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is so soothing and cooling, I don&#x27;t know what more I can say about it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but doesn&#x27;t have the tingle like the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> This was okay.</li>
            <li> The smell is refreshing but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Fantastic foot cream!  </li>
            <li> and she loves it even more when I use this.</li>
            <li> Great quality and very efficient.</li>
            <li> likes it :)</li>
            <li> love this stuff and Amazon price is better than Walmart</li>
            <li> This stuff has such a great scent!</li>
            <li> :).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still my favorite foot lotion after many years.</li>
            <li> Personally, I mostly use this peppermint foot lotion at night while sleeping, but have used it during the day as well.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a couple of years and like the fact I can get it here at Amazon as many retailers don&#x27;t seem to carry it.</li>
            <li> And it smells so lovely.  </li>
            <li> This, however, has become my favorite product.</li>
            <li> This is a favorite for my mom</li>
            <li> So glad to find it on Amazon and NO SHIPPING cost or tax with my Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Better than the coconut Foot Lotion, as this is not oily.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year and love it.</li>
            <li> Love the scent of this product.</li>
            <li> LOVE this...</li>
            <li> its my magic weapon under my socks ,stockings and pantyhose..makes me feel  </li>

            <li> I was expecting it to be more pepperminty.</li>
            <li> I love peppermint and this product is not overly scented.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for several years and it is a wonderful item to get via Subscribe and Save.  </li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my feet smell better</li>
            <li> This one is a traditional lotion that is wonderful at any hour.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Burts Bees</li>
            <li> Refreshing moisture softening lotion</li>
            <li> I did however find a Shaklee cream that is for the joints that works amazing on both hot tried legs and feet, and that I love!</li>
            <li> Great minty smell for lasting fresh feet!!!</li>
            <li> Regardless of what others say, it has a pleasant fresh smell, sort of minty, and does give your feet a cool feel, though not overly so.</li>
            <li> It really works and as an added bonus it smells good.</li>
            <li> and I get a full night&#x27;s sleep!  </li>
            <li> This is a great product for keeping the feet soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was so pleased with this product, but then again as far as I am concerned I am very pleased with ALL the Burt&#x27;s Bees products I have tried.  </li>
            <li> After a long day at work and being on my feet all day, it feels so good!</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Peppermint Foot Lotion is my absolute favorite foot lotion of all!</li>
            <li> Product smells great and softens feet when used regularly.</li>
            <li> I wear heels all day and it helps my feet to feel smooth and comfortable.</li>
            <li> My feet are silky smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees is a FANTASTIC company.</li>
            <li> After my first application, I fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li> smells edible, like fresh peppermint!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Trust in Burt&#x27;s Bees and liven your morning with fresh peppermint on your tootsies!</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try using it after a shower with the Burt&#x27;s Bees Peppermint and Rosemary body wash for a super fresh, wake you up and make you feel energized combination!  </li>
            <li> The peppermint soothes and makes your feet feel cool.</li>
            <li> Good enough!</li>
            <li> This Peppermint foot lotion is the only thing that can make my feet feel good after a 14 hour day of standing.  </li>
            <li> Super sweet and pepperminty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It absorbs well and fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> When applying the lotion it is creamy (not greasy) and absorbs fairly quickly and does have the peppermint scent.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees really does it right on many of their products.</li>
            <li> honestly don&#x27;t think this does a whole lot more than regular lotion.</li>
            <li> Hope this helps and that you enjoy this as much as I have.&lt;br</li>
            <li> is by far my favorite;</li>
            <li> Definitely plan on buying this again and getting some for friends as well since this softens nicely and is affordable.</li>
            <li> I thought that with all the natural ingredients I should be okay</li>
            <li> It gives my dogs a fresh feeling, and I use it every night.</li>
            <li> Love the way this classically, natural, tingling recipe feels.</li>
            <li> I purchased more and plan on continued future use of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very fresh smelling, creamy, fast absorbing lotion that will leave your feet feeling, softer, and very fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> It is a rich, thick, creamy lotion that has great moisturizing properties.  </li>
            <li> I use it right before I put on socks.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees products are generally hit-or-miss: the hand salve and lip balms are excellent, while a lot of the body care items -- lotions, soaps, etc -- are uneven in quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It might be slightly more hydrating, but I don&#x27;t think that its really worth buying a separate product just for feet unless it works way better than plain lotion.</li>
            <li> Very soothing especially when the weather gets warm.</li>
            <li> The cream is very slippery but not greasy, and soaks into skin fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> The coconut is more of a thick translucent ointment, which is nice for intensive treatment with socks at night.</li>
            <li> I first tried Burt&#x27;s Bees Peppermint Foot Lotion when I got a free sample package of several Burt&#x27;s Bees products as a free gift with an office depot order.  </li>
            <li> It contains natural ingredients which was a huge plus for me and</li>
            <li> Love the peppermint fragrance and the cooling feeling on my feet, especially during the summer when the weather is hot.  </li>
            <li> You do need socks for wearing to bed though, because there is a residue left (a layer to sit on top of skin as a protectant)</li>
            <li> I also like to use it when I first get out of the shower in the mornings.</li>
            <li> The cooling sensation was....not present, in any meaningful sense.</li>
            <li> and your feet are smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I have tried many different brands of peppermint foot lotion</li>
            <li> Many foot lotions only moisturize your feet</li>
            <li> I only wish it had more of the consistency of the hand repair cream.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I&#x27;m in the shower I use a very strong exfoliant on my feet every single night.</li>
            <li> Or maybe I just love the product so much, that I use it constantly.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great for hot tired feet</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t want it on your sheets because some oils will stain certain fabrics and not ever come out.</li>
            <li> However, it certainly doesn&#x27;t take away how well this product works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And then all my aspirations for smooth, lovely, fragranced appendages fell flat: the peppermint smell is moderate, but not strong (though quite refreshing!).</li>
            <li> I suffer from multiple chronic pain issues, which travels to my feet, so utilizing peppermint on &amp;#34;tender&amp;#34; areas have huge benefits.</li>
            <li> Another great Burt&#x27;s product for my tired feet.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this foot lotion!</li>
            <li> I use to while massaging my feet before bed, and when I wake up my feet are so much smoother than before.</li>
            <li> I know Burt&#x27;s Bees has another foot lotion product designed for overnight use with socks, but this works very well too.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I sometimes don&#x27;t use the exfoliant and I use a pumice stone instead, depending on how much time I have.</li>
            <li> Softens skin and relieves tired feet (smells great, too...</li>
            <li> It really helps with foot odor problems.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely understand why she loves it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Although, it goes by fast.</li>
            <li> This one really goes beyond that and soothes the feet.</li>
            <li> I really hope it hasn&#x27;t been discontinued.</li>
            <li> It feels very soothing.</li>
            <li> I had used the coconut foot cream and was really looking forward to this one.</li>
            <li> It seems like it just sits on the skin rather than really moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Very relaxing, work just as it says.</li>
            <li> The peppermint gives your feet a very fresh and cooling sensation, and it really does make them much softer and smoother the next day.</li>
            <li> Though the lotion was nice - it was easy to apply, wasn&#x27;t greasy or clumpy or hard to rub in - it definitely did not have the effect that I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my feet a lot and in spite of wearing special insoles I need a daily foot lotion to bring my feet relief.</li>
            <li> Love the strong peppermint smell and the peppermint oil re-energizes tired over worked feet.</li>
            <li> Definitely has a nice, fresh, smell and cools down those heels!</li>
            <li> First of all this product is all natural.</li>
            <li> Just wish there were larger size as 3.38 ounces is used up quickly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I find that the quality of this lotion is high - as 8-10 hours after an application - I still feel the comfort of the lotion.</li>
            <li> Thickness is a little more dense than regular lotion worth a try</li>
            <li> I was expecting this to be something like icy hot with a cooling finish, but it is just hot.</li>
            <li> Also leaves your skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that would really soothe my hot achey legs after a long day of being in heels, and this product does not do that!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this foot lotion: the peppermint would be cooling and comfortable, the moisturizer would aid my dry feet.</li>
            <li> The only other foot lotion that I&#x27;ve liked as much as this one is The Body Shoppe&#x27;s peppermint foot lotion which is a bit more expensive.</li>
            <li> So I give back the half star :)</li>
            <li> and after I clear it up I use Jason vitamin e moisturizer to get rid of the remaining dryness.  </li>
            <li> I tend to have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> But I totally prefer Burt&#x27;s Bees Mama Bee Leg and Foot CrÃ¨me because it&#x27;s content of peppermint is much stronger</li>
            <li> It leaves my feet silky soft without feeling greasy or sticky.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of those old-fashioned, soft peppermint nougat candies you could get at Christmas.</li>
            <li> so soft on the skin, not oily.</li>
            <li> I also like this product because it&#x27;s 100% natural in a recycled container and made in the USA.</li>
            <li> I can not put this on sensitive parts of my body, like the tops of my feet.</li>
            <li> The smell is okay but not great, and the lotion lacks any real moisture.</li>
            <li> I also like to put a tiny dab behind ears and knees for a refreshing tingle!</li>
            <li> The peppermint is refreshing, but the lotion itself isn&#x27;t creamy or thick enough to make any difference on the feet.</li>
            <li> The lotion soothes, cools and hydrates dry and/or tired feet exceptionally well and helps rough areas become softer and smoother, though it will not affect hardened callouses that much.</li>
            <li> really works for dry skin of feet!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit pricey if you think about it, but it is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> He keeps the peppermint cream in the fridge so it really helps cool my tired feet.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I just have an overly sensitive nose and others will only smell the peppermint.</li>
            <li> but I love this product for tired, achy feet.</li>
            <li> The smell was subtle and it actually made my feet smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> and I find that I have to apply more lotion thirty minutes later because my feet are still tired.  </li>
            <li> It looses one star for the price (just a little too much) and the fact that I cannot find it locally.  </li>
            <li> The peppermint activates instantly and lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li> A tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This lotion works wonders on dry scaly feet in a short periodof times.  </li>
            <li> The lotion consistency is just thick enough and you don&#x27;t need a ton to really massage into your feet.</li>
            <li> It makes my feet smell fresh and feel soft, not to mention it leaves behind a slightly cooling sensation.</li>
            <li> her feet with this after a long day.</li>
            <li> and it did help with my dry skin and itchiness, but not profoundly.</li>
            <li> I inherited my dad&#x27;s feet when means their default state is dry and rough, sometimes even getting deep cracks.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m 37 weeks pregnant &amp; even more miserable!  </li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Peppermint Foot Lotion is the only product I&#x27;ve found that puts out the fire in my feet when they burn due to peripheral nueropathy.  </li>
            <li> My husband massages my feet after a very long shift.  </li>
            <li> During the summer, my feet get slightly dry, itchy, and irritated.</li>
            <li> There is nothing worse than hot feet in bed when you&#x27;re trying to fall asleep.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this product: I cannot put my socks on in the morning without applying it first.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a problem with very dry feet</li>
            <li> I recommend it for other kitchen workers, nurses, and anyone else who works long hours on their feet.</li>
            <li> I have used many other foot creams (everything to high end expensive brands, to mediocre ones) throughout my adulthood and BB&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I just massage a little bit into my feet and it creates instant relief.</li>
            <li> I also find that when my feet hurt it sort of dulls the pain a bit.  </li>
            <li> After applying the lotion as instructed, I expected to feel an immediate cooling sensation.</li>
            <li> , I found it evaporated/sunk into my skin without improving dryness or rough</li>
            <li> Thinner than expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the only products that work for my heavily callused feet when they start to crack and split.</li>
            <li> Thick and smooth texture, doesn&#x27;t run off like thin, watery lotions.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I was a little disappointed with the scent.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t purchase again; I&#x27;ll try other manufacturers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too greasy like other lotions; the differences are seen immediately.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other foot moisturizers, but it seemed like it&#x27;s not absorbed by the thicker skin that my feet had.  </li>
            <li> This may sound weird, but if my feet are dry &amp; tired, I have difficulties sleeping at night.</li>
            <li> The only reason why I keep this is for the tingle effect and smell, which relaxes my tired feet after a long day.</li>
            <li> The peppermint also helped eliminate the &#x27;sour&#x27; odor on my feet that I was born with.  </li>
            <li> and I put on some thick cotton socks that I only use for wearing at night with lotions.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s sometimes hard to find locally for any less than a premium price.  </li>
            <li> It will stain your socks, like previous reviewers stated, so keep a pair separate from the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use it probably 3 times a week and have a lot less complaints about what was a chronic problem for me.  </li>
            <li> If I could take away half a star, I would because of the rosemary scent.</li>
            <li> Not as minty as I would like, just mix a few drops of peppermint oil</li>
            <li> A few nights of using this lotion and putting socks on to keep it there</li>
            <li> Flip flops wearing is my fave past time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a slight tingle to it when rubbed onto feet, and the scent is soothing and relaxing when you feel tired.</li>
            <li> I work in the restaurant industry, so I&#x27;m on my feet for 9+ hours a day on hard tile floors.</li>
            <li> I felt almost no cooling sensation, which was really disappointing, since that&#x27;s the specific reason I ordered it for.</li>
            <li> I truly like how this foot lotion is thick.</li>
            <li> This is a must for your usual foot/pedicure routine!</li>
            <li> That meant dry toes and drier toes in the cold months.  </li>
            <li> I could detect the subtle scent of the rosemary.</li>
            <li> I bought this for nightly hand &amp; foot massages during my last month of pregnancy, &amp; within a few days, I broke out in a horrible rash anywhere I used this product!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have had difficulties finding this in the stores lately.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the quality of this product, simply because the smell is so terrible that the quality doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t put my finger on the scent that truly isn&#x27;t unpleasant, but not exactly pleasant.</li>
            <li> Greasy and not refreshing at all, nothing but an unpleasant burning sensation. :(</li>
            <li> Add walking around campus, a retail job, and running, they can get scary!</li>
            <li> but I had a horrible rash from using this lotion!</li>
            <li> So disappointed!!</li>
            <li> Sometimes I get terrible insomnia, but I rub this in before bedtime</li>
            <li> And worst of all, the moisturizing properties just didn&#x27;t cut it: after using a pumice stone in the shower, and then applying the peppermint lotion</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Another great Burt&#x27;s product for my tired feet.  Nice peppermint sent and soothing when applied to feet after being inside my work boots for 10 hrs. ...</li>
            <li> Wow! This foot lotion is AMAZING! The peppermint activates instantly and lasts quite a long time. The lotion consistency is just thick enough and you don&#x27;t need a ton to really massage into your feet. I suffer from multiple chronic pain issues, which travels to my feet, so utilizing peppermint on &amp;#34;tender&amp;#34; areas have huge benefits. I even massage some onto my legs at night, which I love. Burt&#x27;s Bees really does it right on many of their products. Hope this helps and that you enjoy this as much as I have.&lt;br /&gt;PS. I have used many other foot creams (everything to high end expensive brands, to mediocre ones) throughout my adulthood and BB&#x27;s is by far my favorite; fair price, too.</li>
            <li> Love it, wonderful cooling sensation and softens the skin nicely.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly! This foot lotion is excellent. It contains natural ingredients which was a huge plus for me and the smell is so scrumptious. Reminds me of candy canes with a hint of spice from moms kitchen. Thick and smooth texture, doesn&#x27;t run off like thin, watery lotions. Definitely plan on buying this again and getting some for friends as well since this softens nicely and is affordable.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Peppermint Foot Lotion is the only product I&#x27;ve found that puts out the fire in my feet when they burn due to peripheral nueropathy.  It&#x27;s even better if you keep it in the refrigerator!</li>
            <li> This lotion is great for hot tired feet</li>
            <li> Best foot lotion ever!</li>
            <li> I love most Burt&#x27;s Bees products, but this one is a really great find.  Very soothing especially when the weather gets warm.</li>
            <li> Great minty smell for lasting fresh feet!!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do anything for my callouses, but I love the tingly sensation.  The most amazing think I should mention though is that it is the ONLY thing that helps when I have a psoriasis/exzema break out on my hands.  This stuff clears it up and after I clear it up I use Jason vitamin e moisturizer to get rid of the remaining dryness.  Good anti-fungal, not the best moisturizer, though it does moisturize, too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the quality of this product, simply because the smell is so terrible that the quality doesn&#x27;t matter. Every time I rubbed this on my feet, it smelled like I was dousing myself with Mylanta. I would avoid this at all costs.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for keeping the feet soft and comfortable. The scent is pleasant and it works well on my hands too. It is getting challenging to always find this in the stores so to be able to find this on Amazon is great.</li>
            <li> Love the strong peppermint smell and the peppermint oil re-energizes tired over worked feet.</li>
            <li> This is the best foot lotion ever!! After a long day at work and being on my feet all day, it feels so good! It is so minty that your entire room will smell like peppermint.</li>
            <li> This lotion is so soothing and cooling, I don&#x27;t know what more I can say about it.  I also find that when my feet hurt it sort of dulls the pain a bit.  Plus the smell is amazing.  It looses one star for the price (just a little too much) and the fact that I cannot find it locally.  Not that I mind buying from Amazon, but this is an item that I would like to pick up at the store sometimes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a problem with very dry feet so I can&#x27;t speak to that, but I love this product for tired, achy feet. I work in the restaurant industry, so I&#x27;m on my feet for 9+ hours a day on hard tile floors. At the end of the day, a foot rub with this lotion is about the best thing ever; I love the tingly effect and the fragrance of the peppermint and menthol. I recommend it for other kitchen workers, nurses, and anyone else who works long hours on their feet.</li>
            <li> My daughter swears by this product.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find Dr. Scholl&#x27;s peppermint foot lotion so I tried Burt&#x27;s Bees.  It&#x27;s okay but doesn&#x27;t have the tingle like the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s.  I won&#x27;t purchase again; I&#x27;ll try other manufacturers.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product....  I think it got discontinued everywhere...  and i got it here and very happy I did... it works great on your feet..</li>
            <li> I tend to have sensitive skin.  I thought that with all the natural ingredients I should be okay but I had a horrible rash from using this lotion!</li>
            <li> This foot cream is excellent. The peppermint soothes and makes your feet feel cool. Also leaves your skin very soft.</li>
            <li> This was okay. But I totally prefer Burt&#x27;s Bees Mama Bee Leg and Foot CrÃ¨me because it&#x27;s content of peppermint is much stronger and you can feel the peppermint tingle on your skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this foot lotion! I use to while massaging my feet before bed, and when I wake up my feet are so much smoother than before. I know Burt&#x27;s Bees has another foot lotion product designed for overnight use with socks, but this works very well too. The smell is refreshing but not overpowering. I intend to order more!</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this product. During the summer, my feet get slightly dry, itchy, and irritated. After applying the lotion as instructed, I expected to feel an immediate cooling sensation. Though the lotion was nice - it was easy to apply, wasn&#x27;t greasy or clumpy or hard to rub in - it definitely did not have the effect that I was expecting. I felt almost no cooling sensation, which was really disappointing, since that&#x27;s the specific reason I ordered it for. I used it for about a week and it did help with my dry skin and itchiness, but not profoundly.</li>
            <li> I bought this for nightly hand &amp; foot massages during my last month of pregnancy, &amp; within a few days, I broke out in a horrible rash anywhere I used this product!  Now I&#x27;m 37 weeks pregnant &amp; even more miserable!  So disappointed!!</li>
            <li> Fantastic foot cream!  Great smell and feels great on your feet.</li>
            <li> I was not that impressed with this product! I wanted something that would really soothe my hot achey legs after a long day of being in heels, and this product does not do that! I did however find a Shaklee cream that is for the joints that works amazing on both hot tried legs and feet, and that I love!</li>
            <li> Flip flops wearing is my fave past time.  If I&#x27;m not wearing shoes, I&#x27;m wearing flip flops.  That meant dry toes and drier toes in the cold months.  I&#x27;ve tried other foot moisturizers, but it seemed like it&#x27;s not absorbed by the thicker skin that my feet had.  So I turn to a trusted brand - Burt Bee&#x27;s.  After my first application, I fell in love with it.  It&#x27;s a little bit pricey if you think about it, but it is well worth the money.  The peppermint also helped eliminate the &#x27;sour&#x27; odor on my feet that I was born with.  So it&#x27;s not just effective foot lotion, but also a foot deodorizer.</li>
            <li> Good enough! Smell refreshing and not so sticky, best for the summer days.</li>
            <li> Product smells great and softens feet when used regularly.</li>
            <li> Not as minty as I would like, just mix a few drops of peppermint oil and you&#x27;ll get the desired effect:</li>
            <li> My wife approves of me buying this and massaging it into her feet. I approve of the brownie points I accumulate by doing so.</li>
            <li> This lotion goes on easily, feels silky, makes a great massage cream, and the peppermint refreshes my brain as well as my feet! My local pharmacy can&#x27;t seem to keep it in stock, or I would buy it locally; thank heavens for the online back-up! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I work on my feet for 8+ hours a day, and this lotion is literally the BEST thing I can do for my aching feet when I get home. I just massage a little bit into my feet and it creates instant relief. Love it!</li>
            <li> i had never used this before and was pleasantly suprised.  it was so smooth and the peppermint fragrance is wonderful.  i would like to see the manufacturer make a bigger container of it</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I got it in a gift bag, and decided to use it on my elbows, it works great all over and the smell is great and it is tingly and nice!</li>
            <li> It leaves my feet silky soft without feeling greasy or sticky. It absorbs well and fairly quickly. My feet feel rejuvenated and tingly. Best of all, I sleep like a baby!  Sometimes I get terrible insomnia, but I rub this in before bedtime and I get a full night&#x27;s sleep!  It is wonderful. I love everthing about this product!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it when I massage her feet and she loves it even more when I use this. Make your wife happy, do the massage her feet with this after a long day.</li>
            <li> First of all this product is all natural. Secondly, it was not tested on animals. Thirdly, itâ€™s perfect for your feet. It leaves them moisturized and refreshed. I use it every night before bed. Great quality and very efficient. I would recommended to anyone. Even my husbandâ€™s likes it :)</li>
            <li> love this stuff and Amazon price is better than Walmart</li>
            <li> This lotion is soothing and smells Devine.</li>
            <li> Love the peppermint fragrance and the cooling feeling on my feet, especially during the summer when the weather is hot.  Keeps my feet sufficiently moisturized and smelling great!  Thank you for the prompt delivery!</li>
            <li> This stuff has such a great scent! It reminds me of those old-fashioned, soft peppermint nougat candies you could get at Christmas. I loved those, and this lotion smells just like them. Super sweet and pepperminty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a slight tingle to it when rubbed onto feet, and the scent is soothing and relaxing when you feel tired. The cream is very slippery but not greasy, and soaks into skin fairly quickly. You do need socks for wearing to bed though, because there is a residue left (a layer to sit on top of skin as a protectant) and you don&#x27;t want it on your sheets because some oils will stain certain fabrics and not ever come out. I&#x27;ve never had this lotion stain anything, but I&#x27;m not taking any chances!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is really great if you have issues with foot odor, as peppermint is said to help with those types of problems. I have no experience with this but have heard from others that peppermint creams and sprays help foot odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;m in the shower I use a very strong exfoliant on my feet every single night. I sometimes don&#x27;t use the exfoliant and I use a pumice stone instead, depending on how much time I have. Then I put the foot creme on and I put on some thick cotton socks that I only use for wearing at night with lotions. It will stain your socks, like previous reviewers stated, so keep a pair separate from the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly don&#x27;t think this does a whole lot more than regular lotion. It might be slightly more hydrating, but I don&#x27;t think that its really worth buying a separate product just for feet unless it works way better than plain lotion. The only reason why I keep this is for the tingle effect and smell, which relaxes my tired feet after a long day.</li>
            <li> Softens skin and relieves tired feet (smells great, too...if you like peppermint :).  It&#x27;s still my favorite foot lotion after many years.</li>
            <li> People often neglect to take care of their feet, even people who obsess over the rest of their bodies. This peppermint foot lotion has a great light smell and makes the feet tingle a bet. It gives my dogs a fresh feeling, and I use it every night. I use the coconut version, which is thicker, at night -- a great one-two punch.</li>
            <li> I use this lotion every night and my feet feel great. I also like to use it when I first get out of the shower in the mornings. I wear heels all day and it helps my feet to feel smooth and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Personally, I mostly use this peppermint foot lotion at night while sleeping, but have used it during the day as well. The results are great. The lotion soothes, cools and hydrates dry and/or tired feet exceptionally well and helps rough areas become softer and smoother, though it will not affect hardened callouses that much. When applying the lotion it is creamy (not greasy) and absorbs fairly quickly and does have the peppermint scent. I have used this for a couple of years and like the fact I can get it here at Amazon as many retailers don&#x27;t seem to carry it.</li>
            <li> It really helps with foot odor problems. I use it probably 3 times a week and have a lot less complaints about what was a chronic problem for me.  I like it enough to subscribe to have it sent regularly.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this foot lotion: the peppermint would be cooling and comfortable, the moisturizer would aid my dry feet. It would be a luxurious experience. Burt&#x27;s Bees products are generally hit-or-miss: the hand salve and lip balms are excellent, while a lot of the body care items -- lotions, soaps, etc -- are uneven in quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then all my aspirations for smooth, lovely, fragranced appendages fell flat: the peppermint smell is moderate, but not strong (though quite refreshing!). The cooling sensation was....not present, in any meaningful sense. And worst of all, the moisturizing properties just didn&#x27;t cut it: after using a pumice stone in the shower, and then applying the peppermint lotion, I found it evaporated/sunk into my skin without improving dryness or rough skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll finish up the tube, but wouldn&#x27;t re-purchase the product.</li>
            <li> Really good for rubbing on your feet if you have plantar facititis.</li>
            <li> This lotion was perfect for using on my feet before bedtime during the summer. It makes my feet smell fresh and feel soft, not to mention it leaves behind a slightly cooling sensation. There is nothing worse than hot feet in bed when you&#x27;re trying to fall asleep.</li>
            <li> ohhhhh how it tingles.  And it smells so lovely.  Just thinking about it I want to go give myself a pedicure finishing up with this stuff and plastic bags for 10 minutes at the end.  A really nice product, would make a good gift.  I used it on my husband and he loved it too, not too girly.</li>
            <li> The best! A foot massage with this makes you feel like you died and went to heaven!</li>
            <li> I have bought Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm and hand lotion before, and I am very satisfied with both. This, however, has become my favorite product. The peppermint gives your feet a very fresh and cooling sensation, and it really does make them much softer and smoother the next day. I am addicted to this product: I cannot put my socks on in the morning without applying it first.</li>
            <li> Thinner than expected.</li>
            <li> Thickness is a little more dense than regular lotion worth a try</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It really works and as an added bonus it smells good. It&#x27;s not too greasy like other lotions; the differences are seen immediately. My feet are silky smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> This is a favorite for my mom so I buy it for her every birthday and holiday.  I&#x27;ve used it too and I absolutely understand why she loves it.  A few nights of using this lotion and putting socks on to keep it there and your feet are smooth and soft. I love that there&#x27;s a product so effective that also isn&#x27;t tested on animals.  Burt&#x27;s Bees is a FANTASTIC company.</li>
            <li> This is the best treatment I have found for cracked heels. I have tried all kinds of lotions and creams, but none do the job that this one does. With regular nightly use my cracked heels \\&quot;heal\\&quot;! When I&#x27;d been using it for a while the gal who does my pedicures at the salon could see the difference. For a while I could no longer find this product and my feet suffered.  So glad to find it on Amazon and NO SHIPPING cost or tax with my Amazon Prime. It&#x27;s cheaper than I paid buying it at my local store. Regardless of what others say, it has a pleasant fresh smell, sort of minty, and does give your feet a cool feel, though not overly so. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> really works for dry skin of feet!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!!! Although, it goes by fast. Or maybe I just love the product so much, that I use it constantly. ;)</li>
            <li> Great product for price.  Smells good and excellent price.  Smooths the footsies as well.  Packaged well, will purchase again when needed.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Peppermint Foot Lotion is my absolute favorite foot lotion of all! I have tried many different brands of peppermint foot lotion &amp; I keep going back to this one. This may sound weird, but if my feet are dry &amp; tired, I have difficulties sleeping at night. Many foot lotions only moisturize your feet and I find that I have to apply more lotion thirty minutes later because my feet are still tired.  This one really goes beyond that and soothes the feet. The peppermint oil &amp; menthol leave a pleasant tingling sensation as well as a nice scent. It leaves my feet feeling refreshed. Unfortunately, I have had difficulties finding this in the stores lately. I really hope it hasn&#x27;t been discontinued. I am thrilled to find that it&#x27;s available on Amazon! The only other foot lotion that I&#x27;ve liked as much as this one is The Body Shoppe&#x27;s peppermint foot lotion which is a bit more expensive.</li>
            <li> I was really happy to find out that I could find this stuff on Amazon.  My wife and I have used it for years and it&#x27;s sometimes hard to find locally for any less than a premium price.  It&#x27;s one of the only products that work for my heavily callused feet when they start to crack and split.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It soothes my burning feet .  I have diabetes and my feet were burning and tingling in the night.  They don&#x27;t do that anymore if I use this lotion before bedtime.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I only wish it had more of the consistency of the hand repair cream.</li>
            <li> This lotion works wonders on dry scaly feet in a short periodof times.  I highly recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> This has a cooling and calming effect when rubbed onto the feet and toes.  Better than the coconut Foot Lotion, as this is not oily.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. It has a wonderful invigorating smell. I use it for aromatherapy and it has the perfect texture for massage.</li>
            <li> smells edible, like fresh peppermint! wakes you up! so soft on the skin, not oily. use this on elbows, knees, and heels.</li>
            <li> I have neuropathy in my feet and this lotion works great for relieving the burning I experience at night.  I have been using this product for over a year and love it.</li>
            <li> Love the scent of this product. works great for my feet.</li>
            <li> More peppermint please!!!!!</li>
            <li> My favorite and great price!</li>
            <li> This Peppermint foot lotion is the only thing that can make my feet feel good after a 14 hour day of standing.  My husband massages my feet after a very long shift.  He keeps the peppermint cream in the fridge so it really helps cool my tired feet.</li>
            <li> LOVE this...its my magic weapon under my socks ,stockings and pantyhose..makes me feel  SOooooo amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I give my boyfriend &amp;#34;I LOVE YOU&amp;#34;  foot massages..with this he is in heaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my all time FAVORITE.</li>
            <li> I have to be honest. I truly like how this foot lotion is thick. It spreads nicely and I even have spread it upwards onto my ankles and lower legs. It feels very soothing. Honestly, I was a little disappointed with the scent. I was expecting it to be more pepperminty. I just couldn&#x27;t put my finger on the scent that truly isn&#x27;t unpleasant, but not exactly pleasant. So, I read the ingredients. It&#x27;s rosemary leaf extract! Now I know why I started  thinking about being in my Nonna&#x27;s kitchen...I could detect the subtle scent of the rosemary. I don&#x27;t know why that would be in a peppermint product. I love peppermint and this product is not overly scented. I wish I could smell only the peppermint. However, it certainly doesn&#x27;t take away how well this product works. I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase. If I could take away half a star, I would because of the rosemary scent. Perhaps I just have an overly sensitive nose and others will only smell the peppermint. I also like this product because it&#x27;s 100% natural in a recycled container and made in the USA. So I give back the half star :)</li>
            <li> This lotion keeps my feet smelling good and feeling comfortable.  I have been using it for several years and it is a wonderful item to get via Subscribe and Save.  I use it after my shower.  It feels the very best when socks are put on afterward, but it is also very nice to use when I am wearing sandals.  It is my favorite of all the products Burt&#x27;s Bees makes!</li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my feet smell better but I don&#x27;t think it moisturizes as well as Dr. Teal&#x27;s foot lotion.  It is easier to find in stores, also.</li>
            <li> Best foot lotion I have used</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees! I wouldn&#x27;t rely on anything else. I&#x27;m on my feet a lot and in spite of wearing special insoles I need a daily foot lotion to bring my feet relief. I find that the quality of this lotion is high - as 8-10 hours after an application - I still feel the comfort of the lotion. Great product! Very happy with it!</li>
            <li> My feet don&#x27;t feel like mine unless I use this lotion.  A tiny bit goes a long way. I have to use it every time I bathe it feels so good.  It&#x27;s soothing and tingly.  I&#x27;m a runner so anything that makes my feet feel that good I have to have abundantly.</li>
            <li> I first tried Burt&#x27;s Bees Peppermint Foot Lotion when I got a free sample package of several Burt&#x27;s Bees products as a free gift with an office depot order.  I have some allergic eczema issues on one of my feet and I would apply this peppermint foot lotion after doing my nightly foot soak to aid in the softening of the skin and it made my feet feel wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so pleased with this product, but then again as far as I am concerned I am very pleased with ALL the Burt&#x27;s Bees products I have tried.  After my sample tube of Burt&#x27;s Bees Peppermint Foot Lotion was gone I purchased more and plan on continued future use of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very fresh smelling, creamy, fast absorbing lotion that will leave your feet feeling, softer, and very fresh and clean.  It offered lasting softness and moisture as well which I find important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try using it after a shower with the Burt&#x27;s Bees Peppermint and Rosemary body wash for a super fresh, wake you up and make you feel energized combination!  The peppermint scent is not too overbearing in fact I find it very pleasant and the fact that their products are 100% natural really means a great deal to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust in Burt&#x27;s Bees and liven your morning with fresh peppermint on your tootsies!</li>
            <li> Love the way this classically, natural, tingling recipe feels. It has ALWAYS been a fave for years.</li>
            <li> Greasy and not refreshing at all, nothing but an unpleasant burning sensation. :(</li>
            <li> Soothing pepermint cream and helps to control foot bacteria. Just wish there were larger size as 3.38 ounces is used up quickly.</li>
            <li> I felt so pampered after using this product.  The smell was subtle and it actually made my feet smooth and soft.  This is a must for your usual foot/pedicure routine!</li>
            <li> I had used the coconut foot cream and was really looking forward to this one. I was not disappointed. This lotion has a cooling sensation. It&#x27;s different from the coconut lotion. The coconut is more of a thick translucent ointment, which is nice for intensive treatment with socks at night. This one is a traditional lotion that is wonderful at any hour.</li>
            <li> I inherited my dad&#x27;s feet when means their default state is dry and rough, sometimes even getting deep cracks. Add walking around campus, a retail job, and running, they can get scary! One application and I&#x27;m already seeing some improvement, plus the product has a refreshing peppermint smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering, and it&#x27;s all-natural so no chemicals!</li>
            <li> I LOVE Burts Bees and I recommend this foot lotion for the summer months. Definitely has a nice, fresh, smell and cools down those heels!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! It&#x27;s rich, but not greasy, smells wonderful of peppermint and gives your skin fresh cool and tingling.</li>
            <li> I like the peppermint feeling and smell.</li>
            <li> The smell is okay but not great, and the lotion lacks any real moisture. It seems like it just sits on the skin rather than really moisturizing. I needed something for my swollen feet during pregnancy, but this didn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Burt&#x27;s Bees foot cream for years.  Love it, it is cooling and refreshing, and moisturising, too!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This lotion is perfect for helping to avoid smelly feet. I use it right before I put on socks.</li>
            <li> Refreshing moisture softening lotion I look forward to putting on soon as I step out of shower. If you wear socks it seals in the moisture. I also like to put a tiny dab behind ears and knees for a refreshing tingle!</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Very relaxing, work just as it says. I love the smell too!</li>
            <li> If you like the scent of peppermint and a great moisturizer, this is for you!  It is a rich, thick, creamy lotion that has great moisturizing properties.  I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this to be something like icy hot with a cooling finish, but it is just hot. I can not put this on sensitive parts of my body, like the tops of my feet.</li>
            <li> The peppermint is refreshing, but the lotion itself isn&#x27;t creamy or thick enough to make any difference on the feet.</li>
