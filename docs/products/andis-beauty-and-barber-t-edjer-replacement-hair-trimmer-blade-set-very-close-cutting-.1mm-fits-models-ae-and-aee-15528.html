            <li>I have used the TEdger for years and the best price for replacement blades has been Amazon.</li>
            <li>great product</li>
            <li>Great</li>
            <li>Easy to install, awesome sharpness, great value.</li>
            <li>– compressed air does a good job.  </li>
            <li>Works great, price was good and it was easy to install and align.</li>
            <li>great fit, works well</li>
            <li>I love this blade, and for the price its perfect, I use it almost everyday, it&#x27;s sharp and came as advertised, great product.</li>
            <li>Much better than buying new clippers each time.</li>
            <li>This item is and exact replacement.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like having a new pair of clippers.</li>
            <li>The blade wasn&#x27;t as sharp as the original blade.</li>
            <li>Professional product designed for the novice!</li>
            <li>so you will need to adjust it if your looking for super sharp lines but after installing this blade my trimmers are like new.</li>
            <li>Clearly, the blades will last much longer if you use oil to minimize wear.  </li>
            <li>The replacement is done very easily and I can feel the difference between the new sharp blades and the old dull blades.  </li>
            <li>Once again these exactly what i expected.</li>
            <li>Upon first use, the sharp blade provided a clean/close edge</li>
            <li>I had a set of old blades sharpened once by a local shop.  </li>
            <li>The sharpened blades were just a tad better than before sharpening - so it was not worth the money or trouble of having them sharpened.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sharp and didn&#x27;t look new</li>

            <li> great fit, works well</li>
            <li> I have used the TEdger for years and the best price for replacement blades has been Amazon. Thank you Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Easy to install, awesome sharpness, great value. Speedy delivery!</li>
            <li> Works great, price was good and it was easy to install and align. It&#x27;s like having a new pair of clippers. I would definitely recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I have owned a set of clippers for ~ 25 years and have replaced the blade set every couple of years.  The replacement is done very easily and I can feel the difference between the new sharp blades and the old dull blades.  I had a set of old blades sharpened once by a local shop.  The sharpened blades were just a tad better than before sharpening - so it was not worth the money or trouble of having them sharpened.  Clearly, the blades will last much longer if you use oil to minimize wear.  And the clippers will also last longer if they are cleaned periodically – compressed air does a good job.  The only complaint is that the replacement blades seem to me to be a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> The blade I received seemed to be used.  They were very dull, so I used them once an threw them out.</li>
            <li> Once again these exactly what i expected. They just need to be adjusted for a closer cut</li>
            <li> andis speak for its self....great product</li>
            <li> The blade wasn&#x27;t as sharp as the original blade.</li>
            <li> Much better than buying new clippers each time. Just replace the blades periodically. Extends the life of the clippers. Great</li>
            <li> Professional product designed for the novice!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sharp and didn&#x27;t look new</li>

            <li> The replacement blade works as described.  You won&#x27;t be disappointment with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Used. Dirty. But sharp.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong with the real thing. This blade is made by andis for andis clippers. It&#x27;s a factory blade so you will need to adjust it if your looking for super sharp lines but after installing this blade my trimmers are like new.</li>
            <li> This item is and exact replacement.</li>
