            <li>EXCELLENT AND A GOOD PRICE</li>
            <li>Great blades, I&#x27;ve gotten a couple of weeks out of one of these blades.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t believe how happy my 90</li>
            <li>Amazon is a great site to get hard-to-find items like the Schick blades.</li>
            <li>great just what I ordered</li>
            <li>This is just a consistently great product.</li>
            <li>but still a good buy.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with product and delivery time.</li>
            <li>you get a nice shave</li>
            <li>Too many blades get in the way of a good shave.</li>
            <li>but they are as good or better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>It does a good job but be prepared to spend a LOT more time in the morning shaving for a SLIGHTLY better shave.  </li>
            <li>I have an old fashioned razor from my mom that gives the best shaves and I didn&#x27;t want to part with it.</li>
            <li>This was my first try with the Schick SE razor and these blades worked great.</li>
            <li>enjoyed this purchase</li>
            <li>Sure...</li>
            <li>+OUTSTANDING SERVICE.</li>
            <li>I can see now that this razor racket is nothing but a razor&#x27;s edge conspiracy, which is designed to force people to buy five times as many razors as they should have to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am glad amazon had them.  </li>
            <li>This is the same great and functional product it&#x27;s always been when we could buy it in the store.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the blades</li>
            <li>and I got a close, comfortable shave with them.  </li>
            <li>Please keep the blades  available.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you so much!!!</li>
            <li>They work perfectly and give me at least 2 to 3 weeks of shaves per blade before replacing.  </li>
            <li>I am one of those loyal customers that finds a product and stays with it for years.</li>
            <li>So thanks Amazon for being there for him!!</li>
            <li>Good quality, as expected.</li>
            <li>I like Schick blades because they are always sharp and each blade is good for a lot of shaves.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many times to find an equal razor, either blades or electric without success.  </li>
            <li>you very much</li>
            <li>Side note, if there is not a blade in the razor when you install the first blade, it will get damaged.</li>
            <li>Product arrived timely and was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>They originally coerced women to shave their legs through a phony advertising campaign in the early twentieth century.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the Injector Blades by Schick for my husband he really likes them.</li>
            <li>I decided to try out this method of shaving because of the expense of the modern razors.  </li>
            <li>The stiptick pencil doesn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li>I think I will try using this blade on my face and a modern razor on my neck.  </li>
            <li>All a man really needs for a close shave is one blade, not three or four.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>/&gt;Women should stop shaving their legs and arm pits in protest and to show their contempt for the modern razor companies.  </li>
            <li>at least twenty good shaves from one blade before it is time to change.  </li>
            <li>They last for weeks at a time and give the closest shave that I cannot find given the other &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; razors that are available at most pharmacy&#x27;s today.</li>
            <li>I was glad to get them, but not as sharp as they once were.</li>
            <li>Amazon is currently the only reputable place that I can find these blades for purchase.  </li>
            <li>and wow there they were!!</li>
            <li>I found these blades to be sharp and smooth</li>
            <li>I could have used the blade longer than 2 weeks, but just wanted to see the difference with a new blade.</li>
            <li>They are becoming harder to find in local drug stores but the internet has lots of places to get them.  </li>
            <li>yr old dad is that I found the blades.</li>
            <li>I do not like the new plastic throw-away razor blades that are offered in the stores especially the ones with a self discharging creams.</li>
            <li>ONE OF THE BLADES  WAS NOT VERY SHARP......</li>
            <li>You will have to waste the first blade, as I understand that is just the way these razors work.</li>
            <li>Not sure it&#x27;s worth it to save 20-30 bucks a month.  </li>

            <li> These injector blades were not very sharp and did not last very long.  </li>
            <li> They are made in China and are not as sharp as the old originals</li>

            <li> Blades work as expected</li>
            <li> The reason I started using an old fashioned injector razor was because I erroneously believed that the blades were considerably sharper and lasted longer than the garbage razors you buy today.  </li>

            <li> Instead of a 3 minute mediocre shave with the current razors...</li>
            <li> I usually do two passes in each shave</li>
            <li> It is getting hard to find razor blades for the antiquated blade holder.</li>
            <li> you will be spending about 15-20 minutes shaving SLOWLY.  </li>
            <li> Impossible to purchase locally.  </li>
            <li> Finding replacement injector blades for my trusty Schick razor proved difficult.  </li>
            <li> Lots of bloody tissues and waiting before you can put a shirt on.  </li>
            <li> Take your time or you will be nursing the bloody neck bites for 30 minutes.  </li>

            <li> I can never find these in the drug store or the markets so I said let me check Amazon and wow there they were!! My husbands face is tough and the injector blades are the only thing that works on his face. So thanks Amazon for being there for him!!</li>
            <li> This is the same great and functional product it&#x27;s always been when we could buy it in the store.</li>
            <li> These are the only blades that my husband wants to use and they have become hard to find in retail stores.  Very happy that I now can order them online.</li>
            <li> very sharp and hold their edge.no coplaints</li>
            <li> Great blades, I&#x27;ve gotten a couple of weeks out of one of these blades. I usually change DE blades every 3-4 days. This was my first try with the Schick SE razor and these blades worked great. I could have used the blade longer than 2 weeks, but just wanted to see the difference with a new blade. It is a little harsh at first, but smoothes out after a few shaves (YMMV). Side note, if there is not a blade in the razor when you install the first blade, it will get damaged. You will have to waste the first blade, as I understand that is just the way these razors work.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using Schick Injector blades forever.  We are retired.  I couldn&#x27;t find them anymore.  That is the only type of razor my husband uses.  He likes the shave Schick gives him - no cuts.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the blades</li>
            <li> just as  was expected</li>
            <li> I ordered the Injector Blades by Schick for my husband he really likes them. He checked in every store and couldn&#x27;t find them .Thanks to Amazon. I was please with my second order of a product for roses bushes. The product was Propicomazole,a fungicide.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product and delivery time. Thank you.</li>
            <li> enjoyed this purchase</li>
            <li> Good quality, as expected.</li>
            <li> they are razor blades... still won&#x27;t make me coffee in the morning</li>
            <li> I decided to try out this method of shaving because of the expense of the modern razors.  It does a good job but be prepared to spend a LOT more time in the morning shaving for a SLIGHTLY better shave.  Instead of a 3 minute mediocre shave with the current razors...you will be spending about 15-20 minutes shaving SLOWLY.  Also, nicks on the neck take a long time to fix.  The stiptick pencil doesn&#x27;t do much.  Lots of bloody tissues and waiting before you can put a shirt on.  You will have bloody collars for sure.  Take your time or you will be nursing the bloody neck bites for 30 minutes.  Sure...you get a nice shave but, man, it&#x27;s a lot of work.  Not sure it&#x27;s worth it to save 20-30 bucks a month.  I think I will try using this blade on my face and a modern razor on my neck.  The compromise might work...good luck!</li>
            <li> All a man really needs for a close shave is one blade, not three or four. Too many blades get in the way of a good shave. I like Schick blades because they are always sharp and each blade is good for a lot of shaves.</li>
            <li> Could NOT find these ANY place ELSE! TY AMAZON!</li>
            <li> Product arrived timely and was exactly what I was looking for. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> These blades are perfect for those vintage injector razors.  They are becoming harder to find in local drug stores but the internet has lots of places to get them.  I found these blades to be sharp and smooth and I got a close, comfortable shave with them.  I usually do two passes in each shave and I can get at least twenty good shaves from one blade before it is time to change.  Each person may have different results but I think you will like them.</li>
            <li> My dad will only use his Schick Injector to shave. You can&#x27;t believe how happy my 90+ yr old dad is that I found the blades. Happy happy happy!!!!</li>
            <li> +OUTSTANDING SERVICE. PRODUCT MET MY EXPECTATIONS. THANKS</li>
            <li> It is getting hard to find razor blades for the antiquated blade holder. I do not like the new plastic throw-away razor blades that are offered in the stores especially the ones with a self discharging creams. They meke me feel greasy. I can&#x27;t find the Schick Platinum Pluss blades so the regular ones will have to work for now. Amazon is a great site to get hard-to-find items like the Schick blades. Gil</li>
            <li> Blades work as expected</li>
            <li> These injector blades were not very sharp and did not last very long.  The reason I started using an old fashioned injector razor was because I erroneously believed that the blades were considerably sharper and lasted longer than the garbage razors you buy today.  I can see now that this razor racket is nothing but a razor&#x27;s edge conspiracy, which is designed to force people to buy five times as many razors as they should have to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Women should stop shaving their legs and arm pits in protest and to show their contempt for the modern razor companies.  They originally coerced women to shave their legs through a phony advertising campaign in the early twentieth century.  Anyway, I like women with hairy legs.  They look animalistic.</li>
            <li> Made the family very happy !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much</li>
            <li> Impossible to purchase locally.  Works perfectly in my Vietnam era Schick razor.</li>
            <li> Amazon is currently the only reputable place that I can find these blades for purchase.  They last for weeks at a time and give the closest shave that I cannot find given the other &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; razors that are available at most pharmacy&#x27;s today.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT AND A GOOD PRICE</li>
            <li> everything i wanted thank you.</li>
            <li> ONE OF THE BLADES  WAS NOT VERY SHARP......NEED CONSISTENCY AND/OR QUALITY INSPECTIONS.......</li>
            <li> great just what I ordered</li>
            <li> I was glad to get them, but not as sharp as they once were.</li>
            <li> I am one of those loyal customers that finds a product and stays with it for years. I have an old fashioned razor from my mom that gives the best shaves and I didn&#x27;t want to part with it. I&#x27;ve searched stores for these blades for years but they discontinued these. I am glad amazon had them.  I am thrilled!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Schick injector razor(s) for almost 50 years. Other blades have come and gone and these are about all you will find but they are as good or better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried. This is just a consistently great product.</li>
            <li> They were as represented and had the lowest price that I could find. They are made in China and are not as sharp as the old originals but still a good buy.</li>
            <li> Finding replacement injector blades for my trusty Schick razor proved difficult.  When I found these blades on Amazon, I bought multiple packs.  They work perfectly and give me at least 2 to 3 weeks of shaves per blade before replacing.  I&#x27;ve been using the same razor for over 50 years and I&#x27;ve tried many times to find an equal razor, either blades or electric without success.  When I need a close shave I always revert back to my Schick single edge injector razor. Please keep the blades  available.</li>
