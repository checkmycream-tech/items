            <li>Incredible fresh, sweet smell that definitely gets people&#x27;s attention--for good reasons!</li>
            <li>Great to freshen hair when it&#x27;s not dirty but has absorbed an odor ( bonfire, cooking, etc).  </li>
            <li>This really smells great and helps you get through the &amp;#34;one more day&amp;#34;, without smelling like you haven&#x27;t showered for years :-p Just spray on your hair and style as usual.</li>
            <li>This hair mist refreshes your &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; and smells so FRESH and lovely, I use it as perfume.</li>
            <li>This product works great if you have curly hair and want to rescrunch for second day no wash wear.  </li>
            <li>I still use the spay shampoo because my hair was thinning for for many years and it  helps add volume to my hair between washes, and it also smells good, but when I only want freshening and don&#x27;t need to added volume</li>
            <li>Keeping it clean became a problem</li>
            <li>great for the Gentleman, when he doesn&#x27;t feel like showering, he&#x27;ll hit his hair with a little bit of Fresh Start and hair gel and be on his sexy way.  </li>
            <li>Nope, it lasts all day and at the end of the day it smells just as strong as it did when you first sprayed it.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for 2nd day hair.. refreshes and neutralizes any odors... makes you feel like you have that fresh clean hair without weighing it down with more product.</li>
            <li>Just as promised, this gives a fresh scent, plenty of body and shine.</li>
            <li>Sticky, more like a soft hold hairspray</li>
            <li>It has a wonderfully fresh citrusy scent, and eliminates any cigarette odor or &amp;#34;icky&amp;#34; hair smells.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Maybe I didn&#x27;t use it right</li>
            <li>Only Thing I found that treats my hair right Have used it for years &amp; was so glad to get it from you.</li>
            <li>This product works great for between shampoo freshening, especially if you have dry hair because it does not dry it out more.</li>
            <li>Really refreshes my hair!</li>
            <li>I suppose if you had really greasy hair it would be okay, but I have coarse wavy hair that tends to be more dry than oily.</li>
            <li>Works great but not worth $60, purchased last year from Amazon for around $11.  </li>
            <li>It smells so clean, fresh and really works for 2nd day curly hair touch up!</li>
            <li>I absolutely loveeee it.</li>
            <li>- so much hair would fall out in a wash.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product really works as advertised.</li>
            <li>At least it smells good...</li>
            <li>This is great for dry, color treated or bushy hair that does not require an everyday wash.</li>
            <li>It was important to me to keep my hair long.  </li>
            <li>I felt so much better with the slight citrusy smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Witch hazel is one of the main ingredients...</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>After a few sprays my hair smells fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>Is ok if you use curly hair, for straigh hair is a totally nooo, because make your hair wet.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight, hair is soft and fresh after use, it doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down.</li>
            <li>I guess it will do in a pinch, but it smells a little cheap to me.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, 2b to 2c type...</li>
            <li>Just received product all tops were broken on each bottle,but sprayed some of the refresh on my hair it smells nice .</li>
            <li>I would gently comb my hair, spritz in FreshStart, finger comb, let it dry, and pin it up.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;The dry shampoo, which has no place for me to leave a review, left my scalp oily and my hair dry and straw like.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find in my local stores.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy, crazy hair, but not the pretty waves, so I straighten my hair every single day.</li>

            <li> Just spray on your hair and fluff, no sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> Not worth 60</li>
            <li> , I am well, my hair is thick again and it takes forever to wash and dry it</li>
            <li> Originally, I was looking for the hair refresher by Tresemme ; now discontinued :(</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to wash your hair everyday.  </li>
            <li> for a little freshening up!</li>
            <li> Hard to find item.  </li>
            <li> I work at a restaurant and when I get home late I don&#x27;t always like to wash my hair</li>
            <li> So sad its not on store shelves anymore!</li>
            <li> so disappointed that they maker has decided to discontinue it.</li>
            <li> and I hate it.</li>
            <li> but really hate the white-ish powdery look.</li>
            <li> but I hate the &amp;#34;food&amp;#34; smells too.  </li>

            <li> One of my favorite hair refreshing sprays. Very lightweight, hair is soft and fresh after use, it doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down. Great for day two if I don&#x27;t want to wash my hair that day.</li>
            <li> There are days that you JUST DON&#x27;T feel like washing your hair, or simply, lack of time to do so. This really smells great and helps you get through the &amp;#34;one more day&amp;#34;, without smelling like you haven&#x27;t showered for years :-p Just spray on your hair and style as usual.</li>
            <li> Make my hair smell good</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  You could go out to a smoky bar and a spray of this great product, your hair will smell like it was just washed.  It makes you feel great and fresh!  Buy this and you don&#x27;t have to wash your hair everyday.  This is great for dry, color treated or bushy hair that does not require an everyday wash.</li>
            <li> These smell SO AMAZING!! Everytime I use this, someone asks me if I just got out of the shower. Incredible fresh, sweet smell that definitely gets people&#x27;s attention--for good reasons!</li>
            <li> Works great but not worth $60, purchased last year from Amazon for around $11.  I cant believe this is $60+ dollars!!!!! Dont buy. Not worth 60</li>
            <li> So happy I could get my hands on this, it works so well!  so disappointed that they maker has decided to discontinue it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for 2nd day hair.. refreshes and neutralizes any odors... makes you feel like you have that fresh clean hair without weighing it down with more product. So sad its not on store shelves anymore!</li>
            <li> I was expecting a citrus smell, since it says citrus on the package. It doesn&#x27;t smell like citrus at all, smells like hairspray. I guess it will do in a pinch, but it smells a little cheap to me.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy, crazy hair, but not the pretty waves, so I straighten my hair every single day. Somehow, it still looks healthy. But whenever I straighten it, my hair smells burnt and I hate it. This immediately gets rid of that. I didn&#x27;t think it would last all day; I figured it would just last like two hours then smell burnt again. Nope, it lasts all day and at the end of the day it smells just as strong as it did when you first sprayed it. I absolutely loveeee it.</li>
            <li> Just as promised, this gives a fresh scent, plenty of body and shine. This was just was what I needed. Originally, I was looking for the hair refresher by Tresemme ; now discontinued :( , I am soo glad I made this purchase ! Go out and get a bottle....I got three :)</li>
            <li> PERFECT....for a little freshening up!</li>
            <li> This product is so good . I spray a few in my hair and its like I just put life back in my hair and it smells so good! Glad I bought it</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this in the stores anywhere and was so disapointed, then I had an ahh haa moment, AMAZON. So I am stocked up for a while, this stuff is great for just freshening up your hair after being around smoke or food odors.</li>
            <li> I have been using spray shampoos since discovering them about a year ago. I like the way they freshen your hair but really hate the white-ish powdery look. I suppose if you had really greasy hair it would be okay, but I have coarse wavy hair that tends to be more dry than oily. This product works great for between shampoo freshening, especially if you have dry hair because it does not dry it out more. Also, no powdery residue. It smells good too, like fresh washed hair, not overly perfumy. I wish I had known about this stuff years ago. I still use the spay shampoo because my hair was thinning for for many years and it  helps add volume to my hair between washes, and it also smells good, but when I only want freshening and don&#x27;t need to added volume then I just use this. I hope they don&#x27;t stop selling it.</li>
            <li> I have been using FreshStart for a couple  years.  I have been through some stressful endocronology issues. One symtom/result was that my hair was shedding - a LOT.  With waistlength hair that hasn&#x27;t been cut short in 20 years when I survived cancer. It was important to me to keep my hair long.  Keeping it clean became a problem - so much hair would fall out in a wash.&lt;br /&gt;I looked for a hair freshener and found FreshStart - It was and is great. I would gently comb my hair, spritz in FreshStart, finger comb, let it dry, and pin it up.  I felt so much better with the slight citrusy smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I am well, my hair is thick again and it takes forever to wash and dry it (nice problem). 2nd and 3rd mornings after washing it, I spritz FreshStart into combed hair,  use a pick to run FreshStart through my hair and let it air dry.  It seems to add some volume, and add a pleasant scent.  - Love it.</li>
            <li> This hair mist refreshes your &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; and smells so FRESH and lovely, I use it as perfume. I buy 3 at a time and everyone asks what it is. LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. My hair is curly, and so it rebels a lot. I use this when I need to get out of bed and run out of the house. It refreshes my hair and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Product lasts awhile when applied and hair smells like it has just been washed.  I like the 3-pack purchase option a lot.</li>
            <li> Sticky, more like a soft hold hairspray</li>
            <li> I sweat a lot and needed something to spray in my hair to freshen it. This product works great and the fragrance is quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> This product works great if you have curly hair and want to rescrunch for second day no wash wear.  It smells so clean, fresh and really works for 2nd day curly hair touch up!</li>
            <li> This is a great hair freshener.Just spray on your hair and fluff, no sticky feeling. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Just received product all tops were broken on each bottle,but sprayed some of the refresh on my hair it smells nice .</li>
            <li> Only Thing I found that treats my hair right Have used it for years &amp; was so glad to get it from you.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, 2b to 2c type... And this dries it out! I purchased this as well as the dry foam shampoo from the same brand/line... And was dismally disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dry shampoo, which has no place for me to leave a review, left my scalp oily and my hair dry and straw like. Witch hazel is one of the main ingredients... Witch hazel dries out hair! Maybe I didn&#x27;t use it right, I don&#x27;t know, I will give it another go next time I have a day off... This product though, is meant to follow. I thought maybe it would help the main length of my hair look less brittle and frizzy. Nope. Just added to it because it has denatured alcohol, which... dries out hair. At least it smells good... Didn&#x27;t add shine as it claimed.</li>
            <li> Is ok if you use curly hair, for straigh hair is a totally nooo, because make your hair wet.</li>
            <li> Really refreshes my hair! Love it!</li>
            <li> This is a life-saver for anyone with colored hair... it allows you to go two or even three!!! days without a wash and still look fresh and smell great.  It has a wonderfully fresh citrusy scent, and eliminates any cigarette odor or &amp;#34;icky&amp;#34; hair smells.&lt;br /&gt;Also great for the Gentleman, when he doesn&#x27;t feel like showering, he&#x27;ll hit his hair with a little bit of Fresh Start and hair gel and be on his sexy way.  Think of it as Febreeze for your hair!</li>
            <li> This product really works as advertised. The citrus in it gets rid of hair odor. I like to order this in bulk from Amazon so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> Hard to find item.  Great to freshen hair when it&#x27;s not dirty but has absorbed an odor ( bonfire, cooking, etc).  Glad to find an affordable multipack!</li>
            <li> I work at a restaurant and when I get home late I don&#x27;t always like to wash my hair but I hate the &amp;#34;food&amp;#34; smells too.  After a few sprays my hair smells fresh and clean.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Best hair freshener out there. Just wish I could still find it in stores.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use on micro braids to refresh them.  They did freshen the braids, but left a residue that made the hair feel tacky.  I will not re-purchase this item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find in my local stores. Love this protect for in between washing freshness. Good fragrance. Even my husband commented how nice it smelled.  I probably use it once a week.</li>
