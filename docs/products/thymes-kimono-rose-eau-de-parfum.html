    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This perfume smells WONDERFUL!</li>
            <li>Very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially lovely when it&#x27;s been on your clothes for a while.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of the Thymes scents and think this one is the best.</li>
            <li>the best rose cologne!!</li>
            <li>All of their products are very nice and feel so good on your skin.</li>
            <li>Great cologne, beautiful light scent that doesn&#x27;t over power you with the smell!</li>
            <li>It smells so good.</li>
            <li>The scent is delicious and the price is right.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I purchased it for myself again!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great daytime scent, as it&#x27;s not overpowering, and it&#x27;s very fresh and light.</li>
            <li>l Love This...</li>
            <li>I love this for it&#x27;s floral qualities, but it&#x27;s not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a perfect starter perfume, and I was 18 when I bought it, and even in my mid 20s</li>
            <li>I love this perfume.  </li>
            <li>Love this scent.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for toting around w/ you in your purse (the lid is very secure/tight fitting and the bottle is glass, but very durable).</li>
            <li>this has a really unlovely smell...and it doesn&#x27;t smell like any rose I&#x27;ve ever encountered.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much</li>
            <li>Other than that, it is very elegant and love wearing it!</li>
            <li>I Love the clean gentle scent.</li>
            <li>Love this sent... fast shipping+++</li>
            <li>It has a clean and fresh scent.</li>
            <li>(scent fades quickly)</li>
            <li>Great for everyday.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a regular scent user, but when I go out I often use Kimono Rose.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great choice for women who aren&#x27;t a fan of musk or spice, since this is such a natural mix.</li>
            <li>it is no longer frosted glass like in the image, it is clear glass, but still very pretty!</li>
            <li>I love the smell but fades shortly after applying it to my skin.</li>
            <li>Light, soft fragrance.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product and have purchased it a couple of times (not from Amazon, but from a local store in my town).</li>
            <li>Will be trying the other products of Kimono Rose.</li>
            <li>Every time I have purchased it through Amazon, I have gotten the real deal, so I feel like the sellers they are using are indeed selling the Thymes formula, and not a watered-down version or a knock-off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The residual smell after the initial sniff that everyone will catch is softer than the first whiff of sweet, and it&#x27;s a gentle feminine</li>
            <li>I really like the fragrance my sister shared hers with me when we took a trip together</li>
            <li>I fell in love w/ the scent when I bought it a few years back, but it does fade away (on me) very quickly, so I have to spray it directly on what I am wearing.</li>
            <li>particular cologne has a sweet floral quality, and I find that when I place it on my pressure points like the wrist and neck, it lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t super crazy about this scent at first, but now I love it...</li>
            <li>It has a light, delicate fragrance that remains consistent all day.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why - and this is weird, but it kind of reminds me of the smell of fresh black and mild cigars *in the package (I don&#x27;t smoke)</li>
            <li>It has a spicy, clean scent that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm or last too long.  </li>
            <li>It is subtle and not remotely overpowering but it is really nice.</li>
            <li>The picture shown shows the old bottle of the fragrance, which i was hoping  would receive.</li>
            <li>A lot of perfumes don&#x27;t last, but this one calms/ fades into a nice delicate scent.</li>
            <li>Still smells relatively similar but NOT long lasting</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love the smell but fades shortly after applying it to my skin. Other than that, it is very elegant and love wearing it!</li>
            <li> The scent is delicious and the price is right. I also like the body cream and the hand lotion. All of their products are very nice and feel so good on your skin.</li>
            <li> It smells so good. It has a clean and fresh scent.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells WONDERFUL! I bought it for myself on vacation a few years ago and used it all.  Why I didn&#x27;t replace it the minute I ran out of it, I don&#x27;t know, but I&#x27;m glad I purchased it for myself again!  On a side note, they have changed the appearance of the bottle- it is no longer frosted glass like in the image, it is clear glass, but still very pretty!</li>
            <li> this has a really unlovely smell...and it doesn&#x27;t smell like any rose I&#x27;ve ever encountered. I think it shouldn&#x27;t even be called &amp;#34;rose.&amp;#34; I threw it out after using it five times...I did give it a chance, but am sorry I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Light, soft fragrance. Compliments every time I wear it!</li>
            <li> I Love the clean gentle scent. it is not over powering and can be worn anytime. Will be trying the other products of Kimono Rose.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase: A++ seller</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t super crazy about this scent at first, but now I love it... enough so that I&#x27;m likely to purchase another bottle when mine runs out! It&#x27;s especially lovely when it&#x27;s been on your clothes for a while. A lot of perfumes don&#x27;t last, but this one calms/ fades into a nice delicate scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a regular scent user, but when I go out I often use Kimono Rose. It is subtle and not remotely overpowering but it is really nice. Must work because I get a lot of compliments re: my scent. Thankfully I&#x27;m not a skunk.</li>
            <li> l Love This...the best rose cologne!!</li>
            <li> Found this perfume in Hawaii on a trip there in 2007, and have been buying it ever since. I love this for it&#x27;s floral qualities, but it&#x27;s not too overpowering. Every time I have purchased it through Amazon, I have gotten the real deal, so I feel like the sellers they are using are indeed selling the Thymes formula, and not a watered-down version or a knock-off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular cologne has a sweet floral quality, and I find that when I place it on my pressure points like the wrist and neck, it lasts quite a long time. It&#x27;s a great daytime scent, as it&#x27;s not overpowering, and it&#x27;s very fresh and light. It&#x27;s a great choice for women who aren&#x27;t a fan of musk or spice, since this is such a natural mix. The residual smell after the initial sniff that everyone will catch is softer than the first whiff of sweet, and it&#x27;s a gentle feminine that I think also suits younger women. It&#x27;s a perfect starter perfume, and I was 18 when I bought it, and even in my mid 20s I still use this as a go-to daytime when I don&#x27;t want a heavy scent presence.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  It has a spicy, clean scent that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm or last too long.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of the Thymes scents and think this one is the best.</li>
            <li> The picture shown shows the old bottle of the fragrance, which i was hoping  would receive. Thymes has since changed the bottle and formulation of the scent. Still smells relatively similar but NOT long lasting (scent fades quickly) an the sprayer also always falls off. Sadly the company has really cheapened this perfume which is unfortunate because it was my favorite.</li>
            <li> I really like the fragrance my sister shared hers with me when we took a trip together I liked it so much i came home andordered it</li>
            <li> Great cologne, beautiful light scent that doesn&#x27;t over power you with the smell!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product and have purchased it a couple of times (not from Amazon, but from a local store in my town). I will def. start buying it from Amazon though because the store I was geting it from charges like $45 for the same size. I fell in love w/ the scent when I bought it a few years back, but it does fade away (on me) very quickly, so I have to spray it directly on what I am wearing. I don&#x27;t know why - and this is weird, but it kind of reminds me of the smell of fresh black and mild cigars *in the package (I don&#x27;t smoke) w/ a hint of  cherry. The bottle does last quite a while and I wear mine almost everyday. It is perfect for toting around w/ you in your purse (the lid is very secure/tight fitting and the bottle is glass, but very durable).</li>
            <li> Love this scent. Clean and subtle and long lasting. Great for everyday.</li>
            <li> Love this sent... fast shipping+++</li>
            <li> I have used this cologne for the past two years.  It has a light, delicate fragrance that remains consistent all day.</li>
            <li> It smells heavenly!  I put it on in the morning and it lasts all day. I will order it again.</li>
