            <li>I absolutely love Wen products and won&#x27;t use anything else on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Perfect to spritz hair at the end of a long flight before disembarking the plane.</li>
            <li>It makes the frizzies lay down and obey the curling brush better and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>I just love wen products this works great on your hair as a leave in conditioner or you can spray it on your hair the next morning</li>
            <li>Great price and fast shipping, item is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>It honestly doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair.</li>
            <li>the light smell stays with my hair all day.  </li>
            <li>Amazing smell, makes hair really soft.</li>
            <li>This does a good job protecting my hair from the flat iron.</li>
            <li>This product was really cheap and from a famous line with natural ingredients--</li>
            <li>I have fine, stick straight hair and use WEN Lavender Cleansing Conditioner in addition to the mist.</li>
            <li>I love this product to freshen up my hair as I am really busy throughout the day..</li>
            <li>For an emergency it&#x27;s fine but definitely doesn&#x27;t clean your hair.</li>
            <li>Seller was very fast too.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using it</li>
            <li>Very calming and soothing scent.</li>
            <li>and I really like this.  </li>
            <li>I use it daily to smooth my hair.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it as much</li>
            <li>Not to mention the prices are very manageable.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and dry from color treatment.  </li>
            <li>It reminds me of the high end massage oils I used to use when I was in massage therapy school.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>Product is good but the spray pump bottle works poorly.</li>
            <li>it is because I have notice a certain drying effect later after usage,which I was trying to avoid,maybe a different kind of mist is needed other than lavender.</li>
            <li>Hair looks and feels alive.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait for the next new flavor</li>
            <li>I now combine a few sprays with my daily hair cream and it makes it easier to apply less hair cream product to more of my hair....</li>

            <li> Other than that, does not really help my hair.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> and I am very active in my community...</li>
            <li> or I have a little frizz</li>
            <li> I just use a few spritz and bam!</li>
            <li> I have a part time job, I have small children</li>
            <li> It unfortunately does not provide the detangling power that I am looking for.</li>
            <li> This product was no help at all, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Too oily &amp; smells terrible</li>

            <li> Sporting a fro about 1.5 inches in length.  Perfect to spritz hair at the end of a long flight before disembarking the plane. Hair looks and feels alive.</li>
            <li> When ever my hair feels dry or I have a little frizz I just use a few spritz and bam!</li>
            <li> Too oily &amp; smells terrible</li>
            <li> Good stuff, smells great.</li>
            <li> I have fine, stick straight hair and use WEN Lavender Cleansing Conditioner in addition to the mist. The mist gives me no volume. I think my hair is genetically coded to never have volume. I digress. This does a good job protecting my hair from the flat iron. It smells medicinal, but I am not a fan of lavender. I got used to it. The mist keeps flyaways and frizz away. The bottle lasts me quite awhile.</li>
            <li> Wonderful Treatment Mist.  Refreshes my hair and it smells lovely all day.</li>
            <li> I loved the smell and it leaves my hair feeling healthy and shiny without being oily. I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this product. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love what it does for my hair.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, even better price!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve tried yet. I tried the apple spice, fig, aloe cucumber...but this is the best finishing spray so far. It makes the frizzies lay down and obey the curling brush better and it smells wonderful. It reminds me of the high end massage oils I used to use when I was in massage therapy school. Very calming and soothing scent. Will buy again!  Seller was very fast too.</li>
            <li> This product was really cheap and from a famous line with natural ingredients--thats why I bought it. It honestly doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair. I now combine a few sprays with my daily hair cream and it makes it easier to apply less hair cream product to more of my hair....so I guess that&#x27;s good. Other than that, does not really help my hair. If it can make my bottle of phyto hair cream last longer, I may repurchase this.</li>
            <li> I definitely would suggest this product. This is my first time using it and I really like this.  My hair tends to dry out between cleanings.  I love this product to freshen up my hair as I am really busy throughout the day.. I have a part time job, I have small children and I am very active in my community... I stick this product also in my purse so that it is on hand when I need it most.  I love how my hair feels and smells.  Totally refreshed!  I will be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> I use it daily to smooth my hair.  It gives it a sleek look.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it as much</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product. I was going to a dry climate for a week long trip and wanted something to help my hair and skin to maintain moisture. This product was no help at all, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as moisturizing as the Almond Mint.  My hair is fine and dry from color treatment.  It unfortunately does not provide the detangling power that I am looking for.</li>
            <li> Nice smells which takes me away to another world.  Great job Wen.  His products for hair are the best made.  I can&#x27;t wait for the next new flavor and I am no longer scared of coloring my hair.</li>
            <li> Amazing smell, makes hair really soft. Recommend Wen, the best hair care brand.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping, item is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Product is good but the spray pump bottle works poorly.</li>
            <li> I love this product !!! It smells amazing and makes my hair feel so healthy.</li>
            <li> For an emergency it&#x27;s fine but definitely doesn&#x27;t clean your hair. Will not buy this product again. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> love it!!  the light smell stays with my hair all day.  I like the way it feels.&lt;br /&gt;would I recommend it?  YES! I WOULD RECOMMEND ANY WEN PRODUCT! JUST STAY AWAY FROM THEIR WEBSITE. AUTOMATIC SHIPPING? NOPE. Amazon is the only way to go.  Not to mention the prices are very manageable.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Wen products and won&#x27;t use anything else on my hair.  This replenishing treatment mist smells so good and it&#x27;s great for a quick refresher for my hair.  I also spray it on my face- it smells heavenly!  This item came very quickly and in perfect condition.  I recommend this seller and I will definitely be using them again.</li>
            <li> I love this!! I love the way it smells!!! Works great.</li>
            <li> I just love wen products this works great on your hair as a leave in conditioner or you can spray it on your hair the next morning and you can spray it over your make up.</li>
            <li> This item seems to be okay for the most part,not really sure hoe effective it is because I have notice a certain drying effect later after usage,which I was trying to avoid,maybe a different kind of mist is needed other than lavender.</li>
