            <li>Perfect for the office!</li>
            <li>This hand sanitizer is the best!</li>
            <li>Awesome!</li>
            <li>Very happy I have a year&#x27;s supply now!</li>
            <li>In my opinion, Germ-x is the best hand sanitizer on the market.</li>
            <li>Great price for the amount we got.</li>
            <li>Good price and very quick delivery</li>
            <li>With the multi-pack we were able to place hand sanitizer in the nursery, living room, kitchen, and foyer.  </li>
            <li>This encouraged guests to sanitize their hands when arriving and reminded us to be more cautious.  </li>
            <li>and I am always glad to have access to it when there&#x27;s no soap or water around.</li>
            <li>I believe it works like most hand sanitizers.</li>
            <li>Love the product and it&#x27;s uses.</li>
            <li>It instead has a fresh smell that will easily combine with Bath and Body brand sanitizers for clean hands with a great smell.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of the sanitizer, very mild fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent sanitizer and very convienent pump action bottle.  </li>
            <li>Very quick shipment.</li>
            <li>This was one of the most economical packages available.</li>
            <li>then this is the package that will be most useful.  </li>
            <li>Smells good and it leaves hands clean and very soft.</li>
            <li>The sanitizer itself is pretty nice, dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, just love it!</li>
            <li>I use the original and the aloe and like them both.</li>
            <li>When I just want to wash hands, I don&#x27;t need to walk so far to the restroom any more!</li>
            <li>All round good buy though!</li>
            <li>Item was fine, but price was too high.</li>
            <li>The pump give one just the right amount, the alcohol sanitizes, and hands don&#x27;t get chapped.</li>
            <li>This pack is great to refill pocket bottles and will last for several months.</li>
            <li>You also don&#x27;t have to use much to fully cover your hands and it dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>No problems, like it very much.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve found the 10oz size to be perfect for keeping in the car, and I also have a bottle in the guest bathroom since unfortunately</li>
            <li>So be price aware when buying online.</li>
            <li>Well, I admit I&#x27;m kinda lazy :-P</li>
            <li>The liquid doesn&#x27;t really have much odor and it evaporates quickly without leaving any sticky residue, which I appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Regardless, I know that this stuff certainly makes my hands feel cleaner</li>
            <li>You can get a large bottle for around $4 at Walmart or Walgreens.  </li>
            <li>I find it smells better, leaves less sticky residue, and is overall a better product than most other hand sanitizers.</li>
            <li>He specified the percent of alcohol necessary and this fit our requirements.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Germ-x doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue like many other sanitizer a.</li>
            <li>I live in a dorm at campus</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t dry your hands out.  </li>
            <li>So far, I seem to be well.</li>
            <li>It has moisturizing vitamin E and does not dry your hands out.</li>
            <li>Without doing before and after bacterial cultures it&#x27;s hard to say for certain whether Germ-X actually kills the advertised \\&quot;99.99% of germs,\\&quot; but given that the active ingredient in this is the same as in professional-grade sanitizers used by hospitals I&#x27;d have to think it&#x27;s pretty effective.&lt;br</li>

            <li> This is an excellent sanitizer and very convienent pump action bottle.  If you have a need for daily use of a hand sanitizer (my wife is on home peritoneal dyalisis) then this is the package that will be most useful.  Good price and very quick delivery</li>
            <li> We purchased the hand sanitizer at the recommendation of our pediatrician after the birth of our daughter.  He specified the percent of alcohol necessary and this fit our requirements.  With the multi-pack we were able to place hand sanitizer in the nursery, living room, kitchen, and foyer.  This encouraged guests to sanitize their hands when arriving and reminded us to be more cautious.  The hand sanitizer does not have a pungent smell unlike some other brands.  You also don&#x27;t have to use much to fully cover your hands and it dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the office! This stuff is a must!</li>

            <li> This hand sanitizer is the best! Smells good and it leaves hands clean and very soft. I highly recommend this product, just love it!</li>
            <li> What can I say, it&#x27;s hand sanitizer. The package was a little late getting here, but other than that I believe it works like most hand sanitizers. The smell just seems to linger a little longer.</li>
            <li> CAME WITH BROKEN PUMP/STEM.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for me.  I keep some at work and at home and a smaller bottle in my purse.  I also buy this my my kids to take to school, they have this on their supply list every year.  It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t dry your hands out.  I use the original and the aloe and like them both. You can get a large bottle for around $4 at Walmart or Walgreens.  So be price aware when buying online.</li>
            <li> Flu season and colds are out and about.  After wiping the desk and the telephone done, I continually use Germ-X.  It has moisturizing vitamin E and does not dry your hands out.</li>
            <li> This item kills 99.09 percent of germs and it comes in four convenient 10 once bottles. It is quite affordable.</li>
            <li> Arrived a mess, bottles were open and wet inside of packaging. I feel like I was ripped off</li>
            <li> We keep it all through the house for everyone including company..... It works well and helps stop colds and other infections from being spread....</li>
            <li> What can I say, the item seems made well and seems to function properly. I will get some use out of it and if I have any problems I will update my review.</li>
            <li> No problems, like it very much.  The pump give one just the right amount, the alcohol sanitizes, and hands don&#x27;t get chapped.</li>
            <li> Would use seller again, no problems.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday. I live in a dorm at campus and it&#x27;s not very convenient to go to the restroom. When I just want to wash hands, I don&#x27;t need to walk so far to the restroom any more! Awesome! Well, I admit I&#x27;m kinda lazy :-P</li>
            <li> I always have trouble finding Germ-X in stores, so when I saw it on Amazon, I HAD to get it. I find it smells better, leaves less sticky residue, and is overall a better product than most other hand sanitizers. Package came as described, very carefully packed to prevent leaks/breaks. Very happy I have a year&#x27;s supply now!</li>
            <li> Item was fine, but price was too high. I found the same item in the store for 1/3 the price.</li>
            <li> Great price for the amount we got. We&#x27;re still only half way through these after 6 months. Not too sticky, but it is a little smelly. All round good buy though!</li>
            <li> Love the product and it&#x27;s uses. The price for me in the region I live in is quite cheaper than purchasing it at a worldwide retailer that I usually shop at for food and stuff for home.</li>
            <li> Purell is 70% alcohol&lt;br /&gt;This is 63% alcohol...&lt;br /&gt;sounds like a 10% difference in strength&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;addendum:&lt;br /&gt;The 70% Purell was purchased in a pharmacy...&lt;br /&gt;When I ordered it through an Amazon affiliate, it was 62%...</li>
            <li> I am a retired firefighter. I still carry a medical-response jump-bag in my vehicle. I carry one of these in my bag to use before and after exposing myself to a &#x27;scene&#x27; that requires a possible contamination issue. So far, I seem to be well. I have not become, to my knowledge, infected by any situation that to which I was exposed. I think it is a geat product</li>
            <li> In my opinion, Germ-x is the best hand sanitizer on the market. It doesn&#x27;t have a \\&quot;rotten hamburger\\&quot; smell like Purell does. It instead has a fresh smell that will easily combine with Bath and Body brand sanitizers for clean hands with a great smell. Germ-x doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue like many other sanitizer a. This pack is great to refill pocket bottles and will last for several months. Highly recommended!</li>
