            <li>The brushes are wonderful and I would definitely recommend them to everyone I know.</li>
            <li>The most glaring thing about these brushes is that they DO SHED.</li>

            <li>I love this set of makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>They feel so plush and really deliver a great application!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not so sure the reviews are sincere.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I took pictures of this but wasn&#x27;t able to upload any.</li>
            <li>I have the same-looking brush from Elf and that one works so much better.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>Arrived in time and as it was described. :)</li>
            <li>The case is really cute and stands up so you can place the brushes in there like a cup</li>
            <li>I really love the blush brush and the leather case.</li>

            <li>I love these brushes.</li>
            <li>I can say that this is my favorite make-up 7 pieces brush set The Beau  Gachis.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommend  perfect gift or personal use.</li>
            <li>From the reviews, however, I thought the quality would be better.</li>
            <li>Its really surprisingly I fell in love right away  when I used it.</li>
            <li>Also, good customer service and a very kind, personal email from the proprietor.</li>

            <li>These make-up brushes are of high quality and a great value for the money.  </li>
            <li>These brushes are some of the best quality that I have seen in a long time.</li>
            <li>This brush is pretty good.</li>
            <li>They are beautifully made and so soft...</li>
            <li>I recommend this set if you are looking to purchase new brushes at a great price.</li>
            <li>So when I was offered this Cosmetics Makeup Brush Holder with Brushes and Applicators included for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i honestly never thought i would be able to find great brushes in a such good price.&lt;br /&gt;i always thought and heard that the mac brushes were the best you can use but after using this brand, i fell in love with them</li>
            <li>Also love the case, it makes the brushes easy to sore, and easy to find just the brush I want when I want it.  </li>
            <li>Very good quality and terrific price.</li>
            <li>They are superb and don&#x27;t loose bristle while in use!</li>
            <li>So far, everyone&#x27;s happy.</li>
            <li>The brushes are natural and synthetic and I have experienced no shedding.</li>
            <li>It also has a button on both sides of the case to keep the brushes in the case safely and securely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First the case, it is a good size of brush case that fits the brushes really well.</li>
            <li>The brow comb is really useful and handy, I often use a spoolie for my brows, but having this in my collection is also good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brow comb is really useful and handy, I often use a spoolie for my brows, but having this in my collection is also good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li>I got this set in a beautiful case, very easy to carry around, even in a small purse.</li>
            <li>I mainly use it for blush and it does an amazing job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The two eye brush are also really good, the first one is eyeshadow brush which I use to pack up colors in my lid, it picks up the eyeshadow really well.</li>

            <li>Love love them supper soft</li>
            <li>They actually are quite nice, and the case they come in is lovely.</li>
            <li>Nothing special here</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with my new brush set!!  </li>
            <li>&quot; I could imagine that a lot of people out there (beginners who don&#x27;t know much about makeup brushes in particular) wouldn&#x27;t mind writing a good review for a freebie.</li>
            <li>The superior quality of the Beau Gachis brushes was evident as I unwrapped each carefully-packaged brush and felt the silky soft bristles.</li>
            <li>/&gt;they are full</li>
            <li>Now that would be cool.</li>
            <li>Second, the quality of the brushes is of superior quality.  </li>
            <li>My favorite is Real techniques.</li>
            <li>Good selection of brushed in the set.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t pay full price.</li>
            <li>The smudge brush is my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li>That is totally true.</li>
            <li>The quality of the white bristle brushes do not impress me, or feel good on my face.</li>
            <li>Smooth application, soft bristles, and most importantly the bristles dont fall off.</li>
            <li>This brush isn&#x27;t great for blending which is what I tried to use it for but still very soft natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Foundation goes on so smooth; contour brush gives just the right amount of blush.  </li>
            <li>but the powder and foundation brushes felt great on my face and didn&#x27;t leave stray bristles like some other brushes I have.</li>
            <li>The bristles stay intact, no shedding like I&#x27;ve experienced with other brushes.</li>
            <li>The other brushes are great.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect set for anyone either starting out for their first intro to make-up or for someone like me just wanting to upgrade from old mismatched brushes  </li>
            <li>These brushes are great for my college aged daughter!</li>
            <li>I love my new Makeup Brushes!  </li>
            <li>All in all a super buy.  </li>
            <li>Then when I actually started using the brushes I was even more pleased.</li>
            <li>Since Sephora brushes are costly, I have only one and wasn&#x27;t sure I would be able to afford a set.</li>
            <li>I got SOOO lucky.  </li>
            <li>You will be pleased with how comparable they are to high end brushes.</li>
            <li>All my old brushes went right into the trash!!!  </li>
            <li>What a perfect little set of brushes for someone who just wants the basics but high quality that will last and feel great when you put on makeup.</li>
            <li>Overall, she was very pleased.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my purchase and look forward to future products from this company.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this purchase that is looking for a more economical purchase</li>
            <li>“I have used four of the brushes and have found that they are a great value; high quality, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for about a week and the bristles stay in nice and they are pretty soft.</li>
            <li>But the real test is the durability &amp; if they were easy to wash, so I went ahead &amp; borrowed my friends for comparison on video purposes.</li>
            <li>This set is exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li>What came in the mail was a set of lovely and soft makeup brushes!</li>
            <li>They are very soft and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Very soft and the application of my makeup felt great especially my foundation.</li>
            <li>“I was a little hesitant based on the packaging of the product, but the brushes have turned out to be of great quality, and they don&#x27;t shed.  </li>
            <li>nd give complete coverage with no caking, the price is  just a cherry on the top.</li>
            <li>foundation brush is probably my favorite, it&#x27;s made of synthetic fibers, it is dense, soft, and tapered.</li>
            <li>Worth</li>
            <li>/&gt;They&#x27;re soft and work waayy better than I</li>
            <li>Overall a nice set of brushes.  </li>
            <li>I love the quality and how soft they are.</li>
            <li>They are rough and don&#x27;t feel good when applying powders.</li>
            <li>I doubt if you will find better quality set for anywhere near this price.</li>
            <li>This might be true or not, just something to be aware of.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I bought this professional make-up brush set on a black Friday sale and I hoped it would be all that was advertised, It not only was a beautiful set of brushes but the holder is just gorgeous</li>
            <li>When deciding to upgrade to higher quality brushes, I liked what I read about the Beau Gachis Paris brushes and was attracted by the reasonable price and professional quality in the description.</li>
            <li>These are good quality brushes and are definitely well crafted and made of high quality materials.</li>
            <li>I emailed the seller and they quickly replied that the brushes are made up of a natural and synthetic blend and to wash with gentle shampoo. :)</li>
            <li>I actually had a Co worker whom I don&#x27;t really know come up to me today and tell me that my makeup was very nice today, she asked if I was a makeup artist......... not hardly.</li>
            <li>Eco tools also makes a very large bronzer/powder brush.</li>
            <li>“They were a gift and they arrived with a huge surprise and WOW!!</li>
            <li>I used my brushes today for the first time and I must say these brushes were definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>These are the first professional brushes I&#x27;ve purchased as a set and so far, I LOVE THEM!  </li>
            <li>I had previously bought the contour brush from this set and loved it</li>
            <li>Next, several reviewers have mentioned how great the foundation brush is.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>The price was very reasonable too.  </li>
            <li>These brushes are high quality, comparable to my older brushes from a high-end department store brand, but much more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Was not as nice as I expected.  </li>
            <li>These work really well!</li>
            <li>Much higher quality than my sephora set.  </li>
            <li>However, I definitely think that the contour brush needs more improvement.</li>
            <li>I wish they will make the powder brush a bit more larger that it is.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>purchased this using a promo code for testing.ig and softer brush for powdering, so this is more of a personal preference.</li>
            <li>However, I definitely think that the contour brush needs more improvement.</li>
            <li>I wish they will make the powder brush a bit more larger that it is.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I wanted a nice set to replace my old bare minerals brush set.  </li>
            <li>First time using these products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First thing though is these brushes are TRAVEL SIZED.</li>
            <li>and I decided to get the whole pack because it was so intriguing.</li>
            <li>These brushes came exactly as described.</li>
            <li>This is my first purchase of quality makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>The Contour brush started shedding the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I love the make of the entire brushes.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recomend these to my friends and family :)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see what comes next. :)</li>
            <li>It arrived and is exactly what I need to give me the comfort knowing that my makeup brushes and tools are staying sanitary and not exposed to the elements.</li>
            <li>Finally, there were many hairs that splayed out of the contour and powder</li>
            <li>Just really like the way they look!</li>
            <li>They are extremely soft, do not shed and distribute make up evenly and smoothly.  </li>
            <li>You might be able to see in the video that the marginal bristles are all over the place - and that&#x27;s after only the first wash.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>First of all, they are from Florida, not Paris.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s first set of brushes...</li>
            <li>Boy, I didn&#x27;t realize I was in for a real treat!</li>
            <li>They are so soft on the skin, but also dense enough to make sure that application of foundation is smooth &amp; eyeshadows</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very much satisfied with this set.</li>
            <li>I never realized how much of a difference brushes could make in make-up application!  </li>
            <li>This is my first time ever purchasing a makeup brush set online</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice when you place an order and get just what you expected!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been loyal to Chanel and Bobbi Brown brushes for years but wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li>I love the brushes set and the black leather box they come in is pretty cool, too.</li>
            <li>When I first received the brushes in the mail I loved the case it came in but was not sure about the brushes.  </li>
            <li>I will never go back, these brushes are such good quality and the bristles</li>
            <li>The small angled brush is pretty good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the negatives.</li>
            <li>This brush set seems to be of very close quality, if not equal quality, to over priced brushes most cosmetic stores sell.  </li>
            <li>Her response was that it worked very well and applied makeup exactly where she wanted.  </li>
            <li>These are stellar brushes--professional quality and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>He had expensive brushes to sell me, but assured me my brushes were excellent and that I should continue using them (he threw out some older brushes from another source, with my permission).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s densely packed and very soft, it picks up the right amount of product but on my first time to try it, it already shed on my me.</li>
            <li>the black leather case will come in handy for traveling this summer.</li>
            <li>I love that you have included all the brushes I need in a single collection.  </li>
            <li>I would certainly say to order it.</li>
            <li>In under two weeks, the top part of one of the brushes had come loose.</li>
            <li>and she loves them and said they are very high quality.</li>
            <li>and she is very please with the brushes as well as the case.  </li>
            <li>I bought these as a Christmas gift for one of my wife&#x27;s nieces who&#x27;s very into make-up.</li>
            <li>The brow brush came with a comb and a straight bristled brush.</li>
            <li>The brow brush came with a comb and a straight bristled brush.</li>
            <li>The case is very well made too.</li>
            <li>Genuine leather and rock solid.</li>
            <li>so it won&#x27;t absorb your cream, also very dense.</li>
            <li>They are very sturdy and look like I paid a fortune for them.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like the set.</li>
            <li>Very well packaged.</li>
            <li>Thanks for all that you do.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this set!</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, and seller updated me as soon as item was shipped.</li>
            <li>I think this set is very well made.</li>
            <li>I really like the handle on the eyebrow brush.  </li>
            <li>Until I decided to try these makeup brushes, I had been considering purchasing from Sephora because I really like their brushes,.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>and she absolutely adores it.</li>
            <li>I really like using a&lt;br /&gt;foundation brush.  </li>
            <li>I really like that each brush is labeled.</li>
            <li>These people, although they may truly enjoy their product, are also quite possibly trying to get freebies from this company.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sturdy and I really like the snaps that hold the two halves together.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly soft and well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Much better quality than I expected</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this set!</li>
            <li>Thanks for your pride in your product...</li>
            <li>Will definitely order again for future gifts or when I need to replace my own set.</li>
            <li>Taking the time to seek out feedback from customers shows how much the company cares about retaining and gaining clients and having a product they proudly stand behind.</li>
            <li>The reviews are fake, the buyers get free gifts for good reviews.</li>
            <li>But I think that as of now, you can get better for less (i.e., Real Techniques Brushes or even Elf!).</li>
            <li>It is so hard to find GOOD quality brushes at a decent price.</li>
            <li>Very very soft but firm enough to get a great application and picks up and applies make up flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a real person and I am very glad I found these brushes, I went back to amazon after I got them and bought an other.</li>
            <li>I picked this up on a daily special and I have to say this is one of nicest set of brushs and holders I have ever gotten,</li>
            <li>But I thinkthat as of now, you can get better for less (i.e., Real Techniques Brushes or even Elf!).Techniques Brushes or even Elf!).onal opinion</li>
            <li>The brushes are so soft and are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>They come neatly packed in a round hard case which works wonderful!!”  </li>
            <li>But for the price, they are decent quality.</li>
            <li>I prefer a big and softer brush for powdering, so this is more of a personal preference.</li>
            <li>I have owned a lot of great makeup brush cases and none are as thick and solid as this case.</li>
            <li>have spent allot of money at Sephora and Nordstrom&#x27;s for brushes and these are by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Super Product!&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li>Very soft brushes!</li>
            <li>They are super soft, don&#x27;t shed, and I love the hard case they come in.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for others to try this product.</li>
            <li>She spoke so highly of the brushes that I had to buy a set for myself.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend giving these brushes a try 😃</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are high quality.</li>
            <li>However, I did find the set high quality</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I was on a look out for affordable high quality brushes and found this with high reviews.</li>
            <li>Its made of high quality materials yet affordable .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Durable, soft, the bristles don&#x27;t fall off!!  </li>
            <li>However, my experience with this set is something I want to share, especially because the exuberant amount of five star reviews make it easy for new customers to be lured in.</li>
            <li>So soft and very durable.  </li>
            <li>Appears to be well made and the case they all come in is expensive looking and great for travel.  </li>
            <li>I have been using my brushes for a few weeks now and absolutely love them.  </li>
            <li>Let you know more in a few days.</li>
            <li>The foundation brush is my favorite because it doesn&#x27;t waste any makeup-</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first, but I quickly fell in love with then.</li>
            <li>Super soft and the application of my makeup felt divine, especially my foundation.</li>
            <li>I have used other brushes and they put to much makeup on, these are light and soft.</li>
            <li>I have no issues at all with eye shadow and all of my other makeup goes on smooth as well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The case itself is great, but a little bit too heavy.</li>
            <li>They do shed a little but overall a nice set.</li>
            <li>This is my first high end cosmetic brush set so I have nothing recent to</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to see your new items.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It is very very soft .I</li>
            <li>They seem very soft and durable.</li>
            <li>These brushes are the bomb, I gave them as a gift to my daughter and she loves them as well as the case, she says they are very professional grade quality.  </li>
            <li>This again is simply something to be aware of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are so soft!</li>
            <li>I got a better set at Costcoin the past.</li>
            <li>All of the brushes are of high quality materials and durable and I like the fact that they are not too long, like so many other makeup brushes.  </li>
            <li>The price on these brushes is hard to beat, and the quality is outstanding.</li>
            <li>The brushes are so soft to the skin.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and as described.</li>
            <li>In face it actually has made applying my makeup so much easier as it helps apply it evenly like brushes are supposed</li>
            <li>Overall I really like it</li>
            <li>All the brushes are soft and cover well.  </li>
            <li>I was so pleasantly surprised  with the softness of these makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>Another downside is that they aren&#x27;t really soft, which comes as no surprise though because they are natural hair.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and compare to the designer name brushes</li>
            <li>; classy looking.  </li>
            <li>Third, for the quality of these brushes, the number you get (6) and the nice case you would expect to pay at least 100.00.  </li>
            <li>The Foundation brush is the only one I would keep, but that obviously wouldn&#x27;t be worth the set.</li>
            <li>I was used to buying more expensive brushes from Sephora, but I figured it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend natural hair for makeup brushes--especially to beginners--for various reasons (animal cruelty might be involved, less soft, trap makeup, not as precise, more difficult to clean,...) but keep in mind that&#x27;s a personal preference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The couture brush does shed, but at least they are light bristles, way better than short black hairs all over my face.</li>
            <li>The brushes are a bit small for my liking, but it is fine used as a travel kit.</li>
            <li>I would say, the old &amp; new one is comparable, which gives me the confidence that these will last me for years.</li>
            <li>Gave these as a gift and they were a major hit!</li>
            <li>I have bought a lot of high quality and very expensive make up brushes over the years and these brushes are every bit as good as any brushes I have ever purchased.  </li>
            <li>I recently purchased new makeup after the manufacturer&#x27;s salesman applied it using my Amazon-sold makeup brushes.  </li>
            <li>so when I had finally had enough money I went ahead and bought the whole set</li>
            <li>My other, higher end, brushes are no comparison - which some reviewers compared these to.</li>
            <li>The brushes in this set don&#x27;t lose bristles like other brushes I&#x27;ve used, they are soft, and gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>It is not too big or too small, it&#x27;s perfectly fine for travelling.</li>
            <li>The shape of these eye shadow brushes makes it hard to apply accurately too.</li>
            <li>In general I would recommend this set.</li>
            <li>As I have spent on one brush what the whole 7 pieces cost.</li>
            <li>The bristles have held their consistency and stayed soft after washing them multiple times.</li>
            <li>The brushes are really soft and there are a couple different kinds and shapes to choose from.</li>
            <li>The lenght of the handle of these brushes isnt too long or too thick, that I like because youre able to control the brushes</li>
            <li>I never understood why good makeup brushes are either made in Japan and cost a fortune…or made in China and shed like crazy.  </li>
            <li>This Beau Gâchis® Paris Professional Cosmetic Makeup Brush Set with Black Leather Designer Case Holder Organizer is definitely a high quality product!</li>
            <li>This brush as mentioned before like them all is travel sized and I&#x27;m not really a fan of the smaller sized brush as I prefer large powder/buffer brushes.</li>
            <li>I like it so much that I have kept all my other brushes &amp; will be using these from now on.</li>
            <li>Packaging is very usable and practical - the black case is sturdy and can stand alone on the counter by itself or pack it in my suitcase/hand carry bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was really really surprised by how small the whole set was (including the case)</li>

            <li> Nice quality brushes in leather holder.  </li>
            <li> person who gave this set to me doesn&#x27;t know a lot about makeup brushes and was sure that this would be great based on the many five star reviews.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is all my personal opinion and if you find these brushes great, then that&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> Every women should own a set of these for herself.</li>
            <li> To start off, they came in a nice &amp;#34;travel-friendly&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was kind of weary but went with the reviews</li>
            <li> Always wondered why the pros get such great results, it&#x27;s the brushes &amp; these are beyond awesome.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Highly recommend  perfect gift or personal use.</li>
            <li> From the reviews, however, I thought the quality would be better.</li>

            <li> I recommend this set if you are looking to purchase new brushes at a great price.</li>
            <li> So when I was offered this Cosmetics Makeup Brush Holder with Brushes and Applicators included for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i honestly never thought i would be able to find great brushes in a such good price.&lt;br /&gt;i always thought and heard that the mac brushes were the best you can use but after using this brand, i fell in love with them</li>
            <li> Also love the case, it makes the brushes easy to sore, and easy to find just the brush I want when I want it.  </li>
            <li> Very good quality and terrific price.</li>
            <li> They are superb and don&#x27;t loose bristle while in use!</li>
            <li> So far, everyone&#x27;s happy.</li>
            <li> The brushes are natural and synthetic and I have experienced no shedding.</li>
            <li> It also has a button on both sides of the case to keep the brushes in the case safely and securely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First the case, it is a good size of brush case that fits the brushes really well.</li>
            <li> The brow comb is really useful and handy, I often use a spoolie for my brows, but having this in my collection is also good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li> I got this set in a beautiful case, very easy to carry around, even in a small purse.</li>
            <li> I mainly use it for blush and it does an amazing job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The two eye brush are also really good, the first one is eyeshadow brush which I use to pack up colors in my lid, it picks up the eyeshadow really well.</li>
            <li> From selecting the product, placing order, receiving delivery and reading seller&#x27;s follow up email, it has been very positive - quick, clear and easy.&lt;br /&gt;Quality, design and price point of the product is great.</li>

            <li> It is a gift that in excited to give</li>
            <li> Love love them supper soft</li>
            <li> They actually are quite nice, and the case they come in is lovely.</li>
            <li> Nothing special here</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with my new brush set!!  </li>
            <li> &quot; I could imagine that a lot of people out there (beginners who don&#x27;t know much about makeup brushes in particular) wouldn&#x27;t mind writing a good review for a freebie.</li>
            <li> The superior quality of the Beau Gachis brushes was evident as I unwrapped each carefully-packaged brush and felt the silky soft bristles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;they are full</li>
            <li> Now that would be cool.</li>
            <li> Second, the quality of the brushes is of superior quality.  </li>
            <li> My favorite is Real techniques.</li>
            <li> Good selection of brushed in the set.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t pay full price.</li>
            <li> The smudge brush is my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li> That is totally true.</li>
            <li> The quality of the white bristle brushes do not impress me, or feel good on my face.</li>
            <li> Smooth application, soft bristles, and most importantly the bristles dont fall off.</li>
            <li> This brush isn&#x27;t great for blending which is what I tried to use it for but still very soft natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Foundation goes on so smooth; contour brush gives just the right amount of blush.  </li>
            <li> but the powder and foundation brushes felt great on my face and didn&#x27;t leave stray bristles like some other brushes I have.</li>
            <li> The bristles stay intact, no shedding like I&#x27;ve experienced with other brushes.</li>
            <li> The other brushes are great.</li>
            <li> It is the perfect set for anyone either starting out for their first intro to make-up or for someone like me just wanting to upgrade from old mismatched brushes  </li>
            <li> These brushes are great for my college aged daughter!</li>
            <li> I love my new Makeup Brushes!  </li>
            <li> All in all a super buy.  </li>
            <li> Then when I actually started using the brushes I was even more pleased.</li>
            <li> Since Sephora brushes are costly, I have only one and wasn&#x27;t sure I would be able to afford a set.</li>
            <li> I got SOOO lucky.  </li>
            <li> You will be pleased with how comparable they are to high end brushes.</li>
            <li> All my old brushes went right into the trash!!!  </li>
            <li> What a perfect little set of brushes for someone who just wants the basics but high quality that will last and feel great when you put on makeup.</li>
            <li> Overall, she was very pleased.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase and look forward to future products from this company.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this purchase that is looking for a more economical purchase</li>
            <li> “I have used four of the brushes and have found that they are a great value; high quality, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for about a week and the bristles stay in nice and they are pretty soft.</li>
            <li> But the real test is the durability &amp; if they were easy to wash, so I went ahead &amp; borrowed my friends for comparison on video purposes.</li>
            <li> This set is exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li> What came in the mail was a set of lovely and soft makeup brushes!</li>
            <li> They are very soft and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Very soft and the application of my makeup felt great especially my foundation.</li>
            <li> “I was a little hesitant based on the packaging of the product, but the brushes have turned out to be of great quality, and they don&#x27;t shed.  </li>
            <li> nd give complete coverage with no caking, the price is  just a cherry on the top.</li>
            <li> foundation brush is probably my favorite, it&#x27;s made of synthetic fibers, it is dense, soft, and tapered.</li>
            <li> Worth</li>
            <li> /&gt;They&#x27;re soft and work waayy better than I</li>
            <li> Overall a nice set of brushes.  </li>
            <li> I love the quality and how soft they are.</li>
            <li> They are rough and don&#x27;t feel good when applying powders.</li>
            <li> I doubt if you will find better quality set for anywhere near this price.</li>
            <li> This might be true or not, just something to be aware of.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I bought this professional make-up brush set on a black Friday sale and I hoped it would be all that was advertised, It not only was a beautiful set of brushes but the holder is just gorgeous</li>
            <li> When deciding to upgrade to higher quality brushes, I liked what I read about the Beau Gachis Paris brushes and was attracted by the reasonable price and professional quality in the description.</li>
            <li> These are good quality brushes and are definitely well crafted and made of high quality materials.</li>
            <li> I emailed the seller and they quickly replied that the brushes are made up of a natural and synthetic blend and to wash with gentle shampoo. :)</li>
            <li> I actually had a Co worker whom I don&#x27;t really know come up to me today and tell me that my makeup was very nice today, she asked if I was a makeup artist......... not hardly.</li>
            <li> Eco tools also makes a very large bronzer/powder brush.</li>
            <li> “They were a gift and they arrived with a huge surprise and WOW!!</li>
            <li> I used my brushes today for the first time and I must say these brushes were definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li> These are the first professional brushes I&#x27;ve purchased as a set and so far, I LOVE THEM!  </li>
            <li> I had previously bought the contour brush from this set and loved it</li>
            <li> Next, several reviewers have mentioned how great the foundation brush is.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> The price was very reasonable too.  </li>
            <li> These brushes are high quality, comparable to my older brushes from a high-end department store brand, but much more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Was not as nice as I expected.  </li>
            <li> These work really well!</li>
            <li> Much higher quality than my sephora set.  </li>
            <li> However, I definitely think that the contour brush needs more improvement.</li>
            <li> I wish they will make the powder brush a bit more larger that it is.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> purchased this using a promo code for testing.ig and softer brush for powdering, so this is more of a personal preference.</li>
            <li> However, I definitely think that the contour brush needs more improvement.</li>
            <li> I wish they will make the powder brush a bit more larger that it is.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wanted a nice set to replace my old bare minerals brush set.  </li>
            <li> First time using these products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First thing though is these brushes are TRAVEL SIZED.</li>
            <li> and I decided to get the whole pack because it was so intriguing.</li>
            <li> These brushes came exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of quality makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> The Contour brush started shedding the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I love the make of the entire brushes.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recomend these to my friends and family :)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see what comes next. :)</li>
            <li> It arrived and is exactly what I need to give me the comfort knowing that my makeup brushes and tools are staying sanitary and not exposed to the elements.</li>
            <li> Finally, there were many hairs that splayed out of the contour and powder</li>
            <li> Just really like the way they look!</li>
            <li> They are extremely soft, do not shed and distribute make up evenly and smoothly.  </li>
            <li> You might be able to see in the video that the marginal bristles are all over the place - and that&#x27;s after only the first wash.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> First of all, they are from Florida, not Paris.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s first set of brushes...</li>
            <li> Boy, I didn&#x27;t realize I was in for a real treat!</li>
            <li> They are so soft on the skin, but also dense enough to make sure that application of foundation is smooth &amp; eyeshadows</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very much satisfied with this set.</li>
            <li> I never realized how much of a difference brushes could make in make-up application!  </li>
            <li> This is my first time ever purchasing a makeup brush set online</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice when you place an order and get just what you expected!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been loyal to Chanel and Bobbi Brown brushes for years but wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li> I love the brushes set and the black leather box they come in is pretty cool, too.</li>
            <li> When I first received the brushes in the mail I loved the case it came in but was not sure about the brushes.  </li>
            <li> I will never go back, these brushes are such good quality and the bristles</li>
            <li> The small angled brush is pretty good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the negatives.</li>
            <li> This brush set seems to be of very close quality, if not equal quality, to over priced brushes most cosmetic stores sell.  </li>
            <li> Her response was that it worked very well and applied makeup exactly where she wanted.  </li>
            <li> These are stellar brushes--professional quality and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> He had expensive brushes to sell me, but assured me my brushes were excellent and that I should continue using them (he threw out some older brushes from another source, with my permission).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s densely packed and very soft, it picks up the right amount of product but on my first time to try it, it already shed on my me.</li>
            <li> the black leather case will come in handy for traveling this summer.</li>
            <li> I love that you have included all the brushes I need in a single collection.  </li>
            <li> I would certainly say to order it.</li>
            <li> In under two weeks, the top part of one of the brushes had come loose.</li>
            <li> and she loves them and said they are very high quality.</li>
            <li> and she is very please with the brushes as well as the case.  </li>
            <li> I bought these as a Christmas gift for one of my wife&#x27;s nieces who&#x27;s very into make-up.</li>
            <li> The brow brush came with a comb and a straight bristled brush.</li>
            <li> The brow brush came with a comb and a straight bristled brush.</li>
            <li> The case is very well made too.</li>
            <li> Genuine leather and rock solid.</li>
            <li> so it won&#x27;t absorb your cream, also very dense.</li>
            <li> They are very sturdy and look like I paid a fortune for them.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like the set.</li>
            <li> Very well packaged.</li>
            <li> Thanks for all that you do.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this set!</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, and seller updated me as soon as item was shipped.</li>
            <li> I think this set is very well made.</li>
            <li> I really like the handle on the eyebrow brush.  </li>
            <li> Until I decided to try these makeup brushes, I had been considering purchasing from Sephora because I really like their brushes,.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> and she absolutely adores it.</li>
            <li> I really like using a&lt;br /&gt;foundation brush.  </li>
            <li> I really like that each brush is labeled.</li>
            <li> These people, although they may truly enjoy their product, are also quite possibly trying to get freebies from this company.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sturdy and I really like the snaps that hold the two halves together.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly soft and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Much better quality than I expected</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this set!</li>
            <li> Thanks for your pride in your product...</li>
            <li> Will definitely order again for future gifts or when I need to replace my own set.</li>
            <li> Taking the time to seek out feedback from customers shows how much the company cares about retaining and gaining clients and having a product they proudly stand behind.</li>
            <li> The reviews are fake, the buyers get free gifts for good reviews.</li>
            <li> But I think that as of now, you can get better for less (i.e., Real Techniques Brushes or even Elf!).</li>
            <li> It is so hard to find GOOD quality brushes at a decent price.</li>
            <li> Very very soft but firm enough to get a great application and picks up and applies make up flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a real person and I am very glad I found these brushes, I went back to amazon after I got them and bought an other.</li>
            <li> I picked this up on a daily special and I have to say this is one of nicest set of brushs and holders I have ever gotten,</li>
            <li> But I thinkthat as of now, you can get better for less (i.e., Real Techniques Brushes or even Elf!).Techniques Brushes or even Elf!).onal opinion</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft and are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> They come neatly packed in a round hard case which works wonderful!!”  </li>
            <li> But for the price, they are decent quality.</li>
            <li> I prefer a big and softer brush for powdering, so this is more of a personal preference.</li>
            <li> I have owned a lot of great makeup brush cases and none are as thick and solid as this case.</li>
            <li> have spent allot of money at Sephora and Nordstrom&#x27;s for brushes and these are by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Super Product!&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Very soft brushes!</li>
            <li> They are super soft, don&#x27;t shed, and I love the hard case they come in.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for others to try this product.</li>
            <li> She spoke so highly of the brushes that I had to buy a set for myself.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend giving these brushes a try 😃</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are high quality.</li>
            <li> However, I did find the set high quality</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I was on a look out for affordable high quality brushes and found this with high reviews.</li>
            <li> Its made of high quality materials yet affordable .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Durable, soft, the bristles don&#x27;t fall off!!  </li>
            <li> However, my experience with this set is something I want to share, especially because the exuberant amount of five star reviews make it easy for new customers to be lured in.</li>
            <li> So soft and very durable.  </li>
            <li> Appears to be well made and the case they all come in is expensive looking and great for travel.  </li>
            <li> I have been using my brushes for a few weeks now and absolutely love them.  </li>
            <li> Let you know more in a few days.</li>
            <li> The foundation brush is my favorite because it doesn&#x27;t waste any makeup-</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but I quickly fell in love with then.</li>
            <li> Super soft and the application of my makeup felt divine, especially my foundation.</li>
            <li> I have used other brushes and they put to much makeup on, these are light and soft.</li>
            <li> I have no issues at all with eye shadow and all of my other makeup goes on smooth as well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The case itself is great, but a little bit too heavy.</li>
            <li> They do shed a little but overall a nice set.</li>
            <li> This is my first high end cosmetic brush set so I have nothing recent to</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see your new items.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It is very very soft .I</li>
            <li> They seem very soft and durable.</li>
            <li> These brushes are the bomb, I gave them as a gift to my daughter and she loves them as well as the case, she says they are very professional grade quality.  </li>
            <li> This again is simply something to be aware of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are so soft!</li>
            <li> I got a better set at Costcoin the past.</li>
            <li> All of the brushes are of high quality materials and durable and I like the fact that they are not too long, like so many other makeup brushes.  </li>
            <li> The price on these brushes is hard to beat, and the quality is outstanding.</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft to the skin.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and as described.</li>
            <li> In face it actually has made applying my makeup so much easier as it helps apply it evenly like brushes are supposed</li>
            <li> Overall I really like it</li>
            <li> All the brushes are soft and cover well.  </li>
            <li> I was so pleasantly surprised  with the softness of these makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> Another downside is that they aren&#x27;t really soft, which comes as no surprise though because they are natural hair.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and compare to the designer name brushes</li>
            <li> ; classy looking.  </li>
            <li> Third, for the quality of these brushes, the number you get (6) and the nice case you would expect to pay at least 100.00.  </li>
            <li> The Foundation brush is the only one I would keep, but that obviously wouldn&#x27;t be worth the set.</li>
            <li> I was used to buying more expensive brushes from Sephora, but I figured it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend natural hair for makeup brushes--especially to beginners--for various reasons (animal cruelty might be involved, less soft, trap makeup, not as precise, more difficult to clean,...) but keep in mind that&#x27;s a personal preference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The couture brush does shed, but at least they are light bristles, way better than short black hairs all over my face.</li>
            <li> The brushes are a bit small for my liking, but it is fine used as a travel kit.</li>
            <li> I would say, the old &amp; new one is comparable, which gives me the confidence that these will last me for years.</li>
            <li> Gave these as a gift and they were a major hit!</li>
            <li> I have bought a lot of high quality and very expensive make up brushes over the years and these brushes are every bit as good as any brushes I have ever purchased.  </li>
            <li> I recently purchased new makeup after the manufacturer&#x27;s salesman applied it using my Amazon-sold makeup brushes.  </li>
            <li> so when I had finally had enough money I went ahead and bought the whole set</li>
            <li> My other, higher end, brushes are no comparison - which some reviewers compared these to.</li>
            <li> The brushes in this set don&#x27;t lose bristles like other brushes I&#x27;ve used, they are soft, and gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> It is not too big or too small, it&#x27;s perfectly fine for travelling.</li>
            <li> The shape of these eye shadow brushes makes it hard to apply accurately too.</li>
            <li> In general I would recommend this set.</li>
            <li> As I have spent on one brush what the whole 7 pieces cost.</li>
            <li> The bristles have held their consistency and stayed soft after washing them multiple times.</li>
            <li> The brushes are really soft and there are a couple different kinds and shapes to choose from.</li>
            <li> The lenght of the handle of these brushes isnt too long or too thick, that I like because youre able to control the brushes</li>
            <li> I never understood why good makeup brushes are either made in Japan and cost a fortune…or made in China and shed like crazy.  </li>
            <li> This Beau Gâchis® Paris Professional Cosmetic Makeup Brush Set with Black Leather Designer Case Holder Organizer is definitely a high quality product!</li>
            <li> This brush as mentioned before like them all is travel sized and I&#x27;m not really a fan of the smaller sized brush as I prefer large powder/buffer brushes.</li>
            <li> I like it so much that I have kept all my other brushes &amp; will be using these from now on.</li>
            <li> Packaging is very usable and practical - the black case is sturdy and can stand alone on the counter by itself or pack it in my suitcase/hand carry bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really really surprised by how small the whole set was (including the case)</li>
            <li> Brushes were very pretty but a little short and &amp; I think a little pricey for the quality.  </li>
            <li> and I would definitely recommend the Beau Gâchis® Paris Professional Cosmetic Makeup Brush Set with Black Leather Designer Case Holder Organizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> hope it will last long</li>
            <li> The Contour and Powder Brush shed like crazy; just by touching them for the first time I got tons of hair on my fingers - and I wasn&#x27;t pulling hard either.</li>
            <li> I was worried if I didn&#x27;t purchase really expensive brushes they might be cheap and that was not the case.</li>
            <li> the brushes are smaller than what I expected.</li>
            <li> long.</li>
            <li> I am personally not a fan of the shorter handles as they make the brush harder to hold.</li>
            <li> I have used quality brushes for a long time, so this was a gamble for me.  </li>
            <li> It was recommended by a friend who had them for a long time.</li>
            <li> I expect that from brushes ive had for years and washed frequently,  but one and a half weeks!</li>
            <li> I can also add a couple of other things to the container since there is room to spare, I definitely recommend this Makeup Brush Container.</li>
            <li> Very firm but very soft</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the blush and powder brush aren&#x27;t very big, Especially the blush brush.</li>
            <li> There is not enough space given for the cap to be put down without getting the marginal bristles caught in between.</li>
            <li> Handles are a little bit short but</li>
            <li> I ordered them from Amazon and received them sooner than the expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> , I think that&#x27;s to be expected.  </li>
            <li> The set I had before wasn&#x27;t very expensive and was pretty old.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an even, soft and subtle coat.</li>
            <li> I will never buy brushes from any other retailer again.  </li>
            <li> They just seem a lot smaller than my brushes in the past.</li>
            <li> The White small eyeshadow shader brush is the roughest of the bunch.</li>
            <li> they absolutely do not blend well!</li>
            <li> The Powder and Contour brushes are in the way and you need to use your other hand to kinda squeeze the set together</li>
            <li> The only thing I would change is I wish they were a little shorter as I have a small makeup bag, but that is probably just me”</li>
            <li> These brushes have a white bristle blush brush, which is hard.</li>
            <li> there is hardly any foundation left on the brush after I use it.  </li>
            <li> This product is NOT worth the 5 stars everyone on here is giving.</li>
            <li> With other brushes I&#x27;ve used they would shed and leave little hairs all over my face...</li>
            <li> Bought them on black friday.  </li>
            <li> It has enough of the brushes that a daily casual make-up user like me would need.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a set I probably spent $50 on while on sale at sephora for the past 4 years or so.</li>
            <li> Some of the brushes came a little bit frayed.</li>
            <li> and I was not let down!  </li>
            <li> I will never use any other brand of brushes!!</li>
            <li> There are a few brushes that you will never use.</li>
            <li> Sleek, heavy duty, wood handles and copper ferrules.</li>
            <li> No cheap materials here.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides everything mentioned, the biggest negative of the brushes for me is that they really do not work well on my face.</li>
            <li> contour brush is the biggest disappointment for me, I had high hopes with this one as contouring is a must for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few not many bristles fall all</li>
            <li> I made a short video of this (with my phone so please excuse the bad quality)</li>
            <li> I usually buy her MAC brushes but wanted to give something else a try.  </li>
            <li> This brush tends to be used for getting the small creases of your face like around your nose.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend these brushes to any one on a budget or just looking for expensive looking brushes without killling your wallet.</li>
            <li> I had a small issue with one of the brushes, and contacted the company</li>
            <li> As I usually am.</li>
            <li> Usually when I&#x27;m applying my eye make up it gets clumped up</li>
            <li> How is that \\&quot;leading?\\&quot; Everyone starts small - no shame in admitting that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I usually buy all my products from sophora</li>
            <li> Before I have this I kept buying  make up brushes because I not satisfied and my skin getting irritated.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Very firm and allows you to fill in your eyebrows well.</li>
            <li> However, I didn&#x27;t realize the leather case was a hard cylindrical case.  </li>
            <li> I have always used the horrible brushes that come free with products.</li>
            <li> so you can see what I mean.</li>
            <li> This is not only annoying but it also damages the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately acceptable.</li>
            <li> In the past, I have been disappointed by cheaper synthetic brushes that shed their bristles.  </li>
            <li> The Eyebrow one is a fail...</li>
            <li> Nothing crazy.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality!</li>
            <li> Also, the brushes smell very weird.</li>
            <li> I always expect to get really bad products when I order online instead of going to the store to buy things like makeup brushes, but this wasn&#x27;t the case.</li>
            <li> i had to throw it away :-(</li>
            <li> the powder brush sheds like crazy!</li>
            <li> I purchased the eyebrow brush, base make up brush and the powder brush.  </li>
            <li> this is horrible and they smell really bad.</li>
            <li> Also, the brushes, besides the foundation brush, are very bad quality.</li>
            <li> The Contour and Powder Brushes are the worst...</li>

            <li> i absolutely love it !&lt;br /&gt;i honestly never thought i would be able to find great brushes in a such good price.&lt;br /&gt;i always thought and heard that the mac brushes were the best you can use but after using this brand, i fell in love with them&lt;br /&gt;they are full nd give complete coverage with no caking, the price is  just a cherry on the top.</li>
            <li> Love this set if brushes.</li>
            <li> Brushes were nice and the case was great.</li>
            <li> Very nice set. Very smooth to face. Applies make-up well to face. Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Gave these as gifts to ny sister in law and aunts. They were very happy with the brushes!</li>
            <li> So far so good. Got a set for Christmas. The couture brush does shed, but at least they are light bristles, way better than short black hairs all over my face.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my wife and she says they are great.  I usually buy her MAC brushes but wanted to give something else a try.  So far so good and she is very please with the brushes as well as the case.  Great product.  Great seller.  Great communication.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> These are beautiful and excellent quality makeup brushes.  The case adds an extra touch of class, too.  I will only buy from Beau Gachis in the future!</li>
            <li> The brushes are amazing &amp; exquisite I am completely in love with them. I have very sensitive skin so when I tried it with my makeup I didn&#x27;t get a rash or itched. It&#x27;s amazing. Totally recommend it!</li>
            <li> Brushes are very nice.  However, I didn&#x27;t realize the leather case was a hard cylindrical case.  I had hoped for a foldable leather case.</li>
            <li> I have received the brushes and I LOVE them!!  They are wonderful and I plan to go on and order another set for a Christmas gift.  So far, so good.  They work beautifully and are easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> These brushes are well made and wonderful to the touch. Love them!</li>
            <li> For the price, a good selection. There are a few brushes that you will never use. How about a collection that we can select our own brushes?? Now that would be cool. But for the price, they are decent quality.</li>
            <li> Was not as nice as I expected.  The brushes are a bit small for my liking, but it is fine used as a travel kit.</li>
            <li> My wife bought these for our niece and according to her, they are the BEST!</li>
            <li> Thank you, I love my brushes, high-end quality, the leather case is nice. Great value also! As I have spent on one brush what the whole 7 pieces cost. Impressed.</li>
            <li> These work really well!</li>
            <li> LOVE THE BRUSHES AND LEATHER CASE.. The brushes are so soft to the skin. You can really see the great quality... overall I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase. . I would say better than M.A.C</li>
            <li> I had previously bought the contour brush from this set and loved it so when I had finally had enough money I went ahead and bought the whole set and I was not let down!  All of the brushes are of high quality materials and durable and I like the fact that they are not too long, like so many other makeup brushes.  I use these every day and love the way they feel on my face and the way I look because of them.  Buy these and you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I bought these as a Christmas gift for one of my wife&#x27;s nieces who&#x27;s very into make-up. She was impressed with the brushes. If they&#x27;re as good as the case they come in - and they look well made - they were an excellent deal. So far, everyone&#x27;s happy.</li>
            <li> The brushes were a gift for my daughter and she loves them. They are amazing.  Can&#x27;t wait to see your new items.</li>
            <li> Very nice brushes. Haven&#x27;t used all of them yet but the powder and foundation brushes felt great on my face and didn&#x27;t leave stray bristles like some other brushes I have. Looking forward to using the rest of the set. I especially like the case. I don&#x27;t have lots of room and it is nice to have all my brushes within reach. Plus I don&#x27;t have to rummage through a bag to find the brush I want.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! My daughter loves it and the case is great for travel.</li>
            <li> These make-up brushes are of high quality and a great value for the money.  The leather case they came in is handy for storing the brushes when not in use.  This was a great purchase at a great price!  I happened upon a special sale for the holidays and am glad I made the purchase.  I also bought a set for a gift and the recipient loved the brushes as well.</li>
            <li> I use these every day. They don&#x27;t shed like my Mac brushes did!</li>
            <li> Brushes were very pretty but a little short and &amp; I think a little pricey for the quality.  I would, however, buy them for around $30.</li>
            <li> Wanted to wait until I used them to rate. Great brushes!</li>
            <li> Very poor quality! I don&#x27;t understand all the great reviews!! I do not recommend!</li>
            <li> Love the softness of these brushes.  Well made and like having the case to protect them from being just thrown in the drawer.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try it. As i had never heard of this product brand. I was very satisfied with the quality. I highly recommend for others to try this product.</li>
            <li> I purchase this set for my daughter for Christmas.  Her response was that it worked very well and applied makeup exactly where she wanted.  Overall, she was very pleased.</li>
            <li> These brushes are such excellent quality. Super soft and the application of my makeup felt divine, especially my foundation. The bristles stay intact, no shedding like I&#x27;ve experienced with other brushes. The case is wonderful for traveling and also to keep on the dresser for easy access and storage. Whomever receives this as a gift will be impressed and know you care about them.</li>
            <li> the brushes are smaller than what I expected. The white brush for the blush the hairs stick to my face.  Today 06-29-2015 I went to use the eyebrow brush and it broke i had to throw it away :-(</li>
            <li> I bought this set for my wife for Christmas, and she loves it.  The brush holder is equally cool, and she says the brushes work great.</li>
            <li> “I’m very much enjoying the makeup brushes. I especially like the case that they came in and how the brushes do not shed (I didn’t like my last brushes because the hair kept coming out). I haven’t used them all but I would totally recommend them to friends. The only thing I would change is I wish they were a little shorter as I have a small makeup bag, but that is probably just me”</li>
            <li> This is a great product! Quick shipping! I would recomand to any one!</li>
            <li> Bought these as a gift and the person receiving was very pleased with the quality and packaging of the brushes.</li>
            <li> Some of the brushes came a little bit frayed.</li>
            <li> The make up brush set is awesome. I don&#x27;t need many brushes, just the basics. I&#x27;ve been using a set I probably spent $50 on while on sale at sephora for the past 4 years or so. I&#x27;ll never buy brushes from sephora again. The price on these brushes is hard to beat, and the quality is outstanding. They are super soft, don&#x27;t shed, and I love the hard case they come in. Perfect for travel. Much higher quality than my sephora set.  I&#x27;m planning on buying the set for both my mother and sister yet as gifts. Thank you for the awesome product and service.</li>
            <li> The brushes are beautiful and came in a timely fashion</li>
            <li> These brushes have a really good quality in them.&lt;br /&gt;I didnt like one of the brush, but the rest are good.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll break this review piece by piece:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the case, it is a good size of brush case that fits the brushes really well. It is not too big or too small, it&#x27;s perfectly fine for travelling. The case itself is sturdy and it comes with two snaps on the side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foundation brush is probably my favorite, it&#x27;s made of synthetic fibers, it is dense, soft, and tapered. It glides on my skin smoothly and it doesnt leave any streak marks. It is best used with liquid foundations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyebrow brush is also one of the good brush in this set, it also made of synthetic fibers, it is tapered and has a slanted tip. It is perfect for cream type of brow products, I use it for eyeliner and it works great as well. The lenght of the handle of these brushes isnt too long or too thick, that I like because youre able to control the brushes properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The contour brush is the biggest disappointment for me, I had high hopes with this one as contouring is a must for me. The bristles of this brush is made of hair like fibers, the shape and size of the brush is actual perfect for contouring. It&#x27;s densely packed and very soft, it picks up the right amount of product but on my first time to try it, it already shed on my me. I had to pick up fibers on my face. Im not gonna lie, it does shed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two eye brush are also really good, the first one is eyeshadow brush which I use to pack up colors in my lid, it picks up the eyeshadow really well. The next one is the smudge brush, it looks like a bigger version of a pencil brush but softer. It is perfect for defining the crease area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last two brushes are the powder brush and the eyebrow comb/brush. The powder brush is relatively smaller. If you want a bigger and fluffier powder brush, then it&#x27;s not this one. I mainly use it for blush and it does an amazing job. I prefer a big and softer brush for powdering, so this is more of a personal preference. The brow brush came with a comb and a straight bristled brush. The brow comb is really useful and handy, I often use a spoolie for my brows, but having this in my collection is also good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, the set is good for beginners and for travelling. However, I definitely think that the contour brush needs more improvement. I wish they will make the powder brush a bit more larger that it is.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this using a promo code for testing.ig and softer brush for powdering, so this is more of a personal preference.

            <li> I love these makeup brushes.  First, the case is wonderful in protecting the brushes and makes travel easy as it is not too big.  Second, the quality of the brushes is of superior quality.  They do not shed bristles at all.  My favorite is the foundation brush, it blends foundation so nicely I am amazed.  Third, for the quality of these brushes, the number you get (6) and the nice case you would expect to pay at least 100.00.  Also, each brush is labeled as to what it should be used for (shadow, foundation, eyebrow, smudge, powder, contour, and eyebrow brush and comb).  Add them to your list of makeup products to buy.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use these for a while before I submitted a review.  I&#x27;ve been using them for over a month now and I give this entire set 5 stars!  They are very soft and easy to clean.  Each brush is labeled for its recommended purpose which is nice if you are not a makeup pro.  My favorites are the powder and foundation brushes.  Great value for everything included.  I wanted a nice set to replace my old bare minerals brush set.  This one is better in my opinion.  The only con is that the set did not include an enclosure to inform you about the product details.  I emailed the seller and they quickly replied that the brushes are made up of a natural and synthetic blend and to wash with gentle shampoo. :)</li>
            <li> I received my brushes and was pleased with what I got. The case is very nice and sturdy. The brushes are soft and as described. I especially like the larger blush brush. It&#x27;s nice when you place an order and get just what you expected!</li>
            <li> its easy to clean and the brush just work right.i can just put it in my bag,no need of digging just to find what i need.</li>
            <li> These brushes more than met my expectations! They are superb and don&#x27;t loose bristle while in use! Soft and really made of excellent quality bristles. If you are a make up expert or just an every day make up person you won&#x27;t regret buying these!</li>
            <li> This set is exactly what I was looking for!  These brushes are high quality, comparable to my older brushes from a high-end department store brand, but much more reasonably priced. (Love that!!!)  They feel great both in the hand and on the skin, and deliver the makeup flawlessly.  I love that you have included all the brushes I need in a single collection.  Also love the case, it makes the brushes easy to sore, and easy to find just the brush I want when I want it.  All in all a super buy.  Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> First time using these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love them and the case!  Haven&#x27;t used all the brushes yet, but the eybrow/eye shadow/blush brushes are fantastic.  Definitely met my expectations.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased! The brushes are of good quality and just what I wanted. Highly recommend this purchase that is looking for a more economical purchase</li>
            <li> Amazing ! Worth ever penny&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re soft and work waayy better than I anticipated.&lt;br /&gt;The travel case is even better&lt;br /&gt;If u want amazing good quality brushes this is your item !</li>
            <li> When I first received the brushes in the mail I loved the case it came in but was not sure about the brushes.  I wanted to use them so I have now for three days.  They are great and a great price.  I do wish it came with a slanted liquid eyeliner brush.</li>
            <li> Awhile back, I visited one of my friends and she had these make-up brushes.  She spoke so highly of the brushes that I had to buy a set for myself.  I have been using them for over a month now and what a difference I see in not only how evenly my makeup is applied on my face but also the quality and softness of the brushes.  Everyone should have these!</li>
            <li> Overall a nice set of brushes.  I get a lot of compliments on the case. They do shed a little but overall a nice set. The angled brush is great, wish there was an eyeliner brush.</li>
            <li> Truly fine brushes, perfect for applying all kinds of makeup.  I never understood why good makeup brushes are either made in Japan and cost a fortune…or made in China and shed like crazy.  These are the best value and quality I have found.  I recently purchased new makeup after the manufacturer&#x27;s salesman applied it using my Amazon-sold makeup brushes.  He had expensive brushes to sell me, but assured me my brushes were excellent and that I should continue using them (he threw out some older brushes from another source, with my permission).  So a great review from me and from a salesman who didn&#x27;t even sell them to me.</li>
            <li> These brushes are some of the best quality that I have seen in a long time. I use only quality brushes. I have been a trained image consultant as well as worked for designer make up companies at the mall. Your tools make a big difference in application. The case is very well made too. This would be an excellent gift to give this year as well as an essential tool set for your self.</li>
            <li> These are good quality brushes and are definitely well crafted and made of high quality materials. First thing though is these brushes are TRAVEL SIZED. I put this in caps because this is not listed anywhere in the title or description. The brush handles are only about 4.5&amp;#34; long. I was really really surprised by how small the whole set was (including the case) but this doesn&#x27;t take away from the quality of the brushes. I am personally not a fan of the shorter handles as they make the brush harder to hold. I will be posting photos of the set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case that comes with this set is amazing. Genuine leather and rock solid. It is slightly larger than a red bull can. This case is literally bulletproof and these brushes are perfect for travel as this can easily get banged around in a suitcase without any damage to the brushes or case. I have owned a lot of great makeup brush cases and none are as thick and solid as this case. It has to be held to be believed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are beautiful. Sleek, heavy duty, wood handles and copper ferrules. The brushes are natural and synthetic and I have experienced no shedding. No cheap materials here. Here&#x27;s my rundown of the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eyeshadow brush-appears to be pony (sable) hair. AMAZING BRUSH! As good as anything MAC has ever made. Very very soft but firm enough to get a great application and picks up and applies make up flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eyebrow brush-appears to be synthetic. This was the brush that initially led me to this page and I decided to get the whole pack because it was so intriguing. This brush is pretty good. Very firm and allows you to fill in your eyebrows well. It isn&#x27;t quite as dense as I might have liked but still good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eyebrow and eyelash comb-plastic and synthetic. Nothing special here just your very basic drugstore comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smudge brush- appears to be goat hair. This brush tends to be used for getting the small creases of your face like around your nose. This brush isn&#x27;t great for blending which is what I tried to use it for but still very soft natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contour brush-appears to be made of goat hair as well. This brush is angled and good enough for blush but again not the best blender unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foundation brush-synthetic-I am not a fan of foundation brushes and prefer to use my hands or a sponge but if you do like foundation brushes you&#x27;ll love this one! Very firm but very soft and it&#x27;s synthetic so it won&#x27;t absorb your cream, also very dense. Great brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Powder brush-appears to be goat hair-This brush as mentioned before like them all is travel sized and I&#x27;m not really a fan of the smaller sized brush as I prefer large powder/buffer brushes. My favorite is Real techniques. Eco tools also makes a very large bronzer/powder brush. But that&#x27;s just my preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good brush set just make sure the size is the size you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> I used my brushes today for the first time and I must say these brushes were definitely worth the money.  The bristles are great and they pick up enough product.  They are very sturdy and look like I paid a fortune for them.  The packaging is great and I love the brush holder.  I would definitely recommend these brushes to any one on a budget or just looking for expensive looking brushes without killling your wallet.</li>
            <li> These make up brushes were perfect for my teenage daughters. I ordered them from Amazon and received them sooner than the expected delivery date. I received follow up emails from the vendor too. The make up case looks great and keeps the brushes organized. I would highly recommend them to anyone who is looking for a good quality make up brush.</li>
            <li> the case is super sturdy and the brushes are all very good quality! perfect for travelling and can also be used as a brush holder! glad i got this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve changed my review. In under two weeks, the top part of one of the brushes had come loose. It&#x27;s twisting on the stick. I expect that from brushes ive had for years and washed frequently,  but one and a half weeks! Unfortunately acceptable. I will be returning them</li>
            <li> My husband bought these brushes for me as a Christmas present and I absolutely love them!  The company is amazing as well.  I had a small issue with one of the brushes, and contacted the company and they were back in contact with me the same day, asking where to send the replacement!  It is so great to have a company so committed to providing quality products!  I will never buy brushes from any other retailer again.  I use them everyday and they are still in great shape! --Jessie</li>
            <li> I just received this set of brushes this week and absolutely love them.The natural hair quality is excellent and love how my makeup blends in so evenly with the foundation brush. I find I can use mineral or liquid foundation with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;I have spent allot of money at Sephora and Nordstrom&#x27;s for brushes and these are by far my favorite. I&#x27;m very happy with the quality of my purchase and the black leather case will come in handy for traveling this summer.</li>
            <li> I have received the brushes and they are fabulous. I love the quality and how soft they are. Thank you for a great product!”</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush set as a gift, the leather case was a nice quality and the brushes were beautiful.  I was worried if I didn&#x27;t purchase really expensive brushes they might be cheap and that was not the case. I would reccomend them to anyone. In fact I am going to purchase a set for myself.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I purchased two sets for myself and my girlfriend. We are both very pleased with the quality of the brushes and the results they produce when applying makeup. I especially like the contour, the blush and the powder brush. The bristles have held their consistency and stayed soft after washing them multiple times. I highly recommend giving these brushes a try 😃</li>
            <li> This Beau Gâchis® Paris Professional Cosmetic Makeup Brush Set with Black Leather Designer Case Holder Organizer is definitely a high quality product! The brushes in this set don&#x27;t lose bristles like other brushes I&#x27;ve used, they are soft, and gentle on my skin. I have had no problems at all with applying my makeup with these brushes. In face it actually has made applying my makeup so much easier as it helps apply it evenly like brushes are supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leather designer case holder organizer is such an awesome case. It&#x27;s not overly big so it doesn&#x27;t take up much space and is very easy to take with you when you are on the go. It also has a button on both sides of the case to keep the brushes in the case safely and securely. Overall I really like it and I would definitely recommend the Beau Gâchis® Paris Professional Cosmetic Makeup Brush Set with Black Leather Designer Case Holder Organizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. Great quality for a great value. Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with my new brush set!!  I&#x27;ve been loyal to Chanel and Bobbi Brown brushes for years but wanted to try something new. I&#x27;m so glad I did. They truly are luxurious!!</li>
            <li> In general, I have an excellent experience. From selecting the product, placing order, receiving delivery and reading seller&#x27;s follow up email, it has been very positive - quick, clear and easy.&lt;br /&gt;Quality, design and price point of the product is great. Feel and touch of the brushes are very good. Packaging is very usable and practical - the black case is sturdy and can stand alone on the counter by itself or pack it in my suitcase/hand carry bag.&lt;br /&gt;Although durability is not verify yet, I trust it will be alright over time.&lt;br /&gt;It is a good buy.</li>
            <li> I really like the set. All the brushes are soft and cover well.  I love the case!  It looks good on the table &amp; will travel well.  However, the powder brush sheds!  One of the reasons I chose this set was all the reviews that said there was no shedding.  The other brushes are great. There is no shedding but the powder brush sheds like crazy! I will replace it with something else.</li>
            <li> These brushes came exactly as described. Each were individually wrapped in the case and my sister-in-law loved them for her birthday! Will definitely order again for future gifts or when I need to replace my own set.</li>
            <li> Very well packaged. Product arrived on time, and was just as described. Brushes are of very good quality - sturdy and well-constructed.</li>
            <li> I only bought the eyebrow brush..excellent...works nicely...eyebrow pressed powder goes on evenly</li>
            <li> The seller ensured delivery and satisfaction shortly after my purchase, it is great to have a company that wants to ensure their customers have a positive experience and are happy with their products. The set is good quality, I do wish it included a blush brush. The brush holder is durable and beneficial. I recommend this set if you are looking to purchase new brushes at a great price.</li>
            <li> Excellent brushes. Great quality and affordable.</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of quality makeup brushes. The Contour brush started shedding the first time I used it. I lose one or two hairs each time I use it.</li>
            <li> glad I trusted the reviews - these are really nice brushes - gave as xmas gift and container is a nice, rich looking item.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this brush set, it is a quality product.</li>
            <li> I bought this professional make-up brush set on a black Friday sale and I hoped it would be all that was advertised, It not only was a beautiful set of brushes but the holder is just gorgeous It is the perfect set for anyone either starting out for their first intro to make-up or for someone like me just wanting to upgrade from old mismatched brushes  P.S. I am a real person and I am very glad I found these brushes, I went back to amazon after I got them and bought an other. ten stars from me</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize what a difference a really nice makeup brush made until I used these.  The set I had before wasn&#x27;t very expensive and was pretty old.  I kept fighting to get my eyeshadow to look equal on both eyes and it just never seemed to go on the way I wanted.  Since getting these brushes, my problem has been solved.  I love them!  I have no issues at all with eye shadow and all of my other makeup goes on smooth as well.  Definitely a great buy!</li>
            <li> I just love my purchased, received today as stated for estimated delivery. Very nice brush set, perfect size for travel as well as everyday use. I would definitely purchase again for a friend. I went their official website and discovered that they support women&#x27;s health worldwide. So I am very pleased that I made this purchase.  Thanks for all that you do.</li>
            <li> Great brush set.  Blends makeup nicely.  Love the foundation and powder brushes the best.  The case is nice, too.  Great for use at home or travel.</li>
            <li> Great product, the brushes work perfectly and hold makeup. I&#x27;ve always used brands like Chanel and Dior, but no longer.</li>
            <li> From the moment these brushes arrived in the mail I&#x27;ve been in love.. The black leather case that holds the brushes is awesome. Then when I actually started using the brushes I was even more pleased.The powder brush gave me great coverage.I love the make of the entire brushes. No shedding at all... With other brushes I&#x27;ve used they would shed and leave little hairs all over my face... I highly recommend this item. I&#x27;m HOOKED..</li>
            <li> great product, lots of choices and love the storage box.</li>
            <li> I was so pleasantly surprised  with the softness of these makeup brushes. Super Product!&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Very good quality and terrific price. The leather bucket they came with was a surprise extra.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in LOVE with these brushes! They are every bit as soft as you would expect from the description and they perform excellently! The eyeshadow brushes give a flawless application and make blending an absolute breeze.  The foundation brush is perfect for a silky smooth finish and the blush brush allows for a gorgeous  even application of blush.  The case is adorable and perfect for storing and travel. I highly recommend this set!</li>
            <li> Nice brush set with great storage case.  Good selection of brushed in the set.</li>
            <li> Wife loved it!! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with the quailty of these brushes. I got these as a gift and I love them, use them every day. I was a MAC makeup brush user until I got these in my hands. I will never go back, these brushes are such good quality and the bristles always stay intact when I use them to put on my makeup! I love the nice leather holder as well, so convenient when putting on my makeup. I would definitely recomend these to my friends and family :)</li>
            <li> This set is pretty nice. I was looking for a set that didn&#x27;t have a ton of brushes, and this worked well. I&#x27;ve used it for about a week and the bristles stay in nice and they are pretty soft. My only complaint is that the blush and powder brush aren&#x27;t very big, Especially the blush brush. They just seem a lot smaller than my brushes in the past.</li>
            <li> LOVE the box these came in - GREAT stocking stuffer!!</li>
            <li> Love these Makeup Brushes. I have used other brushes and they put to much makeup on, these are light and soft.</li>
            <li> “I have used four of the brushes and have found that they are a great value; high quality, especially for the price! I am thrilled with them. Thank you so much for making a great product available at a reasonable price.”</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes, totally soft, cleans up nicely.  Great for the price. Would purchase again for sure.</li>
            <li> The brushes are excellent. They performed even better than advertised!</li>
            <li> I never thought a make up brush made of hair vs faux hair would make a different, but it does. I got this set in a beautiful case, very easy to carry around, even in a small purse. They clean great with shampoo, and they keep their shape. The eye shadow goes very smooth, and the foundation brush is the perfect size. I will get more for Christmas gifts. Shipping was very fast. Overall, they are great, and love the results.</li>
            <li> These brush are awesome. Works better than the brushes they used when I was getting my makeup done.&lt;br /&gt;They are high quality. Love them.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, and seller updated me as soon as item was shipped.The brushes were in a nice leather case which was great ..love it.And the brushes were great for prices compare to top brands and blends well . I will totally recommend it to anyone especially for beginner...love love it.Will buy anything from this buyer ...thumbs up..thank u</li>
            <li> I have never used quality brushes before. I have always used the horrible brushes that come free with products. These brushes make such a difference with eye shadow and powder. It came with enough that I can even keep spares in my purse. I was about to buy one brush for the price of all of these. I am glad I found this deal.</li>
            <li> 1st I did get a code so I didn&#x27;t pay full price. With that said, I&#x27;m going to be very honest.  As I usually am. I have used the set 3 times now.  The smudge brush is my absolute favorite.  I&#x27;ve had a few not many bristles fall all, I think that&#x27;s to be expected.  Nothing crazy. Just one here and there.  I think this set is very well made. I actually had a Co worker whom I don&#x27;t really know come up to me today and tell me that my makeup was very nice today, she asked if I was a makeup artist......... not hardly. I do believe it was partly to do with the brushes and the blending. I hope a fan brush comes out soon. I&#x27;ve been wanting one and been holding out. I Do Honestly Give 5 stars. I can&#x27;t wait to see what comes next. :)</li>
            <li> One of my pet peeves is my makeup brushes and tools sit in the open for bugs and dust to get on them. So when I was offered this Cosmetics Makeup Brush Holder with Brushes and Applicators included for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered one. It arrived and is exactly what I need to give me the comfort knowing that my makeup brushes and tools are staying sanitary and not exposed to the elements. The brushes are really soft and there are a couple different kinds and shapes to choose from. I can also add a couple of other things to the container since there is room to spare, I definitely recommend this Makeup Brush Container.</li>
            <li> I LOVE my brushes! And the leather case is an added touch. My favorite brush is probably the eyeshadow brush... It puts eyeshadow on evenly and blends beautifully. These are better than most MAC brushes I have used before! I would definitely recommend to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I Love these make-up brushes. Excellent quality !!!</li>
            <li> Bristles shed fast!!!!!</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft and are exactly what I was looking for. Also, the case they come in is perfect! Thank you for making a wonderful and affordable product!</li>
            <li> I have bought a lot of high quality and very expensive make up brushes over the years and these brushes are every bit as good as any brushes I have ever purchased.  I purchased the eyebrow brush, base make up brush and the powder brush.  The make up and powder brushes are very soft and feel good on the skin.  I really like the handle on the eyebrow brush.  The price was very reasonable too.  I am going to buy the shadow brush next.</li>
            <li> Bought them on black friday.  Received today.  Great quality.  Very happy</li>
            <li> Until I decided to try these makeup brushes, I had been considering purchasing from Sephora because I really like their brushes,.  Since Sephora brushes are costly, I have only one and wasn&#x27;t sure I would be able to afford a set. In the past, I have been disappointed by cheaper synthetic brushes that shed their bristles.  When deciding to upgrade to higher quality brushes, I liked what I read about the Beau Gachis Paris brushes and was attracted by the reasonable price and professional quality in the description. The superior quality of the Beau Gachis brushes was evident as I unwrapped each carefully-packaged brush and felt the silky soft bristles. I also liked that the brush handles are stamped with the purpose of the brush, as I am not always sure which brush to use for what application. And the leather case they came in is gorgeous.  The brushes for eye makeup application are superb, though I have not yet used the foundation brush. These are the first professional brushes I&#x27;ve purchased as a set and so far, I LOVE THEM!  I wish a Kabuki flat-head was included, but you can&#x27;t have everything!  These are stellar brushes--professional quality and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> This is going to be a gift for my daughter but it is really beautiful -  the case is very well made and the brushes look wonderful.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great for my college aged daughter! They come neatly packed in a round hard case which works wonderful!!”  Quality is very good!</li>
            <li> I have been using my brushes for a few weeks now and absolutely love them.  It is an excellent set, from the quality to all the basics needed for a starter set.  I would give this set as a gift.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I just got this brush set a week ago . I love love it. It is very very soft .I hope it will last long</li>
            <li> Very nice, I use these daily and they are of good quality! Nice product for the money and the case is very nice, feel like I have a good investment for a long time with these brushes.</li>
            <li> Nice set in great case.  I&#x27;m purchasing another for my sis!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are wonderful!  So soft and very durable.  All my old brushes went right into the trash!!!  And the leather case is perfect for travel.&lt;br /&gt;An excellent buy!!!</li>
            <li> Looks great its a Xmas present for my daughter</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted a more expensive store brand set, but I decided to give these a try.  I have used quality brushes for a long time, so this was a gamble for me.  So glad I did.  The quality is actually better than what I have bought from Sephora.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> The best for traveling! Very soft brushes!</li>
            <li> The brushes are wonderful and I would definitely recommend them to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend and she absolutely adores it. The brushes are great quality and come nicely packed in a circular leather case. Recommended!</li>
            <li> Love love them supper soft</li>
            <li> This is my first high end cosmetic brush set so I have nothing recent to&lt;br /&gt;compare it to. However, I did find the set high quality, I haven&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;experienced any bristles falling out of the brushes.  I really like using a&lt;br /&gt;foundation brush.  Overall, I like the set and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I just received these brushes today. They have a great feel to them. I really like that each brush is labeled. Can&#x27;t wait to use tomorrow!! Let you know more in a few days. LK</li>
            <li> Let me tell you a thing. First of all, I don&#x27;t normally write reviews for anything as I&#x27;m usually happy with products I purchase. HOWEVER! This product is NOT worth the 5 stars everyone on here is giving. When I got this product, there was a card in the box that said &amp;#34;please write a review for us and we&#x27;ll send you free samples&amp;#34;. These people, although they may truly enjoy their product, are also quite possibly trying to get freebies from this company. Just fyi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s start with the positives of this product. The case is great. It&#x27;s very sturdy and I really like the snaps that hold the two halves together. Next, several reviewers have mentioned how great the foundation brush is. That is totally true. It&#x27;s very nice and soft, sturdy, and dense. The small angled brush is pretty good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the negatives. The most glaring thing about these brushes is that they DO SHED. I don&#x27;t know if I got a dud but the contour and powder brush shed about 5-10 fibers each as i was washing them. Why do all these reviewers say they don&#x27;t shed? Also, the brushes smell very weird. The smell reminds me of a salon that&#x27;s been flooded with dye and perm solution. The smell remained even after I washed them. Also, the brushes, besides the foundation brush, are very bad quality. They are rough and don&#x27;t feel good when applying powders. The White small eyeshadow shader brush is the roughest of the bunch. It&#x27;s like trying to put eyeshadow on with hay. The shape of these eye shadow brushes makes it hard to apply accurately too. Finally, there were many hairs that splayed out of the contour and powder brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you want to pay $40 for a foundation brush and a travel case, skip this &amp;#34;deal&amp;#34;. Take every review with a grain of salt, as I should have done when I saw all these glowing reviews. I&#x27;m just telling you what I wish I had known before purchasing.</li>
            <li> I received my brushes. I&#x27;m in the Philippines. There&#x27;s nothing like this here. These are the softest brushes and they don&#x27;t shed. I love the quality and I love the leather case.</li>
            <li> I just received my Makeup brushes this week and I absolutely love them!!! Usually when I&#x27;m applying my eye make up it gets clumped up and I end up having to even it out with a cue tip. Not so with these brushes, my eye shadow goes on smooth and looks perfect! I have had the same results with the &#x27;powder&amp;#34; brush as well, it&#x27;s an even, soft and subtle coat. I could not be more happier with these brushes, they&#x27;re wonderful! I will never use any other brand of brushes!! So happy to have finally gotten a set!</li>
            <li> Great product! And when the eyebrow/eyelash brush snapped, the owner, Robin Guess at Beau Gachis Paris, not only immediately replaced it but sent two extra brushes that haven&#x27;t even been released to the public yet. I don&#x27;t think the brushes are cheaply made at all and that is the thinnest one in the set. Stuff like this happens all the time. I love the brushes set and the black leather box they come in is pretty cool, too. I would recommend these brushes to anyone.</li>
            <li> They actually are quite nice, and the case they come in is lovely. Surprisingly soft and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Very nice set.  Appears to be well made and the case they all come in is expensive looking and great for travel.  I purchaed these for my daughter so I have not personally tried them.  Just really like the way they look!</li>
            <li> Great price on this high quality brush set! Also, good customer service and a very kind, personal email from the proprietor. I doubt if you will find better quality set for anywhere near this price. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these brushes. It is so hard to find GOOD quality brushes at a decent price. I must say the quality of these brushes are amazing. Durable, soft, the bristles don&#x27;t fall off!!  Highly recommended!!!! Would give it 10 stars if I could!!!</li>
            <li> I have received my brushes and love them! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Just received my Nars make up today to be able to use my brushes. I will review these brushes again in a week on performance and how well they hold up being washed. They arrived in two days, a week before schedule. They seem very soft and durable. We shall see.....</li>
            <li> Nice quality brushes in leather holder.  I like that you can register them and if any issues arise they will be replaced.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these brushes! They are extremely soft, do not shed and distribute make up evenly and smoothly.  I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I love this set of makeup brushes. I bought is specifically with the case for travel.&lt;br /&gt;The case itself is great, but a little bit too heavy. In general I would recommend this set.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my brushes.  They feel so plush and really deliver a great application!&lt;br /&gt;I also love the carrying case!  This cylinder looks rich and will provide great protection for travel--a bonus: there are plastic sleeves on a couple of brushes.  These will keep the bristles perfectly in place.&lt;br /&gt;Surpisingly, there was a follow up email from the company.  I was very impressed by this.  Taking the time to seek out feedback from customers shows how much the company cares about retaining and gaining clients and having a product they proudly stand behind.</li>
            <li> Great set of brushes and the carrying case is sturdy.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:da7df4e6aba7f9e74022deb2ef82c108]] I got this as a present, which is why it&#x27;s not a \\&quot;verified purchase.\\&quot; However, my experience with this set is something I want to share, especially because the exuberant amount of five star reviews make it easy for new customers to be lured in. This is not a five star product in my opinion and I&#x27;m not so sure the reviews are sincere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BRUSHES:&lt;br /&gt;Low-quality. The Contour and Powder Brush shed like crazy; just by touching them for the first time I got tons of hair on my fingers - and I wasn&#x27;t pulling hard either. I made a short video of this (with my phone so please excuse the bad quality) so you can see what I mean. Besides the shedding, the brushes do not hold their shape well after cleaning. You might be able to see in the video that the marginal bristles are all over the place - and that&#x27;s after only the first wash. I took pictures of this but wasn&#x27;t able to upload any. Another downside is that they aren&#x27;t really soft, which comes as no surprise though because they are natural hair. I would not recommend natural hair for makeup brushes--especially to beginners--for various reasons (animal cruelty might be involved, less soft, trap makeup, not as precise, more difficult to clean,...) but keep in mind that&#x27;s a personal preference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides everything mentioned, the biggest negative of the brushes for me is that they really do not work well on my face. The Contour and Powder Brushes are the worst... they absolutely do not blend well! The Smudge and Eyeshadow Brushes are better, but again not doing a perfect job at blending. Plus they feel rough on the sensitive eye. The Eyebrow one is a fail... it just seems to not hold any color. I felt like it never put anything on my face. I have the same-looking brush from Elf and that one works so much better. The Foundation brush is the only one I would keep, but that obviously wouldn&#x27;t be worth the set. I don&#x27;t use the Brow Combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BOX:&lt;br /&gt;Nice and feels high-quality, but it&#x27;s not practical. As you can see in my short video, closing it is a hassle. There is not enough space given for the cap to be put down without getting the marginal bristles caught in between. The Powder and Contour brushes are in the way and you need to use your other hand to kinda squeeze the set together so you can close the box. This is not only annoying but it also damages the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE REVIEWS:&lt;br /&gt;The person who gave this set to me doesn&#x27;t know a lot about makeup brushes and was sure that this would be great based on the many five star reviews. Also, it has \\&quot;Paris\\&quot; on it which means it must be great. ;) First of all, they are from Florida, not Paris. Don&#x27;t lie to your customers. Second, please go on their website and convince yourself that this is not as \\&quot;high-end\\&quot; as they claim. They also claim on their facebook website (1700 likes btw) that \\&quot;Beau Gâchis Paris is one of the newest leaders in the beauty industry to provide quality products at an affordable price\\&quot; yet they only offer two products (this set and a sponge) and nobody knows of them. How is that \\&quot;leading?\\&quot; Everyone starts small - no shame in admitting that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As \\&quot;CrunchyGummmmmy\\&quot; pointed out in her 1-star review, she received a card that said \\&quot;please write a review for us and we&#x27;ll send you free samples.\\&quot; I could imagine that a lot of people out there (beginners who don&#x27;t know much about makeup brushes in particular) wouldn&#x27;t mind writing a good review for a freebie. This might be true or not, just something to be aware of. It also never hurts to click on some of the reviewers and see what else they write on Amazon. I personally get a bit suspicious if people only wrote one review or only 5-star reviews (often all on the same day) or when several people all review the same products. This again is simply something to be aware of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is all my personal opinion and if you find these brushes great, then that&#x27;s awesome. But I thinkthat as of now, you can get better for less (i.e., Real Techniques Brushes or even Elf!).Techniques Brushes or even Elf!).onal opinion and if you find these brushes great, then that&#x27;s awesome. But I think that as of now, you can get better for less (i.e., Real Techniques Brushes or even Elf!).</li>
            <li> Great brushes for the price, I usually buy all my products from sophora but I thought I would give these a try cause all the great reviews and I&#x27;m glad I did. You will be pleased with how comparable they are to high end brushes. Great buy for sure!</li>
            <li> Just what my friend wanted! Arrived in time and as it was described. :)</li>
            <li> These brushes are comparable to my MAC brushes but are even softer for a fraction of the price! Loved the contour brush and foundation brush. Best coverage I&#x27;ve ever had. The case is really cute and stands up so you can place the brushes in there like a cup</li>
            <li> Love the case and the brushes are great product..</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s first set of brushes...they are perfect!</li>
            <li> These brushes are the bomb, I gave them as a gift to my daughter and she loves them as well as the case, she says they are very professional grade quality.  I would reccommend they to anyone wanting a quality set of make up brushes.</li>
            <li> “I was a little hesitant based on the packaging of the product, but the brushes have turned out to be of great quality, and they don&#x27;t shed.  I will be purchasing an additional set for myself.”</li>
            <li> Excellent brushes! I was skeptical at first, but I quickly fell in love with then. They are so soft!</li>
            <li> Excellent value for the price. The brushes are soft and compare to the designer name brushes</li>
            <li> this is horrible and they smell really bad. The reviews are fake, the buyers get free gifts for good reviews. I should have returned them smh</li>
            <li> Great experience. Seller even sent a personal email thanking me for the sale. Brushes are amazing. I am going to order another set since I Loved them.</li>
            <li> I love my new Makeup Brushes!  They are great quality, very soft, and give your skin a flawless makeup application. I really love the blush brush and the leather case. I highly recommend these brushes at this great price! Worth every penny. Every women should own a set of these for herself.</li>
            <li> This brush set seems to be of very close quality, if not equal quality, to over priced brushes most cosmetic stores sell.  It came in a great leather case for keeping.  I am very pleased with my purchase and look forward to future products from this company.  It&#x27;s so nice to be able to get high quality products at affordable prices.</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift and one for myself.. I&#x27;ve used them for awhile. I got a better set at Costcoin the past. These brushes have a white bristle blush brush, which is hard. The quality of the white bristle brushes do not impress me, or feel good on my face. I think they should all be the same in the set.</li>
            <li> I always expect to get really bad products when I order online instead of going to the store to buy things like makeup brushes, but this wasn&#x27;t the case. What came in the mail was a set of lovely and soft makeup brushes! Now, they do smell a bit, but after washing them, they&#x27;re just fine. Great quality for not a bad price.</li>
            <li> I recieved this set as a gift and LOVE IT! The carrying case will be perfect for traveling and the brushes are really soft!</li>
            <li> I was on a look out for affordable high quality brushes and found this with high reviews. It was recommended by a friend who had them for a long time. I was used to buying more expensive brushes from Sephora, but I figured it was worth a try. Boy, I didn&#x27;t realize I was in for a real treat! I am happy to report that these brushes are a winner! To start off, they came in a nice &amp;#34;travel-friendly&amp;#34; packaging that I can actually put on my dresser as opposed to just a travel bag. These brushes are amazing! They are so soft on the skin, but also dense enough to make sure that application of foundation is smooth &amp; eyeshadows/blushes have good color pay-off. But the real test is the durability &amp; if they were easy to wash, so I went ahead &amp; borrowed my friends for comparison on video purposes. Using just some mild soap and water, they came out clean! I would say, the old &amp; new one is comparable, which gives me the confidence that these will last me for years. I have also tried the trick of cleaning by swishing them around in a container with olive oil &amp; dishwashing liquid, works like a charm! Overall, I&#x27;m very much satisfied with this set. It has enough of the brushes that a daily casual make-up user like me would need. I like it so much that I have kept all my other brushes &amp; will be using these from now on. These stand up against some of the pricey brand names that I had. Do yourself a favor and give this a try. I guarantee you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> These brushes are such excellent quality. Very soft and the application of my makeup felt great especially my foundation. The bristles have no shedding. The case is wonderful for traveling and also to keep on the dresser for easy access and storage.</li>
            <li> I never realized how much of a difference brushes could make in make-up application!  Beau Gachis&#x27; products are definitely top of the line and make a world of difference in make-up application!  They&#x27;re amazingly soft, do not shed on your skin and allow for a perfectly even application!!  Would absolutely recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> I think the brushes are just okay. The price was great, but it wasn&#x27;t the softest. I probably would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Bristles on the larger brushes came out.  These brushes were not usable.</li>
            <li> Great quality! 5 stars</li>
            <li> I got SOOO lucky.  I picked this up on a daily special and I have to say this is one of nicest set of brushs and holders I have ever gotten, even when I paid twice what I paid for this.  I am so pleased with this.  I would certainly say to order it.</li>

            <li> I can say that this is my favorite make-up 7 pieces brush set The Beau  Gachis.The brushes are very soft perfect for my sensitive skin.It made of animal hair, synthetic hair , wood matt handles and leather case for storage.Before I have this I kept buying  make up brushes because I not satisfied and my skin getting irritated.&lt;br /&gt;When I heard about it from a friend  she tells me how fascinating  to have this.So I never double thought to avail it. Its really surprisingly I fell in love right away  when I used it.And I notice my skin doesnt get irritated.Its made of high quality materials yet affordable .&lt;br /&gt;I got this Beau Gachis 7 piece make up brush at discounted price&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend  perfect gift or personal use.</li>

            <li> I could not be happier with this purchase!!! The brushes are great. The seller was very nice and shipped the product immediately. Will definitely be doing business with Collaboratories LLC again!Thank you!</li>
            <li> Always wondered why the pros get such great results, it&#x27;s the brushes &amp; these are beyond awesome.</li>
            <li> Very nice! Much better quality than I expected</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time as promised. It is a beautiful set with high quality brushes. It is a gift that in excited to give</li>
            <li> The brushes are great quality. Handles are a little bit short but not a big Deal!please continue produce quality products!</li>
            <li> This is my first time ever purchasing a makeup brush set online and I can say this set is awesome I would recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> Really nice items; classy looking.  Foundation goes on so smooth; contour brush gives just the right amount of blush.  EXCELLENT product.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely loved the makeup brush set.  It has all the essential brushes I wanted and needed.  The foundation brush is my favorite because it doesn&#x27;t waste any makeup- there is hardly any foundation left on the brush after I use it.  Also, all of the brushes are incredibly soft and just feel great!  I highly recommend this set!</li>
            <li> What a perfect little set of brushes for someone who just wants the basics but high quality that will last and feel great when you put on makeup. Gave these as a gift and they were a major hit! wonderful quality and they&#x27;re short so they&#x27;re great for carrying around in the super nice leather case!</li>
            <li> Nice brushes, and case 😁</li>
            <li> Great brushes with a great price!  Received my brushes and great quality brushes plus the leather case was very nice as well!</li>
            <li> Brushes &amp; case look very nice, bought as gift</li>
            <li> “They were a gift and they arrived with a huge surprise and WOW!! They are beautifully made and so soft... haven&#x27;t had a chance to &amp;#34;try&amp;#34; them yet, but I know they are going to be wonderful! Thanks for your pride in your product... it shows!”</li>
            <li> Great product. Bought a gift for my girlfriend and she loves them and said they are very high quality.</li>
            <li> For the price, it is a good product. From the reviews, however, I thought the quality would be better. My other, higher end, brushes are no comparison - which some reviewers compared these to.</li>
            <li> 1-10, Ten being Chanel quality ultra brushes and one being 99cent quality. The brush set is a solid 8. Smooth application, soft bristles, and most importantly the bristles dont fall off. This is a steal for the price.</li>
