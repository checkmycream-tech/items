            <li>I should had ordered more.</li>
            <li>The s&amp;h was more than item&#x27;s cost.</li>

            <li>I purchased this hoping it would b ok.</li>
            <li>Now Who doesn&#x27;t like saving money. :)</li>
            <li>Great deal after buying for almost twice as much on ebay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more than pleased.</li>
            <li>I brought this for a love one because they don&#x27;t have health insurance to buy another.</li>
            <li>I will make sure to remember the name of this company, No Insurance Needed and not purchase from them again.</li>
            <li>love it just what I wanted</li>
            <li>I liked this head gear better than the original type I used at the beginning.</li>
            <li>pretty good</li>
            <li>Wish I hadn&#x27;t tossed my original Comfort Select!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure this would fit my nasal mask</li>
            <li>It more comfortable and well made.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Other than durability, it&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li>Easily adjustable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as soft and cushy as my beloved True Blue headgear, but it does the job and in a pinch, I&#x27;ll be glad to have it.</li>
            <li>They told me it worked fine for them</li>
            <li>Cheap, does what is meant to do.</li>
            <li>This was a very cost effective replacement.  </li>
            <li>I had hoped this headgear would fit my Fisher and Paykel Zest mask, and it does.  </li>
            <li>I would try it once if you can get it cheap then move on.</li>
            <li>It pulls free from the mask when laying.</li>
            <li>Pros - Comfortable, durable, doesn&#x27;t shift much&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not flimsy and fit my existing mask quite well.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just cheap.</li>
            <li>and it is comfortable to wear</li>
            <li>Its works...but not as comfortable as the original straps..</li>
            <li>Its not as comfortable as the original headgear</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure it was advertised without clips.  </li>
            <li>This fits well, but I should have ordered the original for my mask.  </li>
            <li>There was no surface labeling as with the original.</li>
            <li>This does not occur with the original Respironics labeled product.</li>
            <li>I should have purchased the original one.</li>
            <li>My sales agent who sold me the original refused to believe me when I told him the price of these replacements.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried nine different CPAP makes, and Repironics makes the most comfortable, and this is the most comfortable elastic gear I&#x27;ve used as well.  </li>
            <li>I hope to the method to use this special band.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Product is as advertised and was shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much more comfortable than the other inexpensive replacement I had tried.... and even more inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;cons - Velcro is very strong at first, like most headgear it does get stretched over time, but not as badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was just exactly what we needed!</li>
            <li>Velcro quality is good and doesn&#x27;t lose grip even when the fit is tight.</li>
            <li>so far hopefully it will be a good one for him only time will tell</li>
            <li>It has the same fine quality as original.</li>
            <li>price was very reasonable as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and material is of good quality but reasonably priced - will buy 1 more as travel spare, hopefully the cloth band will withstand the occasional rubbing with the rough velcro</li>
            <li>Very confy &amp; easy to adjust to fit your head properly.</li>
            <li>A smaller size would be even better</li>
            <li>so I know where to get more affordable ones in the future.</li>
            <li>An exact replacement for what my wife needed for her CPAP machine.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Prices for these elastic headgear straps are all over the map - some prices are more than double what I paid.</li>
            <li>I took a chance on this one and sure enough it&#x27;s the exact unit.  </li>
            <li>«««this is exactly what I need</li>
            <li>I know exactly where to order my C PAP supplies.</li>
            <li>Comfortable, reasonably unobtrusive to wear, and much sturdier than my old rig.</li>
            <li>More cheaply made, much thinner material, probably will not last a long time..</li>
            <li>That being said, it still stretches and wears out too fast.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for providing it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It has made her so much happier in the morning.</li>
            <li>The straps wear out extremely fast.  </li>
            <li>If you dont want to deal with them or just need one at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>This product is very well made.  </li>
            <li>With the price of this, I can change out and prevent leaks without costing so much.</li>
            <li>cause he sweats so much</li>
            <li>so, I end up paying a large price tag when I go through my normal supplier.  </li>
            <li>It works fine but will most likely not last as long as the heavier ones.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got to say that this particular item exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>I would order it again because it has held up long enough to be worth the cost, which is much lower than the original product.</li>
            <li>I hope that it lasts as long as the original did.</li>
            <li>My old strap had too much elasticity.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that it is very large...</li>
            <li>Had to buy a new head gear to get me through till my new CPAP supplies arrive.</li>
            <li>In a couple of months you&#x27;ll be tightning and repositioning, and in four months you&#x27;ll want a new one.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this headgear to replace a very old and worn one that I had been using for some time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Compared to the standard issue headgear, I felt I got a better night&#x27;s sleep not having the mask slipping all over, and I haven&#x27;t had to replace it nearly as often.</li>
            <li>This is the exact same gear that came with my machine.  </li>
            <li>Unless you have a giant head, the straps connecting the top to the bottom in the back are way too long.</li>
            <li>ordered for my husband works great,he usually goes threw them pretty quick</li>
            <li>but I believe will last much longer.  </li>
            <li>Headgear material is too flexible and soft.</li>
            <li>The old one had begun to fall apart.  </li>
            <li>It a replacement of the old strap.</li>
            <li>Am ordering more in case they are not readily available next time</li>
            <li>You look even more ridiculous and can&#x27;t see.</li>
            <li>it is okay-not as flexible as I like the others I have had in the past - it is okay for the short run</li>
            <li>Fits snug and so far does not seem to stretch out like my last headgear.</li>
            <li>The Velcro on my old mask finally fell apart.  </li>
            <li>I have spent so much money on leaky masks that made my face hurt.  </li>
            <li>The straps are narrower than the original style and the Velcro is the same size which makes it hard to put on without having some of the material touch your skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a high priority thing for me as I have managed to use my old worn out headgear.</li>

            <li> it is okay-not as flexible as I like the others I have had in the past - it is okay for the short run</li>
            <li> Fits snug and so far does not seem to stretch out like my last headgear.</li>
            <li> The Velcro on my old mask finally fell apart.  </li>

            <li> I mean really, some people want $30 plus shipping for an elastic strap that probably costs pennies to make in China?  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Cheap, does what is meant to do. I regret I bought only one. I should had ordered more. The s&amp;h was more than item&#x27;s cost.</li>
            <li> Better than the head gear that came with my mask!  Fits snug and so far does not seem to stretch out like my last headgear. Time will tell I guess...</li>
            <li> Its works...but not as comfortable as the original straps..</li>
            <li> and material is of good quality but reasonably priced - will buy 1 more as travel spare, hopefully the cloth band will withstand the occasional rubbing with the rough velcro</li>
            <li> I liked this head gear better than the original type I used at the beginning. After wearing it nightly for 4 months, the velcro is starting to rub on the back of my neck. The straps are narrower than the original style and the Velcro is the same size which makes it hard to put on without having some of the material touch your skin. I still like it but I put a small piece of Kleenex tissue under the strap where it is rubbing on my neck. I would order it again because it has held up long enough to be worth the cost, which is much lower than the original product.</li>
            <li> compared to looking around at other places for this product.. No one can compete with their prices. Perfect for those looking for sleep apnea accessories.</li>
            <li> Excellent improvement over my old harness and Amazon provided an 80% savings over brick-and-mortar sources. Comfortable, reasonably unobtrusive to wear, and much sturdier than my old rig. Recommended!</li>
            <li> There are clips for the bottom of the headgear making it easier to put a mask on.  Also there is a great amount of room for adjustment of the elastisized velcro straps.</li>
            <li> Product is good quality, well made, and comfortable. Price is less expensive than from Medical supply stores. Arrived on time and was well packaged. I recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement for my old strap. My old strap had too much elasticity. This one has just enough. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> The Velcro on my old mask finally fell apart.  This was a very cost effective replacement.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Had to buy a new head gear to get me through till my new CPAP supplies arrive. Have been using it for 2 months. Works great and is of good quality. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> My need was meet. Still looking for replacement mask. Will need to have sleep study repeated.&lt;br /&gt;Most helpful at the point of my need.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried nine different CPAP makes, and Repironics makes the most comfortable, and this is the most comfortable elastic gear I&#x27;ve used as well.  That being said, it still stretches and wears out too fast.  In a couple of months you&#x27;ll be tightning and repositioning, and in four months you&#x27;ll want a new one.  This product should last at least six months before getting loose and needing replacing.  It doesn&#x27;t.  Other than durability, it&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> Unless you have a giant head, the straps connecting the top to the bottom in the back are way too long. It should go across the back of ones head, not the neck. Wish I hadn&#x27;t tossed my original Comfort Select!</li>
            <li> This is not a Respironics Premium Headgear.  Its home made.  Its not as comfortable as the original headgear but I believe will last much longer.  Getting it to fit took awhile and its a little thick but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it.  Will not order again.</li>
            <li> I am giving this a one star, not because the Respironics Premium Headgear is a bad product, but rather that the product never arrived. I&#x27;m sure that if and when I ever get it I will give it 5 stars.  The company supplying this was myrespiratorsupply .  They sent me a chin strap instead of the headgear I ordered. I received an e-mail on October 6 saying they were sending me the correct item but it never arrived. Just sent another message today so maybe someone will finally get this taken care of. It&#x27;s not a high priority thing for me as I have managed to use my old worn out headgear. I never followed up after it didn&#x27;t get corrected as promised. I just don&#x27;t have time for multiple follow-ups. Will continue to get my replacement parts through Amazon, just won&#x27;t rely on myrespiratorsupply in the future.</li>
            <li> It works great, easy to use and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;The price was very reasonable as well.&lt;br /&gt;I will order again when needed.</li>
            <li> I had hoped this headgear would fit my Fisher and Paykel Zest mask, and it does.  It&#x27;s so much more comfortable than the other inexpensive replacement I had tried.... and even more inexpensive.  The only drawback is that it is very large...the straps go almost all the way around my head.  A smaller size would be even better but I&#x27;m happy with this anyway.  Am ordering more in case they are not readily available next time I need a replacement. Can&#x27;t beat the value for the unbelievably low price.</li>
            <li> Not the same as purchased through medical supply.  More cheaply made, much thinner material, probably will not last a long time..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but cleaning it essentially slowly deteriorates until it&#x27;s useless. I would try it once if you can get it cheap then move on.</li>
            <li> Headgear material is too flexible and soft. It pulls free from the mask when laying. I was unable to keep the mask on my nose. I returned the gear for credit. The return was handled promptly. I did however have to stand in line at the post office and I did have to pay for the return postage. I am afraid this headgear is just not a good buy.</li>
            <li> I got what was advertised; however the peel tabs became useless after 3 months. Not a good value at all.</li>
            <li> Great fit never have to adjust goes on easy and does not slip around at night.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. I purchased 2 just to have a back up, did not feel I had to back up the back up.</li>
            <li> Finally a mask headset that fits at a great price!  I have spent so much money on leaky masks that made my face hurt.  This one is great.</li>
            <li> Needed to replace my headgear that had stretched out after 6 years.  It has the same fine quality as original.</li>
            <li> I hope to the method to use this special band.&lt;br /&gt;This band is a little bit different from a bundle band of CPAP (M series).&lt;br /&gt;This has double stitches for each bundles of the band.&lt;br /&gt;I think inner stitches are for smaller head, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please explain the method in detail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;Have a good day!</li>
            <li> My husband still has trouble with it. It can be hard to adjust. What it is is just a replacement.</li>
            <li> Just like it said I and if they by I in now if I am by it are tie fed</li>
            <li> This strap replacement is okay, but not as good as the original one that the doctor issued. But you get what you pay for. It works fine but will most likely not last as long as the heavier ones.</li>
            <li> Let me say that it fits my Respironics mask. I haven&#x27;t used it yet but I find it misleading that the seller states that it is \\&quot;Respironics Premium Headgear.\\&quot; This product is \\&quot;manufactured for Legend Medical Devices, Inc.\\&quot; in Taiwan. It does not have the Philips name printed on it as shown in the photo and it looks and feels inferior in quality . The seller/Amazon should correct this deceptive practice. Don&#x27;t misrepresent the product you are selling to me! One star for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It works. I hope that it lasts as long as the original did. 3 stars for it working.</li>
            <li> Pros - Comfortable, durable, doesn&#x27;t shift much&lt;br /&gt;cons - Velcro is very strong at first, like most headgear it does get stretched over time, but not as badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the standard issue headgear, I felt I got a better night&#x27;s sleep not having the mask slipping all over, and I haven&#x27;t had to replace it nearly as often.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure this would fit my nasal mask but it did. so I know where to get more affordable ones in the future. I would recommend this to anyone needing headgear.</li>
            <li> This head gear is one of the best and holds up great.  I sleep with it and nap with it couldn&#x27;t do with out it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got to say that this particular item exceeded my expectations.  It&#x27;s not flimsy and fit my existing mask quite well.  Very pleased with the quality of this purchase!</li>
            <li> Item was as expected.  I have insurance, however, durable medical products are not covered until the deductible is met...so, I end up paying a large price tag when I go through my normal supplier.  I figure, if I am gonna pay for it, I will just pay out of pocket and pay less!</li>
            <li> I have been using this headgear for a couple of months.  The face mask works well with this gear and does not slip or loosen during a night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li> This is the exact same gear that came with my machine.  The old one had begun to fall apart.  I am quite pleased with this replacement.  Good product at a good price.  Thanks for providing it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> An exact replacement for what my wife needed for her CPAP machine.  It has made her so much happier in the morning.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome and it works perfectly.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> IT was the best buy at the time, So, go with it, I did an i am glad did, I hope you are!</li>
            <li> Nothing is going to hold up forever, this one will usually last a year, but after a few uses there are little black pieces of material that will start coming off.  Just the way its made I guess.  Do not wash it, it will fall apart!  Regardless of what it says.</li>
            <li> Product is as advertised and was shipped quickly.  This was the cheapest price I could find on Amazon or elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prices for these elastic headgear straps are all over the map - some prices are more than double what I paid. I mean really, some people want $30 plus shipping for an elastic strap that probably costs pennies to make in China?  Do your homework when shopping for CPAP accessories!</li>
            <li> I ordered this headgear to replace a very old and worn one that I had been using for some time.  When I put this one on and laid down to sleep, I was amazed at the difference.  This one feels great and stays snug,  I am ordering more so I never have to deal with a worn headgear again.</li>
            <li> Great replacement headgear I would  reccomend this it fits perfectly good and will be shopping here again I am watching you guys.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hoping it would b ok. It was the same manufacture as what I had been buying at my medical supply store. I paid for this out of pocket and my savings were almost 50 percent over what it cost me at my medical supply store....and that was AFTER my BC &amp; BS paid. Now Who doesn&#x27;t like saving money. :)</li>
            <li> No clips but I have plenty of extras.  I&#x27;m pretty sure it was advertised without clips.  Always great to have a backup. Great deal after buying for almost twice as much on ebay.</li>
            <li> it is okay-not as flexible as I like the others I have had in the past - it is okay for the short run</li>
            <li> It has velcro attachments and was the correct replacement for my cpap mask, I like the price and will purchase this item again</li>
            <li> It was just exactly what we needed!</li>
            <li> Bought due to low price and within a month the straps were unusable.  The straps wear out extremely fast.  The velcro did the same.  Had to use safety pins till a different headgear arrived.</li>
            <li> Works well with my full-face mask. Stretches nicely and doesn&#x27;t fell awkward on my head. I recommend this product for anytone that has a CPAP machine.</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;m not supposed to talk about the price but in this case it is so simple. You get the same product that the corner medical supply store charges your insurance five times its price. If you dont want to deal with them or just need one at a reasonable price. I recoment it.</li>
            <li> This product is very well made.  The velcro on it is very nice.  Easily adjustable. It is very comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> Very confy &amp; easy to adjust to fit your head properly.This one is the nicest one that I have yet.</li>
            <li> This head strap is much improved from past iterations. It more comfortable and well made.</li>
            <li> same as the one I usually purchase through my insurance and have to pay a hefty co-pay.  I took a chance on this one and sure enough it&#x27;s the exact unit.  I&#x27;m more than pleased.</li>
            <li> «««this is exactly what I need but hopefully it&#x27;ll last longer than my previous head gear and won&#x27;t be anoyed buy the regular adjustments I have to make</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as soft and cushy as my beloved True Blue headgear, but it does the job and in a pinch, I&#x27;ll be glad to have it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t see anything that would make this a &amp;#34;Premium&amp;#34; headgear. Very narrow. Velcro tears when you adjust it. Next time I will buy the standard one. It&#x27;s more comfortable.</li>
            <li> it was very good for my nazal mask&lt;br /&gt;I just wished it had a different color&lt;br /&gt;and the shipment took forever...</li>
            <li> This headgear is value for money. The material seems sturdy and built to last. Velcro quality is good and doesn&#x27;t lose grip even when the fit is tight.</li>
            <li> I brought this for a love one because they don&#x27;t have health insurance to buy another. It a replacement of the old strap.</li>
            <li> This came after quite a long wait. The headgear was not as pictured. Instead of the open triangle as pictured it was connected with three holes like a  Halloween mask. The holes do not align so they get in the way of your eyes . You look even more ridiculous and can&#x27;t see. The company was not very helpful. They told me it worked fine for them and this didn&#x27;t make sense. I will make sure to remember the name of this company, No Insurance Needed and not purchase from them again.</li>
            <li> This fits well, but I should have ordered the original for my mask.  This one causes my headgear to wear on the bridge of my nose.</li>
            <li> This was not a Phillips Respironics product! There was no surface labeling as with the original. I have a contact dermatitis to neoprene products and one night&#x27;s use produced a severe neck and facial rash. This does not occur with the original Respironics labeled product. Several washings and soaking did not alleviate the problem. I am not sure what the difference in production may be but buyer beware!!! I do not have a reaction to Latex so this is not an issue here.</li>
            <li> I should have purchased the original one. Straps too thin and it&#x27;s just cheap. I have hated it since I&#x27;ve had it.</li>
            <li> love it just what I wanted</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same as the ones I get from the home health company but costs a lot less.  I like this model but over time the headgear stretches and does not hold the mask well and I get leaks.  With the price of this, I can change out and prevent leaks without costing so much.</li>
            <li> Fits well and works with my mask.  The price is great.  No problems with it at all and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Authorities are investigating whether a high-speed police chase in Texas is related to this week&#x27;s shooting death of Colorado&#x27;s prison chief, a sheriff&#x27;s office said</li>
            <li> great fit and it is comfortable to wear</li>
            <li> My sales agent who sold me the original refused to believe me when I told him the price of these replacements. I bought them with my Respironics easylife cushion sets. Well I have them at less then $15 a set. while they go for over $ 50 a set in Malaysia.</li>
            <li> ordered for my husband works great,he usually goes threw them pretty quick cause he sweats so much but it seems to be holdin out pretty good so far hopefully it will be a good one for him only time will tell</li>
            <li> The head gear is great.  It fit perfectly and is very comfortable.  I know exactly where to order my C PAP supplies.</li>
