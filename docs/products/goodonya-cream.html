            <li>I was just looking for a good moisturizing cream and</li>
            <li>While I LOVED the serum, shampoo, Conditioner and body wash.  </li>

            <li>Works fairly well</li>
            <li>good qualities!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think the person who sold it to me at a craft fair said it had a shelf life of six months, but I&#x27;ve used it up to a year without any problems.  </li>
            <li>I have used it ever since, and have now added the shampoo, conditioner, face wash, micro-dermabrasion scrub and eye serum to the list of Good</li>
            <li>Since we have been using Good</li>
            <li>All I can say is Good</li>
            <li>Good for psoriasis and skin irritation</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer!</li>
            <li>This seller gives awesome customer service and I got the product FAST!</li>
            <li>I bought this product at a home show almost 3 years ago and LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>Skin looks better and no acne!</li>
            <li>and my skin has never looked better!</li>
            <li>I use the body wash then top it off with the moisturizer - face &amp; body!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I bought it at a Trade Show and liked it</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use much, but this stuff does the best job of preventing the dryness and cracking that I have found.  </li>
            <li>Love love love!!</li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it!!</li>
            <li>I have been using this skin cream for a couple of years and its nice to be able to buy it on Amazon now.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li>I read all of the amazing reviews and really thought it can&#x27;t be that great.  </li>
            <li>We just see that this is a company interested in making a great natural product and they are doing a great job according to our standards and what we expect a good company with integrity and character should do.</li>
            <li>My skin is more clear than it was before I discovered this excellent moisturizer and feels better with just a morning and bedtime application.</li>
            <li>and I fell in love with the skin treat all over again.</li>
            <li>The sales people convinced me that it was better than the moon aloe since I have eczema, so I purchased it online.</li>
            <li>I have issues with most everything I put on my skin making me break out.  </li>
            <li>but I like the price here even better.</li>
            <li>Her skin is lovely.</li>
            <li>After some online research, I was impressed enough to look for it.</li>
            <li>And I made sure to re-order before I ran out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>Love the feel</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>I suffer from Lichen planus and this cream and their eczema wash does not irritate my skin like so many do.</li>
            <li>it just sits on top of your skin without penetrating it.</li>
            <li>if it has Manuka in it even better since I know it does wonders.</li>
            <li>This one just sits on top and does nothing</li>
            <li>and I appreciate that it does not leave any kind of sticky or tacky feel to the skin just smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than the cream prescribed by my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE &amp;#34;Good</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed it&#x27;s better for my face than body, but I use it all over because it has so man</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Manuka Honey Skin Treat is the best facial lotion I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>Better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad it is now available on amazon.com.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work any better than a cheap jar of moisurizer.</li>
            <li>I can combat fine lines and blotchy skin.  </li>
            <li>Super satisfied.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, but a little pricey.  </li>
            <li>The packaging seems cheap, but the product...  </li>
            <li>It absorbs in to my skin and feels like a light moisturizer</li>
            <li>This product is FABULOUS.  </li>
            <li>but this stuff is FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why some reviewers say it&#x27;s fragrance free</li>
            <li>Worth the investment!  </li>
            <li>It dries nicely, and better yet, it starts working the same day you&#x27;re using it.  </li>
            <li>Actually, sometimes I use both Shea Butter and Good</li>
            <li>And getting 2 for the price of one is an extraordinary value.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with this product so far because I had to stop using the Retin-A  a few years ago because of the skin irritation that it caused, but by following up with a good Ph balanced moisturizer like this product or Shea Butter</li>
            <li>I have been paying so much more for a product that I liked so much less.  </li>
            <li>I use this on my whole body and face with fantastic results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Interested in eye serum and Savannah threw in a full sized jar of face cream.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, and it makes everything so soft.</li>
            <li>At the price it is, if I were to order a years worth of product it would cost me about $800 just for this cream.  </li>
            <li>I use this everyday on my face and my skin has never looked or felt better!!</li>
            <li>The reviews are right on.  </li>
            <li>right after I apply it.  </li>
            <li>The top of my skin felt smooth but underneath is felt dry and parched</li>
            <li>I use the cleanser and the shampoos and the scrub and love them all for their gentle efficaciousness on my 65 year old skin.</li>
            <li>It is the best thick cream!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying more with my next paycheck.</li>
            <li>Though the price is higher than you might pay, it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li>the first thing I thought was &amp;#34;there&#x27;s NO WAY</li>
            <li>I have allergies to many fragrances, and this fact is what convinced me to try the cream several years ago..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cream for over a year and can sincerely say that it is tops as an overall moisturizer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is fragrance free, non greasy, and absorbs instantly leave your skin silky smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>The main reason I love it is that is has oodles of organic ingredients and that the whole line of facial and hair care products respect your skin&#x27;s PH balance of 5.5.</li>
            <li>I use Retin A for facial  fine lines and follow up with either Shea Butter to reduce skin irritation or this product  </li>
            <li>It is a very nice product, but it&#x27;s not quite emollient enough and leaves my face feeling a bit tight.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over a year on both body and face, and it has really improved the condition of my skin.  </li>
            <li>It is neither oily nor greasy, but, absolutely makes a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I REALLY DIDN&#x27;T LIKE THE ODOR OF THE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>I really recommend you try this product.  </li>
            <li>I use it for my whole body, not just my face.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>and it really did not help/</li>
            <li>Very soothing.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend you try this!</li>
            <li>It does take quite a bit of this airy cream to cover the whole body.  </li>
            <li>Still searching for a quality product that is a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Product is very greasy</li>
            <li>I use this also as body lotion because of the fact that it does not leave your skin feeling oily and it soaks in quite fast.</li>
            <li>Every time I smiled I felt and saw tiny, tiny wrinkles and lines not because of age but because of dryness.</li>
            <li>Another thing this moisturizer has been good for are healing minor wounds (like a scrape or cut) and a minor skin rash.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells like strong, sour chocolate, and the other stuff was mild, fresh and sweet.</li>
            <li>At this point, I&#x27;m researching raw ingredients to make my own organic body cream.</li>
            <li>I bought this a few years ago and it worked magic on my highly dry and problematic skin, but I didn&#x27;t have the money to buy more when I ran out.</li>
            <li>It soaks in fast, is non-greasy, wonderful ingredients, but it&#x27;s just to expensive for the short time it lasted.  </li>
            <li>The same is true for two of my kids.  </li>
            <li>The key is storing it in a cool place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On Ya&#x27; brand, just not this particular product.</li>
            <li>I love the big jar too, WAY bigger than I thought.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive skin  but with GoodOnYa products my skin has really improved.</li>
            <li>I highly recomend this product to anyone who uses a skin moisturizer and to those who should.</li>
            <li>but I took off 2 for the high price and the amount of time it lasted me.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend for problem skin.</li>
            <li>Have been using this cream for a few years now and love it.  </li>
            <li>I like it better than any product meant for hair, and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend Good On Ya for guys that have trouble with dry cracked hands.  </li>
            <li>The price is right as well, especially during the company&#x27;s promotions.</li>
            <li>I might find it sufficient in a tropical climate, or even in New England summers, but for now  I&#x27;ll stay with the face cream I&#x27;ve been using for years.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different lotions, etc to keep my hands soft with limited results.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone who has sensitive  or problematic skin.</li>
            <li>Its one thing to have a fragrance free lotion that actually moisturizes your skin, Its another to have a product that actually feeds all the layers of your skin with all natural vitamins and minerals it needs.</li>
            <li>One of my kids has minor eczema, and when I use it, it clears right up.  </li>
            <li>leave areas of my face dry), but light enough to not cause new blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>Took in by young girl at cowboy convention in Las Vegas in December.</li>
            <li>I do know my boyfriend has commented on how soft my skin has become since I have been using it.</li>
            <li>It reminded me of the old Skin Cap which the FDA pulled off the market.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft and supple.</li>
            <li>This lotion leaves your face feeling soft and not greasy and no fragrance.  </li>
            <li>mine was FAR from it.  </li>
            <li>I have used this for years and worth every cent spent on this jar!</li>
            <li>When you combine all the natural ingredients to the product like Manuka honey and so many others, I really don&#x27;t know how you can go wrong.</li>
            <li>Absorbed quickly, not greasy/oily but does nothing for Psoriasis.</li>
            <li>I have been using these products over 3 months and expected some positive results by now.</li>
            <li>The packaging just looks cheap on the picture (dollar store quality), but I read the reviews on it while searching for a moisturizer that was heavy enough to hydrate my skin (I suffer from occasional adult cystic acne &amp; the treatments</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done countless hours of research, it&#x27;s damn hard to find good moisturizer with all natural ingredients (I was previously using Alba, which I still overall recommend)</li>
            <li>It smells a little different from the last jar I purchased, and it just doesn&#x27;t feel the same, but that could also be do to a fading memory, so it&#x27;s only OK in my book now.</li>
            <li>I am going to have to stop using it and go back to the old product.</li>
            <li>cream is so rich, a little dab goes a long way.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> but I like the price here even better.</li>
            <li> Her skin is lovely.</li>
            <li> After some online research, I was impressed enough to look for it.</li>
            <li> And I made sure to re-order before I ran out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> Love the feel</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from Lichen planus and this cream and their eczema wash does not irritate my skin like so many do.</li>
            <li> it just sits on top of your skin without penetrating it.</li>
            <li> if it has Manuka in it even better since I know it does wonders.</li>
            <li> This one just sits on top and does nothing</li>
            <li> and I appreciate that it does not leave any kind of sticky or tacky feel to the skin just smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than the cream prescribed by my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE &amp;#34;Good</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed it&#x27;s better for my face than body, but I use it all over because it has so man</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Manuka Honey Skin Treat is the best facial lotion I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion.</li>
            <li> Better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad it is now available on amazon.com.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work any better than a cheap jar of moisurizer.</li>
            <li> I can combat fine lines and blotchy skin.  </li>
            <li> Super satisfied.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, but a little pricey.  </li>
            <li> The packaging seems cheap, but the product...  </li>
            <li> It absorbs in to my skin and feels like a light moisturizer</li>
            <li> This product is FABULOUS.  </li>
            <li> but this stuff is FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why some reviewers say it&#x27;s fragrance free</li>
            <li> Worth the investment!  </li>
            <li> It dries nicely, and better yet, it starts working the same day you&#x27;re using it.  </li>
            <li> Actually, sometimes I use both Shea Butter and Good</li>
            <li> And getting 2 for the price of one is an extraordinary value.  </li>
            <li> Very happy with this product so far because I had to stop using the Retin-A  a few years ago because of the skin irritation that it caused, but by following up with a good Ph balanced moisturizer like this product or Shea Butter</li>
            <li> I have been paying so much more for a product that I liked so much less.  </li>
            <li> I use this on my whole body and face with fantastic results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Interested in eye serum and Savannah threw in a full sized jar of face cream.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, and it makes everything so soft.</li>
            <li> At the price it is, if I were to order a years worth of product it would cost me about $800 just for this cream.  </li>
            <li> I use this everyday on my face and my skin has never looked or felt better!!</li>
            <li> The reviews are right on.  </li>
            <li> right after I apply it.  </li>
            <li> The top of my skin felt smooth but underneath is felt dry and parched</li>
            <li> I use the cleanser and the shampoos and the scrub and love them all for their gentle efficaciousness on my 65 year old skin.</li>
            <li> It is the best thick cream!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying more with my next paycheck.</li>
            <li> Though the price is higher than you might pay, it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> the first thing I thought was &amp;#34;there&#x27;s NO WAY</li>
            <li> I have allergies to many fragrances, and this fact is what convinced me to try the cream several years ago..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for over a year and can sincerely say that it is tops as an overall moisturizer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is fragrance free, non greasy, and absorbs instantly leave your skin silky smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> The main reason I love it is that is has oodles of organic ingredients and that the whole line of facial and hair care products respect your skin&#x27;s PH balance of 5.5.</li>
            <li> I use Retin A for facial  fine lines and follow up with either Shea Butter to reduce skin irritation or this product  </li>
            <li> It is a very nice product, but it&#x27;s not quite emollient enough and leaves my face feeling a bit tight.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year on both body and face, and it has really improved the condition of my skin.  </li>
            <li> It is neither oily nor greasy, but, absolutely makes a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I REALLY DIDN&#x27;T LIKE THE ODOR OF THE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I really recommend you try this product.  </li>
            <li> I use it for my whole body, not just my face.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> and it really did not help/</li>
            <li> Very soothing.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend you try this!</li>
            <li> It does take quite a bit of this airy cream to cover the whole body.  </li>
            <li> Still searching for a quality product that is a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Product is very greasy</li>
            <li> I use this also as body lotion because of the fact that it does not leave your skin feeling oily and it soaks in quite fast.</li>
            <li> Every time I smiled I felt and saw tiny, tiny wrinkles and lines not because of age but because of dryness.</li>
            <li> Another thing this moisturizer has been good for are healing minor wounds (like a scrape or cut) and a minor skin rash.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like strong, sour chocolate, and the other stuff was mild, fresh and sweet.</li>
            <li> At this point, I&#x27;m researching raw ingredients to make my own organic body cream.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few years ago and it worked magic on my highly dry and problematic skin, but I didn&#x27;t have the money to buy more when I ran out.</li>
            <li> It soaks in fast, is non-greasy, wonderful ingredients, but it&#x27;s just to expensive for the short time it lasted.  </li>
            <li> The same is true for two of my kids.  </li>
            <li> The key is storing it in a cool place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On Ya&#x27; brand, just not this particular product.</li>
            <li> I love the big jar too, WAY bigger than I thought.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin  but with GoodOnYa products my skin has really improved.</li>
            <li> I highly recomend this product to anyone who uses a skin moisturizer and to those who should.</li>
            <li> but I took off 2 for the high price and the amount of time it lasted me.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend for problem skin.</li>
            <li> Have been using this cream for a few years now and love it.  </li>
            <li> I like it better than any product meant for hair, and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend Good On Ya for guys that have trouble with dry cracked hands.  </li>
            <li> The price is right as well, especially during the company&#x27;s promotions.</li>
            <li> I might find it sufficient in a tropical climate, or even in New England summers, but for now  I&#x27;ll stay with the face cream I&#x27;ve been using for years.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many different lotions, etc to keep my hands soft with limited results.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone who has sensitive  or problematic skin.</li>
            <li> Its one thing to have a fragrance free lotion that actually moisturizes your skin, Its another to have a product that actually feeds all the layers of your skin with all natural vitamins and minerals it needs.</li>
            <li> One of my kids has minor eczema, and when I use it, it clears right up.  </li>
            <li> leave areas of my face dry), but light enough to not cause new blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> Took in by young girl at cowboy convention in Las Vegas in December.</li>
            <li> I do know my boyfriend has commented on how soft my skin has become since I have been using it.</li>
            <li> It reminded me of the old Skin Cap which the FDA pulled off the market.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft and supple.</li>
            <li> This lotion leaves your face feeling soft and not greasy and no fragrance.  </li>
            <li> mine was FAR from it.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for years and worth every cent spent on this jar!</li>
            <li> When you combine all the natural ingredients to the product like Manuka honey and so many others, I really don&#x27;t know how you can go wrong.</li>
            <li> Absorbed quickly, not greasy/oily but does nothing for Psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I have been using these products over 3 months and expected some positive results by now.</li>
            <li> The packaging just looks cheap on the picture (dollar store quality), but I read the reviews on it while searching for a moisturizer that was heavy enough to hydrate my skin (I suffer from occasional adult cystic acne &amp; the treatments</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done countless hours of research, it&#x27;s damn hard to find good moisturizer with all natural ingredients (I was previously using Alba, which I still overall recommend)</li>
            <li> It smells a little different from the last jar I purchased, and it just doesn&#x27;t feel the same, but that could also be do to a fading memory, so it&#x27;s only OK in my book now.</li>
            <li> I am going to have to stop using it and go back to the old product.</li>
            <li> cream is so rich, a little dab goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My hair is long, wavy and silver gray, and I can only speak for my hair type.</li>
            <li> Now, my kid&#x27;s eczema only comes up from time to time (so it&#x27;s very minor),</li>
            <li> It looked thick and clumpy &amp; I was positive</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this due to the positive reviews; however, I&#x27;m sending it back because I cannot get past the &amp;#34;fishy&amp;#34; smell.  </li>
            <li> NOT SURE WHY IT WAS SO HIGHLY PRICED.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, and in the past, it seemed that nothing really worked to keep my hands from getting chapped.  </li>
            <li> It was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and leaves my long hair shiny.  </li>
            <li> When I use any other skin creams or lotions I actually feel ashamed as I know what I am putting on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from dry, cracked skin patches on my hands and feet for years.</li>
            <li> With this product within a month the patches on my feet disappeared and the dry patches on my hands are no longer cracked and bleeding and are 95% healed.</li>
            <li> I work a lot with my hands and they tend to get very dry and cracked in the winter time.  </li>
            <li> I tried every remedy on the market including Shea Butter, Coconut Oil, and numerous others and got little to no relief.</li>
            <li> I used to get phone calls from the nurse telling me to take them in to the doctor to get medicated cream, and they didn&#x27;t believe me when I told them I was using lotion on their hands because the other products weren&#x27;t working as well as they should have for the type of dry skin we have.  </li>
            <li> Use sparingly and a little will go a long way.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it just from the ingredients alone and it may help where other products haven&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also works for other skin conditions.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if someone with moderate to severe eczema would have to keep using it all the time.  </li>
            <li> Since I have been using the product my hands are drier then they have been in a long time, and they are starting to crack worse</li>
            <li> The eye serum does sbsolutely nothing for the puffiness and dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I used something else on my feet because I like to really saturate them and didn&#x27;t want to use this expensive cream on them.  </li>
            <li> (Yes, I am a little obsessive when it comes to things I put on my skin.)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get dried out once it soaked in</li>
            <li> I used it almost everyday before bed as sparingly as I could to cover my arms, legs, hands, and torso.  </li>
            <li> I use it all over my body and face and will usually throw a little in my hair as well.</li>
            <li> My wife has very delicate dry skin, and we have tried everything to deal with it.</li>
            <li> I started playing with it and the small amount I tested on my hand convinced me to try it on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for the past two years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s wrong with this stuff, but it believe it&#x27;s old or past its expiration, because it smells terrible compared to the same product I got directly from a representative at a trade show.</li>
            <li> She was not impressed, said that it made her face dry and did not penetrate into her skin.</li>
            <li> It stinks and I have really dry skin</li>
            <li> Seriously... I had my doubts about this product.</li>
            <li> This is very hard to find in U.S. Made products.</li>
            <li> but when you stopped using it which I did for 3 days (I was out of town), I broke out worse than I have in years.  </li>
            <li> I like the product, but the smell is terrible and I KNOW that it is not supposed to smell like that, and its depressing since I bought the biggest size available.</li>
            <li> SORRY.</li>
            <li> but I really hate the small.</li>
            <li> Thought I got a bad jar</li>
            <li> but website says it does not go bad.</li>
            <li> I have been using your product for about two weeks now, and I have to say that I am fairly disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> and there is literally NOTHING bad in the ingredients!</li>
            <li> To bad!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year on both body and face, and it has really improved the condition of my skin.  It is neither oily nor greasy, but, absolutely makes a difference in my skin.  My husband loves it, too!  It is truly excellent and I&#x27;m so glad it is now available on amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few years ago and it worked magic on my highly dry and problematic skin, but I didn&#x27;t have the money to buy more when I ran out. Well I got a sample when I bought their scrub and I fell in love with the skin treat all over again. I&#x27;m buying more with my next paycheck. This stuff works.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I have ever used on my face and body. I highly recommend it to anyone who has sensitive  or problematic skin. Though the price is higher than you might pay, it&#x27;s not. One of these 8 oz containers lasts me 6 to 8 months.</li>
            <li> I have been using this skin cream for a couple of years and its nice to be able to buy it on Amazon now.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt my psoriasis skin and feels good.</li>
            <li> I REALLY DIDN&#x27;T LIKE THE ODOR OF THE PRODUCT. NOT SURE WHY IT WAS SO HIGHLY PRICED. NOT AT ALL HAPPY SO I RETURNED FOR REFUND. SORRY.</li>
            <li> I have been using your product for about two weeks now, and I have to say that I am fairly disappointed with it. I was using the Hawaiian Moon Aloe before and was seeing good results with it. I went to a home show and saw this product. The sales people convinced me that it was better than the moon aloe since I have eczema, so I purchased it online. Since I have been using the product my hands are drier then they have been in a long time, and they are starting to crack worse then I can remember it. I am going to have to stop using it and go back to the old product.</li>
            <li> Wow.  I read all of the amazing reviews and really thought it can&#x27;t be that great.  The reviews are right on.  The packaging seems cheap, but the product...  I have issues with most everything I put on my skin making me break out.  This product has been wonderful.  It doesn&#x27;t make me break out, I actually have a patch of irritation that has been bothering me for 6 months? that has disappeared...  I put it on at night before bed and when I take my shower in the morning I can feel that the cream is still on my skin.  I really recommend you try this product.  I have been paying so much more for a product that I liked so much less.  The only thing I wish is that they would package it in a tube so that I wasn&#x27;t sticking my fingers in the product, which could contaminate the product.  (Yes, I am a little obsessive when it comes to things I put on my skin.)</li>
            <li> This is a very good moisturizer. I bought it at a Trade Show and liked it but I like the price here even better. Works on everything!</li>
            <li> I use Retin A for facial  fine lines and follow up with either Shea Butter to reduce skin irritation or this product  which is Ph balanced to 5.5. ( I verified this with Ph test strips). Very happy with this product so far because I had to stop using the Retin-A  a few years ago because of the skin irritation that it caused, but by following up with a good Ph balanced moisturizer like this product or Shea Butter I can combat fine lines and blotchy skin.  Actually, sometimes I use both Shea Butter and Good On Ya together at night and use the Good On Ya in the morning under my foundation.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife. She was not impressed, said that it made her face dry and did not penetrate into her skin. Would not buy this product again, although she likes the &#x27;Good On Ya&#x27; brand, just not this particular product.</li>
            <li> Took in by young girl at cowboy convention in Las Vegas in December. Interested in eye serum and Savannah threw in a full sized jar of face cream. The smell is putrid. Thought I got a bad jar but website says it does not go bad. It doesn&#x27;t work any better than a cheap jar of moisurizer. The eye serum does sbsolutely nothing for the puffiness and dark circles.  I have been using these products over 3 months and expected some positive results by now. It was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> This product is actually called GoodOnYa Manuka Honey Skin Treat. I do not know why it has the lengthy- snake oily rename here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I discovered this product about 8 months ago. I have a client who is a doctor. Her skin is lovely. I asked her what she uses. She told me about Manuka Honey Skin Treat. After some online research, I was impressed enough to look for it. Amazon had it at a good price.&lt;br /&gt;The cream is so rich, a little dab goes a long way. I use it for my whole body, not just my face. It took me about 7 months of daily use to go thru an 8 oz jar. I do not know about it being anti-aging, healing scars or curing any skin diseases. I do know my boyfriend has commented on how soft my skin has become since I have been using it. And I made sure to re-order before I ran out.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer! It smells like honey and does not clog my pores. It absorbs in to my skin and feels like a light moisturizer but, does the work of an all inclusive one (deep moisturizing and wrinkle reducer). It&#x27;s everything it claims to be and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It smells a little different from the last jar I purchased, and it just doesn&#x27;t feel the same, but that could also be do to a fading memory, so it&#x27;s only OK in my book now.</li>
            <li> Finally a skin product that works! I&#x27;ve suffered from dry, cracked skin patches on my hands and feet for years. NOTHING WORKED. I tried every remedy on the market including Shea Butter, Coconut Oil, and numerous others and got little to no relief. With this product within a month the patches on my feet disappeared and the dry patches on my hands are no longer cracked and bleeding and are 95% healed. I wish I had before and after photos to show. It&#x27;s AMAZING. This seller gives awesome customer service and I got the product FAST! I love the big jar too, WAY bigger than I thought. The way my skin drinks this stuff up I&#x27;ll be ordering more. I would recommend it just from the ingredients alone and it may help where other products haven&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This is the best face, neck &amp; chest moisturizer around.</li>
            <li> It stinks and I have really dry skin and it really did not help/</li>
            <li> Excellent product, but a little pricey.  Wait for it to go on sale to save some cash.</li>
            <li> This is also my 3rd time purchasing this product. I purchased it along with the microdermabrasion scrub and its so good on my skin. I have a very sensitive skin  but with GoodOnYa products my skin has really improved. Love  it!!!</li>
            <li> This is best product that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! Love the feel</li>
            <li> Its one thing to have a fragrance free lotion that actually moisturizes your skin, Its another to have a product that actually feeds all the layers of your skin with all natural vitamins and minerals it needs. With Good On Ya&#x27; it does both! When I use any other skin creams or lotions I actually feel ashamed as I know what I am putting on my skin. I highly recomend this product to anyone who uses a skin moisturizer and to those who should. (:</li>
            <li> It is the best thick cream!!</li>
            <li> This is my 3 jar and I LOVE it.  I use it everywhere!  I love the smell, and it makes everything so soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s wrong with this stuff, but it believe it&#x27;s old or past its expiration, because it smells terrible compared to the same product I got directly from a representative at a trade show. This stuff smells like strong, sour chocolate, and the other stuff was mild, fresh and sweet. I like the product, but the smell is terrible and I KNOW that it is not supposed to smell like that, and its depressing since I bought the biggest size available.</li>
            <li> I suffer from Lichen planus and this cream and their eczema wash does not irritate my skin like so many do. Very soothing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!!  I work a lot with my hands and they tend to get very dry and cracked in the winter time.  I have tried many different lotions, etc to keep my hands soft with limited results.  I ran across Good On Ya at a trade show and picked up a jar.  You don&#x27;t have to use much, but this stuff does the best job of preventing the dryness and cracking that I have found.  If I do get a crack or cut on my hands, I just rub this stuff into the cut and it helps to heal it.  I would highly recommend Good On Ya for guys that have trouble with dry cracked hands.  The best part is it doesn&#x27;t leave your hands greasy and won&#x27;t wash off every time you wash your hands.</li>
            <li> This cream is not moisturizing AT ALL it just sits on top of your skin without penetrating it. The top of my skin felt smooth but underneath is felt dry and parched and I was not dehydrated. Every time I smiled I felt and saw tiny, tiny wrinkles and lines not because of age but because of dryness. I sent it back after 3 days. If I had problem skin like psoriasis maybe Manuka honey would&#x27;ve helped but I don&#x27;t I was just looking for a good moisturizing cream and if it has Manuka in it even better since I know it does wonders. This one just sits on top and does nothing</li>
            <li> I purchased this last winter.  The set included shampoo, Conditioner, Serum, Body Wash and the moisturizer.  While I LOVED the serum, shampoo, Conditioner and body wash.  I will never use the moisturizer nor recommend it.  I do have psoriasis and while you are using it, it worked wonders. but when you stopped using it which I did for 3 days (I was out of town), I broke out worse than I have in years.  It reminded me of the old Skin Cap which the FDA pulled off the market.  Beware if you use it.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve found! I don&#x27;t get dried out once it soaked in and there is literally NOTHING bad in the ingredients! Great product, great company.</li>
            <li> Good Day/Night Moisturizer. Absorbed quickly, not greasy/oily but does nothing for Psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at a home show almost 3 years ago and LOVE IT!  I find that it helps to reduce deep circles under my eyes when I but it on at night before bed.  I also use it as an all over body cream now and I appreciate that it does not leave any kind of sticky or tacky feel to the skin just smooth and silky.  I highly recommend you try this!</li>
            <li> This product is FABULOUS.  It&#x27;s better than the cream prescribed by my dermatologist.  And getting 2 for the price of one is an extraordinary value.  I LOVE &amp;#34;Good On Ya&#x27;&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I bought multiple products at the Home Patio show (combo pack) - my reasoning was I&#x27;ve tried everything else including topical steroids for my eczema/psoriasis - so why not.  HOLY MOLY!  I love, love, love this product.  It has definitely helped my hands with the constant splitting, cracking, peeling and itching!  I use everyday and have used the whole jar (lasted about 6 weeks) and my hands are definitely healing!  I truly recommend GoodOnYa!</li>
            <li> Skin finally feels truly moisturized all day not just right after I apply it.  Skin looks better and no acne!</li>
            <li> Works fairly well but I really hate the small.</li>
            <li> Have been using this cream for a few years now and love it.  I&#x27;m turning 68 this week and my skin has never looked better!</li>
            <li> Seriously... I had my doubts about this product. The packaging just looks cheap on the picture (dollar store quality), but I read the reviews on it while searching for a moisturizer that was heavy enough to hydrate my skin (I suffer from occasional adult cystic acne &amp; the treatments leave areas of my face dry), but light enough to not cause new blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the box I was floored by the size of the jar... It&#x27;s huge!&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the jar the first thing I thought was &amp;#34;there&#x27;s NO WAY I&#x27;m putting this on my face&amp;#34;! It looked thick and clumpy &amp; I was positive I could feel my pores clogging just from looking at the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;But I started playing with it and the small amount I tested on my hand convinced me to try it on my face. It&#x27;s amazing!!! I use this on my whole body and face with fantastic results.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed it&#x27;s better for my face than body, but I use it all over because it has so man good qualities!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is fragrance free, non greasy, and absorbs instantly leave your skin silky smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It works wonders on my eczema. Trick is you need to keep using it even AFTER the condition clears. It may come back if you stop. I wish you would deliver to Canada though.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this moisturizer!!!!</li>
            <li> This would be a 5 star product but I took off 2 for the high price and the amount of time it lasted me.  I ordered this on Aug. 10th and had used it all by Sept. 4.  So, about 3 weeks.  I used it almost everyday before bed as sparingly as I could to cover my arms, legs, hands, and torso.  It does take quite a bit of this airy cream to cover the whole body.  I used something else on my feet because I like to really saturate them and didn&#x27;t want to use this expensive cream on them.  It soaks in fast, is non-greasy, wonderful ingredients, but it&#x27;s just to expensive for the short time it lasted.  If the price was $20 I would buy it regularly.  At the price it is, if I were to order a years worth of product it would cost me about $800 just for this cream.  To bad!  Still searching for a quality product that is a reasonable price.  At this point, I&#x27;m researching raw ingredients to make my own organic body cream.</li>
            <li> They say you can put this on your face...but it made mine bumpy.  Works great on elbows knees and feet.  Love it.</li>
            <li> My go to face cream! I have used this for years and worth every cent spent on this jar! Love love love!!</li>
            <li> Not sure of consistent results. Product is very greasy so I can&#x27;t use all over face.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it!!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for the past two years.  I have very dry skin, and in the past, it seemed that nothing really worked to keep my hands from getting chapped.  The same is true for two of my kids.  I used to get phone calls from the nurse telling me to take them in to the doctor to get medicated cream, and they didn&#x27;t believe me when I told them I was using lotion on their hands because the other products weren&#x27;t working as well as they should have for the type of dry skin we have.  One thing that did work was coconut oil, but I don&#x27;t like using that on them because it just made their hands oily when you touched them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But with this product, it works as well as coconut oil, and it doesn&#x27;t leave that slippery feeling on your hands.  It dries nicely, and better yet, it starts working the same day you&#x27;re using it.  You don&#x27;t even need to use a lot.  I&#x27;d say it using the amount of a size of a dime a couple times a day is the best way to get results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also lasts for a long time.  I think the person who sold it to me at a craft fair said it had a shelf life of six months, but I&#x27;ve used it up to a year without any problems.  The key is storing it in a cool place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also works for other skin conditions.  One of my kids has minor eczema, and when I use it, it clears right up.  Now, my kid&#x27;s eczema only comes up from time to time (so it&#x27;s very minor), so I don&#x27;t have to keep using it.  I&#x27;m not sure if someone with moderate to severe eczema would have to keep using it all the time.  Another thing this moisturizer has been good for are healing minor wounds (like a scrape or cut) and a minor skin rash.</li>
            <li> Great organic face cream!</li>
            <li> It is a very nice product, but it&#x27;s not quite emollient enough and leaves my face feeling a bit tight.  I might find it sufficient in a tropical climate, or even in New England summers, but for now  I&#x27;ll stay with the face cream I&#x27;ve been using for years.  This is great for leave-in hair conditioning.  It&#x27;s not greasy and leaves my long hair shiny.  I like it better than any product meant for hair, and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few.  My hair is long, wavy and silver gray, and I can only speak for my hair type.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for some time now.  It leaves my skin feeling soft and supple.</li>
            <li> Manuka Honey Skin Treat is the best facial lotion I have ever used.  My skin is more clear than it was before I discovered this excellent moisturizer and feels better with just a morning and bedtime application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done countless hours of research, it&#x27;s damn hard to find good moisturizer with all natural ingredients (I was previously using Alba, which I still overall recommend) but this stuff is FANTASTIC. I use it all over my body and face and will usually throw a little in my hair as well.</li>
            <li> A very effective skin treat indeed! I especially love that this cream and in fact all of the &amp;#34;Good On Ya&amp;#34; products do not have added fragrances. I have allergies to many fragrances, and this fact is what convinced me to try the cream several years ago.. I have used it ever since, and have now added the shampoo, conditioner, face wash, micro-dermabrasion scrub and eye serum to the list of Good On Ya products that I currently use. They are wonderful!</li>
            <li> Great product been using it for 3years.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and she loves it!</li>
            <li> My wife has very delicate dry skin, and we have tried everything to deal with it. Since we have been using Good On Ya products, and especially the Facial Moisturizer, we just cannot stop using it because it seems to be the only thing that works. When you combine all the natural ingredients to the product like Manuka honey and so many others, I really don&#x27;t know how you can go wrong. The price is right as well, especially during the company&#x27;s promotions. That&#x27;s when we buy all we need for the year. We just see that this is a company interested in making a great natural product and they are doing a great job according to our standards and what we expect a good company with integrity and character should do. All I can say is Good On Ya for doing a great work on a great product and thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for over a year and can sincerely say that it is tops as an overall moisturizer. The main reason I love it is that is has oodles of organic ingredients and that the whole line of facial and hair care products respect your skin&#x27;s PH balance of 5.5. This is very hard to find in U.S. Made products. I use the cleanser and the shampoos and the scrub and love them all for their gentle efficaciousness on my 65 year old skin.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!!! I use this everyday on my face and my skin has never looked or felt better!! Not greasy at all!!</li>
            <li> This lotion leaves your face feeling soft and not greasy and no fragrance.  I use this also as body lotion because of the fact that it does not leave your skin feeling oily and it soaks in quite fast.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion. I got an extra one from buying. I highly recommend for problem skin.</li>
            <li> It is too short of the time period to make an comment.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! One stop shop. Face, arms, legs it does it all. Super satisfied. Thank you for a great product!</li>
            <li> Worth the investment!  Use sparingly and a little will go a long way.  I use the body wash then top it off with the moisturizer - face &amp; body!  My skin stays moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> Better than anything I&#x27;ve tried. Good for psoriasis and skin irritation&lt;br /&gt;Works on ingrown hairs too. It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> Creamy and moisturizing. Never greasy!</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer ever.  Does not clog pores, keeps on moisturizing through the day.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this due to the positive reviews; however, I&#x27;m sending it back because I cannot get past the &amp;#34;fishy&amp;#34; smell.  There is no way I could ever use this on a regular basis as the smell does not dissipate for several hours.  I don&#x27;t know why some reviewers say it&#x27;s fragrance free...mine was FAR from it.  Maybe I got a rancid jar???</li>
