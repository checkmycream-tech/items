            <li>This covers gray effectively.</li>
            <li>they were thrilled.  </li>
            <li>If you hold the can too close to your hairline, you won&#x27;t get the nice coating of color:</li>
            <li>but it also has a nice smell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the one that is kind of like a lipstick</li>
            <li>A nice product to use for those in-between appt&#x27;s at the hair salon.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the coverage the product gave.</li>
            <li>It comes in handy.</li>

            <li>This spray was easy to use and covered my gray nicely!</li>
            <li>, easy to use, good coverage.</li>
            <li>Great for a quick root touch up between colors.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great quick fix.  </li>
            <li>and i found it very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This product is very easy to use and conceals well.  </li>
            <li>The best thing is the fine nozzle which allows you to point it at exactly where you need the coverage.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of root covers and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>This is the best product I have used so far to help cover my gray hair</li>
            <li>I already bought cans for my friends and they were thrilled.  :)</li>
            <li>Love this product at the economical price!!!</li>
            <li>Messy.this spray comes off easily after it dries without even washing it!</li>

            <li>Good seller and quick ship- no worries there.</li>
            <li>I love this more than the colormark product.</li>
            <li>It was ok and did the job, but I like gray away much better, plus it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
            <li>if you are looking for something to cover your grays and allow you more time between colorings, this does the trick.</li>
            <li>Fantastic price thwt cant be beat!</li>
            <li>and this one seemed ok.</li>
            <li>better price than 1.5 oz</li>
            <li>but I ordered it, tried it, and now I love it.</li>
            <li>Am enjoying using this product.  </li>
            <li>And yes I would recommend this to a friend :)</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Nice spray tip for precise application.</li>
            <li>The latest was thing I had tried</li>
            <li>but I am soooooo glad I did.</li>
            <li>and I have healthy shiny hair again.  </li>
            <li>Satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>so you might want to test it before going out to make sure there isn&#x27;t any color runoff (if you&#x27;re using one of the brown shades).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>- most worked well in terms of coverage but were either sticky, waxy or didn&#x27;t wear well.</li>
            <li>so i&#x27;ve been looking for a better alternative for a while.</li>
            <li>This is ok.  </li>
            <li>Much better than competitors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Style Edit is one of the most amazing products that meets all my criteria: 1) relatively cheap, 2)</li>
            <li>need I say more.</li>
            <li>Great product and does what it says but cmon really, $14 for a teeny weeny</li>
            <li>Id rather dye my roots with cheap box stuff every 2 weeks for $3!</li>
            <li>I have tried many others and this is the best color and the longest lasting....</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>Although I tend to use more than supposed to do (probably) to be safe side, it always hides grays to the perfection!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will try before and after photos in a week :)</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but I find Gray Away covers better and easier.  </li>
            <li>and I am covering more areas of my head.</li>
            <li>Of course this varies greatly on how much growth you are trying to cover.</li>
            <li>I have used many root touch up products</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Holds well better than most hair color sprays, but does have build up</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t write many reviews</li>
            <li>you can be sure to get the spots that need covering.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Style Edit is fabulous!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still totally pleased.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I have to color my roots every 2 weeks because my gray hairs.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>Like so many others here, I have tried several waxes, powders, crayons, and powders without getting the best look for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Way better than the hair &amp;#34;mascara&amp;#34</li>
            <li>If you sweat while you use it make sure you keep wiping your face because it drips.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>(more bang for the buck)</li>
            <li>I took a chance and glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Have ombre hair and love</li>
            <li>how 1/2 a bottle will give me about 2 more weeks before I have to see my stylist</li>
            <li>I have tried many products but style edit is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I would give this spray five stars if there were more of it.  </li>
            <li>I found better product.</li>
            <li>This ones my favorite</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love the pointed nozzle.</li>
            <li>Just OK on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Finally a product that does what it says &amp; looks great too!</li>
            <li>And it comes pretty full surprisingly!</li>
            <li>Next best thing to cover grey in between and keeping your hair healthy and looking its best.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Style Edit is a great product and I would highly reccommend.</li>
            <li>Style Edit has beautifully allowed me to go longer between touch ups, the color looks so natural</li>
            <li>It looks totally natural and covers gray beautifully.</li>
            <li>Covers gray pretty good.</li>
            <li>This is the best product for covering grey I have found</li>
            <li>This spray is great - goes on easy, does a good job covering the grey, and doesn&#x27;t screw up my hair.  </li>
            <li>Best product on the market that I have found for covering up grey in between salon visits!</li>
            <li>Just as good as Rita Hazan product, doesn&#x27;t flake, water resistant and is shiny like real hair so ordering 2 more bottles today for backup.  </li>
            <li>Best and easiest to use grey root cover-up ever!!</li>
            <li>Direct pin needle sprayer is great</li>
            <li>and I read that for some people this product worked best with wet hair.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my first time purchase of STYLE Edit spray.</li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;m spray painting my head which is kind a fun.</li>
            <li>Great product is easy to use and not messy.</li>
            <li>After purchasing the first one and trying it, I went ahead and ordered 3 more!  </li>
            <li>I wish it would stay put instead of easily rubbing off of my hair.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, covers gray and color blends well.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say how easy it would be to use on the sides.</li>
            <li>But it covers well,&lt;br /&gt;and washes out easily.</li>
            <li>Covers well between appointments, and easy to use</li>
            <li>Use it all the time - so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t rub off as easily.</li>
            <li>We already use the powder, but I wanted to try a spray which I thought could easily target the areas we wanted to cover.  </li>
            <li>it can easily comes out (like when you touch you hair with hands and clothes..)</li>
            <li>Covers gray and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s easily washed off.  </li>
            <li>It washes out easily and leaves no residue.  </li>
            <li>If you prefer a concealer that doesn&#x27;t wash off easily, look elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>It washes off easily and you don&#x27;t even feel it on your hair.</li>
            <li>Product is easy to use once you get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and covers well.</li>
            <li>spray shoots out fairly strong</li>
            <li>I have dark brown hair and this blends perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I like the product because it is light, sprays on easily and results are immediate.  </li>
            <li>I guess I didn&#x27;t read the fine print.  </li>
            <li>Received quick!</li>
            <li>Gives an accurate delivery of color.  </li>
            <li>It works great covering the gray on my part til the last week before my appointment to retouch my color.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much I have also given it as gifts.</li>
            <li>but the coverage was fantastic and it didn&#x27;t leave any brittle or sticky or waxing or dulling residue on my hair.</li>
            <li>However, it appears Gray Away is now available in drugstore chains...don&#x27;t know about this brand.</li>
            <li>Great cover up until the next coloring.  </li>
            <li>Ok for a quick touch up but fades quickly</li>
            <li>The good news is that it does cover most of the grey after spraying.</li>
            <li>My new favorite!</li>
            <li>Great product for a quick &amp; easy fix to cover that unsightly grey hair.</li>
            <li>Based on reviews, I ordered Style Edit &amp; can not say enough about this amazing product!</li>
            <li>I am so excited to have discovered a solution to my hair color problem.</li>
            <li>Do you want to spray paint on your skin, good luck with that, hope you will not loose your hair.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s perfect for covering up several wild hairs between hair colorings.</li>
            <li>The price is right!</li>
            <li>No longer does it look like I have a bald spot when the roots start showing their true color.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve asked several co-workers if they can tell if I&#x27;ve colored or sprayed my hair with color and no one could tell, even in good lighting.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve asked several co-workers if they can tell if I&#x27;ve colored or sprayed my hair with color and no one could tell, even in good lighting.</li>
            <li>Makes for a good hold until my next visitüòÑ</li>
            <li>This product allowed me to prolong the coloring a full week.</li>
            <li>As others have noted, it has a tiny nozzle giving you good control for spraying.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s not my real hair color. :)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to dye it all until I absolutely can&#x27;t avoid it :)</li>
            <li>Qtips take too long but are effective on front of hair line or top of scalp, but be prepared to use a lot.  </li>
            <li>Qtips take too long but are effective on front of hair line or top of scalp, but be prepared to use a lot.  </li>
            <li>But the good news is that it wipes off easily with a wet wash cloth or tissue (trust me -</li>
            <li>I used to buy the Rita Hazen spray but found that none were available on &amp;#34;prime&amp;#34; and I needed some spray right away.  </li>
            <li>This is probably the best product I have tried for covering grey&#x27;s in between coloring, its works better than I ever expected.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m lucky i can budget time/money</li>
            <li>If you want a quick fix for an evening out then its for you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of dollars and many years looking for a no-fuss, effective solution to temporarily covering up the silver hairs around my temples.</li>
            <li>You have to move quickly.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>This is a quick fix.</li>
            <li>She just isn&#x27;t as lucky as I was in that department.</li>
            <li>The texture is not too matte like some other products and the color is also very nice.  </li>
            <li>Like it very much!  </li>
            <li>so the dark brown/black worked great.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27; covers the grey good , but just touch the hair</li>
            <li>My roots are so light it looks like I&#x27;m going bald with my gorgeous dark brown colour.</li>
            <li>Perfect natural cover up on my dark brown hair.</li>
            <li>It gives great coverage and I can cut my dying frequency in half.</li>
            <li>It does the job and really covers between coloring, but it does come off easily on your pillow and even hand if you rub it.  </li>
            <li>It seems like it absorbs better to the hair to cover more of the grey.  </li>
            <li>Instead of getting my roots colored every 3 weeks, I can now go 5 - 6 weeks easily, saving much money.  </li>
            <li>As with most products, you get what you pay for and if you want better concealment and longer lasting, you must go to higher priced products.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t run, very simple to use, love it!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>Another big plus is that this thickens my hair on the top of my head, as well!  </li>
            <li>What a welcome relief that this product does what it promises without making a mess.</li>
            <li>I discovered Rita Hazan Root Concealer which is absolutely amazing but breaks the bank at $25.00 per 2oz bottle and only avail at QVC, Sephora and now Ulta.</li>
            <li>and she immediately commented on how nice the color looked and was amazed when she washed my hair as to how silver I actually was.  </li>
            <li>so this makes my hair look full and pretty.</li>
            <li>But the fact that it covered up the gray, it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>I hesitate to give it only 3 stars because I want them to stay in business, but I have to be honest.</li>
            <li>It has a very natural look and it is quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>This has really saved me from coloring my hair so much!!!</li>
            <li>works great unless it&#x27;s humid or raining and gets stiff.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to apply covers nicely but runs down your face when it&#x27;s horn</li>
            <li>works great love the small direct spray nozzle to spray just where you need it.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t get it all over my face while I used it and washes right off of your hands.</li>
            <li>Reordering two to have on hand right now.</li>
            <li>Not only does Style Edit do an amazing job of covering the outgrowth, it also eliminates any &#x27;hot roots&#x27; or discolored roots between color touch ups.  </li>
            <li>My natural color is a beautiful silver, however, I am not ready to go there yet.  </li>
            <li>The applicator is terrific because it allows easy &amp; precise application.</li>
            <li>like I usually am, the hair dryer method works great.  </li>
            <li>I only have one strip of hair that grows in grey and this product is great for covering it up without having to do a full dye job.</li>
            <li>This sprays on nicely and keeps your hair feeling soft and natural.  </li>
            <li>I use the blonde which comes out very light brown.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and covers your gray (or white) very well.</li>
            <li>I was skeptic at first</li>
            <li>I only use it on top</li>
            <li>I did this when I first got it).  </li>
            <li>After the first spray or two you&#x27;ll get the hang of</li>
            <li>Extends the need for colorings, and much cheaper than the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; one from Sephora!</li>
            <li>I do plan on buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>I will surely be repurchasing, and in larger quantities.</li>
            <li>This product really works well for me!  </li>
            <li>I was pleased with the quality of the product and will likely re-purchase.  </li>
            <li>this saves me money - Thanks!</li>
            <li>I first found this at my hair salon when I was complaining about my gray roots always showing through.  </li>
            <li>I wish they sold a larger can at a better price point.</li>
            <li>First I style my hair how I want</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>Best used in a larger room, or even outside if you can manage it.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend the product and supplier!</li>
            <li>so you can conceal exactly the part of your hair you wish.  </li>
            <li>Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li>If I had a suggestion it would be that the spray is a little more fine but sufficient to cover the gray hair roots.</li>
            <li>i use it mostly on my side part and it really covers the gray until my next coloring.</li>
            <li>Not stiff, just right!</li>
            <li>really fast right around my hairline especially near my ears</li>
            <li>This is perfect mid-week, in between my root touch ups, especially with 2 little ones and a busy job.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and covers white hair really well!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s coverage is pretty good, but not 100 percent, it is enough to conceal the grey and keep it from being obvious.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, it comes off easily even several hours after I put in on.</li>
            <li>I love how you spray this one on dry hair b/c</li>
            <li>I can definitely brush through my hair easily after using it and use it a couple days in a row without having to wash my hair.</li>
            <li>Thrilled w the way it even adds a little volume.</li>
            <li>My friend who is blond recommended this and said it really worked for her.</li>
            <li>I have to spray so, so much on it for it to turn a grayish brown.</li>
            <li>It is definitely a very temporary solution.</li>
            <li>This works really well.</li>
            <li>Just a real pain.</li>
            <li>Did not work very well.</li>
            <li>It stays on very well even when I work out.  </li>
            <li>It really covers the gray.</li>
            <li>I will absolutely purchase this again.</li>
            <li>That stuff is just colored hairspray, it shouldn&#x27;t cost so much.</li>
            <li>Well, My hair grows fast...</li>
            <li>Works better than expected</li>
            <li>Works very well---</li>
            <li>On days that I have last minute plans I can spray this on the light areas and I&#x27;m out the door.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t even used much</li>
            <li>and I am getting ready to order another one.</li>
            <li>I really like this conceal spray.</li>
            <li>Someone who has straight hair and runs a combs or brush through it through out the day might have an issue with it coming off, but I wouldn&#x27;t know.  </li>
            <li>It works very well at hiding those stray gray hairs.  </li>
            <li>Really extends time between salon appointments.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product, I use to use a different gray concealer and this product by far is so much better.</li>
            <li>Like that you can really target where you want the color to land.  </li>
            <li>Worked really well.</li>
            <li>I also use it to conceal some areas where my scalp shows too much.</li>
            <li>Anyone who&#x27;s having application difficulty, or wants a lighter textured product, should give BUMBLE &amp; BUMBLE SPRAY ON COLORED HAIR POWDER a try.  </li>
            <li>but it works very well.</li>
            <li>Works very well on the wife&#x27;s roots....</li>
            <li>It really works well.</li>
            <li>This product really works - it is really saving me for those times when I just can&#x27;t get to coloring my hair</li>
            <li>Seems like the greys return so fast.  </li>
            <li>I bought this at the suggestion of a stylist friend, and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I have very premature gray hair</li>
            <li>Precise tip to spray only where you need it.</li>
            <li>It really blends well</li>
            <li>Fast and easy way to cover grey roots</li>
            <li>But true to its description, it is easy to apply, isn&#x27;t messy at all, and it stays on - even when you sweat</li>
            <li>There is a pinpoint nozzle that lets you have more control with your aim, and it is quicker to use than the other product types mentioned.  </li>
            <li>For some reasons, the color is very light, I have dark brown hair.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than the brand I have used in the past and just as effective.</li>
            <li>It has a focused directional nozzle however I still miss, however overspray clean up is simple.</li>
            <li>odorless, 3) effective, 4) long lasting, 5) FAST.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for between colorings for those of us with dark hair and a high concentration of grey!!</li>
            <li>Also, this product have very little fragrance which is nice and won&#x27;t smell like cologne or interfere with the cologne</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let it dry completely before touching it.  </li>
            <li>I like it, but it&#x27;s way too dark for my light brown/blond hair!</li>
            <li>: I hold the can with my right hand, pull my hairs gently to get them away the side of my head with my left hand, and while holding the hairs  perpendicular from my temples/scalp, spray gently.</li>
            <li>New mainstay in my hair care!</li>
            <li>It works, its fast an easy and its cheaper than other brands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than nothing for in-between hair coloring because it does obscure my roots somewhat, but I have to find something that is black and not brown.</li>
            <li>More for black hair.</li>
            <li>so I simply spray in quick bursts along my part and sides of my face, so</li>
            <li>One can lasts only about 2 weeks, if you&#x27;re lucky.</li>
            <li>But it might work super on a different type of hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried quite a few of the root concealer sprays and this one is hands down the best especially for the price!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Love this product (received this as a white elephant Christmas present in 2014 and now I can&#x27;t live without it).</li>
            <li>does a pretty good job of covering the grays (not perfect though), certainly better than the one from rita hazan, which is more expensive.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a complete match to my dark brown hair, goes on wonderful without a dull, powder matte look &amp; covers my gray while looking natural!</li>
            <li>and i have tried many different grey concealers</li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone who has trouble keeping grey roots  looking good between color as I do.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different products to conceal my grey roots in between colorings - sprays, powders, pens.</li>
            <li>I have been using Gray Away spray and this stuff is pretty much the same</li>
            <li>Maybe a little sticky while drying, but dries fast and doesn&#x27;t smell too strong.</li>
            <li>With a little practice, it is easy to use with quick short sprays.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this product!</li>
            <li>me didn&#x27;t think about those little gray hairs that pepper my natural color at the top.  </li>
            <li>Guess it&#x27;s kinda a new product</li>
            <li>How did I ever live without this???  </li>
            <li>In 2008 I developed an allergy to the main ingredient in hair color.</li>
            <li>Looks very natural, and doesn&#x27;t come off on the pillowcase or your hands when you scratch your head.</li>
            <li>This little can goes far thanks to the precise tip.</li>
            <li>I have tried this a few times now, and it is pretty easy to use after the first couple of tries.  </li>
            <li>Makes me look like a natural!</li>
            <li>I have not been able to color my hair for the past 5 years.</li>
            <li>I just bought this for the first time having never needed to color my hair before, but I&#x27;m starting to see noticeable gray growing in.  </li>
            <li>so I just spray this right around my temples and part where the grey shows.  </li>
            <li>, this product leaves hair soft and shinny and very natural looking.  </li>
            <li>Overall I love this product and will continue to purchase as long as necessary!</li>
            <li>The only thing that would make this product better would be if they offered it in black instead of black/dark brown.</li>
            <li>It covered my grey areas, specially the small section on the frontal part of my right forehead very well...</li>
            <li>It just covers - pure and simple.</li>
            <li>Styler Edit&#x27;s spray was easy to direct and did not make my hair sticky or stiff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much better than using those hair mascara that makes your hair hard like a bird&#x27;s nest.</li>
            <li>, I can easily get two days of use.&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper than other similar products</li>
            <li>Stayed on but leaves a very sticky film that stays on through rain but rubs off on hats be careful not to spay too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice so far and so far</li>
            <li>I like the color, the spray had fibers that looked like hair, that looked natural on my head.</li>
            <li>Really, lasts until the next shampoo.</li>
            <li>Looks natural and i like it</li>
            <li>husband, kids, mortgage, cars, schools etc..doesn&#x27;t afford me the budget to color professionally at my hair stylists -</li>
            <li>mine doesn&#x27;t even completely come out after shampooing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used mine about five times so far with no issues.</li>
            <li>It has a light feel on your hair,not heavy.</li>
            <li>It covered my grays and also maintained a natural look.</li>
            <li>really the one and only product I never want to be without!</li>
            <li>Service from Ozark Beauty was excellent--their order shipped nearly a week before the accompanying Amazon order.  </li>
            <li>It covers the grey pretty well enabling me to wear my hair up and away from my face during week five and six after a salon color treatment.  </li>
            <li>Good, but v. expensive.</li>
            <li>but yet you can get many uses, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Got a little on my skin on the first application and had to really rub it off, but once you get used to applying it-</li>
            <li>no mess.</li>
            <li>not sure if i held the spray nozzle too close to my hair or if i should&#x27;ve brushed it through more after waiting the 10-15 mins after application or if there&#x27;s another reason it didn&#x27;t fully set</li>
            <li>But I have no other option as far as color goes.  </li>
            <li>A few months ago I got an hombre color style applied to my hair that had my natural dark brown color at the top and lighter color at the bottom mainly because I wanted to avoid constant chemical treatments and also I really didn&#x27;t want to have to constantly return to the salon for touch ups.  </li>
            <li>It covers my grey roots very well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it would be so difficult to wash out - two washes for sure!  </li>
            <li>No messy overspray and no mess left in my shower either!!</li>
            <li>I can run my hand through my hair with barely any products on my fingers &amp; the product lasts!</li>
            <li>my grays are stubborn and sometimes it&#x27;s not the root that comes in gray but further up on the hair shaft itself (odd, i know, but true).</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve tried numerous other products with varying success</li>
            <li>A little pricy but worth it.  </li>
            <li>the salon &amp; hair that is long, course &amp; grows fast, I had been using a high end name brand brown powder as my only option to cover my white strip between salon appointments that left a matte finish &amp; unmatched color.</li>
            <li>Instead it barely covers the gray.  </li>
            <li>Be careful not to apply too much product, it will leave a somewhat sticky residue if applied liberally.</li>
            <li>only problem I have with it is the smell, but I am quite sensitive to chemical odours.  </li>
            <li>It gives a natural look before next color appt.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not cheap in terms of price/gram, but I think it&#x27;s worth it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am lucky with only little Gray in front.</li>
            <li>The narrow nozzle makes it easy to control exactly where you want the spray to cover and it does not leave your hair looking dull and matted.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried others and I&#x27;m really pleased with the fact that this does not have a bad smell, it doesn&#x27;t feel stiff and gives the hair a nice luster.</li>
            <li>I cover my forehead with the other hand and sometimes I will get a little paint on my finger and nails but it washes out easily.  </li>
            <li>it works but gives so little runs out too fast!</li>
            <li>You really have to move your hand swiftly while spraying to avoid a dark spot of paint in one place.</li>
            <li>I was really excited about trying this however they didn&#x27;t have one specifically for dark brown hair rather one for dark brown/black.</li>
            <li>At first if looks darker than the rest of my hair but after a few minutes it dries and blends in with my color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty messy.</li>
            <li>a little on the too dark side (i&#x27;d probably have to play around with creating a custom hybrid blend between the light brown and this color)</li>
            <li>I am completely 100% gray and I color my hair my natural dark brown.</li>
            <li>Then one morning when I was running late and needed to quickly camoflage gray that was showing through the part in my hair, I grabbed the can and started spraying.</li>
            <li>This is my beauty secret that is so easy to fix the grays between colorings.  </li>
            <li>I have black hair, so the \\&quot;grays\\&quot; that grow out are not gray, not white but  appear silver, which is pretty evident and very stubborn and difficult to color.</li>
            <li>If you have colored your hair dark, I highly recommend this product for touch ups for the gray hair.  </li>
            <li>and it was ok for me but hard to apply and messy.</li>
            <li>I was afraid it would be more like that old &amp;#</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This product is absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li> a great light hair spray/enhhancer</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> This covers gray effectively.</li>
            <li> they were thrilled.  </li>
            <li> If you hold the can too close to your hairline, you won&#x27;t get the nice coating of color:</li>
            <li> but it also has a nice smell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the one that is kind of like a lipstick</li>
            <li> A nice product to use for those in-between appt&#x27;s at the hair salon.  </li>
            <li> I really liked the coverage the product gave.</li>
            <li> It comes in handy.</li>
            <li> Conceals my scattered gray strands nicely.</li>
            <li> This spray was easy to use and covered my gray nicely!</li>
            <li> , easy to use, good coverage.</li>
            <li> Great for a quick root touch up between colors.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great quick fix.  </li>
            <li> and i found it very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to use and conceals well.  </li>
            <li> The best thing is the fine nozzle which allows you to point it at exactly where you need the coverage.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of root covers and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have used so far to help cover my gray hair</li>
            <li> I already bought cans for my friends and they were thrilled.  :)</li>
            <li> Love this product at the economical price!!!</li>
            <li> Messy.this spray comes off easily after it dries without even washing it!</li>
            <li> Easy to use!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and lasts all day!</li>
            <li> The spray nozzle is very fine</li>
            <li> Easy to use...just spray it on to cover gray!</li>
            <li> this product is an excellent quick fix in between colors, it covers my grey perfectly and doesn&#x27;t rub off on my pillow cases, quick delivery also!</li>
            <li> Good seller and quick ship- no worries there.</li>
            <li> I love this more than the colormark product.</li>
            <li> It was ok and did the job, but I like gray away much better, plus it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
            <li> if you are looking for something to cover your grays and allow you more time between colorings, this does the trick.</li>
            <li> Fantastic price thwt cant be beat!</li>
            <li> and this one seemed ok.</li>
            <li> better price than 1.5 oz</li>
            <li> but I ordered it, tried it, and now I love it.</li>
            <li> Am enjoying using this product.  </li>
            <li> And yes I would recommend this to a friend :)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Nice spray tip for precise application.</li>
            <li> The latest was thing I had tried</li>
            <li> but I am soooooo glad I did.</li>
            <li> and I have healthy shiny hair again.  </li>
            <li> Satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> so you might want to test it before going out to make sure there isn&#x27;t any color runoff (if you&#x27;re using one of the brown shades).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> - most worked well in terms of coverage but were either sticky, waxy or didn&#x27;t wear well.</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;ve been looking for a better alternative for a while.</li>
            <li> This is ok.  </li>
            <li> Much better than competitors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Style Edit is one of the most amazing products that meets all my criteria: 1) relatively cheap, 2)</li>
            <li> need I say more.</li>
            <li> Great product and does what it says but cmon really, $14 for a teeny weeny</li>
            <li> Id rather dye my roots with cheap box stuff every 2 weeks for $3!</li>
            <li> I have tried many others and this is the best color and the longest lasting....</li>
            <li> love this product.</li>
            <li> Although I tend to use more than supposed to do (probably) to be safe side, it always hides grays to the perfection!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will try before and after photos in a week :)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but I find Gray Away covers better and easier.  </li>
            <li> and I am covering more areas of my head.</li>
            <li> Of course this varies greatly on how much growth you are trying to cover.</li>
            <li> I have used many root touch up products</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Holds well better than most hair color sprays, but does have build up</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t write many reviews</li>
            <li> you can be sure to get the spots that need covering.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Style Edit is fabulous!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still totally pleased.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have to color my roots every 2 weeks because my gray hairs.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Like so many others here, I have tried several waxes, powders, crayons, and powders without getting the best look for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Way better than the hair &amp;#34;mascara&amp;#34</li>
            <li> If you sweat while you use it make sure you keep wiping your face because it drips.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> (more bang for the buck)</li>
            <li> I took a chance and glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Have ombre hair and love</li>
            <li> how 1/2 a bottle will give me about 2 more weeks before I have to see my stylist</li>
            <li> I have tried many products but style edit is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I would give this spray five stars if there were more of it.  </li>
            <li> I found better product.</li>
            <li> This ones my favorite</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love the pointed nozzle.</li>
            <li> Just OK on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Finally a product that does what it says &amp; looks great too!</li>
            <li> And it comes pretty full surprisingly!</li>
            <li> Next best thing to cover grey in between and keeping your hair healthy and looking its best.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Style Edit is a great product and I would highly reccommend.</li>
            <li> Style Edit has beautifully allowed me to go longer between touch ups, the color looks so natural</li>
            <li> It looks totally natural and covers gray beautifully.</li>
            <li> Covers gray pretty good.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for covering grey I have found</li>
            <li> This spray is great - goes on easy, does a good job covering the grey, and doesn&#x27;t screw up my hair.  </li>
            <li> Best product on the market that I have found for covering up grey in between salon visits!</li>
            <li> Just as good as Rita Hazan product, doesn&#x27;t flake, water resistant and is shiny like real hair so ordering 2 more bottles today for backup.  </li>
            <li> Best and easiest to use grey root cover-up ever!!</li>
            <li> Direct pin needle sprayer is great</li>
            <li> and I read that for some people this product worked best with wet hair.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my first time purchase of STYLE Edit spray.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m spray painting my head which is kind a fun.</li>
            <li> Great product is easy to use and not messy.</li>
            <li> After purchasing the first one and trying it, I went ahead and ordered 3 more!  </li>
            <li> I wish it would stay put instead of easily rubbing off of my hair.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, covers gray and color blends well.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say how easy it would be to use on the sides.</li>
            <li> But it covers well,&lt;br /&gt;and washes out easily.</li>
            <li> Covers well between appointments, and easy to use</li>
            <li> Use it all the time - so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t rub off as easily.</li>
            <li> We already use the powder, but I wanted to try a spray which I thought could easily target the areas we wanted to cover.  </li>
            <li> it can easily comes out (like when you touch you hair with hands and clothes..)</li>
            <li> Covers gray and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s easily washed off.  </li>
            <li> It washes out easily and leaves no residue.  </li>
            <li> If you prefer a concealer that doesn&#x27;t wash off easily, look elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> It washes off easily and you don&#x27;t even feel it on your hair.</li>
            <li> Product is easy to use once you get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and covers well.</li>
            <li> spray shoots out fairly strong</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and this blends perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I like the product because it is light, sprays on easily and results are immediate.  </li>
            <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t read the fine print.  </li>
            <li> Received quick!</li>
            <li> Gives an accurate delivery of color.  </li>
            <li> It works great covering the gray on my part til the last week before my appointment to retouch my color.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much I have also given it as gifts.</li>
            <li> but the coverage was fantastic and it didn&#x27;t leave any brittle or sticky or waxing or dulling residue on my hair.</li>
            <li> However, it appears Gray Away is now available in drugstore chains...don&#x27;t know about this brand.</li>
            <li> Great cover up until the next coloring.  </li>
            <li> Ok for a quick touch up but fades quickly</li>
            <li> The good news is that it does cover most of the grey after spraying.</li>
            <li> My new favorite!</li>
            <li> Great product for a quick &amp; easy fix to cover that unsightly grey hair.</li>
            <li> Based on reviews, I ordered Style Edit &amp; can not say enough about this amazing product!</li>
            <li> I am so excited to have discovered a solution to my hair color problem.</li>
            <li> Do you want to spray paint on your skin, good luck with that, hope you will not loose your hair.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s perfect for covering up several wild hairs between hair colorings.</li>
            <li> The price is right!</li>
            <li> No longer does it look like I have a bald spot when the roots start showing their true color.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve asked several co-workers if they can tell if I&#x27;ve colored or sprayed my hair with color and no one could tell, even in good lighting.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve asked several co-workers if they can tell if I&#x27;ve colored or sprayed my hair with color and no one could tell, even in good lighting.</li>
            <li> Makes for a good hold until my next visitüòÑ</li>
            <li> This product allowed me to prolong the coloring a full week.</li>
            <li> As others have noted, it has a tiny nozzle giving you good control for spraying.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s not my real hair color. :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to dye it all until I absolutely can&#x27;t avoid it :)</li>
            <li> Qtips take too long but are effective on front of hair line or top of scalp, but be prepared to use a lot.  </li>
            <li> Qtips take too long but are effective on front of hair line or top of scalp, but be prepared to use a lot.  </li>
            <li> But the good news is that it wipes off easily with a wet wash cloth or tissue (trust me -</li>
            <li> I used to buy the Rita Hazen spray but found that none were available on &amp;#34;prime&amp;#34; and I needed some spray right away.  </li>
            <li> This is probably the best product I have tried for covering grey&#x27;s in between coloring, its works better than I ever expected.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m lucky i can budget time/money</li>
            <li> If you want a quick fix for an evening out then its for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of dollars and many years looking for a no-fuss, effective solution to temporarily covering up the silver hairs around my temples.</li>
            <li> You have to move quickly.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a quick fix.</li>
            <li> She just isn&#x27;t as lucky as I was in that department.</li>
            <li> The texture is not too matte like some other products and the color is also very nice.  </li>
            <li> Like it very much!  </li>
            <li> so the dark brown/black worked great.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27; covers the grey good , but just touch the hair</li>
            <li> My roots are so light it looks like I&#x27;m going bald with my gorgeous dark brown colour.</li>
            <li> Perfect natural cover up on my dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> It gives great coverage and I can cut my dying frequency in half.</li>
            <li> It does the job and really covers between coloring, but it does come off easily on your pillow and even hand if you rub it.  </li>
            <li> It seems like it absorbs better to the hair to cover more of the grey.  </li>
            <li> Instead of getting my roots colored every 3 weeks, I can now go 5 - 6 weeks easily, saving much money.  </li>
            <li> As with most products, you get what you pay for and if you want better concealment and longer lasting, you must go to higher priced products.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t run, very simple to use, love it!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> Another big plus is that this thickens my hair on the top of my head, as well!  </li>
            <li> What a welcome relief that this product does what it promises without making a mess.</li>
            <li> I discovered Rita Hazan Root Concealer which is absolutely amazing but breaks the bank at $25.00 per 2oz bottle and only avail at QVC, Sephora and now Ulta.</li>
            <li> and she immediately commented on how nice the color looked and was amazed when she washed my hair as to how silver I actually was.  </li>
            <li> so this makes my hair look full and pretty.</li>
            <li> But the fact that it covered up the gray, it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> I hesitate to give it only 3 stars because I want them to stay in business, but I have to be honest.</li>
            <li> It has a very natural look and it is quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> This has really saved me from coloring my hair so much!!!</li>
            <li> works great unless it&#x27;s humid or raining and gets stiff.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to apply covers nicely but runs down your face when it&#x27;s horn</li>
            <li> works great love the small direct spray nozzle to spray just where you need it.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t get it all over my face while I used it and washes right off of your hands.</li>
            <li> Reordering two to have on hand right now.</li>
            <li> Not only does Style Edit do an amazing job of covering the outgrowth, it also eliminates any &#x27;hot roots&#x27; or discolored roots between color touch ups.  </li>
            <li> My natural color is a beautiful silver, however, I am not ready to go there yet.  </li>
            <li> The applicator is terrific because it allows easy &amp; precise application.</li>
            <li> like I usually am, the hair dryer method works great.  </li>
            <li> I only have one strip of hair that grows in grey and this product is great for covering it up without having to do a full dye job.</li>
            <li> This sprays on nicely and keeps your hair feeling soft and natural.  </li>
            <li> I use the blonde which comes out very light brown.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and covers your gray (or white) very well.</li>
            <li> I was skeptic at first</li>
            <li> I only use it on top</li>
            <li> I did this when I first got it).  </li>
            <li> After the first spray or two you&#x27;ll get the hang of</li>
            <li> Extends the need for colorings, and much cheaper than the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; one from Sephora!</li>
            <li> I do plan on buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> I will surely be repurchasing, and in larger quantities.</li>
            <li> This product really works well for me!  </li>
            <li> I was pleased with the quality of the product and will likely re-purchase.  </li>
            <li> this saves me money - Thanks!</li>
            <li> I first found this at my hair salon when I was complaining about my gray roots always showing through.  </li>
            <li> I wish they sold a larger can at a better price point.</li>
            <li> First I style my hair how I want</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> Best used in a larger room, or even outside if you can manage it.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend the product and supplier!</li>
            <li> so you can conceal exactly the part of your hair you wish.  </li>
            <li> Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li> If I had a suggestion it would be that the spray is a little more fine but sufficient to cover the gray hair roots.</li>
            <li> i use it mostly on my side part and it really covers the gray until my next coloring.</li>
            <li> Not stiff, just right!</li>
            <li> really fast right around my hairline especially near my ears</li>
            <li> This is perfect mid-week, in between my root touch ups, especially with 2 little ones and a busy job.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and covers white hair really well!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s coverage is pretty good, but not 100 percent, it is enough to conceal the grey and keep it from being obvious.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, it comes off easily even several hours after I put in on.</li>
            <li> I love how you spray this one on dry hair b/c</li>
            <li> I can definitely brush through my hair easily after using it and use it a couple days in a row without having to wash my hair.</li>
            <li> Thrilled w the way it even adds a little volume.</li>
            <li> My friend who is blond recommended this and said it really worked for her.</li>
            <li> I have to spray so, so much on it for it to turn a grayish brown.</li>
            <li> It is definitely a very temporary solution.</li>
            <li> This works really well.</li>
            <li> Just a real pain.</li>
            <li> Did not work very well.</li>
            <li> It stays on very well even when I work out.  </li>
            <li> It really covers the gray.</li>
            <li> I will absolutely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> That stuff is just colored hairspray, it shouldn&#x27;t cost so much.</li>
            <li> Well, My hair grows fast...</li>
            <li> Works better than expected</li>
            <li> Works very well---</li>
            <li> On days that I have last minute plans I can spray this on the light areas and I&#x27;m out the door.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t even used much</li>
            <li> and I am getting ready to order another one.</li>
            <li> I really like this conceal spray.</li>
            <li> Someone who has straight hair and runs a combs or brush through it through out the day might have an issue with it coming off, but I wouldn&#x27;t know.  </li>
            <li> It works very well at hiding those stray gray hairs.  </li>
            <li> Really extends time between salon appointments.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product, I use to use a different gray concealer and this product by far is so much better.</li>
            <li> Like that you can really target where you want the color to land.  </li>
            <li> Worked really well.</li>
            <li> I also use it to conceal some areas where my scalp shows too much.</li>
            <li> Anyone who&#x27;s having application difficulty, or wants a lighter textured product, should give BUMBLE &amp; BUMBLE SPRAY ON COLORED HAIR POWDER a try.  </li>
            <li> but it works very well.</li>
            <li> Works very well on the wife&#x27;s roots....</li>
            <li> It really works well.</li>
            <li> This product really works - it is really saving me for those times when I just can&#x27;t get to coloring my hair</li>
            <li> Seems like the greys return so fast.  </li>
            <li> I bought this at the suggestion of a stylist friend, and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I have very premature gray hair</li>
            <li> Precise tip to spray only where you need it.</li>
            <li> It really blends well</li>
            <li> Fast and easy way to cover grey roots</li>
            <li> But true to its description, it is easy to apply, isn&#x27;t messy at all, and it stays on - even when you sweat</li>
            <li> There is a pinpoint nozzle that lets you have more control with your aim, and it is quicker to use than the other product types mentioned.  </li>
            <li> For some reasons, the color is very light, I have dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than the brand I have used in the past and just as effective.</li>
            <li> It has a focused directional nozzle however I still miss, however overspray clean up is simple.</li>
            <li> odorless, 3) effective, 4) long lasting, 5) FAST.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great for between colorings for those of us with dark hair and a high concentration of grey!!</li>
            <li> Also, this product have very little fragrance which is nice and won&#x27;t smell like cologne or interfere with the cologne</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let it dry completely before touching it.  </li>
            <li> I like it, but it&#x27;s way too dark for my light brown/blond hair!</li>
            <li> : I hold the can with my right hand, pull my hairs gently to get them away the side of my head with my left hand, and while holding the hairs  perpendicular from my temples/scalp, spray gently.</li>
            <li> New mainstay in my hair care!</li>
            <li> It works, its fast an easy and its cheaper than other brands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than nothing for in-between hair coloring because it does obscure my roots somewhat, but I have to find something that is black and not brown.</li>
            <li> More for black hair.</li>
            <li> so I simply spray in quick bursts along my part and sides of my face, so</li>
            <li> One can lasts only about 2 weeks, if you&#x27;re lucky.</li>
            <li> But it might work super on a different type of hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few of the root concealer sprays and this one is hands down the best especially for the price!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this product (received this as a white elephant Christmas present in 2014 and now I can&#x27;t live without it).</li>
            <li> does a pretty good job of covering the grays (not perfect though), certainly better than the one from rita hazan, which is more expensive.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a complete match to my dark brown hair, goes on wonderful without a dull, powder matte look &amp; covers my gray while looking natural!</li>
            <li> and i have tried many different grey concealers</li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone who has trouble keeping grey roots  looking good between color as I do.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different products to conceal my grey roots in between colorings - sprays, powders, pens.</li>
            <li> I have been using Gray Away spray and this stuff is pretty much the same</li>
            <li> Maybe a little sticky while drying, but dries fast and doesn&#x27;t smell too strong.</li>
            <li> With a little practice, it is easy to use with quick short sprays.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this product!</li>
            <li> me didn&#x27;t think about those little gray hairs that pepper my natural color at the top.  </li>
            <li> Guess it&#x27;s kinda a new product</li>
            <li> How did I ever live without this???  </li>
            <li> In 2008 I developed an allergy to the main ingredient in hair color.</li>
            <li> Looks very natural, and doesn&#x27;t come off on the pillowcase or your hands when you scratch your head.</li>
            <li> This little can goes far thanks to the precise tip.</li>
            <li> I have tried this a few times now, and it is pretty easy to use after the first couple of tries.  </li>
            <li> Makes me look like a natural!</li>
            <li> I have not been able to color my hair for the past 5 years.</li>
            <li> I just bought this for the first time having never needed to color my hair before, but I&#x27;m starting to see noticeable gray growing in.  </li>
            <li> so I just spray this right around my temples and part where the grey shows.  </li>
            <li> , this product leaves hair soft and shinny and very natural looking.  </li>
            <li> Overall I love this product and will continue to purchase as long as necessary!</li>
            <li> The only thing that would make this product better would be if they offered it in black instead of black/dark brown.</li>
            <li> It covered my grey areas, specially the small section on the frontal part of my right forehead very well...</li>
            <li> It just covers - pure and simple.</li>
            <li> Styler Edit&#x27;s spray was easy to direct and did not make my hair sticky or stiff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much better than using those hair mascara that makes your hair hard like a bird&#x27;s nest.</li>
            <li> , I can easily get two days of use.&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper than other similar products</li>
            <li> Stayed on but leaves a very sticky film that stays on through rain but rubs off on hats be careful not to spay too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice so far and so far</li>
            <li> I like the color, the spray had fibers that looked like hair, that looked natural on my head.</li>
            <li> Really, lasts until the next shampoo.</li>
            <li> Looks natural and i like it</li>
            <li> husband, kids, mortgage, cars, schools etc..doesn&#x27;t afford me the budget to color professionally at my hair stylists -</li>
            <li> mine doesn&#x27;t even completely come out after shampooing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used mine about five times so far with no issues.</li>
            <li> It has a light feel on your hair,not heavy.</li>
            <li> It covered my grays and also maintained a natural look.</li>
            <li> really the one and only product I never want to be without!</li>
            <li> Service from Ozark Beauty was excellent--their order shipped nearly a week before the accompanying Amazon order.  </li>
            <li> It covers the grey pretty well enabling me to wear my hair up and away from my face during week five and six after a salon color treatment.  </li>
            <li> Good, but v. expensive.</li>
            <li> but yet you can get many uses, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Got a little on my skin on the first application and had to really rub it off, but once you get used to applying it-</li>
            <li> no mess.</li>
            <li> not sure if i held the spray nozzle too close to my hair or if i should&#x27;ve brushed it through more after waiting the 10-15 mins after application or if there&#x27;s another reason it didn&#x27;t fully set</li>
            <li> But I have no other option as far as color goes.  </li>
            <li> A few months ago I got an hombre color style applied to my hair that had my natural dark brown color at the top and lighter color at the bottom mainly because I wanted to avoid constant chemical treatments and also I really didn&#x27;t want to have to constantly return to the salon for touch ups.  </li>
            <li> It covers my grey roots very well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would be so difficult to wash out - two washes for sure!  </li>
            <li> No messy overspray and no mess left in my shower either!!</li>
            <li> I can run my hand through my hair with barely any products on my fingers &amp; the product lasts!</li>
            <li> my grays are stubborn and sometimes it&#x27;s not the root that comes in gray but further up on the hair shaft itself (odd, i know, but true).</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried numerous other products with varying success</li>
            <li> A little pricy but worth it.  </li>
            <li> the salon &amp; hair that is long, course &amp; grows fast, I had been using a high end name brand brown powder as my only option to cover my white strip between salon appointments that left a matte finish &amp; unmatched color.</li>
            <li> Instead it barely covers the gray.  </li>
            <li> Be careful not to apply too much product, it will leave a somewhat sticky residue if applied liberally.</li>
            <li> only problem I have with it is the smell, but I am quite sensitive to chemical odours.  </li>
            <li> It gives a natural look before next color appt.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not cheap in terms of price/gram, but I think it&#x27;s worth it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am lucky with only little Gray in front.</li>
            <li> The narrow nozzle makes it easy to control exactly where you want the spray to cover and it does not leave your hair looking dull and matted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others and I&#x27;m really pleased with the fact that this does not have a bad smell, it doesn&#x27;t feel stiff and gives the hair a nice luster.</li>
            <li> I cover my forehead with the other hand and sometimes I will get a little paint on my finger and nails but it washes out easily.  </li>
            <li> it works but gives so little runs out too fast!</li>
            <li> You really have to move your hand swiftly while spraying to avoid a dark spot of paint in one place.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about trying this however they didn&#x27;t have one specifically for dark brown hair rather one for dark brown/black.</li>
            <li> At first if looks darker than the rest of my hair but after a few minutes it dries and blends in with my color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty messy.</li>
            <li> a little on the too dark side (i&#x27;d probably have to play around with creating a custom hybrid blend between the light brown and this color)</li>
            <li> I am completely 100% gray and I color my hair my natural dark brown.</li>
            <li> Then one morning when I was running late and needed to quickly camoflage gray that was showing through the part in my hair, I grabbed the can and started spraying.</li>
            <li> This is my beauty secret that is so easy to fix the grays between colorings.  </li>
            <li> I have black hair, so the \\&quot;grays\\&quot; that grow out are not gray, not white but  appear silver, which is pretty evident and very stubborn and difficult to color.</li>
            <li> If you have colored your hair dark, I highly recommend this product for touch ups for the gray hair.  </li>
            <li> and it was ok for me but hard to apply and messy.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would be more like that old &amp;#</li>
            <li> WITH This product I found the quick forceful spray just too difficult to manage and the color was not quite right for my dark blonde highlighted hair.  </li>
            <li> A little clean up is usually needed after application, especially in the ears as I have short hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even perfected a technique using carbon black eyeshadow and eye shadow primer to cover up the grays but it was time consuming, and I would have to get up extra early in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> made several attempt after letting it dry between coats; This product just did not take after a numerous attempts.</li>
            <li> I am 30 and am just starting to get grey hair.  </li>
            <li> Works well, but didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t take that long to dry, but if you&#x27;re impatient or in a hurry</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use toilet paper or it may flake off on your hair.</li>
            <li> I love wearing my hair up in a bun, but last year my edges thin out due to having tight braids, so after a lot of research on line and YouTube I found this product on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of grey</li>
            <li> but hair got slightly wet during opening/closing of umbrella when outside.</li>
            <li> I know this because I have alot of grey hair on the sides.</li>
            <li> It does cover the grey hair well on the crown of my head.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Hides grey&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a long time</li>
            <li> It came earlier than expected.  </li>
            <li> It conceals the spots where my hair has not filled in completely after chemo.</li>
            <li> It does wonders to cover the grey</li>
            <li> I tend to get grey</li>
            <li> It hurts the scalp and doesn&#x27;t conceal the grey.</li>
            <li> The feel is a little tacky even when dry, but it does completely cover the glistening grey roots.</li>
            <li> Whether I had my hair pulled back or left down...</li>
            <li> It does not provide the coverage needed for my part which usually shows new growth.</li>
            <li> ; Beats looking at the grey around my temples and part while I wait for my hair color appt!  </li>
            <li> It also acts like a dry shampoo by giving it volume and allowing me to go days without washing my hair.</li>
            <li> Knock off of the Bumble and Bumble dry, powder spray.</li>
            <li> my hair was dry</li>
            <li> for the coloring on the hair/scalp, I let the product dry for a few minutes, then use a dry paper towel (one with texture - like Brawny) and gently but firmly wipe away the stains on the skin/scalp/temples.</li>
            <li> Too dark for a natural dark brown girl.</li>
            <li> Matches my hair perfectly (dark brown/ black natural color).</li>
            <li> This is dark enough for my hair and covers my gray.  </li>
            <li> Recently, my hair&#x27;s been growing faster than usual so my roots (which are now grey in places) are showing up sooner than my next appoinment.  </li>
            <li> only thing i did notice was that when i ran my fingers through my hair or touched my scalp, i did have (dark brown/black) color transfer on to my fingers.</li>
            <li> It sprays on with a small nozzle to area you direct it.</li>
            <li> I tried it both ways (wet and dry) and dry</li>
            <li> Also, makes my hair easy to manage (like dirty hair).</li>
            <li> Not only was the spray half the price of the Rita Hazen spray</li>
            <li> However, the tiny nozzle prevents mess.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sticky to the touch immediately after spraying but only takes a few minutes to dry.  </li>
            <li> so I only use a little each time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So just went to purchase more Rita Hazan root concealer when I came across an Amazon Prime new product called Stye Edit for Black / Dark Brown and figured it was crap like the others but with the price and</li>
            <li> The only problem I&#x27;ve had lately is that I have dyed my hair a dark brown with red tones and this color doesn&#x27;t match as well as when I just dyed it dark brown with no red.</li>
            <li> It allows me to extend the time between my professional hair coloring appointments by at least a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> so not much was found out about it.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s some coverage, but not much at all.</li>
            <li> careful you can&#x27;t get the stuff out of your hair an its sticky</li>
            <li> All day long I kept finding it on my hands, got some on my clothes when I changed... not worth it if you ask me.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of the spray you get on halloween to dye your hair pink.  </li>
            <li> Have to be careful not to over do it or get in your skin.</li>
            <li> This product does dry so you can&#x27;t touch you hair without getting brown/black marker on your hands!!</li>
            <li> use after I completely dry my hair, as I noticed when hair is slightly damp</li>
            <li> and then just give a little spray to my part where grey grow out is.</li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Would have preferred something that only comes off when you wash your hair, but instead every time you touch your hair it comes off on your hand, the can is too small for the price.</li>
            <li> I went to the hairdresser the other day for a cut</li>
            <li> I like this product and the way it works, the three stars are due to the amount of uses that you can get from the 2oz can.</li>
            <li> due to the timing of receiving this spray, i used it immediately.</li>
            <li> I ordered it for my mom to help cover her bald spots due to her thinning hair.</li>
            <li> so I usually do sing process which cost about the same .&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can actually have a little flexibility in the time between appointments since this will do a little touch up for me.</li>
            <li> You only need to apply a small amount for it to do the job.</li>
            <li> I like the powder (HairWow), but it takes too long to apply and can get messy.  </li>
            <li> The color is brown and does not really cover the gray roots of my black</li>
            <li> Let it dry for a few minutes before you touch.</li>
            <li> I only uses it for my bangs and the little hairs next to my ears, yet it hardly lasts a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I figured that it may be too dark for me.</li>
            <li> Works well for coverage in narrow spots because of the narrow long spray nozzle.</li>
            <li> It covers your greys without looking sticky or fake and everyone I showed was very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i have dark brown hair</li>
            <li> (l&#x27;oreal preference in dark brown #4).</li>
            <li> It is dark but works with my medium brown hair.</li>
            <li> My hair grows fast and I have to get my hair colored every four weeks, which isn&#x27;t always convenient and is expensive.</li>
            <li> My hair color is dyed a dark brown</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair</li>
            <li> Coloring at a salon can be so expensive and this saves me so much money.  </li>
            <li> It was too dark for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have really dark hair and this spray covered the gray.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that the black/dark brown colour would not blend that well into my dark brown hair</li>
            <li> Does dry a little stiff but it stays on until washed out.</li>
            <li> starting to make me lazy with coloring, but does the job!</li>
            <li> I have dark brown not quite black.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is it&#x27;s a very small can...</li>
            <li> product itself works well and does not leave your hair feeling heavy, sticky or greasy like some other products (mascara or lipstick type root concealers).  </li>
            <li> if you scratch your head, it leaves black color under your nails.</li>
            <li> It takes me less than five minutes, tops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes me less than five minutes, tops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, my mom slightly prefers the powder.</li>
            <li> I have black hair, it does cover the grays well.</li>
            <li> The color is closer to a brown than to a black.</li>
            <li> you might as well spray black spray paint on your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it spreads on the scalp and leaves black mark on scalp</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work well on my edges, leaves a think looking mess.</li>
            <li> I just wish they, once applied would be so powdery/get on your fingers if you mess with your hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little oily feeling and does get on the fingers slightly</li>
            <li> The spray is less messy.</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts me about two dye cycles, so thats about 25  applications, that being only because I&#x27;m really graying  :(  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that the spray takes a little pressure to get the product out which makes me nervous about swishing it around and getting it on my clothes.  </li>
            <li> got in between colors to stretch them a little.</li>
            <li> I sprayed a little on my bangs to blend in.</li>
            <li> I have a thyroid problem and my hair is thinning a little bit</li>
            <li> It takes a lot to do al little.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little tacky to the touch</li>
            <li> a little heavy</li>
            <li> waited about 10-15 minutes before heading out, it was raining heavily</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried hair \\&quot;mascaras\\&quot;, hair touch up pens, color rinses, hiding my temples with messy hair styles, etc.</li>
            <li> wasted money on this item.</li>
            <li> If you constantly work your fingers through your hair, you might be annoyed that the color will show on your fingers, but I don&#x27;t mind this and just force myself not to run my fingers through my hair.  </li>
            <li> I use this to help get me by in between hair coloring sessions which can be harsh on your hair.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> This product concealed my grey between my trips to the salon without looking dry, sticky or fake.</li>
            <li> The price was almost half of what my salon was charging!</li>
            <li> and I have used at least 6 other products.</li>
            <li> I used to use a similar product but decided to try this because it was less expensive.  </li>
            <li> Pretty bad coverage .</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a learning curve, as some other reviewers have stated, when pressing down on the nozzle - sometimes you get a more-than-intended blast of color from its thin nozzle,  and yes, it does go on your scalp and skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only reason I give this 4 stars and not 5 as I do find the price point to be a little expensive for the amount of product you get.  </li>
            <li> received this yesterday on a damp, raw, rainy day, just before i was heading to the gym.</li>
            <li> Sprayer a little hard to get used to.</li>
            <li> and I have tried quite a few!</li>
            <li> I usually change into my work clothes after styling my hair and I haven&#x27;t had any issues</li>
            <li> Not sure how it stands up to sweat/humidity</li>
            <li> sweated as usual.</li>
            <li> You have to hold the can a few inches away to get the benefits of the coloring agent being distributed by the butane (don&#x27;t smoke around this item!).</li>
            <li> harsh smell either!</li>
            <li> It has held me over when I&#x27;ve been late on my dye job (hiding alot of grays these days).</li>
            <li> I like the control you have when you spray the product, but it is ice cold just for a second or two.  </li>
            <li> I start with the roots at my side part, and while still spraying, I move slowly to the hairline at my temples and widow&#x27;s peak.  </li>
            <li> After it dries my hair feel a bit thick where I sprayed</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful; it sprays out way too quickly leaving behind a black scalp.  </li>
            <li> I mean way</li>
            <li> I noticed for a very small area, it took a lot of spraying.  </li>
            <li> Not a good look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - unfortunately I found they are messy and a pain to manage.</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> How dumb was I a spray ,of course it got all over everything.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for it to stay in longer than 12 hours then dream on, i&#x27;m not impressed at all with it.</li>
            <li> a little&lt;br /&gt;Can be difficult to wash out&lt;br</li>
            <li> Silly</li>
            <li> Too expensive for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> Shipping and handling was a bit expensive, though...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s terrible even though it looks like the same container don&#x27;t be fooled...</li>
            <li> It was a scary experience to try it</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon Bumble &amp; Bumble brown hair powder to cover my roots but hated the matte, dull look</li>
            <li> Wrong!</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t look so bad.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too bad</li>
            <li> I was using it for two weeks and didn&#x27;t even realize my roots had gotten that bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> coloring every 2 - 3 weeks is annoying</li>
            <li> &gt; I no longer have to worry about the blasted, nasty, skunk line in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> Very bad for your hair and stains it.  </li>
            <li> I was very, very disappointed when the product arrived.  </li>
            <li> Hate it!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this more than the colormark product.</li>
            <li> It was ok and did the job, but I like gray away much better, plus it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
            <li> if you are looking for something to cover your grays and allow you more time between colorings, this does the trick. It matches my color perfectly. The only drawback it learning how to aim. A little clean up is usually needed after application, especially in the ears as I have short hair.</li>
            <li> Fantastic price thwt cant be beat! Wonderful product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Great for in between dye jobs!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something to cover my blonde roots between hair appointments. My roots are so light it looks like I&#x27;m going bald with my gorgeous dark brown colour. Not a good look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t want to spend a heap of $$$ and this one seemed ok. Guess it&#x27;s kinda a new product so not much was found out about it. I&#x27;ve used it twice so far and so far so good. It covers up the bits I spray and it doesn&#x27;t look so bad. I feel like I&#x27;m spray painting my head which is kind a fun. I just spray on the bits I can see.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with how the product works.  I don&#x27;t like that the spray takes a little pressure to get the product out which makes me nervous about swishing it around and getting it on my clothes.  However, the tiny nozzle prevents mess.  Like it very much!  And it comes pretty full surprisingly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit disappointed with this product. My friend who is blond recommended this and said it really worked for her. I was really excited about trying this however they didn&#x27;t have one specifically for dark brown hair rather one for dark brown/black. I figured that it may be too dark for me. Wrong! Instead it barely covers the gray.  I have to spray so, so much on it for it to turn a grayish brown. It&#x27;s not as if I have a ton of gray to cover just stray grays at the roots.  There&#x27;s some coverage, but not much at all.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased  with this product.  Having read the reviews of a more expensive root concealer,  I was prepared  for something  more difficult to use. Styler Edit&#x27;s spray was easy to direct and did not make my hair sticky or stiff. I am recommending it to friends.</li>
            <li> Pretty bad coverage .</li>
            <li> it&#x27; covers the grey good , but just touch the hair and it color comes off on your hand, or what ever it touches.</li>
            <li> Whenever my wife uses this she feels itching in the scalp. Will not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> It works but you will feel thickness on the hair</li>
            <li> IT DOES THE JOB UNTIL I GET MY HAIR DYED AT SALON</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product.  Works well until you can get to a salon</li>
            <li> great product.  great coverage and i have tried many different grey concealers&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> This spray comes off on everything that touches it. Would have preferred something that only comes off when you wash your hair, but instead every time you touch your hair it comes off on your hand, the can is too small for the price.</li>
            <li> Very good product. My wife loves it...</li>
            <li> This product does dry so you can&#x27;t touch you hair without getting brown/black marker on your hands!!</li>
            <li> better price than 1.5 oz</li>
            <li> I 100% approve this product. I love wearing my hair up in a bun, but last year my edges thin out due to having tight braids, so after a lot of research on line and YouTube I found this product on Amazon.com. I was skeptic at first but I ordered it, tried it, and now I love it. This doesn&#x27;t break my hair or keep my hair from growing, I can still condition my edges for regrowth and now wear my bun. I love it!!</li>
            <li> I wish it would stay put instead of easily rubbing off of my hair. Perhaps water proof it until shampooing.  I&#x27;d like it to stay on a lot longer before washing. I noticed for a very small area, it took a lot of spraying.  As for pros. I like the color, the spray had fibers that looked like hair, that looked natural on my head.</li>
            <li> It works great covering the gray on my part til the last week before my appointment to retouch my color.</li>
            <li> Am enjoying using this product.  Works well for coverage in narrow spots because of the narrow long spray nozzle. Gives an accurate delivery of color.  I bought the blk/dark brown and it blends well with my hair even though I&#x27;m multi-dimensional brown w/golden highlights.</li>
            <li> Nothing compares to this product in my opinion. I love it!!! It covers my grey roots very well. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is it&#x27;s a very small can...the price is good too. ...And yes I would recommend this to a friend :)</li>
            <li> This is dark enough for my hair and covers my gray.  However, it comes off easily even several hours after I put in on. It is definitely a very temporary solution.</li>
            <li> I like this product for in between colorings. S[rays on well, evenly, and lasts for a couple of days. Really, lasts until the next shampoo. Will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommend this to me.  It is a perfect way to conceal greys in between me seeing her.  It also acts like a dry shampoo by giving it volume and allowing me to go days without washing my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Perfect natural cover up on my dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of root covers and this is by far the best. Easy to apply, covers gray and color blends well.  Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Perfect product for thinning hair and in between dyeing. Doesn&#x27;t rub off. Nice spray tip for precise application.</li>
            <li> This works really well. I don&#x27;t have a lot of grey but it&#x27;s perfect for covering up several wild hairs between hair colorings. I only use it on top so I can&#x27;t say how easy it would be to use on the sides.</li>
            <li> Looks natural and i like it</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! Does dry a little stiff but it stays on until washed out.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have used so far to help cover my gray hair and I have tried quite a few! The latest was thing I had tried was the powder applied with a brush - unfortunately I found they are messy and a pain to manage. Inevitably, I would get the powder on my hands when applying and if I put my glasses up on my head - well, it would rub off and end up on my nose when I put my glasses back on. Just a real pain. Then one morning when I was running late and needed to quickly camoflage gray that was showing through the part in my hair, I grabbed the can and started spraying. I do not know why I suddenly decided to try this but I am soooooo glad I did. This covers gray effectively. With a little practice, it is easy to use with quick short sprays. The narrow nozzle makes it easy to control exactly where you want the spray to cover and it does not leave your hair looking dull and matted. And what a time savings! Seriously - I really love this product!</li>
            <li> Did not work very well.</li>
            <li> I find it perfect for quick touch ups when I have no time to color my hair.  It has a very natural look and it is quick and easy.  I liked it so much I have also given it as gifts.</li>
            <li> This product concealed my grey between my trips to the salon without looking dry, sticky or fake. Great product!! I will buy it again!</li>
            <li> Knock off of the Bumble and Bumble dry, powder spray. Essentially the same&lt;br /&gt;stuff, but it doesn&#x27;t deliver the same volume that B&amp;B does. But it covers well,&lt;br /&gt;and washes out easily. No damage to hair and the size of the bottle is smaller&lt;br /&gt;than the B&amp;B, making it easier to work with. Will re-order again and again!</li>
            <li> Covers well between appointments, and easy to use but it does come off on my fingers when I scratch my head.</li>
            <li> Works great to cover u grays between salon color visits.</li>
            <li> Works well......just don&#x27;t touch for a while after spraying because it will get on your fingers</li>
            <li> Price is lower than purchased at salon.  Product works well, does not flake off but does wash out when washed.</li>
            <li> My natural color is a beautiful silver, however, I am not ready to go there yet.  I color my hair a chocolate brown, it looks great and I get tons on compliments on it.  With the roots being so silver I found I was coloring my hair every 3 weeks and my hair was starting to break and look damaged.  Style Edit has beautifully allowed me to go longer between touch ups, the color looks so natural and I have healthy shiny hair again.  I went to the hairdresser the other day for a cut and she immediately commented on how nice the color looked and was amazed when she washed my hair as to how silver I actually was.  Not only does Style Edit do an amazing job of covering the outgrowth, it also eliminates any &#x27;hot roots&#x27; or discolored roots between color touch ups.  I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Wish it came in a larger size!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a brunette and have regular salon colorings every 6 weeks.  Recently, my hair&#x27;s been growing faster than usual so my roots (which are now grey in places) are showing up sooner than my next appoinment.  A friend had been using this and I couldn&#x27;t even tell she had it in her hair so I was super impressed. She gave me a can for my birthday which went to use a couple weeks later and I LOVED it!!  It covers your greys without looking sticky or fake and everyone I showed was very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only trick is learning how to apply it.  The can is only about 5 or 6 inches tall, but it&#x27;s jam-packed with aerosol so it packs quite a punch.... which means you need to start with an area that is not directly next to your face or you&#x27;ll end up with what appears to be a blast of spray paint.  But the good news is that it wipes off easily with a wet wash cloth or tissue (trust me - I did this when I first got it).  I start with the roots at my side part, and while still spraying, I move slowly to the hairline at my temples and widow&#x27;s peak.  After the first spray or two you&#x27;ll get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let it dry completely before touching it.  I apply mine after I&#x27;m done styling my hair and then blast the sprayed areas with a hair dryer to speed up the drying process.  It really doesn&#x27;t take that long to dry, but if you&#x27;re impatient or in a hurry like I usually am, the hair dryer method works great.  I usually change into my work clothes after styling my hair and I haven&#x27;t had any issues w/ this coming off on my clothes.  I also haven&#x27;t had any issues of it rubbing off on my white pillow cases at night so I was pretty impressed.  Not sure how it stands up to sweat/humidity so you might want to test it before going out to make sure there isn&#x27;t any color runoff (if you&#x27;re using one of the brown shades).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is a GREAT product and I would definitely recommend it for hiding the greys between colorings.  I already bought cans for my friends and they were thrilled.  :)they were thrilled.  :)</li>
            <li> Use it all the time - so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Extends the need for colorings, and much cheaper than the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; one from Sephora!</li>
            <li> thickens hair and is great for thinning hair.. Try it !</li>
            <li> if you scratch your head, it leaves black color under your nails.</li>
            <li> Next best thing to cover grey in between and keeping your hair healthy and looking its best. I will buy again</li>
            <li> Great product to keep around for in between coloring. Great size for travel but yet you can get many uses, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This product provides great cover.  I am 30 and am just starting to get grey hair.  I don&#x27;t want to dye my entire head yet so I just spray this right around my temples and part where the grey shows.  It stays on very well even when I work out.  No dripping or smearing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing!!!! It really covers the gray. I don&#x27;t want to color my hair yet and this was the perfect temporary solution! Love it!</li>
            <li> I like this product and the way it works, the three stars are due to the amount of uses that you can get from the 2oz can. Don&#x27;t know if I would buy again</li>
            <li> in between the color works to fill the roots where needed would purchase again</li>
            <li> Covers my greys with just a spray! The feel is a little tacky even when dry, but it does completely cover the glistening grey roots. Great for between colorings for those of us with dark hair and a high concentration of grey!! No longer does it look like I have a bald spot when the roots start showing their true color.</li>
            <li> received this yesterday on a damp, raw, rainy day, just before i was heading to the gym. perfect timing, too because my gray roots needed a touch-up. i&#x27;ve tried numerous other products with varying success - most worked well in terms of coverage but were either sticky, waxy or didn&#x27;t wear well. i have dark brown hair and i color at home with box color (l&#x27;oreal preference in dark brown #4). husband, kids, mortgage, cars, schools etc..doesn&#x27;t afford me the budget to color professionally at my hair stylists - i&#x27;m lucky i can budget time/money to get cut/styled every 3 months! my grays are stubborn and sometimes it&#x27;s not the root that comes in gray but further up on the hair shaft itself (odd, i know, but true). coloring every 2 - 3 weeks is annoying so i&#x27;ve been looking for a better alternative for a while. due to the timing of receiving this spray, i used it immediately. my hair was dry and i found it very easy to apply. a little on the too dark side (i&#x27;d probably have to play around with creating a custom hybrid blend between the light brown and this color) but the coverage was fantastic and it didn&#x27;t leave any brittle or sticky or waxing or dulling residue on my hair. waited about 10-15 minutes before heading out, it was raining heavily and i had an umbrella but hair got slightly wet during opening/closing of umbrella when outside. walked to gym. 30 mins cardio and then 30 min circuit training. sweated as usual. no running/dripping or problems. yay! only thing i did notice was that when i ran my fingers through my hair or touched my scalp, i did have (dark brown/black) color transfer on to my fingers. and this was before and after the gym visit. slept with it on - no transfer on pillow case, thankfully - but still transferring to my fingers when touched. not sure if i held the spray nozzle too close to my hair or if i should&#x27;ve brushed it through more after waiting the 10-15 mins after application or if there&#x27;s another reason it didn&#x27;t fully set but i plan on working that out because i&#x27;m very pleased with the way it covers my gray.g that out because i&#x27;m very pleased with the way it covers my gray.</li>
            <li> I think this product works well. But, if you are  using oils in your hair I don&#x27;t if it will work. I didn&#x27;t use oil on my hair and I applied it on my hair and it works great!</li>
            <li> Messy.this spray comes off easily after it dries without even washing it! I can see it on my hands after running my fingers through my hair, on the ears, and even comes off after sleeping with it in. The good news is that it does cover most of the grey after spraying. I know this because I have alot of grey hair on the sides. If you want a quick fix for an evening out then its for you. If you&#x27;re looking for it to stay in longer than 12 hours then dream on, i&#x27;m not impressed at all with it.</li>
            <li> Fast and easy way to cover grey roots, this product leaves hair soft and shinny and very natural looking.  I recommend it to anyone who has trouble keeping grey roots  looking good between color as I do.</li>
            <li> This is ok.  It doesn&#x27;t work well on my edges, leaves a think looking mess. It does cover the grey hair well on the crown of my head.</li>
            <li> Works great! This product is double the money at the hair salon.</li>
            <li> I only have one strip of hair that grows in grey and this product is great for covering it up without having to do a full dye job. It&#x27;s coverage is pretty good, but not 100 percent, it is enough to conceal the grey and keep it from being obvious.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It does come off on your hands a little&lt;br /&gt;Can be difficult to wash out&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Hides grey&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a long time, I can easily get two days of use.&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper than other similar products</li>
            <li> I am lucky with only little Gray in front. This product works great to cover after washing and drying hair.  I may never color with chemicals!  Makes me look like a natural!</li>
            <li> Much better than competitors. Easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t rub off as easily.</li>
            <li> It leaves a silvery metallic shine to your hair which I don&#x27;t like and I noticed a couple people looking at my head in confusion.</li>
            <li> It does the job and really covers between coloring, but it does come off easily on your pillow and even hand if you rub it.  Also beware when you are applying not to spill or spray on your clothes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of dollars and many years looking for a no-fuss, effective solution to temporarily covering up the silver hairs around my temples. I have black hair, so the \\&quot;grays\\&quot; that grow out are not gray, not white but  appear silver, which is pretty evident and very stubborn and difficult to color. I&#x27;ve tried hair \\&quot;mascaras\\&quot;, hair touch up pens, color rinses, hiding my temples with messy hair styles, etc. I&#x27;ve even perfected a technique using carbon black eyeshadow and eye shadow primer to cover up the grays but it was time consuming, and I would have to get up extra early in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Style Edit is one of the most amazing products that meets all my criteria: 1) relatively cheap, 2) odorless, 3) effective, 4) long lasting, 5) FAST.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a learning curve, as some other reviewers have stated, when pressing down on the nozzle - sometimes you get a more-than-intended blast of color from its thin nozzle,  and yes, it does go on your scalp and skin but you can wipe it off. It just takes some practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Here&#x27;s what I do: I hold the can with my right hand, pull my hairs gently to get them away the side of my head with my left hand, and while holding the hairs  perpendicular from my temples/scalp, spray gently. You have to hold the can a few inches away to get the benefits of the coloring agent being distributed by the butane (don&#x27;t smoke around this item!). If you hold the can too close to your hairline, you won&#x27;t get the nice coating of color: think of this product as you would a mini airbrush, you need some distance for even distribution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the coloring on the hair/scalp, I let the product dry for a few minutes, then use a dry paper towel (one with texture - like Brawny) and gently but firmly wipe away the stains on the skin/scalp/temples. I try to rub in one direction only, and not too vigorously so I don&#x27;t obliterate the color and it works like a charm! Don&#x27;t use toilet paper or it may flake off on your hair. Qtips take too long but are effective on front of hair line or top of scalp, but be prepared to use a lot.  It takes me less than five minutes, tops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve asked several co-workers if they can tell if I&#x27;ve colored or sprayed my hair with color and no one could tell, even in good lighting. The color lasts all day and does not run or rub off, even in a humid environment. I wish I knew about this product years ago, I could have saved a lot of time and money!!r hair.

            <li> This is easy to use and gives great results.  It easily covered my great roots beautifully!  I will absolutely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Great product! I ordered it for my mom to help cover her bald spots due to her thinning hair. We already use the powder, but I wanted to try a spray which I thought could easily target the areas we wanted to cover.  I find it easier to use than the powder, which is also good &amp; effective. The spray is less messy. No cleanup. However, my mom slightly prefers the powder. I think she&#x27;s just used to using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a great product---effective, easy, no mess. Great buy. Best wishes!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! covers what I need it to until I can get to my hair stylist!!</li>
            <li> This is probably the best product I have tried for covering grey&#x27;s in between coloring, its works better than I ever expected.</li>
            <li> How dumb was I a spray ,of course it got all over everything. Please don&#x27;t sweat it melts need I say more. wasted money on this item.</li>
            <li> Great product and does what it says but cmon really, $14 for a teeny weeny can that lasts about 2 weeks? That stuff is just colored hairspray, it shouldn&#x27;t cost so much. Id rather dye my roots with cheap box stuff every 2 weeks for $3!</li>
            <li> Love it, thank you!!!</li>
            <li> It came earlier than expected.  Everything was great!</li>
            <li> careful you can&#x27;t get the stuff out of your hair an its sticky</li>
            <li> This Conceal Spray is wonderful and puts your mind at ease. The best thing is the fine nozzle which allows you to point it at exactly where you need the coverage. I have tried many others and this is the best color and the longest lasting....mine doesn&#x27;t even completely come out after shampooing so I only use a little each time.</li>
            <li> Well, My hair grows fast...I mean way TOO fast.&lt;br /&gt;Root touch up costs me $65-80 ...so I usually do sing process which cost about the same .&lt;br /&gt;So it gets tricky to stay over 4 weeks between even I occasionally do at home coloring myself.&lt;br /&gt;Then I saw all this great reviews on Amazon.com (thank you all by the way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product. Although I tend to use more than supposed to do (probably) to be safe side, it always hides grays to the perfection!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use after I completely dry my hair, as I noticed when hair is slightly damp it can easily comes out (like when you touch you hair with hands and clothes..) .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not cheap in terms of price/gram, but I think it&#x27;s worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try before and after photos in a week :)</li>
            <li> Great product! Works better than expected</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Stylist gave it to me got in between colors to stretch them a little. Use in parts and hair line edges. Direct pin needle sprayer is great</li>
            <li> This works so well.  It&#x27;s so much better than using those hair mascara that makes your hair hard like a bird&#x27;s nest. This sprays on nicely and keeps your hair feeling soft and natural.  Great coverage.  I have been using for almost a year in between my dyes.</li>
            <li> This works well for price range.  As with most products, you get what you pay for and if you want better concealment and longer lasting, you must go to higher priced products.  So, with those thoughts, I still recommend it because it does what it claims and the buyer should not expect miracles.</li>
            <li> Works very well---I have re-ordered it several times. It conceals the spots where my hair has not filled in completely after chemo. However, it does rub off in pillow case if you don&#x27;t cover your head.</li>
            <li> Great product for a quick &amp; easy fix to cover that unsightly grey hair. I would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> On days that I have last minute plans I can spray this on the light areas and I&#x27;m out the door.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but I find Gray Away covers better and easier.  There is no point for me to switch. Back to what works.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product!  I needed to color my roots every two weeks and now I can go for about 3 or 4 weeks.  It is perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li> Great cover up in between the coloring!! It works great, now I can space my visits to a beauty salon for another week or even longer!! It doesn&#x27;t run, very simple to use, love it!</li>
            <li> Rubs off I had my arm resting on my head looked at my arm and it was covered with product  I hadn&#x27;t even used much it&#x27;s too bad cause it&#x27;s easy to apply covers nicely but runs down your face when it&#x27;s horn</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product twice before and I am getting ready to order another one. I really like this conceal spray. It has held me over when I&#x27;ve been late on my dye job (hiding alot of grays these days). I can go over about 2 weeks using this. It lasts all day on me. I have curly hair so I don&#x27;t run my hands through my hair alot or run a brush through it after I style it in the morning, to avoid frizzies. Someone who has straight hair and runs a combs or brush through it through out the day might have an issue with it coming off, but I wouldn&#x27;t know.  You really have to move your hand swiftly while spraying to avoid a dark spot of paint in one place. You have to move quickly. I cover my forehead with the other hand and sometimes I will get a little paint on my finger and nails but it washes out easily.  At first if looks darker than the rest of my hair but after a few minutes it dries and blends in with my color. The only problem I&#x27;ve had lately is that I have dyed my hair a dark brown with red tones and this color doesn&#x27;t match as well as when I just dyed it dark brown with no red. But I have no other option as far as color goes.  I have used it on damp hair with no problem.  The bottle lasts me about two dye cycles, so thats about 25  applications, that being only because I&#x27;m really graying  :(  and I am covering more areas of my head. Of course this varies greatly on how much growth you are trying to cover.</li>
            <li> Best product great delivery</li>
            <li> gets me from hair appointment to hair appointment. I can actually have a little flexibility in the time between appointments since this will do a little touch up for me.</li>
            <li> The best gray cover up out there.  Washes out and is perfect between colorings for root touch up.</li>
            <li> I have used many root touch up products but this one is superior to them all!  I would definitely recommend it .</li>
            <li> A little pricy but worth it.  Buys time before my next coloring.  Applied in short bursts close to scalp.  FYI the aerosol is butane.</li>
            <li> Works great for the in between salon visits! Makes for a good hold until my next visitüòÑ</li>
            <li> This spray is great.  I used to buy the Rita Hazen spray but found that none were available on &amp;#34;prime&amp;#34; and I needed some spray right away.  I took a chance on this product and was happy with the results.  Not only was the spray half the price of the Rita Hazen spray but it also has a nice smell.  I would recommend this product to anyone who needs to cover up those &amp;#34;part-lines&amp;#34; between colors.  It does the job!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!&lt;br /&gt;I style my hair and then just give a little spray to my part where grey grow out is. Perfect for in between colors.</li>
            <li> Love this spray! It saves me in between coloring!</li>
            <li> Great stuff for stretching out hair color appointments!  Also, makes my hair easy to manage (like dirty hair).</li>
            <li> A few months ago I got an hombre color style applied to my hair that had my natural dark brown color at the top and lighter color at the bottom mainly because I wanted to avoid constant chemical treatments and also I really didn&#x27;t want to have to constantly return to the salon for touch ups.  Silly me didn&#x27;t think about those little gray hairs that pepper my natural color at the top.  In walks this stuff.  I love it!  It works very well at hiding those stray gray hairs.  I also think it smells good! If you constantly work your fingers through your hair, you might be annoyed that the color will show on your fingers, but I don&#x27;t mind this and just force myself not to run my fingers through my hair.  I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if the color didn&#x27;t show up on my fingers though.</li>
            <li> Works well, but didn&#x27;t last long. Too expensive for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> I like the control you have when you spray the product, but it is ice cold just for a second or two.  Holds well better than most hair color sprays, but does have build up I only like to use it in a pinch when I know I will be washing it out the next day.</li>
            <li> It is dark but works with my medium brown hair. I sprayed a little on my bangs to blend in. It works great and is very easy to use. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Recieved order in a timely manner and well packaged.  Product is excellent, it does what it advertises and I love it.  I do plan on buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> This spray was easy to use and covered my gray nicely! I would purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;No harsh smell either!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product. I was afraid it would be more like that old &amp;#34;spray-on hair&amp;#34;. But true to its description, it is easy to apply, isn&#x27;t messy at all, and it stays on - even when you sweat (I definitely put this aspect to the test). And a little goes a long way. My hair grows fast and I have to get my hair colored every four weeks, which isn&#x27;t always convenient and is expensive. This product allowed me to prolong the coloring a full week. Whether I had my hair pulled back or left down... whether I left it curly or straightened it. I will surely be repurchasing, and in larger quantities.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few of the root concealer sprays and this one is hands down the best especially for the price!</li>
            <li> I loved it.  Very easy to use and great coverage.  Really extends time between salon appointments.  Would recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> Great product is easy to use and not messy. Adds extra weeks between touch-ups.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t write many reviews but i have to say this works great on my hair. i use it mostly on my side part and it really covers the gray until my next coloring. I&#x27;ve used the one that is kind of like a lipstick and it was ok for me but hard to apply and messy. I love how you spray this one on dry hair b/c you can be sure to get the spots that need covering. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> It blends nicely and looks great when you spray it on.... but it doesn&#x27;t stay on.  All day long I kept finding it on my hands, got some on my clothes when I changed... not worth it if you ask me.</li>
            <li> My mother in law says Excellent!, easy to use, good coverage.</li>
            <li> A nice product to use for those in-between appt&#x27;s at the hair salon.  Covers gray and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> works great love the small direct spray nozzle to spray just where you need it.</li>
            <li> This product really works well for me!  My hair color is dyed a dark brown so I bought the Black/Dark Brown.  My roots begin to show around the second week after coloring and being that I have some grays I&#x27;ve been looking for something to cover the roots till my next root coloring which I do every 4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray shoots out fairly strong so I simply spray in quick bursts along my part and sides of my face, so about a 10-15&amp;#34; area in total each time.  It&#x27;s sticky to the touch immediately after spraying but only takes a few minutes to dry.  If I scratch or rub my head the color does come off but it&#x27;s easily washed off.  After it dries my hair feel a bit thick where I sprayed but you cannot tell that I have anything on my hair at all!  I&#x27;ve used mine about five times so far with no issues. Nothing on my pillow or clothing.  It washes out easily and leaves no residue.  If you prefer a concealer that doesn&#x27;t wash off easily, look elsewhere.  Overall I love this product and will continue to purchase as long as necessary!</li>
            <li> Good, but v. expensive.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done!&lt;br /&gt;Thank goodness for this product!&lt;br /&gt; I no longer have to worry about the blasted, nasty, skunk line in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Only comment, is that it can make your head feel like there&#x27;s a bit of dirt in it.&lt;br /&gt;However it is what it is, literally spray painting roots.</li>
            <li> Pros:  As others have noted, it has a tiny nozzle giving you good control for spraying.  Probably great if you have brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  The color is brown and does not really cover the gray roots of my black hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use it since I have it. It&#x27;s better than nothing for in-between hair coloring because it does obscure my roots somewhat, but I have to find something that is black and not brown.</li>
            <li> I used to use a similar product but decided to try this because it was less expensive.  I was pleased with the quality of the product and will likely re-purchase.  Product arrived on-time and in good condition.</li>
            <li> Best product on the market that I have found for covering up grey in between salon visits!</li>
            <li> I really like this product, I use to use a different gray concealer and this product by far is so much better. It has a light feel on your hair,not heavy. I recommend this product Style edit to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great fir covering gray in between colors!</li>
            <li> This product is as good as Gray Away...no difference I could detect. However, it appears Gray Away is now available in drugstore chains...don&#x27;t know about this brand.</li>
            <li> It does not provide the coverage needed for my part which usually shows new growth. For some reasons, the color is very light, I have dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> My new favorite! This does the job quite nicely! I&#x27;ve tried others and I&#x27;m really pleased with the fact that this does not have a bad smell, it doesn&#x27;t feel stiff and gives the hair a nice luster. I have a thyroid problem and my hair is thinning a little bit so this makes my hair look full and pretty. The applicator is terrific because it allows easy &amp; precise application. The price is right! It&#x27;s a little oily feeling and does get on the fingers slightly but I can overlook that because let&#x27;s face it nothing is going to be 100% besides actual processed hair color. This saves me from getting my hair colored every two to three weeks which is what I would have to do &amp; at $100.00 a visit for a cut and color this saves me money - Thanks!</li>
            <li> I first found this at my hair salon when I was complaining about my gray roots always showing through.  I began using it and it works great and I can extend cut/color sessions by using it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use! Excellent covering of gray roots and also helps scalp coverage.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely use again... Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> Too dark for a natural dark brown girl. More for black hair. Stayed on but leaves a very sticky film that stays on through rain but rubs off on hats be careful not to spay too much. Received quick!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Fills in some thinning areas.  Wished it came in larger bottle</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get enough!  Perfectly hides the grays without anyone noticing.  Good price for an awesome item. I am out already...starting to make me lazy with coloring, but does the job!</li>
            <li> This is just what I needed for the week before I get my roots done. You can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s not my real hair color. :)</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It does wonders to cover the grey</li>
            <li> Best and easiest to use grey root cover-up ever!!</li>
            <li> Works well to hide gray in between coloring my hair.  Like that you can really target where you want the color to land.  Another big plus is that this thickens my hair on the top of my head, as well!  Will be buying again!</li>
            <li> I really liked the coverage the product gave. It covered my grays and also maintained a natural look. I would recommend this product for anyone looking for gray coverage between color visits!</li>
            <li> This is my beauty secret that is so easy to fix the grays between colorings.  Can&#x27;t be without it now.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  It is easy to use and covers white hair really well!  Will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! Already purchased a second can. Great for a quick root touch up between colors. Easy to apply and lasts all day! Definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful; it sprays out way too quickly leaving behind a black scalp.  Had I continued spraying my hair, I would have looked like a spotted leopard.  The crayons I ordered worked great compared to this garbage.</li>
            <li> this is a wonderful product , esp for those women with thinning hair, and the price was great</li>
            <li> This spray is awesome!  It&#x27;s very easy to use and covers your gray (or white) very well. I use this to help get me by in between hair coloring sessions which can be harsh on your hair.  Also, this product have very little fragrance which is nice and won&#x27;t smell like cologne or interfere with the cologne you wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I give this 4 stars and not 5 as I do find the price point to be a little expensive for the amount of product you get.  I wish they sold a larger can at a better price point.</li>
            <li> Great product for touch up...goes on easy, does not rub off.  Matches hair color and does not run if you use hair spray.</li>
            <li> I already recommended it to my sister in Omaha.  I like the spray.  It sometimes comes out a little heavy so am trying to learn to manage the spray output.  If I had a suggestion it would be that the spray is a little more fine but sufficient to cover the gray hair roots.</li>
            <li> Style Edit is fabulous! In 2008 I developed an allergy to the main ingredient in hair color. I have not been able to color my hair for the past 5 years. My dermatologist recently told my about Style Edit. I have been using it to color, not just my roots, but for overall hair color. It looks totally natural and covers gray beautifully. I am so excited to have discovered a solution to my hair color problem.</li>
            <li> Have only used this once, but immediately bought a pack of three because it works so well and I don&#x27;t want to be without. Looks very natural, and doesn&#x27;t come off on the pillowcase or your hands when you scratch your head. Very, very happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Few weeks later update:&lt;br /&gt;Still totally pleased. Color stays on until you wash it out. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> Worked really well. Much cheaper than the brand I have used in the past and just as effective.</li>
            <li> Works ok...thickens hair and adds a bit of color. It takes a lot to do al little. One can lasts only about 2 weeks, if you&#x27;re lucky.</li>
            <li> I like the product because it is light, sprays on easily and results are immediate.  It washes off easily and you don&#x27;t even feel it on your hair.</li>
            <li> It did the trick for me!  It covered my grey areas, specially the small section on the frontal part of my right forehead very well... I read some of the reviews before buying it and I read that for some people this product worked best with wet hair.  I tried it both ways (wet and dry) and dry worked best for me.  It seems like it absorbs better to the hair to cover more of the grey.  I have dark brown hair so the dark brown/black worked great.  After purchasing the first one and trying it, I went ahead and ordered 3 more!  It was a great price, too!  Shipping and handling was a bit expensive, though... almost the same price I paid for the 3 bottles combined!</li>
            <li> Need a lot of it to cover just a touch of gray.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of the spray you get on halloween to dye your hair pink.  Didn&#x27;t work for what I needed it for.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have to color my roots every 2 weeks because my gray hairs. This has really saved me from coloring my hair so much!!! Its going on 4 weeks now. First I style my hair how I want, then I apply the Style Edit to wear I see my gray. Let it dry for a few minutes before you touch. If it can cover my stubborn grays it can cover anybody&#x27;s! And it is not sticky at all!!! LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly. I have black hair, it does cover the grays well. The color is closer to a brown than to a black. But the fact that it covered up the gray, it&#x27;s well worth it. Be careful not to apply too much product, it will leave a somewhat sticky residue if applied liberally. You only need to apply a small amount for it to do the job. And will not leave any residue if applied correctly. The only thing that would make this product better would be if they offered it in black instead of black/dark brown.</li>
            <li> This is a quick fix. Now I don&#x27;t have to color my hair as often.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing.  Coloring at a salon can be so expensive and this saves me so much money.  I have one &amp;#34;part&amp;#34; when I style my hair so I only need to use it on that &amp;#34;part&amp;#34; to hide my grays.  I am completely 100% gray and I color my hair my natural dark brown. You can&#x27;t even tell I have sprayed the roots when I use this product!  Instead of getting my roots colored every 3 weeks, I can now go 5 - 6 weeks easily, saving much money.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It was too dark for my hair.</li>
            <li> It works, its fast an easy and its cheaper than other brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of products to cover gray, even on my clients but this one flies out the door. Everyone loves it.</li>
            <li> Very good product....thanks!</li>
            <li> Great product for covering grays!</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to use and conceals well.  I also use it to conceal some areas where my scalp shows too much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing , I&#x27;m really , really happy w the results that I see after the first time I use the pdroduct !!! üòÉ</li>
            <li> I now use this spray between my coloring appointments.  It woks great, so good that my hair dresser asked what am I using.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my first time purchase of STYLE Edit spray. It sprays on with a small nozzle to area you direct it. I have found that immediately rubbing it in the spot helps to cover all my gray pieces. It lasts until washed out. Does what it is meant to do...will always have it on hand from now on!!</li>
            <li> My hair dresser suggested using this product so I didn&#x27;t have to dye my roots so often. I LOVE IT. It gives great coverage and I can cut my dying frequency in half.</li>
            <li> Ok for a quick touch up but fades quickly</li>
            <li> Like so many others here, I have tried several waxes, powders, crayons, and powders without getting the best look for my hair.  WITH This product I found the quick forceful spray just too difficult to manage and the color was not quite right for my dark blonde highlighted hair.  Anyone who&#x27;s having application difficulty, or wants a lighter textured product, should give BUMBLE &amp; BUMBLE SPRAY ON COLORED HAIR POWDER a try.  I use the blonde which comes out very light brown.  It&#x27;s not inexpensive, but it&#x27;s excellent and really the one and only product I never want to be without!</li>
            <li> This product did not perform as well as advertised for me.  I would not wish to recommend it.</li>
            <li> Does the job well. Maybe a little sticky while drying, but dries fast and doesn&#x27;t smell too strong. Would buy again!</li>
            <li> I have really dark hair and this spray covered the gray. The sprayer has good aim- didn&#x27;t get it all over my face while I used it and washes right off of your hands. Leaves a filmy feel on the roots...but it&#x27;s the best root concealer I&#x27;ve used. Way better than the hair &amp;#34;mascara&amp;#34; Beats looking at the grey around my temples and part while I wait for my hair color appt!  If you sweat while you use it make sure you keep wiping your face because it drips.&lt;br /&gt;Will order again!</li>
            <li> works great unless it&#x27;s humid or raining and gets stiff. it&#x27;s great when you are in a pinch</li>
            <li> Service from Ozark Beauty was excellent--their order shipped nearly a week before the accompanying Amazon order.  In fact, it was received in Hawai&#x27;i before Amazon even shipped.  The product was received incomplete, a manufacturing issue as it had not been opened by Ozark.  Ozark responded immediately to my e-mail (on a Saturday!) and offered to replace the item, following up with another e-mail on Monday morning to let me know that it had been shipped.  Replacement product was received by the end of the week.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself works well and does not leave your hair feeling heavy, sticky or greasy like some other products (mascara or lipstick type root concealers).  I was concerned that the black/dark brown colour would not blend that well into my dark brown hair but it did without being obvious.  Product is easy to use once you get the hang of it.  There is a pinpoint nozzle that lets you have more control with your aim, and it is quicker to use than the other product types mentioned.  There is an instructional video on the Style Edit website.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have with it is the smell, but I am quite sensitive to chemical odours.  I found I had to cover my nose and mouth when applying or the smell and taste of the butane propellant would stay with me all day.  Best used in a larger room, or even outside if you can manage it.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend the product and supplier!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little tacky to the touch but it works very well.</li>
            <li> Works very well on the wife&#x27;s roots....lol. She just isn&#x27;t as lucky as I was in that department. Beauty supply stores are out of control on pricing for this product. I guess they like starving and waiting for that pay anything cust.</li>
            <li> This product works well.. was delivered on time and I&#x27;m very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;I just wish it was bigger (more bang for the buck)</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work as the Seller describe.&lt;br /&gt;I made several attempt after letting it dry between coats; This product just did not take after a numerous attempts. Don&#x27;t waste your time and money</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty messy. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon Bumble &amp; Bumble brown hair powder to cover my roots but hated the matte, dull look it gave my roots plus it got all over my fingers, collar &amp; pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I discovered Rita Hazan Root Concealer which is absolutely amazing but breaks the bank at $25.00 per 2oz bottle and only avail at QVC, Sephora and now Ulta. (Amazon carries but it&#x27;s a 1oz can and not a prime seller)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started looking for an alternative because even thought I love just too expensive and not convenient.  I tried Gray Away and it&#x27;s terrible even though it looks like the same container don&#x27;t be fooled...you might as well spray black spray paint on your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So just went to purchase more Rita Hazan root concealer when I came across an Amazon Prime new product called Stye Edit for Black / Dark Brown and figured it was crap like the others but with the price and it being Prime I took a chance and glad I did.  Just as good as Rita Hazan product, doesn&#x27;t flake, water resistant and is shiny like real hair so ordering 2 more bottles today for backup.  Have ombre hair and love how 1/2 a bottle will give me about 2 more weeks before I have to see my stylist so i get about 8 weeks instead of 6 weeks.  I tend to get grey really fast right around my hairline especially near my ears&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Style Edit is a great product and I would highly reccommend.</li>
            <li> this product is an excellent quick fix in between colors, it covers my grey perfectly and doesn&#x27;t rub off on my pillow cases, quick delivery also!</li>
            <li> Not good. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Got a little on my skin on the first application and had to really rub it off, but once you get used to applying it- it&#x27;s a great quick fix.  Also- it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products but style edit is my favorite. Its sweat proof and not clumpy. It gives a natural look before next color appt.</li>
            <li> If you have colored your hair dark, I highly recommend this product for touch ups for the gray hair.  It really works well.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and covers well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of these sprays. I just wish they, once applied would be so powdery/get on your fingers if you mess with your hair.</li>
            <li> It works as advertized.  It has a focused directional nozzle however I still miss, however overspray clean up is simple.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It allows me to extend the time between my professional hair coloring appointments by at least a couple of weeks. It covers great and stays in until you wash it. You can brush and style you hair with it on and it does not flake off at all. I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this product!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different products to conceal my grey roots in between colorings - sprays, powders, pens. The couple sprays I remember trying made my hair gummy / sticky (Rita Hazan) and/or feel like straw or just gross (Bumble).  I like the powder (HairWow), but it takes too long to apply and can get messy.  This spray is great - goes on easy, does a good job covering the grey, and doesn&#x27;t screw up my hair.  I can definitely brush through my hair easily after using it and use it a couple days in a row without having to wash my hair. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> a great light hair spray/enhhancer</li>
            <li> This stuff has paint in it.  Very bad for your hair and stains it.  It RUINED MY HAIR.  Hate it!!!</li>
            <li> What a welcome relief that this product does what it promises without making a mess. Will definitely keep a reserve of this on hand.</li>
            <li> it works but gives so little runs out too fast!</li>
            <li> I heard abut this from a tv personality. I needed something to cover the roots (greys) in between hair colors with my hair stylist. I can&#x27;t be happier with this product. Matches my hair perfectly (dark brown/ black natural color). A+ for product and price!</li>
            <li> Good experience, good product</li>
            <li> I would give this spray five stars if there were more of it.  I only uses it for my bangs and the little hairs next to my ears, yet it hardly lasts a few weeks.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do though.  I hesitate to give it only 3 stars because I want them to stay in business, but I have to be honest.</li>
            <li> it spreads on the scalp and leaves black mark on scalp</li>
            <li> This is a product you must try yourself  to believe just how good it is. It is absolutely AMAZING!  A tiny spritz is all it takes.  There are no lines of demarcation - no &amp;#34;stripes&amp;#34; of color. It just covers - pure and simple.</li>
            <li> Love this product (received this as a white elephant Christmas present in 2014 and now I can&#x27;t live without it). This is perfect mid-week, in between my root touch ups, especially with 2 little ones and a busy job. The downside is that it washes out with a shampoo so it buys me ~2 days.</li>
            <li> Do you want to spray paint on your skin, good luck with that, hope you will not loose your hair. I found better product. Jennifer</li>
            <li> Seems to work.  Sprayer a little hard to get used to.</li>
            <li> This product really works - it is really saving me for those times when I just can&#x27;t get to coloring my hair</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Seems like the greys return so fast.  Just get this out and spray some on and off I go!  So very easy to use too!</li>
            <li> I like it, but it&#x27;s way too dark for my light brown/blond hair!</li>
            <li> does a pretty good job of covering the grays (not perfect though), certainly better than the one from rita hazan, which is more expensive.  would recommend.</li>
            <li> I just bought this for the first time having never needed to color my hair before, but I&#x27;m starting to see noticeable gray growing in.  I bought this at the suggestion of a stylist friend, and I really like it.  I spray it on any problem spots and it blends with the color of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does wash out when you shampoo, which I don&#x27;t do every day, so I&#x27;m happy with the longevity.  Otherwise, you&#x27;d have to reapply after every wash, but either way, it doesn&#x27;t bleed or transfer to your pillow overnight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for in between Color! Covers gray pretty good. Have to be careful not to over do it or get in your skin.</li>
            <li> I tried a lot of different products for in between color.. This ones my favorite</li>
            <li> This is the best product for covering grey I have found and I have used at least 6 other products.</li>
            <li> Convenient dependable way to obtain my hair products</li>
            <li> It does the job. Used it to color my friends roots when I did her weave. It comes in handy.</li>
            <li> I was very, very disappointed when the product arrived.  There was only one can.  I THOUGHT I was purchasing FOUR cans of various colors.  The advertising is misleading.  It shows four cans in the images....I guess I didn&#x27;t read the fine print.  But, the product works well.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have very premature gray hair and this is a lifesaver between salon visits. Love the pointed nozzle. This helps prevent the product from going anywhere except where it&#x27;s supposed to. New mainstay in my hair care!</li>
            <li> Love this product at the economical price!!!</li>
            <li> Style Edit works for several reasons.  The spray nozzle is very fine so you can conceal exactly the part of your hair you wish.  The texture is not too matte like some other products and the color is also very nice.  It lasts quite a while too.</li>
            <li> Just OK on my hair.  I didn&#x27;t think it would be so difficult to wash out - two washes for sure!  It didn&#x27;t provide the texture I anticipated from the description.  But it might work super on a different type of hair.  Good seller and quick ship- no worries there.</li>
            <li> Easy to use...just spray it on to cover gray!</li>
            <li> Good coverage, but the product leaves an impression of having greasy hair</li>
            <li> I have tried this a few times now, and it is pretty easy to use after the first couple of tries.  It covers the grey pretty well enabling me to wear my hair up and away from my face during week five and six after a salon color treatment.  I was hoping it would work so I could squeeze that extra week out of my color, and it seems to have worked!  The price was almost half of what my salon was charging!</li>
            <li> This is a piece of junk. It hurts the scalp and doesn&#x27;t conceal the grey. It was a scary experience to try it</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping! I LOVE this stuff! Used it twice &amp; washed hair in btwn uses. I have dark brown not quite black. Precise tip to spray only where you need it. Conceals my scattered gray strands nicely. I don&#x27;t want to dye it all until I absolutely can&#x27;t avoid it :) Tada- Found my Fix!! Thrilled w the way it even adds a little volume. Didn&#x27;t even need gel, or hairspray. I even sprayed some where the color wasn&#x27;t needed just for some added texture! Not stiff, just right! It does smell like the Halloween smell, but only while actually spraying. This little can goes far thanks to the precise tip. No messy overspray and no mess left in my shower either!! Thank You üëçüòä From a Happy, Happy #40 Grandma 2B in SLC, Utah üíïüëºüíï</li>
            <li> Love it! I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> Excellent for touching roots,excellent seller!</li>
            <li> How did I ever live without this???  I was using it for two weeks and didn&#x27;t even realize my roots had gotten that bad but then I ran out.  Best stuff ever.  Doesn&#x27;t flake, doesn&#x27;t come off until you wash it.  If you play with your hair, your hands don&#x27;t get color once it dries.  It really blends well and if you are gray like me it just makes it look like you have darker roots growing in.  I have dark brown hair and this blends perfectly.  Reordering two to have on hand right now.</li>
            <li> I have been using Gray Away spray and this stuff is pretty much the same but you get a bigger can for the money.  Nothing like those yucky mascara-wand covers or pasty sticks. Sprays on like hairspray and lasts until you wash. Perfect for covering part roots.</li>
            <li> Having resistant gray to color @ the salon &amp; hair that is long, course &amp; grows fast, I had been using a high end name brand brown powder as my only option to cover my white strip between salon appointments that left a matte finish &amp; unmatched color. Based on reviews, I ordered Style Edit &amp; can not say enough about this amazing product! It&#x27;s a complete match to my dark brown hair, goes on wonderful without a dull, powder matte look &amp; covers my gray while looking natural! I can run my hand through my hair with barely any products on my fingers &amp; the product lasts! Finally a product that does what it says &amp; looks great too! Love it!</li>
            <li> Great cover up until the next coloring.  You have to figure out how best to spray it but it&#x27;s a great temporary fix until you can get your hair treated.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS AWESOME!!!!  A &amp;#34;root&amp;#34; lifesaver - covers the greys!!!!!!</li>
