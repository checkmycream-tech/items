            <li>(I layered it like 8 times just to make sure</li>

            <li>lumpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am usually a huge fan of Sally Hansen products, but I warn you leave this alone.</li>
            <li>Now mine is almost gone and this stuff isn&#x27;t cheap but lasts a while.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>I have no idea about whether it&#x27;s good for nails though, but I hope some readers discover this alternative use for clear nail polish.</li>
            <li>It dries fast and stays on without peeling off!!!</li>
            <li>exactly what  i ordered.:)</li>
            <li>First of all, I love Sally Hansen products.  </li>
            <li>Keeps your nails shiny and &#x27;clean&#x27; looking.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it as a top coat, I thought ok maybe I used too much as it was quite gummy</li>
            <li>This works really well for a top coat.</li>
            <li>This stuff dries quick and no bubbles.</li>
            <li>No complaints here and the shipment was quick.</li>
            <li>top coats out there that are similarly priced and work much better.  </li>
            <li>My manicure (with OPI polish) chipped off rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the thing with product reviews, you always have negative and positive ones, all I can say is my experience has been wonderful with this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to encourage better products that help us save time, effort and irritation to be developed, and ones like these to just be taken off the shelf.</li>
            <li>totally worth it,</li>
            <li>Had no trouble with it not drying and causing imprints no matter how many times I layered it.</li>
            <li>either all there nail power chip right away</li>
            <li>All the other Sally Hansen brands are pretty good.</li>
            <li>and I re-do my nails, not because it&#x27;s chipped, but because my nails grow very fast.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several top coats, including &#x27;quick dry&#x27; ones, and this top coat dries faster and lasts longer than the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Then, I applied the Double Duty as a top coat onto one nail and it immediately clumped up the polish and got darker and</li>
            <li>I use this as a top coat only, and it keeps my color polish on for weeks.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use the Double Duty as a top coat though....</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have this problem when I don&#x27;t use Double Duty as a top coat.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t miss with Sally Hansen products!</li>
            <li>The first 5 times I used it</li>
            <li>It dries in minutes, and my nails are so much healthier now!</li>
            <li>I read other reviews and was hesitant to buy; I&#x27;m so glad I did!  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that you can get both the base coat and top coat in one bottle and have always found Sally Hansen products to be of great quality.</li>
            <li>Dried good.</li>
            <li>Well, I think my title sums it up, pretty much.  </li>
            <li>My nail designs last much longer when I use this, and using it as a top coat makes it very</li>
            <li>I have used plenty of other clear coats and they don&#x27;t work as good as this does.</li>
            <li>It also dries nice and smooth as long as you wait a minute or so for the coats to dry, If not you get bubbles.</li>
            <li>I use a lot of polishes containing glitter, and Double Duty makes it really easy to remove the polishes</li>
            <li>However, as a top coat, if you put it on before the color is completely dry, it smears the color.  </li>
            <li>However, it also tends to peel up at my cuticles, and eventually my polish will catch on clothing or a towel and peel off in a large sheet.  </li>
            <li>I use it as a top coat on Wet &amp; Wild nail polish, dries quickly.</li>
            <li>As far as top coating, the few times I am using colored nail polish, it does fine for me.</li>
            <li>So overall great polish but a little much in price</li>
            <li>Although INM Out the Door topcoat is not a base coat, it is so much better and dries rock hard.</li>
            <li>but i really feel compelled to write this because we invest so much time on our nails.</li>
            <li>Dries fast.  </li>
            <li>I can go the whole week or longer without it chipping.</li>
            <li>I do my nails very often.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a generous word) very gummy.</li>
            <li>Would definately recommend for anyone who wants their nails protected.</li>
            <li>As many other people have stated, it never fully dries.</li>
            <li>In fact, Sally Hansen extreme is my favorite drugstore polish.</li>
            <li>If I ever use this product again, it will be for a quick base coat at best.</li>
            <li>Nails lasted 3 full days after 2nd layer before chipping.&lt;br /&gt;Week</li>
            <li>Having to wait an hour or more for a traditional top coat to dry is one thing, but gummy and soft 12+ hours later?</li>
            <li>I file my nails down and put this top coat on it.</li>
            <li>Typically when I do my nails, my preferred top coat is Out The Door by INM Nails.</li>
            <li>I like this better than any other &#x27;clear&#x27; i&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li>rather thickly, I might add) and they were able to dry, and once I coated them with this clear coat, they often lasted an unprecedented amount of time, sometimes weeks.</li>
            <li>It does a decent job at protecting from staining.</li>
            <li>It keeps my nail polish lasting longer and dries fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>Very nice base and top coat.</li>
            <li>When I now use it as a top coat it forms little air bubble on the surface of my manicure.</li>
            <li>But since it wasn&#x27;t a quick dry coat I didn&#x27;t worry too much.</li>
            <li>The first base/top coat I purchased was Sally Hansen Double Duty, Like some others have mentioned, it easily peals off in a single sheet, damaging my nails.</li>
            <li>After a few weeks of using it, I found that my nails were splitting and chipping at the ends more as well, so it is probably also drying out my nails.</li>
            <li>Dries pretty slow for a top coat.</li>
            <li>It was my first experience with nail bead, so I assumed they would not last, but much to my surprise</li>
            <li>Even when it seems dry, it still dents, so I have to make sure I have no plans for several hours.</li>
            <li>As a painter, I paint small-scale, hand-painted pieces all the time, that I have to spray with a clear coat, and really, this process takes 24 hours and even though the same can&#x27;t exactly be said for nail polish, there are some similarities.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used my difficult-to-apply OTD this morning to harden my nails and will be purchasing a new bottle of it.</li>
            <li>only started doing my own manicures a few months ago.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a while and consistently have had the same issues.  </li>
            <li>I gave it ample time to dry afterwards, even sticking my hands in front of a fan in the hopes they&#x27;d dry faster when I realized that this, as a top coat, is quite gummy.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with purchase and would recommend to anyone as both a base and top coat as well as a nail growth promoter.</li>
            <li>It makes removing polish easy and fun (but horribly unhealthy for my nails).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so hard to find a reliable Base and Top Coat, this one is great!</li>
            <li>I read online that a solution to fraying fabric / buttons is to put some clear nail polish.  </li>
            <li>I used this for a touch up coat when I nicked the clear coat on my road bike.</li>
            <li>This also will color the clear polish.  </li>
            <li>review was written by my 15 year old daughter)</li>
            <li>Buying separate base and top coats would more than be worth the extra effort.</li>
            <li>It is about 8 out of 10 rating regarding how long it keeps your polish from chipping (pretty good, but not excellent).  </li>
            <li>For a while this was a solid base coat (dried pretty quickly) and an okay to decent top coat.</li>
            <li>You have your nails pretty for long time!</li>
            <li>(the consistency of super glue or thicker) and even stringy (like those little wisps that come off of glue), much too thick to use on my nails smoothly.</li>
            <li>Arrived pretty quickly, wasn&#x27;t broken, and worked as a great top and base coat!</li>
            <li>But since it is a pretty decent base coat, a fair rating will be 1 star.  </li>
            <li>It is also great if you like to put a little but of color in between the base and top coats.</li>
            <li>Though it is advertised as a base and top coat, it can actually be worn on its own and looks like polish.</li>
            <li>It is my go-to top nail base and top coat.</li>
            <li>and it dried quickly each time)</li>
            <li>I love this polish because it serves as both a base and top coat.</li>
            <li>I purchased this originally as a base coat, but I was pleased to find that it also works as a top coat too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just not sure if it is working or if it makes my fingernails polish chip off more uniformly in one single layer.  </li>
            <li>Sally Hansen double duty base and top coat is very easy to apply and you only need one product instead of two.</li>
            <li>Nearly an hour later, I had to dress and dash out the door to class.  </li>
            <li>I am in the process of going through my nail products and weeding out the poor ones, because my nails appear to be getting more brittle and weak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this product works very well makes my nail polish last for a long time without chipping!!</li>
            <li>I saw many people say that it&#x27;s a bad top-coat; I have found the opposite to be true.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to dry hard enough to work as a top coat either.</li>
            <li>This time, I didn&#x27;t use the Double Duty for a base coat, I just applied the new polish and it looked great.</li>
            <li>I noticed lately that OTD was getting harder to apply evenly, as it does when the top coat ages.</li>
            <li>Waste of money - threw it away after the first use.</li>
            <li>About 1/4 through the bottle, it became super sticky and gloopy and hard to apply.</li>
            <li>As this is the only product I&#x27;ve been using for months now, I can only assign the orange stain on my nails to this item, especially since the nail polish never actually has direct contact with my nails.  </li>
            <li>That night, probably a full 12 hours later, i went to bed and woke up the next morning with a smudge on a nail, probably from clenching too hard.  </li>
            <li>As a base coat, it did keep the fingernail polish color from staining my nails, but as a top coat, it did nothing to protect the polish from chips, scratches or wearing off quickly.  </li>
            <li>As a base coat it works very well as a top coat it didn&#x27;t work well with certain nailpolish, it stayed gummy and took forever to dry.</li>

            <li> Now mine is almost gone and this stuff isn&#x27;t cheap but lasts a while.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> I have no idea about whether it&#x27;s good for nails though, but I hope some readers discover this alternative use for clear nail polish.</li>
            <li> It dries fast and stays on without peeling off!!!</li>
            <li> exactly what  i ordered.:)</li>
            <li> First of all, I love Sally Hansen products.  </li>
            <li> Keeps your nails shiny and &#x27;clean&#x27; looking.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it as a top coat, I thought ok maybe I used too much as it was quite gummy</li>
            <li> This works really well for a top coat.</li>
            <li> This stuff dries quick and no bubbles.</li>
            <li> No complaints here and the shipment was quick.</li>
            <li> top coats out there that are similarly priced and work much better.  </li>
            <li> My manicure (with OPI polish) chipped off rather quickly.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the thing with product reviews, you always have negative and positive ones, all I can say is my experience has been wonderful with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to encourage better products that help us save time, effort and irritation to be developed, and ones like these to just be taken off the shelf.</li>
            <li> totally worth it,</li>
            <li> Had no trouble with it not drying and causing imprints no matter how many times I layered it.</li>
            <li> either all there nail power chip right away</li>
            <li> All the other Sally Hansen brands are pretty good.</li>
            <li> and I re-do my nails, not because it&#x27;s chipped, but because my nails grow very fast.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several top coats, including &#x27;quick dry&#x27; ones, and this top coat dries faster and lasts longer than the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Then, I applied the Double Duty as a top coat onto one nail and it immediately clumped up the polish and got darker and</li>
            <li> I use this as a top coat only, and it keeps my color polish on for weeks.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use the Double Duty as a top coat though....</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have this problem when I don&#x27;t use Double Duty as a top coat.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t miss with Sally Hansen products!</li>
            <li> The first 5 times I used it</li>
            <li> It dries in minutes, and my nails are so much healthier now!</li>
            <li> I read other reviews and was hesitant to buy; I&#x27;m so glad I did!  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that you can get both the base coat and top coat in one bottle and have always found Sally Hansen products to be of great quality.</li>
            <li> Dried good.</li>
            <li> Well, I think my title sums it up, pretty much.  </li>
            <li> My nail designs last much longer when I use this, and using it as a top coat makes it very</li>
            <li> I have used plenty of other clear coats and they don&#x27;t work as good as this does.</li>
            <li> It also dries nice and smooth as long as you wait a minute or so for the coats to dry, If not you get bubbles.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of polishes containing glitter, and Double Duty makes it really easy to remove the polishes</li>
            <li> However, as a top coat, if you put it on before the color is completely dry, it smears the color.  </li>
            <li> However, it also tends to peel up at my cuticles, and eventually my polish will catch on clothing or a towel and peel off in a large sheet.  </li>
            <li> I use it as a top coat on Wet &amp; Wild nail polish, dries quickly.</li>
            <li> As far as top coating, the few times I am using colored nail polish, it does fine for me.</li>
            <li> So overall great polish but a little much in price</li>
            <li> Although INM Out the Door topcoat is not a base coat, it is so much better and dries rock hard.</li>
            <li> but i really feel compelled to write this because we invest so much time on our nails.</li>
            <li> Dries fast.  </li>
            <li> I can go the whole week or longer without it chipping.</li>
            <li> I do my nails very often.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a generous word) very gummy.</li>
            <li> Would definately recommend for anyone who wants their nails protected.</li>
            <li> As many other people have stated, it never fully dries.</li>
            <li> In fact, Sally Hansen extreme is my favorite drugstore polish.</li>
            <li> If I ever use this product again, it will be for a quick base coat at best.</li>
            <li> Nails lasted 3 full days after 2nd layer before chipping.&lt;br /&gt;Week</li>
            <li> Having to wait an hour or more for a traditional top coat to dry is one thing, but gummy and soft 12+ hours later?</li>
            <li> I file my nails down and put this top coat on it.</li>
            <li> Typically when I do my nails, my preferred top coat is Out The Door by INM Nails.</li>
            <li> I like this better than any other &#x27;clear&#x27; i&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> rather thickly, I might add) and they were able to dry, and once I coated them with this clear coat, they often lasted an unprecedented amount of time, sometimes weeks.</li>
            <li> It does a decent job at protecting from staining.</li>
            <li> It keeps my nail polish lasting longer and dries fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Very nice base and top coat.</li>
            <li> When I now use it as a top coat it forms little air bubble on the surface of my manicure.</li>
            <li> But since it wasn&#x27;t a quick dry coat I didn&#x27;t worry too much.</li>
            <li> The first base/top coat I purchased was Sally Hansen Double Duty, Like some others have mentioned, it easily peals off in a single sheet, damaging my nails.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of using it, I found that my nails were splitting and chipping at the ends more as well, so it is probably also drying out my nails.</li>
            <li> Dries pretty slow for a top coat.</li>
            <li> It was my first experience with nail bead, so I assumed they would not last, but much to my surprise</li>
            <li> Even when it seems dry, it still dents, so I have to make sure I have no plans for several hours.</li>
            <li> As a painter, I paint small-scale, hand-painted pieces all the time, that I have to spray with a clear coat, and really, this process takes 24 hours and even though the same can&#x27;t exactly be said for nail polish, there are some similarities.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used my difficult-to-apply OTD this morning to harden my nails and will be purchasing a new bottle of it.</li>
            <li> only started doing my own manicures a few months ago.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while and consistently have had the same issues.  </li>
            <li> I gave it ample time to dry afterwards, even sticking my hands in front of a fan in the hopes they&#x27;d dry faster when I realized that this, as a top coat, is quite gummy.  </li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with purchase and would recommend to anyone as both a base and top coat as well as a nail growth promoter.</li>
            <li> It makes removing polish easy and fun (but horribly unhealthy for my nails).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find a reliable Base and Top Coat, this one is great!</li>
            <li> I read online that a solution to fraying fabric / buttons is to put some clear nail polish.  </li>
            <li> I used this for a touch up coat when I nicked the clear coat on my road bike.</li>
            <li> This also will color the clear polish.  </li>
            <li> review was written by my 15 year old daughter)</li>
            <li> Buying separate base and top coats would more than be worth the extra effort.</li>
            <li> It is about 8 out of 10 rating regarding how long it keeps your polish from chipping (pretty good, but not excellent).  </li>
            <li> For a while this was a solid base coat (dried pretty quickly) and an okay to decent top coat.</li>
            <li> You have your nails pretty for long time!</li>
            <li> (the consistency of super glue or thicker) and even stringy (like those little wisps that come off of glue), much too thick to use on my nails smoothly.</li>
            <li> Arrived pretty quickly, wasn&#x27;t broken, and worked as a great top and base coat!</li>
            <li> But since it is a pretty decent base coat, a fair rating will be 1 star.  </li>
            <li> It is also great if you like to put a little but of color in between the base and top coats.</li>
            <li> Though it is advertised as a base and top coat, it can actually be worn on its own and looks like polish.</li>
            <li> It is my go-to top nail base and top coat.</li>
            <li> and it dried quickly each time)</li>
            <li> I love this polish because it serves as both a base and top coat.</li>
            <li> I purchased this originally as a base coat, but I was pleased to find that it also works as a top coat too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not sure if it is working or if it makes my fingernails polish chip off more uniformly in one single layer.  </li>
            <li> Sally Hansen double duty base and top coat is very easy to apply and you only need one product instead of two.</li>
            <li> Nearly an hour later, I had to dress and dash out the door to class.  </li>
            <li> I am in the process of going through my nail products and weeding out the poor ones, because my nails appear to be getting more brittle and weak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this product works very well makes my nail polish last for a long time without chipping!!</li>
            <li> I saw many people say that it&#x27;s a bad top-coat; I have found the opposite to be true.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to dry hard enough to work as a top coat either.</li>
            <li> This time, I didn&#x27;t use the Double Duty for a base coat, I just applied the new polish and it looked great.</li>
            <li> I noticed lately that OTD was getting harder to apply evenly, as it does when the top coat ages.</li>
            <li> Waste of money - threw it away after the first use.</li>
            <li> About 1/4 through the bottle, it became super sticky and gloopy and hard to apply.</li>
            <li> As this is the only product I&#x27;ve been using for months now, I can only assign the orange stain on my nails to this item, especially since the nail polish never actually has direct contact with my nails.  </li>
            <li> That night, probably a full 12 hours later, i went to bed and woke up the next morning with a smudge on a nail, probably from clenching too hard.  </li>
            <li> As a base coat, it did keep the fingernail polish color from staining my nails, but as a top coat, it did nothing to protect the polish from chips, scratches or wearing off quickly.  </li>
            <li> As a base coat it works very well as a top coat it didn&#x27;t work well with certain nailpolish, it stayed gummy and took forever to dry.</li>
            <li> I bought this months ago and still have it, A thin coat will do the trick for about a weeks worth of wear, and i work for fedex, so my nails take a beating!</li>
            <li> DD basecoat, OPI nailpolish (same drying time), and DD topcoat after giving the second layer of polish 4 hours to dry.  </li>
            <li> After exactly 9 months of use (about once every 2 weeks), this has now turned goopy, thick</li>
            <li> I have a hard time &#x27;liking&#x27; a whole bunch of polishes.  </li>
            <li> I love this as a base and a clear coat, but if you do a lot with your hands it will not last long.</li>
            <li> But, not it is very gloopy and thick</li>
            <li> I noticed it took a long time to dry...</li>
            <li> It takes forever to dry and stays gummy for an incredibly long time.  </li>
            <li> but I always go back to Sally Hansen Base &amp; Top!</li>
            <li> Compared to other similar products, I still recommend this as a top/base coat polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not as lasting as other ones i have had</li>
            <li> I can let my nails dry for 4 hours, go to bed, and wake up with imprints of my sheets in my nails.  </li>
            <li> I wait until my thin layer of OPI color is solidly dry, then apply the Double Duty as a top coat, as thin as I can.  </li>
            <li> I will admit I am lazy and like to use one coat of clear and leave the house.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, I get lazy and don&#x27;t feel like painting my nails, so I just use this as a clear nail polish</li>
            <li> spend the extra money and get separate base and top coats</li>
            <li> I have a very specific manicure routine, and this base and top coat is an integral part of every manicure.  </li>
            <li> I messed up one nail, repainted, and used OTD so it wouldn&#x27;t be wet longer than the other nails.</li>
            <li> After I applied the base coat I used Rimmel London 60 second dry and waited as it dried then applied top coat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I used it, I thought I&#x27;d done something wrong--or that there was something wrong with the polish I was using.</li>
            <li> and I used this for something other than nails.  </li>
            <li> Not like the other reviews said.</li>
            <li> I used other brand too</li>
            <li> Other</li>
            <li> and I was getting imprints in the coat from other things.</li>
            <li> There are other base/</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I have to set a lot of time aside for this, because it takes forever to dry!</li>
            <li> I used this product as a base, put on two coats of Covergirl Outlast in Peek A Boo Pink, then used the product again as a top coat.</li>
            <li> It seems that if I have been using it for longer that a few minutes, the polish gets really dry on the brush.  </li>
            <li> I only used it as a base coat; I&#x27;d heard on the internet that it was dreadfully slow to dry as a top coat.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient since I can use it as both base coat and top coat.  </li>
            <li> It fulfills the duty of the base coat and top coat.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it can be used for a base and top coat.</li>
            <li> While this is good for a base coat, it is awful as a top coat.</li>
            <li> I use this as both a bass and a to coat.</li>
            <li> I like it that you can use it for both, base and top coat.</li>
            <li> The second time I used a very thin layer and same thing - it was gummy and within a day, some of the polish (along with gummy stuff) was peeling off.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a possible replacement, since my base coat (Seche Clear) was also getting low.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s decent as a base coat, but this brand also has base coats that work better and provide other benefits such as strengthening your nails or making them grow faster.</li>
            <li> Overrated too thick and clumps on nails.also takes along tome too dry.</li>
            <li> As a topcoat it went on a little thick, took a little bit to dry and sometimes picked up the pigment of the polish under.</li>
            <li> I was a little scared ordering nail polish online, hoping it didn&#x27;t break in the mail...</li>
            <li> This is a TERRIBLE top coat!  </li>
            <li> It dried in a matter of 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have seen these reviews before I wasted my time and money on this.</li>
            <li> As a base coat, Double Duty works decently.  </li>
            <li> As a base coat, my OPI color polish adheres very well to it after I&#x27;ve let it dry a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done all kinds of wild, crazy designs on my nails (</li>
            <li> Usually, my nail polish chips literally within hours of applying it, since I am a stay-at-home mom with no dishwasher</li>
            <li> a top coat, this product is the worst.  </li>
            <li> terrible it dry up right away</li>
            <li> This is a mediocre top and base coat.</li>
            <li> so my nails don&#x27;t look as dull.  </li>
            <li> (Yes, I&#x27;m hard on my hands).</li>
            <li> But still, seriously?  </li>
            <li> - otherwise the glitter sticks to my nails and is next to impossible to remove.  </li>
            <li> so it is very hard to use.</li>
            <li> This base coat/top coat clumps up the polish above or beneath it.</li>
            <li> This is worse than having no topcoat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so i am stuck with it, broken nails and lost money.</li>
            <li> I guess that I am a tad bit confused.</li>
            <li> so annoyed.</li>
            <li> Even after sitting without moving for 20 minutes, I ended up with with that nasty rough finish on my nails because the stuff still hadn&#x27;t fully dried.  </li>
            <li> It takes a while to dry, but as a base coat, it keeps the color polish from staining my nails.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend other base coats from this brand, just not this one.</li>
            <li> I have used it as a base coat on occasion when I am fancying myself up a little with a colored nail polish.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t go wrong with Sally</li>
            <li> 3 very unappealing things to me as a consumer.</li>
            <li> Of course this mean my nails usually look terrible.</li>
            <li> So disappointing.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Sally Hanson!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m never used this as a base coat, but I&#x27;m tempted to try it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it OR like it.  </li>
            <li> but it has worked well as a base coat for me.</li>
            <li> When I used it for a base coat</li>
            <li> The base coat didn&#x27;t seem to adhere well to the nail bed.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible product, made my nails brittle and three broke off at the base.</li>
            <li> and I also paint (which is very bad for nail</li>
            <li> Horrible horrible product i would of returned it if i could,</li>
            <li> Sally Hansen is a terrible product, save your money and time.</li>
            <li> Terrible and does nothing to protect polish</li>
            <li> It is almost worst than using nothing.  </li>

            <li> can&#x27;t go wrong with Sally</li>
            <li> Use every time I change my nail color!</li>
            <li> I did not purchase this from Amazon, but wanted to leave a review here anyway to warn people to stay away from this product. This base coat/top coat clumps up the polish above or beneath it. There&#x27;s some sort of reaction to the polish that makes it get lumpy as soon as this top coat is applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, I thought I&#x27;d done something wrong--or that there was something wrong with the polish I was using. But I removed the clumpy-looking polish from my nails and tried a different polish. This time, I didn&#x27;t use the Double Duty for a base coat, I just applied the new polish and it looked great. Then, I applied the Double Duty as a top coat onto one nail and it immediately clumped up the polish and got darker and lumpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am usually a huge fan of Sally Hansen products, but I warn you leave this alone.</li>
            <li> As this is the only product I&#x27;ve been using for months now, I can only assign the orange stain on my nails to this item, especially since the nail polish never actually has direct contact with my nails.  I&#x27;m going to be looking for something else...</li>
            <li> It is my go-to top nail base and top coat.</li>
            <li> As a top coat, it is absolutely useless.  If i could give it no stars i would.  But since it is a pretty decent base coat, a fair rating will be 1 star.  Here are my tests.&lt;br /&gt;Week A:  DD basecoat, OPI nailpolish (2 layers, with a day drying time between layers).  Nails lasted 3 full days after 2nd layer before chipping.&lt;br /&gt;Week B: No basecoat, OPI nailpolish (same drying time).  And nails lasted 2 days before chipping.&lt;br /&gt;Week C: DD basecoat, OPI nailpolish (same drying time), and DD topcoat after giving the second layer of polish 4 hours to dry.  4 hours later i went for yoga class, and all my nails have imprints of the yoga mat.&lt;br /&gt;Week C: I refuse to believe the evidence of Week C, so tried again.  On Week D,  i applied the topcoat on the morning after the day i applied the second layer of polish.  That night, probably a full 12 hours later, i went to bed and woke up the next morning with a smudge on a nail, probably from clenching too hard.  But still, seriously?  This is worse than having no topcoat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never written a review before but i really feel compelled to write this because we invest so much time on our nails. I&#x27;d like to encourage better products that help us save time, effort and irritation to be developed, and ones like these to just be taken off the shelf.</li>
            <li> Works just like it says.  Lasts a while.  Doesn&#x27;t chip off easily.</li>
            <li> If you can wait! I use this as a top coat only, and it keeps my color polish on for weeks. My cuticles usually look haggard first before the polish starts to chip. My only complaint is that I have to set a lot of time aside for this, because it takes forever to dry! Even when it seems dry, it still dents, so I have to make sure I have no plans for several hours. It&#x27;s good stuff though and worth the wait, since you get weeks of color out of it.</li>
            <li> This stuff dries quick and no bubbles. Great find.</li>
            <li> Good product that helps nails grow really fast.  I am very satisfied with purchase and would recommend to anyone as both a base and top coat as well as a nail growth promoter.</li>
            <li> I will admit I am lazy and like to use one coat of clear and leave the house. This works great for that. It is also great if you like to put a little but of color in between the base and top coats. It also dries nice and smooth as long as you wait a minute or so for the coats to dry, If not you get bubbles.</li>
            <li> Well, I think my title sums it up, pretty much.  As a base coat, my OPI color polish adheres very well to it after I&#x27;ve let it dry a few minutes.  I can&#x27;t use the Double Duty as a top coat though.... I wait until my thin layer of OPI color is solidly dry, then apply the Double Duty as a top coat, as thin as I can.  I gave it ample time to dry afterwards, even sticking my hands in front of a fan in the hopes they&#x27;d dry faster when I realized that this, as a top coat, is quite gummy.  Nearly an hour later, I had to dress and dash out the door to class.  When I got to class, I saw a \\&quot;gummy\\&quot; gouge in my polish, along with a good-sized chip on the tips on two nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have this problem when I don&#x27;t use Double Duty as a top coat.  So, as a base, it&#x27;s great.  Double duty, though?  Not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this item locally.</li>
            <li> spend the extra money and get separate base and top coats</li>
            <li> This is a good, reliable product.  Though it is advertised as a base and top coat, it can actually be worn on its own and looks like polish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s decent as a base coat, but this brand also has base coats that work better and provide other benefits such as strengthening your nails or making them grow faster. I&#x27;d recommend other base coats from this brand, just not this one. It doesn&#x27;t seem to dry hard enough to work as a top coat either. Buying separate base and top coats would more than be worth the extra effort.</li>
            <li> I used to use this all the time because it was affordable and seemed like a good idea. As many other people have stated, it never fully dries. You can smudge it around like gum. Although INM Out the Door topcoat is not a base coat, it is so much better and dries rock hard. If you&#x27;re looking for a really good topcoat that is affordable and dries quickly, Out the Door is a great idea. Another con about this product is how gloopy it becomes in the bottle. About 1/4 through the bottle, it became super sticky and gloopy and hard to apply.</li>
            <li> exactly what  i ordered.:)</li>
            <li> Love this brand and it works great. Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> This product goes on easily.  It&#x27;s convenient since I can use it as both base coat and top coat.  It is about 8 out of 10 rating regarding how long it keeps your polish from chipping (pretty good, but not excellent).  Overall it is good product and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Makes my polish shine so nicely. Lasts a while.</li>
            <li> Great, bottom and top coat!</li>
            <li> I bought this months ago and still have it, A thin coat will do the trick for about a weeks worth of wear, and i work for fedex, so my nails take a beating! Must buy</li>
            <li> For a while this was a solid base coat (dried pretty quickly) and an okay to decent top coat. As a topcoat it went on a little thick, took a little bit to dry and sometimes picked up the pigment of the polish under. At its peak, my manicure lasted about 5 days without repplication. After exactly 9 months of use (about once every 2 weeks), this has now turned goopy, thick (the consistency of super glue or thicker) and even stringy (like those little wisps that come off of glue), much too thick to use on my nails smoothly. It&#x27;s a shame to toss it with 1/5-1/4 still left in the bottle. Off to search for a replacement, I know I can do better!</li>
            <li> Protects great and gives a nice shine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and I used this for something other than nails.  I read online that a solution to fraying fabric / buttons is to put some clear nail polish.  It works!!  I have no idea about whether it&#x27;s good for nails though, but I hope some readers discover this alternative use for clear nail polish.</li>
            <li> It fulfills the duty of the base coat and top coat. It gives a good shine. Nice to be able to order online and have in my hands so .quickly. I do like the Sally Hansen product and especially the affordable price.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time &#x27;liking&#x27; a whole bunch of polishes.  I like this better than any other &#x27;clear&#x27; i&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible product, made my nails brittle and three broke off at the base. The top coat caused the nail polish to peel off in one piece, what didn&#x27;t peel off chipped, this all happened within 12 hours of applying. Horrible horrible product i would of returned it if i could, but of course i couldn&#x27;t so i am stuck with it, broken nails and lost money. 3 very unappealing things to me as a consumer. Sally Hansen is a terrible product, save your money and time. Nail magic is a bit more money but totally worth it, no breaks no chips just nail growth and strength.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t miss with Sally Hansen products!</li>
            <li> Overrated too thick and clumps on nails.also takes along tome too dry.</li>
            <li> Works good. Dried good. Not like the other reviews said. Had no trouble with it not drying and causing imprints no matter how many times I layered it. (I layered it like 8 times just to make sure and it dried quickly each time)</li>
            <li> I am in the process of going through my nail products and weeding out the poor ones, because my nails appear to be getting more brittle and weak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only started doing my own manicures a few months ago. The first base/top coat I purchased was Sally Hansen Double Duty, Like some others have mentioned, it easily peals off in a single sheet, damaging my nails. After a few weeks of using it, I found that my nails were splitting and chipping at the ends more as well, so it is probably also drying out my nails. The rest of my bottle is going in the trash and I will start paying more attention to product reviews before applying anything else to my nails.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it can be used for a base and top coat. The first 5 times I used it it worked fine. But, not it is very gloopy and thick so it is very hard to use. So disappointing. When I now use it as a top coat it forms little air bubble on the surface of my manicure. All the other Sally Hansen brands are pretty good. In fact, Sally Hansen extreme is my favorite drugstore polish. Not buying again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several top coats, including &#x27;quick dry&#x27; ones, and this top coat dries faster and lasts longer than the others I&#x27;ve tried. That being said, I always allow for extra time drying, just because with almost any nail polish, it takes several hours to truly cure a nail polish. As a painter, I paint small-scale, hand-painted pieces all the time, that I have to spray with a clear coat, and really, this process takes 24 hours and even though the same can&#x27;t exactly be said for nail polish, there are some similarities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m never used this as a base coat, but I&#x27;m tempted to try it. I&#x27;ve done all kinds of wild, crazy designs on my nails (rather thickly, I might add) and they were able to dry, and once I coated them with this clear coat, they often lasted an unprecedented amount of time, sometimes weeks. Usually, my nail polish chips literally within hours of applying it, since I am a stay-at-home mom with no dishwasher and I wash everything by hand and I also use my hands quite a bit because I am a painter and I also paint (which is very bad for nail polish).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;XOXO</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not sure if it is working or if it makes my fingernails polish chip off more uniformly in one single layer.  I don&#x27;t hate it OR like it.  I guess that I am a tad bit confused.</li>
            <li> As a base coat it works very well as a top coat it didn&#x27;t work well with certain nailpolish, it stayed gummy and took forever to dry. After I applied the base coat I used Rimmel London 60 second dry and waited as it dried then applied top coat. It dried in a matter of 20 minutes. My nails didn&#x27;t start chipping until a week later. This product can work great with the right type of nailpolish.</li>
            <li> Sally Hansen double duty base and top coat is very easy to apply and you only need one product instead of two. Must have!</li>
            <li> I never have time for fancy color manicures.  This is a nice product.  Keeps your nails shiny and &#x27;clean&#x27; looking. Dries fast.  I&#x27;ve ordered this before.</li>
            <li> Terrible and does nothing to protect polish</li>
            <li> I love this top coat. It dries nicely, there are no bubbles,  and makes for an excellently strong top coat.</li>
            <li> Typically when I do my nails, my preferred top coat is Out The Door by INM Nails. I noticed lately that OTD was getting harder to apply evenly, as it does when the top coat ages. I purchased this as a possible replacement, since my base coat (Seche Clear) was also getting low. I used this product as a base, put on two coats of Covergirl Outlast in Peek A Boo Pink, then used the product again as a top coat. I noticed it took a long time to dry... But since it wasn&#x27;t a quick dry coat I didn&#x27;t worry too much. I messed up one nail, repainted, and used OTD so it wouldn&#x27;t be wet longer than the other nails. This was around 3pm. Cut to 4am, I wake up and notice that all the nails except the one I used OTD on now have imprints of my sheet fabric. Having to wait an hour or more for a traditional top coat to dry is one thing, but gummy and soft 12+ hours later? Not acceptable. I used my difficult-to-apply OTD this morning to harden my nails and will be purchasing a new bottle of it. If I ever use this product again, it will be for a quick base coat at best. Save your money and look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for many years! I used other brand too but I always go back to Sally Hansen Base &amp; Top! You have your nails pretty for long time!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have been looking for a good, inexpensive base/top coat combo, and this works really well. My nail designs last much longer when I use this, and using it as a top coat makes it very glossy.&lt;br /&gt;  Sometimes, I get lazy and don&#x27;t feel like painting my nails, so I just use this as a clear nail polish so my nails don&#x27;t look as dull.  It dries in minutes, and my nails are so much healthier now!</li>
            <li> I love this polish because it serves as both a base and top coat. It def makes my polish last longer. I can go the whole week or longer without it chipping.</li>
            <li> My nail color already came off. I wash my hands a lot at work (medical field) and i needed something that would keep my nail polish on. this didn&#x27;t work. it started to chip off after two days at work. so annoyed.</li>
            <li> I use it as a top coat and it helps my nail polish stay on longer without chipping, so I can get that salon finish without spending money at the salon.</li>
            <li> Nice product by Sally Hansen.  I use her products quite often.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.  It takes forever to dry and stays gummy for an incredibly long time.  Even after sitting without moving for 20 minutes, I ended up with with that nasty rough finish on my nails because the stuff still hadn&#x27;t fully dried.  Waste of money - threw it away after the first use.</li>
            <li> This product is Awesome. It dries fast and stays on without peeling off!!! I love it!!! :-) :-)</li>
            <li> Loved the nail polish</li>
            <li> I had hoped this would keep the polish from pealing off of my nails... all that work and I still haven&#x27;t rectified the problem, more research needed.  Other then that it was a good top coat.</li>
            <li> This is a mediocre top and base coat. It does a decent job at protecting from staining. Dries pretty slow for a top coat.</li>
            <li> Works great, inexpensive and ships fast, what more could you need? I definitely recommend this product! It&#x27;s so hard to find a reliable Base and Top Coat, this one is great!</li>
            <li> Does what its supposed to do</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a university student that never has time to do her nails. I still wanted to protect them through the winter and have them look presentable. I file my nails down and put this top coat on it. My nails look so beautiful! I can only imagine how it would look on an actual nail polish color. With just one layer, it last for about 1.5 weeks before it starts wears off around the edges. It would probably last longer if another layer of colored nail polish was painted atop it. The shine is incredible and it dries really fast</li>
            <li> Sally Hansen makes the best products for nails. This product was received before EDD and I use it twice a week, so I will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> I used this for a touch up coat when I nicked the clear coat on my road bike. Worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> Cheap and works! No complaints here and the shipment was quick. I use it as a top coat on Wet &amp; Wild nail polish, dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Sally Hanson!</li>
            <li> I love this as a base and a clear coat, but if you do a lot with your hands it will not last long. Overall, it provides a great and beautiful shine to my manicures.</li>
            <li> Great as a top coat. I don&#x27;t use it as a bottom coat. I have used plenty of other clear coats and they don&#x27;t work as good as this does. Now mine is almost gone and this stuff isn&#x27;t cheap but lasts a while. Love it!!</li>
            <li> terrible it dry up right away I wont buy this sally hansen again either all there nail power chip right away</li>
            <li> this product works very well makes my nail polish last for a long time without chipping!! i would recommend it</li>
            <li> It worked fine but i foind that it works just as much generic brands you cnn get at drug stores or walmart &amp; target for like 99 ents. So overall great polish but a little much in price</li>
            <li> While this is good for a base coat, it is awful as a top coat. The first time I used it as a top coat, I thought ok maybe I used too much as it was quite gummy and I was getting imprints in the coat from other things. The second time I used a very thin layer and same thing - it was gummy and within a day, some of the polish (along with gummy stuff) was peeling off. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this! I do my nails very often. I use this as both a bass and a to coat. Works great.. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Arrived pretty quickly, wasn&#x27;t broken, and worked as a great top and base coat! I was a little scared ordering nail polish online, hoping it didn&#x27;t break in the mail...but this base/top coat nail polish was perfect.</li>
            <li> This product \\&quot;dries\\&quot;(and that&#x27;s a generous word) very gummy. I&#x27;ve been sitting here with it on my nails for over 30 minutes and it&#x27;s like I just put it on from the bottle. I wish I would have seen these reviews before I wasted my time and money on this.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while and consistently have had the same issues.  As a base coat, Double Duty works decently.  I use a lot of polishes containing glitter, and Double Duty makes it really easy to remove the polishes - otherwise the glitter sticks to my nails and is next to impossible to remove.  However, it also tends to peel up at my cuticles, and eventually my polish will catch on clothing or a towel and peel off in a large sheet.  It makes removing polish easy and fun (but horribly unhealthy for my nails).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a top coat, this product is the worst.  I can let my nails dry for 4 hours, go to bed, and wake up with imprints of my sheets in my nails.  Hours after using it, I can still leave fingerprints on my polish or smudge it.  There are other base/top coats out there that are similarly priced and work much better.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> It takes a while to dry, but as a base coat, it keeps the color polish from staining my nails.  However, as a top coat, if you put it on before the color is completely dry, it smears the color.  This also will color the clear polish.  It seems that if I have been using it for longer that a few minutes, the polish gets really dry on the brush.  Compared to other similar products, I still recommend this as a top/base coat polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(This review was written by my 15 year old daughter)</li>
            <li> Very nice base and top coat. I like it that you can use it for both, base and top coat. I don&#x27;t need to buy two  products.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Using this my nails stay chip-free.  The manicure lasts for over 1 week and I re-do my nails, not because it&#x27;s chipped, but because my nails grow very fast.  I read other reviews and was hesitant to buy; I&#x27;m so glad I did!  I saw many people say that it&#x27;s a bad top-coat; I have found the opposite to be true.  Honestly I have been using this for months and have had no chipping.  That&#x27;s the thing with product reviews, you always have negative and positive ones, all I can say is my experience has been wonderful with this product.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that you can get both the base coat and top coat in one bottle and have always found Sally Hansen products to be of great quality.</li>
            <li> This is great and so cheap! It keeps my nail polish lasting longer and dries fairly quickly. I will definitely be repurchasing!</li>
            <li> I use this product basically as the only nail polish I ever put on. I like it quite well. I have used it as a base coat on occasion when I am fancying myself up a little with a colored nail polish. I don&#x27;t do that often but it has worked well as a base coat for me. As far as top coating, the few times I am using colored nail polish, it does fine for me. I like this product.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat. I am a mom, so I spend tons of time cleaning and cooking and bathing. Of course this mean my nails usually look terrible. I have never had my polish stay on loner than a day without cracking and flaking off. This stuff kept my nail color on for 3 days through all of my nail abuse &amp; it even held nail caviar on!!! It was my first experience with nail bead, so I assumed they would not last, but much to my surprise it stayed on until I peeled it off.</li>
            <li> This works really well for a top coat. When I used it for a base coat my nail polish pealed off like a sticker.</li>
            <li> Great Two in One base/ top coat. Gets The job done.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth. Dries quickly and has a nice gloss to it.</li>
            <li> not as lasting as other ones i have had</li>
            <li> My manicure (with OPI polish) chipped off rather quickly.  The base coat didn&#x27;t seem to adhere well to the nail bed.  I only used it as a base coat; I&#x27;d heard on the internet that it was dreadfully slow to dry as a top coat.  Should I have bought from a pricier line (Seche Vite, Essie)?  Maybe so.</li>
            <li> I purchased this originally as a base coat, but I was pleased to find that it also works as a top coat too. With this topcoat, on average, I went about three days before there was any chipping when normal nail polish just lasts one day (Yes, I&#x27;m hard on my hands). With better nail polish, I went about a week before there was chipping.</li>
            <li> First of all, I love Sally Hansen products.  Great price, great quality.  I have a very specific manicure routine, and this base and top coat is an integral part of every manicure.  I keeps my nails more sturdy as well as extending the life of my nail polish.  Would definately recommend for anyone who wants their nails protected.</li>
            <li> This is a TERRIBLE top coat!  It is almost worst than using nothing.  As a base coat, it did keep the fingernail polish color from staining my nails, but as a top coat, it did nothing to protect the polish from chips, scratches or wearing off quickly.  SAVE YOUR MONEY!  There are much better products out there!</li>
