    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Very happy.</li>
            <li>The best cologne I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>You are 1000% better on purchasing this item in the store !!!</li>
            <li>product is great, but the seller isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>he loves it when people ask what cologne he is wearing and he says: &amp;#34;Antonio&amp;#34; with an accent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exactly how it was advertised, shipped on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li>He loved the thought and that he got to smell it again.</li>
            <li>My dad loved it.  </li>
            <li>My husband used them more 8 years .</li>
            <li>Absolutely my favorite scent for my husband.</li>
            <li>But I rigged it to be able to spray.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my fav cologne so not too many complaints.</li>
            <li>Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my boyfriend as it is one of his favorite fragances</li>
            <li>Going to order more for him.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s his favorite cologne</li>
            <li>I might try more from his lineup.</li>
            <li>the women love it,</li>
            <li>Great price and the bottle was bigger than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems as if it&#x27;s harder to get now, and I hope his signature scent isn&#x27;t discontinued, but if so, I&#x27;m stocking up, as this is really a great balance of richness and value.</li>
            <li>By far, hands down, no doubt, this was the first of his many fragrances..and still &amp;#34;the best&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I bought Antonio from Amazon direct and am pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li>I would buy Antonio again and now having success with two of his products</li>
            <li>I have bought this many times and will continue to do so as long as it is available</li>
            <li>Long lasting perfume and smells great.  </li>
            <li>My personal favorite of all I tried and I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>and while he&#x27;s got some great others (The Golden Secret, Mediterraneo come to mind)</li>
            <li>I have had positive comments on this cologne every time I wear it.</li>
            <li>One of the bottles lost its pressure sprayer and really leaked.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Had a few nice comments from people who smelled on me.  </li>
            <li>you made My Honey&#x27;s Christmas extra special by getting this hard-to-find fragrance to me....thank you for your product/services....</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something a little different that not many people know about, but every comments on how good it smells.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent, but the bottle was leaking in the box and the sprayer is broken.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not long lasting.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> it&#x27;s not long lasting.</li>
            <li> Comparing the two, Antonio is a long lasting all day fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Ship in a USPS first-class Grey plastic bag .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sweet or fruity, but musty, manly and romantic.</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t wrong - this is a fantastic, long lasting scent that is complex, yet not overpowering or off putting.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d go with Pine, Lime, Sandlewood, and some other spices that are Mediterranean, but not fruity or beachy.</li>
            <li> I like the Secret equally well, but it is gone in 4 - 5 hours.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunetly the perfumed arrieved broken and half empty, TWICE!</li>
            <li> Sadly, the bottle came in a plastic open and with no cap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe (by me anyway)</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s discontinued and hard to find.</li>
            <li> some of his are just so so ,at least with my chemistry.</li>
            <li> and lately we couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere</li>
            <li> I have another Antonio Banderas fragrance, the Secret.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> This was the worst shipped products I have ever seen in my life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought others that were outrageously priced.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Bottle was cheap and spray cap came broken it wont even stay on to spray it I would never buy again</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband, he loves the smell but unfortunetly the perfumed arrieved broken and half empty, TWICE! It might have to do with the packaging. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I ordered a bottle of this after reading about Banderas foray into the fragarence world, and how this won several design awards. They weren&#x27;t wrong - this is a fantastic, long lasting scent that is complex, yet not overpowering or off putting. It&#x27;s hard to describe (by me anyway) but I&#x27;d go with Pine, Lime, Sandlewood, and some other spices that are Mediterranean, but not fruity or beachy. It&#x27;s really solid, and well priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It got me to try his entire line (except Diavolo...yet) and while he&#x27;s got some great others (The Golden Secret, Mediterraneo come to mind) some of his are just so so ,at least with my chemistry. But this...this is the one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems as if it&#x27;s harder to get now, and I hope his signature scent isn&#x27;t discontinued, but if so, I&#x27;m stocking up, as this is really a great balance of richness and value.</li>
            <li> My husband used them more 8 years . Thank.</li>
            <li> Package was not in a box, did not have a cap on either bottle, leaked in the bubble wrap they were in.  One of the bottles lost its pressure sprayer and really leaked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is great, but the seller isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> HUELE MUY BIEN. ME GUSTA.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted , this fragances brings me memories from my homeland .&lt;br /&gt;Just the the same cologne as I used to wear back home.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> Absolutely my favorite scent for my husband. I have bought this many times and will continue to do so as long as it is available</li>
            <li> I love the scent, but the bottle was leaking in the box and the sprayer is broken. But I rigged it to be able to spray. It&#x27;s my fav cologne so not too many complaints.</li>
            <li> Long lasting perfume and smells great.  Had a few nice comments from people who smelled on me.  I bought a 3.4 oz. bottle before, but now can not find the larger size.  So I bought this 1 OZ. bottle.  I am still looking for the larger size bottle to buy.</li>
            <li> My brother loves this scent. So I spoiled him this year and went a-searching. Thank you Amazon- he loves it when people ask what cologne he is wearing and he says: &amp;#34;Antonio&amp;#34; with an accent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exactly how it was advertised, shipped on time and in good condition. Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend as it is one of his favorite fragances but it&#x27;s discontinued and hard to find. He loved the thought and that he got to smell it again. Sadly, the bottle came in a plastic open and with no cap. Also the scent it&#x27;s not long lasting.</li>
            <li> Great price and the bottle was bigger than I thought it would be.  My dad loved it.  Going to order more for him. It&#x27;s his favorite cologne and lately we couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere and Amazon had it.  Very happy. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have another Antonio Banderas fragrance, the Secret.  Comparing the two, Antonio is a long lasting all day fragrance.  I&#x27;m getting 12 hours.  My cologne technique is two pumps. I like the Secret equally well, but it is gone in 4 - 5 hours.  I bought Antonio from Amazon direct and am pleased with the product.  I cannot describe scent and have no way of knowing if you&#x27;ll like the scent, but I do.  I would buy Antonio again and now having success with two of his products I might try more from his lineup.</li>
            <li> This was the worst shipped products I have ever seen in my life. This is supposed to be 1. in a box 2.wrap properly 3. ships in a well-organized box BUT NO It came just as an open perfume Wrapped in a dinky one layer bubble wrap. Ship in a USPS first-class Grey plastic bag . Just to add it isn&#x27;t even the proper size I ordered. You are 1000% better on purchasing this item in the store !!!</li>
            <li> The best cologne I&#x27;ve ever tried. I&#x27;ve bought others that were outrageously priced. Compared to this cologne they were nothing. I have had positive comments on this cologne every time I wear it. One spray will last all day and linger. My personal favorite of all I tried and I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something a little different that not many people know about, but every comments on how good it smells.  This is your ticket.  It&#x27;s not sweet or fruity, but musty, manly and romantic.</li>
            <li> By far, hands down, no doubt, this was the first of his many fragrances..and still &amp;#34;the best&#x27;. the women love it,</li>
            <li> ....you made My Honey&#x27;s Christmas extra special by getting this hard-to-find fragrance to me....thank you for your product/services....</li>
