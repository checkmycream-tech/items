            <li>For this price I guess it is ok.</li>
            <li>This combination couldn&#x27;t be smoother, nor more efficient.</li>
            <li>Great delivery, do not wear out fast.</li>
            <li>THIS IS A NICE PRODUCT GOOD FOR SENSITIVE TEETH.I</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s easy, clean, efficient - just a breeze!</li>
            <li>a soft toothbrush is EXCELLENT because you can really cram it against your teeth without pain and the bristles get in between.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it is as good as any high quality oral B products</li>
            <li>works great for sensitive gums,  but these can be bought just as easily and quickly from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.  </li>
            <li>I have to hold them under very hot water just before using to make the bristles more pliable.</li>
            <li>They are gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>It is so much better than the cheap ones, it is in a class by itself, and worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>Plus, Oral-B makes a far superior product to Sonacare.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive gums and this brush is consistently good over the years.</li>
            <li>Ok listen up Oral B electric brushes really work great, and taking care of our teeth is of primary concern for me, After all we only get one set</li>
            <li>How excited can you get over a tooth brush?</li>
            <li>Clean well and dont hurt my gums.</li>
            <li>This is a good quality rechargeable brush and these heads definitely get her teeth clean.</li>
            <li>i surely reccomend the item, it doesn&#x27;t hurt the gum and cleans very well...</li>
            <li>and they love them, definitely helps them to clean their teeth better.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>Just what the dentist suggested, and a better price than I could find in the retail stores near me, providing that I include it in an order that gets free shipping</li>
            <li>Got my brush heads quick.</li>
            <li>Now for the brush heads itself, its a great investment especially for new users like myself for the electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Love the soft bristles, which is was my dentist recommended.</li>
            <li>That pays for the toothbrush pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Really getting teeth clean.</li>
            <li>Full price, not so much.  </li>
            <li>These same heads would have cost me $7 - $10 more elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Better price than at local Walgreens or Walmart.  </li>
            <li>Same price and even better</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Everyone should be using an electric toothbrush, they&#x27;re much more efficient than regular toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I have been able to cut back from cleanings three times a year to twice a year.</li>
            <li>they are the same as the ones that sell for much more.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>AT FIRST TIME ORDERED IT BUT SEEM LOST MAIL</li>
            <li>NOT HAVE TO WORRY TO GET BACK ON AMAZON FOR BUY MORE</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t have a problem with the fit and is not harsh on my gum</li>
            <li>Oral-B Pro-Health For Me Sensitive Clean Brush.</li>
            <li>I like them because they are soft and for me they are better for my gums and sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel like glass after a polishing with these super soft bristles.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend third party brush heads as they break very quickly.</li>
            <li>Cannot fine these locally.</li>
            <li>so I need a gentle brush.</li>
            <li>Same product as I can buy from the supermarket, but end up basically getting one for free.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>But these are very overpriced, everywhere, not just Amazon.</li>
            <li>everything else is just an mamtation, and when your Dentist gets involved it can really cost.</li>
            <li>Personally I felt my gums would almost bleed using the floss action, although this brush heads made brushing more bearable.</li>
            <li>We love these and having them delivered on a regular basis keeps us from using old brush heads.</li>
            <li>Also I enjoy the different colored bands in the bottom of the brush head, made it easier for us to distinguish which was which, so excellent product with a somewhat bad packaging.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S COMES TO ME IN BRAND NEW CONDITION AND FAST MAIL</li>
            <li>This works just fine as expected.</li>
            <li>My Oral B Professional electric toothbrush has really improved my dental checkups.</li>
            <li>These are soft and hold up very well&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li>Fortunately no harm done, although the plastic packaging could&#x27;ve been better.</li>
            <li>These brush heads are much better than the terribly harsh one on my new brush.</li>
            <li>Bought these to go with my new Oral-B Pro-Health Rechargeable Toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Oral B PRO 3000 with soft, gentle bristles allows a thorough teeth cleanse over sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>My teeth are very sensitive so this is what I buy.  </li>
            <li>I have LOTS of gum problems, and this soft brush (with the toothbrush on low) lets me really brush much longer.  </li>
            <li>My 19 month old loves it!  </li>
            <li>Bleeding in my mouth has completely stopped since I started using these soft-headed refills for my electric toothbrush!  </li>
            <li>These small heads are so much better than any brushes</li>
            <li>It is fine but obviously not original Braun brush head.</li>
            <li>The Oral B toothbrush is easier to keep clean than the previous brand I tried, too.</li>
            <li>I did buy a variety of brush heads for it and trade about frequently.</li>
            <li>Although they are labeled for sensitive teeth/gums, I&#x27;d prefer if they were a bit softer.  </li>
            <li>My gums are sensitive</li>
            <li>For one thing, they don&#x27;t make a sensitive floss brush head that I have found.</li>
            <li>I ordered these because I thought they would be softer than the ones I have for sensitive teeth  </li>
            <li>I like that these are still compatible with my 4+ year old electric brush.</li>
            <li>Advised my dental cleaning tech that I was using this sensitive brush</li>
            <li>Winner for young ones.</li>
            <li>My dentist recommends soft.</li>
            <li>Expected the brush heads to be colorful with a Frozen theme.</li>
            <li>Better than the generic brands, which are stiff and can damage gums.</li>
            <li>internal mechanism is long lasting (unlike generic imitations) and will outlast the bristles for sure.  </li>
            <li>First off, shipping came as expected, although the packaging itself was a bit in tatters for the brush heads.</li>
            <li>My 7 year old, 5 year old and 2 year old (he tries) like to use them.</li>
            <li>But apparently, it&#x27;s just the packaging.</li>
            <li>Same as extra soft Adult Oral B heads.</li>
            <li>They are the same as the ones for sensitive teeth that Oral B sells  </li>
            <li>I wish Oral B would offer extra sensitive brushes.</li>
            <li>I then sometimes keep the old brush heads after their useful dental service is done, just to use for hobby applications and other small household cleaning tasks because the mechanism lasts so well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used the sensitive version due to having sensitive teeth/gums, the only drawback is they perhaps don&#x27;t last as long.</li>

            <li> We love these and having them delivered on a regular basis keeps us from using old brush heads.</li>
            <li> Also I enjoy the different colored bands in the bottom of the brush head, made it easier for us to distinguish which was which, so excellent product with a somewhat bad packaging.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S COMES TO ME IN BRAND NEW CONDITION AND FAST MAIL</li>
            <li> This works just fine as expected.</li>
            <li> My Oral B Professional electric toothbrush has really improved my dental checkups.</li>
            <li> These are soft and hold up very well&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li> Fortunately no harm done, although the plastic packaging could&#x27;ve been better.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are much better than the terribly harsh one on my new brush.</li>
            <li> Bought these to go with my new Oral-B Pro-Health Rechargeable Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Oral B PRO 3000 with soft, gentle bristles allows a thorough teeth cleanse over sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> My teeth are very sensitive so this is what I buy.  </li>
            <li> I have LOTS of gum problems, and this soft brush (with the toothbrush on low) lets me really brush much longer.  </li>
            <li> My 19 month old loves it!  </li>
            <li> Bleeding in my mouth has completely stopped since I started using these soft-headed refills for my electric toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> These small heads are so much better than any brushes</li>
            <li> It is fine but obviously not original Braun brush head.</li>
            <li> The Oral B toothbrush is easier to keep clean than the previous brand I tried, too.</li>
            <li> I did buy a variety of brush heads for it and trade about frequently.</li>
            <li> Although they are labeled for sensitive teeth/gums, I&#x27;d prefer if they were a bit softer.  </li>
            <li> My gums are sensitive</li>
            <li> For one thing, they don&#x27;t make a sensitive floss brush head that I have found.</li>
            <li> I ordered these because I thought they would be softer than the ones I have for sensitive teeth  </li>
            <li> I like that these are still compatible with my 4+ year old electric brush.</li>
            <li> Advised my dental cleaning tech that I was using this sensitive brush</li>
            <li> Winner for young ones.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommends soft.</li>
            <li> Expected the brush heads to be colorful with a Frozen theme.</li>
            <li> Better than the generic brands, which are stiff and can damage gums.</li>
            <li> internal mechanism is long lasting (unlike generic imitations) and will outlast the bristles for sure.  </li>
            <li> First off, shipping came as expected, although the packaging itself was a bit in tatters for the brush heads.</li>
            <li> My 7 year old, 5 year old and 2 year old (he tries) like to use them.</li>
            <li> But apparently, it&#x27;s just the packaging.</li>
            <li> Same as extra soft Adult Oral B heads.</li>
            <li> They are the same as the ones for sensitive teeth that Oral B sells  </li>
            <li> I wish Oral B would offer extra sensitive brushes.</li>
            <li> I then sometimes keep the old brush heads after their useful dental service is done, just to use for hobby applications and other small household cleaning tasks because the mechanism lasts so well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used the sensitive version due to having sensitive teeth/gums, the only drawback is they perhaps don&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> Oral-B products area high quality products, but a little pricey.</li>
            <li> These brushes last a long while, and don&#x27;t damage my gums.</li>
            <li> These are not soft enough.  </li>
            <li> they last as long as they say too.</li>
            <li> They are a little harder than soft brushes, but still much less less than the normal Oral-B brush heads.</li>
            <li> Not sure if they will work for people with sensitive teeth or gums.</li>
            <li> I use four per year, and the fourth one usually becomes number one in the following year.</li>
            <li> The sensitive heads are recommended by my Dental Hygienist because I tend to brush too hard and this protects the enamel on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Not much to say, but they work.</li>
            <li> I will never use any other.</li>
            <li> Have tried other heads, not Oral B brand and have regretted it.  </li>
            <li> so I cannot use in my country what a waste.</li>
            <li> I was shocked when I first turned it on</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you time on less expensive knock offs.  </li>
            <li> You cannot brush too hard, it will pause itself until you ease up, so there is no chance of damage to your teeth.  </li>
            <li> The price is ridiculous though for what your getting.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t handle any of the other brush heads, they&#x27;re too hard &amp; painful.  </li>
            <li> I hope she is wrong.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Better than the generic brands, which are stiff and can damage gums.</li>
            <li> I thought I had used an electric tooth brush before, but believe me they were NOTHING like the Oral B.  I was shocked when I first turned it on and it took off like a power saw.  You cannot brush too hard, it will pause itself until you ease up, so there is no chance of damage to your teeth.  It is so much better than the cheap ones, it is in a class by itself, and worth every penny.  I will never use any other. I did buy a variety of brush heads for it and trade about frequently. Different ones do different types of cleaning, and all are labeled to help you choose which you want to use that day.</li>
            <li> Clean well and dont hurt my gums.</li>
            <li> These same heads would have cost me $7 - $10 more elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Better price than at local Walgreens or Walmart.  Although they are labeled for sensitive teeth/gums, I&#x27;d prefer if they were a bit softer.  I have to hold them under very hot water just before using to make the bristles more pliable.</li>
            <li> Excellent customer sevice</li>
            <li> works great for sensitive gums,  but these can be bought just as easily and quickly from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.  Same price and even better if you use the 20% coupon</li>
            <li> Gift I did not use them .</li>
            <li> Bought these to go with my new Oral-B Pro-Health Rechargeable Toothbrush. I like them because they are soft and for me they are better for my gums and sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Great product very soft on your gums!!</li>
            <li> Item arrived in good condition</li>
            <li> First off, shipping came as expected, although the packaging itself was a bit in tatters for the brush heads. Fortunately no harm done, although the plastic packaging could&#x27;ve been better. Now for the brush heads itself, its a great investment especially for new users like myself for the electric toothbrushes. Personally I felt my gums would almost bleed using the floss action, although this brush heads made brushing more bearable. Also I enjoy the different colored bands in the bottom of the brush head, made it easier for us to distinguish which was which, so excellent product with a somewhat bad packaging.</li>
            <li> Oral-B Pro-Health For Me Sensitive Clean Brush. wonderfully tool, can be used to massage the gums properly without making them bleed. a soft toothbrush is EXCELLENT because you can really cram it against your teeth without pain and the bristles get in between. My teeth feel like glass after a polishing with these super soft bristles.</li>
            <li> Good product, meets my expectations and the price is also reasonable.</li>
            <li> Perfect for sensitive teeth/gums.  I had tried the &#x27;regular&#x27; brushes, however they were much too harsh.  I have LOTS of gum problems, and this soft brush (with the toothbrush on low) lets me really brush much longer.  I am very satisfied and my gums are happy campers!</li>
            <li> Cannot fine these locally. Thanks!</li>
            <li> After trying (and failing miserably to save money) a few &amp;#34;off-brand&amp;#34; replacements heads for my Oral B, I realized that in this instance you get what you pay for.  The sensitive heads are recommended by my Dental Hygienist because I tend to brush too hard and this protects the enamel on my teeth.  These heads are a perfect fit and because everyone should replace their toothbrush every three months, no worries about these wearing out.  The colored bands are a bonus in the case of multiple users.</li>
            <li> Have tried other heads, not Oral B brand and have regretted it.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Works great, its a fantastic product. Everyone should be using an electric toothbrush, they&#x27;re much more efficient than regular toothbrushes. Plus, Oral-B makes a far superior product to Sonacare.</li>
            <li> Oral-B always makes great products!</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes.  They work well.</li>
            <li> Not the same brushhead that came with the power toothbrush</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you time on less expensive knock offs.  Have used both and Oral-B brand fits like its supposed to and wears well.</li>
            <li> Excellent product&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with it&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely recommend</li>
            <li> I was glad to find this here at a good price. I&#x27;ve been using oral b for a while and love it.</li>
            <li> You are supposed to replace your toothbrush regularly. My gums are sensitive so I need a gentle brush. My Oral B Professional electric toothbrush has really improved my dental checkups. I have been able to cut back from cleanings three times a year to twice a year. That pays for the toothbrush pretty quickly. The Oral B toothbrush is easier to keep clean than the previous brand I tried, too. These brushes last a long while, and don&#x27;t damage my gums.</li>
            <li> Been using these for the last 5 or so years.  Can&#x27;t handle any of the other brush heads, they&#x27;re too hard &amp; painful.  These do the job perfectly.</li>
            <li> Not much to say, but they work. They are a little harder than soft brushes, but still much less less than the normal Oral-B brush heads. Not sure if they will work for people with sensitive teeth or gums.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive gums and this brush is consistently good over the years. Still overpriced but I find the cheaper ones catch on my lips. My dentist said Oral B plans to stop making these and only sell the floss brush heads. I hope she is wrong. For one thing, they don&#x27;t make a sensitive floss brush head that I have found.</li>
            <li> Love these brush replacements. Best price around too!</li>
            <li> I have had an Oral B electric toothbrush for years and this is what I like when it comes to a good cleaning.  My teeth are very sensitive so this is what I buy.  I have never had a problem so...they work for me..!!</li>
            <li> Just what the dentist told me to order. Work great.</li>
            <li> Great value for the heads! These work great and have kept me cavity free.</li>
            <li> These work great with the oral-b vitality</li>
            <li> Same product as I can buy from the supermarket, but end up basically getting one for free. 5 stars for the price saving. I&#x27;ve always used the sensitive version due to having sensitive teeth/gums, the only drawback is they perhaps don&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> To me, the brush did not reach the crevices between teeth. Otherwise, it is as good as any high quality oral B products</li>
            <li> Expected the brush heads to be colorful with a Frozen theme. But apparently, it&#x27;s just the packaging. Inside, they&#x27;re just regular brush heads.</li>
            <li> Same as extra soft Adult Oral B heads. Great price at the time. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It is fine but obviously not original Braun brush head. For this price I guess it is ok. I haven&#x27;t tested it extensively yet though.</li>
            <li> Nothing kiddie about these...they are the same as the ones that sell for much more.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are much better than the terribly harsh one on my new brush.</li>
            <li> purchased these for backup for tooth brush. dentist said to use the softest brush possible. great buy</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.  Description as advertised.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> The heads for the toothbrush work like they are suppose to, but there is not a frozen character on the brush heads. Which is disappointing to the kids</li>
            <li> it is a must if someone suffers from sensitivity gums... i surely reccomend the item, it doesn&#x27;t hurt the gum and cleans very well...</li>
            <li> Oral-B products area high quality products, but a little pricey.</li>
            <li> How excited can you get over a tooth brush?</li>
            <li> These are not soft enough.  They are the same as the ones for sensitive teeth that Oral B sells  I ordered these because I thought they would be softer than the ones I have for sensitive teeth  I wish Oral B would offer extra sensitive brushes.</li>
            <li> Brush heads are great. I like that these are still compatible with my 4+ year old electric brush. The price is ridiculous though for what your getting. I do not recommend third party brush heads as they break very quickly. But these are very overpriced, everywhere, not just Amazon.</li>
            <li> Good choice for the excellent tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Great price and cleans teeth well</li>
            <li> excellent for very sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> Just what the dentist suggested, and a better price than I could find in the retail stores near me, providing that I include it in an order that gets free shipping&lt;br /&gt;The internal mechanism is long lasting (unlike generic imitations) and will outlast the bristles for sure.  I then sometimes keep the old brush heads after their useful dental service is done, just to use for hobby applications and other small household cleaning tasks because the mechanism lasts so well.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought these several times, and will do so again.</li>
            <li> Advised my dental cleaning tech that I was using this sensitive brush and she was happy with the selection and now hat makes two of usðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> good product wish I had got years ago</li>
            <li> My 19 month old loves it!  He didn&#x27;t want anything to do with his regular toothbrush he wanted ours so we got him this one !</li>
            <li> I purchased these for brushing my 2 year olds teeth with our Oral-B brush. It has worked awesomely. Dentist even asked what we were doing cause her teeth looked so good. Winner for young ones.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 13-year-old granddaughter who has braces.  She likes them.</li>
            <li> Ok listen up Oral B electric brushes really work great, and taking care of our teeth is of primary concern for me, After all we only get one set everything else is just an mamtation, and when your Dentist gets involved it can really cost. Best advice is to take care of our teeth brush every day twice if you can, I do it.</li>
            <li> These brushes with great on my daughter&#x27;s tooth brush. This is a good quality rechargeable brush and these heads definitely get her teeth clean.</li>
            <li> These are excellent if you have gum disease and need to get to the bottom of the gumline to clean.  My periodentist recommended them to use with my Braun Electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fits perfect, works great.  And a great value too.</li>
            <li> Oral B PRO 3000 with soft, gentle bristles allows a thorough teeth cleanse over sensitive gums. I use aurom&amp;egrave;re&#x27;s aryuvedic herbal toothpaste, followed by aurom&amp;egrave;re&#x27;s neem &amp; peelu herbal mouthwash. This combination couldn&#x27;t be smoother, nor more efficient. This beats a toothbrush any day ðŸ˜ƒ It&#x27;s easy, clean, efficient - just a breeze!</li>
            <li> Good service and great  product</li>
            <li> Great product.  If you watch for Amazon price drops and combine with a clickable coupon, these are a great deal vs retail.  Full price, not so much.  Love the soft bristles, which is was my dentist recommended.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Bleeding in my mouth has completely stopped since I started using these soft-headed refills for my electric toothbrush!  Give them a try and find out for yourself how your mouth reacts.</li>
            <li> This works just fine as expected.</li>
            <li> Good replacement for my son&#x27;s brush. Will last for a while.</li>
            <li> Got my brush heads quick. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I cant write a review of this oral B pro health because I brought this item I did not check the voltage 110 volt, my country use 220 volt so I cannot use in my country what a waste.</li>
            <li> Good deal !!! These small heads are so much better than any brushes</li>
            <li> this is a wonderful bargain for those who own and use an Oral B toothbrush.  These are soft and hold up very well&lt;br /&gt;for those who use a spin brush.  The three pack is perfect and the cost is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A NICE PRODUCT GOOD FOR SENSITIVE TEETH.I WILL BUY IT AGAIN .THE MACHINE GOES WITH THIS ITEM IS GOOD TOO. IT&#x27;S COMES TO ME IN BRAND NEW CONDITION AND FAST MAIL AFTER I DIDN&#x27;T GET ITEM AT FIRST TIME ORDERED IT BUT SEEM LOST MAIL OR WHAT BUT AFTER ALL I GET IT NOW. I BOUGHT ONE BEFORE JUST START USE IT AND THIS IS MY SECOND ORDER FOR BACK UP IN CASE I NEED USE NOT HAVE TO WORRY TO GET BACK ON AMAZON FOR BUY MORE BUT TAKE TIME TO WAIT MAIL COME TO ME.I&#x27;M TESTING ON IT FOR MY TEETH FEELING COMFORTABLE BETTER THAN HAND BRUSH TEETH .</li>
            <li> Great delivery, do not wear out fast.</li>
            <li> It does its job and does not hurt my gum.</li>
            <li> Very good product, but a bit pricey for what they are.</li>
            <li> According to my dentist, these are the only heads to get for brushing your teeth. They get your teeth clean without doing any damage to the enamel, and they do the best job of massaging your gums. If you press when you brush, another no-no, these heads will help aleviate the pressure.  All I know is they feel good when I use my toothbrush. Just on that, I&#x27;m a repeat buyer. they last as long as they say too. I use four per year, and the fourth one usually becomes number one in the following year. Good brush heads.</li>
            <li> good price and no issues</li>
            <li> Bought these for the oral B battery handles that my kids have and they love them, definitely helps them to clean their teeth better. My 7 year old, 5 year old and 2 year old (he tries) like to use them.</li>
            <li> Great quality. works nicely on my gums. i don&#x27;t even have to press. just let the brush do the work</li>
            <li> We love these and having them delivered on a regular basis keeps us from using old brush heads.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommends soft. I get a good cleaning and these are designed to get into the crevasses between your teeth. These are excellent brushes. They are also relatively expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When your done brushing your mouth should feel clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t forget to floss!</li>
            <li> Really getting teeth clean. A great value too.</li>
            <li> Good price and easy on the gums.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have a problem with the fit and is not harsh on my gum</li>
            <li> These are the greatest. They are gentle and effective. I would recommended them for everyone.</li>
