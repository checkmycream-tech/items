            <li>Very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>Big and shiny and perfect.</li>
            <li>I love this mirror.  </li>

            <li>I love this compact.</li>
            <li>When I did this upon its arrival I found that the top mirror was not attached.</li>

            <li>right?!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a problem with the magnification I&#x27;m able to see my face very well.  </li>
            <li>so this fit right in with my style.  </li>
            <li>This mirror puts you in mind of the old Hollywood glamour; the type of mirror that Betty Davis or Marilyn Monroe would carry in their purse.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, someone loved my mirror just as much as I did and stole it from me</li>
            <li>Wish somebody would make a pretty 10X mag mirror!</li>
            <li>I own several of these mirrors don&#x27;t know what I did without them.</li>
            <li>very much like the gorgeous large compacts from back in the glamour movie days.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a travel mirror with light (that worked) and was large enough to see more of my face.  </li>
            <li>Shipping on the the items I buy are WAY too high..is my only complaint..and that has NOT one thing to do with this lovely compact.</li>
            <li>Not a problem for me because I am very fond of my hot glue gun.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s large for a clutch, but fits well into a shoulder bag.  </li>
            <li>Them irror is cheaply made, so I&#x27;m sending it back.  </li>
            <li>too much mgnification</li>
            <li>and I have only had it a few weeks, but so far so good!  </li>
            <li>Old fashion glam feel to this pretty compact.&lt;br</li>
            <li>was very old and had just given up.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a little large, but will fit nicely in my larger handbags.</li>
            <li>I heard an unexpected click as I opened it and one of the mirrors fell out.  </li>
            <li>The mirror is large and the lighting in fastastic especailly in dark places.  </li>
            <li>The only positives about this mirror are that it is pretty and a nice size, but it is entirely useless as a magnifying mirror because its round shape distorts the reflection so much it is impossible to clearly see your own face.</li>
            <li>Its a little on the large side.</li>
            <li>It was heavy enough and large enough.</li>

            <li> Big and shiny and perfect. I am going to get this beautiful compact engraved for my daughter. She will treasure this for years or until she loses it, well you know how kids can be. I am going to order one for myself in a different color.</li>
            <li> This is, to me, the perfect size and is well made.  I can see to apply my make up properly.  My only complaint is: I ordered a pink mirror but a black one came instead.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror.  It fits in my purse and i can see what i need to see without my glasses.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful mirror.  It&#x27;s large for a clutch, but fits well into a shoulder bag.  I love the 10x mirror!</li>
            <li> Seems to be a big problem with this item as other reviewers spoke about how one of the mirror was loose when the box was opened, too.  I&#x27;m returning it for that reason and because when I bought it, I thought it was the lighted one.  It is not and I can&#x27;t justify paying almost $20 for an unlighted, broken compact mirror.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and I know she will love it....I do! I must say that I am not crazy about magnifying my face at this stage of the game by ten times..but hey...if I can get things to look good at THAT magnification...then I will look GREAT to everyone else right?! Ha ha! It is very large and fits beautifully in the palm of ones&#x27; hand....very much like the gorgeous large compacts from back in the glamour movie days.</li>
            <li> The pink color is atrocious.  Them irror is cheaply made, so I&#x27;m sending it back.  Wish somebody would make a pretty 10X mag mirror!</li>
            <li> Use at home, use for travel.  For those of us whose eyesight is not what it used to be...this is a compact, not too pricey, and convenient mirror.</li>
            <li> arrived broken and should&#x27;ve returned it. glass on inside was not attached, like the glue  holding it on was very old and had just given up.</li>
            <li> I used this compact mirror for 4 months and was satisfied with it.  UNTIL 2 DAYS AGO.  I heard an unexpected click as I opened it and one of the mirrors fell out.  The glue bond between the mirror and the plastic compact casing lost its holding power.  And the mirror fell on the floor and broke.  I think this product should have lasted more than 4 months!!</li>
            <li> I have 4 of these. Take one everywhere. Mirror is very clear and not distorted like other 10x ones</li>
            <li> horrible product  magnifying mirror too much mgnification&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;returned product  would not reccomend to anyone  product not described acurately pm website</li>
            <li> Purchased in black.  Plan on returning.  Light doesn&#x27;t work.  Too small.  Very unhappy. I was looking for a travel mirror with light (that worked) and was large enough to see more of my face.  also, can&#x27;t stand it up, have to hold it.  I suppose if you wanted to tote it in your purse (and didn&#x27;t care about a light that worked) it would suffice.</li>
            <li> The only positives about this mirror are that it is pretty and a nice size, but it is entirely useless as a magnifying mirror because its round shape distorts the reflection so much it is impossible to clearly see your own face.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this mirror. I&#x27;m a trendy fashionable gal so this fit right in with my style.  The mirror is large and the lighting in fastastic especailly in dark places.  I don&#x27;t have a problem with the magnification I&#x27;m able to see my face very well.  Each time I would pull it out I would receive rave reviews and comments.  This mirror puts you in mind of the old Hollywood glamour; the type of mirror that Betty Davis or Marilyn Monroe would carry in their purse.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, someone loved my mirror just as much as I did and stole it from me but I was able to reorder another. Girls, this mirror is functional and a head turner.  You won&#x27;t go wrong by ordering this mirror. Step out into glamour!</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made.  Upon receipt, the mirror that was glued to compact was loose. Very obvious it would not last.</li>
            <li> This is so nice.  It doesn&#x27;t get rough treatment and I have only had it a few weeks, but so far so good!  A really nice mirror to have on had.  No plans to drop it..so I consider it a great deal.  Shipping on the the items I buy are WAY too high..is my only complaint..and that has NOT one thing to do with this lovely compact.</li>
            <li> Great item color is good good bang for the buck would buy again nice nice what can I say great</li>
            <li> I use it almost every day.  Convenient purse size although one of the mirrors came unglued shorty after I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to carry in my purse... it&#x27;s a little large, but will fit nicely in my larger handbags.</li>
            <li> I own several of these mirrors don&#x27;t know what I did without them. I got this one for my daughter since she loves pink.</li>
            <li> Good magnifying mirror.  We bought these for all the women in the office and they were happy with them.  Its a little on the large side.</li>
            <li> Looks awesome. One mirror became unglued eventually but will be easy to fix.</li>
            <li> This compact has the feminine quality I like. It was heavy enough and large enough. I love it! Would recommend it to a friend most definatly.</li>
            <li> it looks way better in person! its got a nice weight about it and its pretty sturdy feeling. the mirrors are both great. overall great product, would buy again.</li>
            <li> The mirror is a little big but no complaints.  It is a good magnifier and seems to be well made.  I am glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this compact.
