            <li>But in all fairness I haven&#x27;t used many scrubs anyway.  </li>
            <li>I thouroughly enjoy using both of these for eye treatment care.</li>

            <li> The serum is OK....but just OK....definitely no better than most other products I&#x27;ve tried.  It also sometimes stings....if it meets up with the facial moisturizer (different ones) I have on.  You shouldn&#x27;t have to leave a strip of unmoisturized skin around an eye product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is way too greasy.  I ended up using it on my arms.</li>
            <li> I love this line of product. My only issue is the eye gel that was ordered the container was half empty.</li>
            <li> The pump on the eye serum doesn&#x27;t work.  I did not request a replacement but probably should.  Otherwise, I like the product.</li>
            <li> In Vegas, I managed to avoid the high pressure sales pitch for this $600 wonder cream that came along with my &#x27;free sample&#x27; .  The problem was the stuff really worked.&lt;br /&gt;When I got up to my hotel room I found on Amazon for much less and ordered. Love it. Works great and smells wonderful. I purchased several items in this line and they have all been well worth the money. The day cream is much lighter than the night cream. My skin feels smoother and my kids swear my eyes are more youthful looking.</li>
            <li> This product seems to do what it is supposed to do. I know the company is using high-quality ingredients because my eyes do not itch. I&#x27;ve used many eye creams over the past 40 years and this seems to be a high-end product without spending big bucks.</li>
            <li> I love it. Great price and it works!!</li>
            <li> Highly recomend these products. Use it daily and the difference is very noticeable. It&#x27;s been an excellent products for me and it works</li>

            <li> I like the feeling after I applied, but I about different in my skin we have to wait a little more.</li>
            <li> This product is way too sticky and greasy. I was not happy with it.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to my doctor when he said a cream will not remove dark circles. I like the price though.</li>
            <li> Highly reccomend these products.  I like the option of being able to chose whether I&#x27;m going to apply the serum (which I do in&lt;br /&gt;the morning before a makeup application), or apply the greaseless cream in the evening.  I thouroughly enjoy using both of these for eye treatment care.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. Bought one set for daughter and continue to add other items to my skin care. Noticeable change in the look and feel of my skin. A must buy.</li>
            <li> I love it. Great price and it works!!</li>
            <li> Nice day and night cream ,  the exfoliate is great. Removed all the dry skin off my husband hands and left them smooth. I was already using it for over a year, as it looks the same as the Vine Vera I have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to purchase my second jar of the day cream.  The scrub I really don&#x27;t use often.  I haven&#x27;t seen much difference and like others have said it&#x27;s a little difficult but not impossible to get off.  But in all fairness I haven&#x27;t used many scrubs anyway.  I did like the face cream so much I&#x27;m purchasing night cream this time as well as another bottle.  It looks and feels like it works and I like the smell.</li>
