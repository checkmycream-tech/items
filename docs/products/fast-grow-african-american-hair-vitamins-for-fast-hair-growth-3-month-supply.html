            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a week now and I already notice how soft and shiny my hair is plus I&#x27;ve noticed it getting long.  I definitely recommend this product it&#x27;s a must have!</li>
            <li> Product delivered in good condition. My hair is growing very fast and healthy looking. I have followed instructions everyday and taking 3 pills everyday. I love this product so much, I have ordered 5 bottles since my first order.</li>
            <li> Trying this product and just started so don&#x27;t know how fast it works yet</li>
            <li> My hair was extremely damaged due to perming, hot curling, weaving,wig wearing and you name it just to be projected as a beautiful black diva. I tried hot oil treatment, protein treatments and I still suffered from split ends and breakage for a long time until i tried this product.  Fast grow has recommended continue used for three months and me being the skeptic that i m, i first ordered a one month supply and by week three, i had all the proof i need to order the additional two months. I have minimal split ends and little to no hair breakage and falling outs. I am very empressed with this product!</li>
            <li> This is my first month using the product. I am currently on my second bottle, and I haven&#x27;t really seen any improvements as yet. I have a problem with my hair thinning. I have seen some new growth around my temples, but for the most part I haven&#x27;t really seen the stunning results that  I have read about.</li>
            <li> thanks you i lovethanks you i love it it thanks you i love it thanks you i love itthanks you i love it  thanks you i love it thanks you i love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not satisfied with my experience. Used all three bottles and have seen no improvement in my hair growth. Providing three bottles must have been some marketing plot unfortunately. I feel very mislead and somewhat depressed. Good thing I tried this out on myself before gifting this to a friend that has been dying to grow his hair.</li>
            <li> Been using this for 3 months and I have to say that this product does not work! It&#x27;s a cheap knock off! No hair grew back on my head! Please don&#x27;t try this as it is a waste of your time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously try it , its a wonderful and effective product.. I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it ! I have been using it for about a month . I also use MSM vitamins . People always ask me what I&#x27;m using. I plan on buying some more. I relax my hair with an olive oil relaxer. I wash it with palmer&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner. All of these things are working for me. I noticed my hair is thicker.</li>
            <li> I am African and I suffer from thyroiditis and my hair would not grow as fast as it used to,  so I saw this product and read the reviews and decided to give it a try.  I have seen growth in as little as a month before I finished the first bottle and now I&#x27;m on the second bottle,  this product does work and I am glad I found it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product</li>
            <li> I love these vitamins. I brought them while I was deployed to help with the breakage from the treated water. I also went natural and cut all of my premed hair so I wanted to try something to make it grow faster. My hair grew so long and it was extremely healthy I had no shedding when I brushed threw it. I only used the product for three months and I had about 8- 10 inches of growth in that time frame. I recommend these vitamins for anyone that wants fast and healthy hair growth because it really works</li>
            <li> The fast grow African  American  hair  vitamin is ok. Don&#x27;t  expect  your  hair  to grow  fast.</li>
            <li> Good, exactely what was looking for to buy.</li>
