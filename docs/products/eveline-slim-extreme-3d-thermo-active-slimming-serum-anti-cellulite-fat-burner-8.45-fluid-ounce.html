            <li> I have been using this for about 2 weeks and it is really working. it is definitely smoothing out the areas where I am applying it. It heats up a lot, but is not uncomfortable and it doesn&#x27;t have a displeasing odor. The scent is light and pleasing.</li>
            <li> This products shows results, but you have to be consistent and make sure you exercise and eat healthy. You see results with given time. I&#x27;ve ordered 2nd tube. It&#x27;s just part of my routine.</li>

            <li> I love this product!!! I ordered the item on Sumday and it arrived to me by Friday. This is very different than other creams I&#x27;ve used.

I will definitely order this product again.</li>

            <li> Holy shiz this is hot!!!! will post later to tell if it works......Update, I really love it. But u do need to use it for about a month before you can see the difference but you can see the difference. It also isn&#x27;t quite as hot after the first time you use it. It really helped with my work out. If you put on a shaper over this stuff.....Magic. Its awesome</li>

            <li> Love this product I&#x27;ve tried it with a waist trainer and you can feel the slight burning sensation. I have also tried it without the waist trainer and I can&#x27;t really feel the burning sensation therefore I always put my cream on with the waist trainer in the morning and at night before bed. I have noticed results but apart from putting the cream I&#x27;ve been eating right and exercising.</li>
