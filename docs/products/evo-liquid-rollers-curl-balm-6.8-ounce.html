            <li> This product looks and feels like a cream. It goes on easily, I twist my hair to encourage the curl where it is more wavy and less curly, let it dry and it looks great. Perfect for the high humidity weather. I have tried other products in the past  which have left my hair feeling crunchy, but this feels natural and good.</li>

            <li> This product really reduces frizz and locks in curls beautifully! It gives your hairstyle a polished look. I love it!</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy, thick hair. This product reduces frizz and brings out the natural curls in my hair. I love the smell and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t leave it crunchy like a gel or mousse. I have been using this product for 2 years now and would not use anything else.</li>
