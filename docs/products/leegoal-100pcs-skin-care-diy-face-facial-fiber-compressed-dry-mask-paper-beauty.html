    <ol>
            <li> There were only 92 pieces in my package!</li>
            <li> Kinda hard to use, but does help hold facial products on face. Not bad.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it, its too thick and the material is not so good.</li>
            <li> This is awsome احطها في الماء وتكبر شحن من الصين the shipping took weeks coz its imported from hong kong but it worth it.</li>
            <li> This is my second buying this product. Nicer material than before. The texture of the mask is stronger than  before. LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good in quality, and convenient for me to make mask by myself. The only thing to be considered is that it&#x27;s fast to feel dry, so you need to supplement serum to the mask in about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Disliked it because once I applied product the papers began to shred into strips leaving fibers on my skin to be picked off.  Ugggg!!!</li>
            <li> I mixed honey and lemon and made a mask out of this.  It does feel great on the skin. I even sent some to my sister in Quebec.</li>
            <li> This product is not as same as in pictures, they don&#x27;t have individual package, i tried one, the shape of the mask kind of funny...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the shipping is super fast and the product is awesome . I will buy it again .</li>
            <li> Merchandise looks like picture.  Slow delivery.</li>
            <li> I only have 86 pc in my bag！</li>
            <li> The mask i received is not even the same kind of mask showed in the picture, and the only reason I bought it is because I have used the mask showed in the picture and I want exactly the same thing! So disappointing, but I don&#x27;t feel like to wait another week so i just keep it.</li>
            <li> These masks look like tablets. I wish they were a bit bigger.</li>
            <li> Pro: easy to carry on trips. Cons: They must be thoroughly drenched in order to open up, which uses a lot of product. Once drenched they can easily tear making application hard to control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do work , if you are extra careful and patient. I will finish using mine but will probably not buy again. I cannot recommend highly.</li>
            <li> Great little masks! They are perfect for what I was wanting. They are small and compact and activated by a little water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product (either free or at a discounted price) in exchange for my honest review.

            <li> Great facial masks! I use DIY stuff. Perfect</li>
            <li> I liked them. Perect. They look like&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip:  1. Use Toner.&lt;br /&gt;  2. Rice Water (just rinse out the rice, only keep the water)&lt;br /&gt;  3. Warm up some Chamomile Tea</li>
            <li> Just as advertised and work great with my clay masks.  I received this item to test and review.</li>
            <li> No clear instructions on how to undo the mask for use.  Package was delivery timely.</li>
            <li> Luv these! make mask time soothing. I do hope they come out with more mayber with coconut or aloe fibers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got only 94 not 100!!</li>
            <li> I like to use these mask for everyday moisturizing. It&#x27;s easy. Convenience. Fast. It also work very well  with gel substances, which can give more time before drying. I also like fast delivery.</li>
            <li> this is what I need. I like it. It&#x27;s convenient. Now I can do face mask by myself. . .</li>
            <li> This is deceitful. This product made in China and shipped from China. It&#x27;s made from cheap chemical compressed papers. The package is very different. Be very careful!</li>
            <li> I received the masks in a resealable bag which was helpful.  I had a hard time getting the mask off due to being wrapped in plastic.  I also did have to count to make sure I had the full 100 due to other reviews.  There was no clear instructions just pictures of how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product (either free or at a discounted price) in exchange for my honest review.
