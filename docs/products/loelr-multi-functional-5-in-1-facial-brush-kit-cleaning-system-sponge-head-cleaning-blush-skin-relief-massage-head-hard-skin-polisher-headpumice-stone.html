            <li>Nice item.  </li>
            <li>it is great for skin cleansing and it makes it fun to do so.</li>
            <li>Need to spend more money for a better one.</li>
            <li>This product is a cheap piece of junk!</li>
            <li>going to get a better one.</li>
            <li>hehe :)</li>
            <li>than that I would say get something faster with more power.</li>
            <li>I have barley used this product but the times that I used it I actually enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>It was okay until it stopped working after 5 uses...</li>
            <li>This is one of the most cost efficient facal brushes i have ever come across.</li>
            <li>other wise it is a great product.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use and handle.</li>
            <li>Easy to travel wilth.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting this product to be fantastic.</li>
            <li>Great accessory to have for facial care..</li>
            <li>but I guess that is what you get when you buy the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li>But if you choose to get this facial brush hoping your luck will be better then good luck.</li>
            <li>, I get excited every night to come home just to use this to wash my face</li>
            <li>Overall good product.</li>
            <li>I was lucky to receive it under promotion but my opinion is unbiased.</li>
            <li>the brush is just the right texture for my face..</li>
            <li>Others wrote it worked fine, but I cant possibly see how if it cant even clean your face.</li>
            <li>This thing is so cheaply made that you can&#x27;t even clean your face properly, I had to end up washing my face with a wash cloth!</li>
            <li>I was debating buying one of the higher end brands.. as I heard it did wonders, but I&#x27;ve just graduated college and with all my student loans etc, it didn&#x27;t seem like the brightest idea.</li>
            <li>YES the batteries were new and tried two different sets :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t spin very well.  </li>
            <li>It really felt like I was getting a &amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The power behind this is not that great</li>
            <li>I had put a new battery in on the first day.</li>
            <li>I used the high setting and the manufacturer who made this brush must have been high, if they think that is a high setting!</li>
            <li>Overall the facial brush kit was okay</li>
            <li>Could have a little more power.</li>
            <li>really makes my face soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even the high speed is not even as fast and strong as my low speed on my old facial brush by Conair.&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>i want a new one.</li>
            <li>You would think the batteries were dying, or that it was time to just buy a new one.</li>
            <li>I can now gently clean or exfoliate my face without being to rough.</li>
            <li>It worked the first time I used it, but the next day it would not spin continuously.</li>
            <li>I just tried it yesterday and my skin felt as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>5 replaceable soft bristle brush heads meet your all kinds of need: Nylon Brush, Soft Brush, Massor, Pumice Stone,</li>
            <li>was nice but not impressed with speed of rotation even with new batteries.</li>
            <li>This item is pretty small and has no power; Pretty much on low setting you have to push it with your finger so it can start to spin.</li>
            <li>The high setting is even slower than a low setting on a $100.00 facial brush.</li>
            <li>Works but very slow rotation, will take longer to clean my pores!</li>
            <li>deep &amp;#34; clean, and a small face massage at the same time!</li>
            <li>If you are looking for an everyday use one, I recommend paying an extra 10 dollars and buying a full size one from toilet tree.  </li>
            <li>It would spin a little with gentle pressure against my face, but intermitently</li>

            <li> /&gt;The only reason i gave this 4 stars is because it does not come with a storage box like the other model sold else</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It takes double A batteries not triple A as described&lt;br /&gt;There is no adapter for rechargeable batteries.as described in the ad&lt;br /&gt;The electric motor is not very strong</li>

            <li> Not very powerful.</li>
            <li> Smaller that I expected, but not too small.</li>
            <li> and if you push at all on your face, it slows down how it spins.  </li>
            <li> When i got it thr bristles in the brush were bent to where there was like a chunk missing...</li>
            <li> I use this thing EVERYday.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an inexpensive cleanser that would take my makeup off and remove dead skin without paying $200...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not fantastic</li>
            <li> would not recommend this item to anyone... unless to a person i don&#x27;t like and want them to waste money.</li>
            <li> WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li> , I have arthritis and it can hard sometimes trying to handle a washcloth when your hands hurt.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very slow has no real power behind it</li>
            <li> However I figured it would at least get the job done.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s why they complained.</li>
            <li> such a disappointment</li>
            <li> I put new batteries in, and the power is horrible.</li>
            <li> Not impressed</li>
            <li> Bad bad bad bad!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works just as good as the $200. ones.</li>
            <li> It worked the first time I used it, but the next day it would not spin continuously. I had put a new battery in on the first day. It would spin a little with gentle pressure against my face, but intermitently</li>
            <li> great gift so they told me</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t spin very well.  Need to spend more money for a better one.</li>
            <li> Bad bad bad bad! It stopped working, no power, i&#x27;m upset. i want a new one.</li>
            <li> The item is not as described in Amazon ad&lt;br /&gt;It takes double A batteries not triple A as described&lt;br /&gt;There is no adapter for rechargeable batteries.as described in the ad&lt;br /&gt;The electric motor is not very strong</li>
            <li> for the price, its alright, but i expected it to spin faster and harder than it does</li>
            <li> I am not a picky person at all. I know you get what you pay for, so I was not expecting this product to be fantastic. However I figured it would at least get the job done. This product is a cheap piece of junk! I put new batteries in, and the power is horrible. If you apply just a little pressure on your face like you are suppose to with a facial brush it barely spins! You would think the batteries were dying, or that it was time to just buy a new one. I used the high setting and the manufacturer who made this brush must have been high, if they think that is a high setting! The high setting is even slower than a low setting on a $100.00 facial brush. Don&#x27;t even try using the low setting, it won&#x27;t even spin if you just put it on your face. This thing is so cheaply made that you can&#x27;t even clean your face properly, I had to end up washing my face with a wash cloth! This reminds me of something you would purchase at a dollar store! I hope this review helps anyone thinking about buying this product. It&#x27;s truly not worth it, I&#x27;m an open minded person and read all of the reviews prior to buying this. I thought maybe some people were expecting a 100.00 facial brush for the price of $10.00 and that&#x27;s why they complained. Others wrote it worked fine, but I cant possibly see how if it cant even clean your face. But if you choose to get this facial brush hoping your luck will be better then good luck. Just keep in mind when or if you find out what other people are talking about amazon has wonderful customer service and an excellent return policy!</li>
            <li> The 2 speeds on this are snail and is this thing spinning? Will be returning this. I haven&#x27;t even used it. When i got it thr bristles in the brush were bent to where there was like a chunk missing...going to get a better one.</li>
            <li> My friend ordered two, and gave me one. She said the shipping only took one day! How amazing is that! I just tried it yesterday and my skin felt as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom. It really felt like I was getting a &amp;#34; deep &amp;#34; clean, and a small face massage at the same time! LOL! I was debating buying one of the higher end brands.. as I heard it did wonders, but I&#x27;ve just graduated college and with all my student loans etc, it didn&#x27;t seem like the brightest idea. I&#x27;m so happy my friend gifted this to me, I get excited every night to come home just to use this to wash my face hehe :)</li>
            <li> This. Brush. Is. Awesome!!  Apply a good cleanser and great skin is yours!  I use this thing EVERYday.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an inexpensive cleanser that would take my makeup off and remove dead skin without paying $200...this cleanser is great! It arrived on time, all pieces in tact, and only takes 2 AA batteries to operate! At $10 I could purchase many of these over the years and not break my bank! Xx</li>
            <li> Overall the facial brush kit was okay, it&#x27;s very slow has no real power behind it&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it if only to get to start with&lt;br /&gt;other than that I would say get something faster with more power.</li>
            <li> THIS FACIAL BRUSH KIT HAS NO POWER.</li>
            <li> Great accessory to have for facial care..the brush is just the right texture for my face..and I could already see the difference in my skin.. .am happy that I made this purchase...</li>
            <li> very good product thankyou</li>
            <li> It is as described.  It&#x27;s not fantastic but I definitely feel a difference after I use it.</li>
            <li> Very low power. Not impressed but I guess that is what you get when you buy the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> I have barley used this product but the times that I used it I actually enjoyed it. Made my face feel good.</li>
            <li> it is great for skin cleansing and it makes it fun to do so.</li>

            <li> Works good. Could have a little more power. Overall good product. Timely delivery.</li>
            <li> its a good beauty tool,does its works nicely</li>
            <li> I love it!! Works great, I have arthritis and it can hard sometimes trying to handle a washcloth when your hands hurt. This product is easy to use and handle. I recommended for people with RA.</li>
            <li> Perfect travel size!  If you are looking for an everyday use one, I recommend paying an extra 10 dollars and buying a full size one from toilet tree.  I give this as gifts though for people that are looking to see if they want to invest in a clarasonic or have never used a face brush.  The power behind this is not that great and if you push at all on your face, it slows down how it spins.  But it is perfect for me when I travel for work and I am not worried about losing it because of the price!</li>
            <li> My mom enjoys using it</li>
            <li> Works but very slow rotation, will take longer to clean my pores!</li>
            <li> NO POWER AT ALL. WASTE OF MONEY. WILL BE SEEKING A REFUND</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with my daily facial skin cleaning. Smaller that I expected, but not too small. Easy to travel wilth. I can now gently clean or exfoliate my face without being to rough.</li>
            <li> Nice item.  Not very powerful.</li>
            <li> you get what you pay for.  was nice but not impressed with speed of rotation even with new batteries. was lethargicly rotating.</li>
            <li> Update: It was okay until it stopped working after 5 uses...such a disappointment</li>
            <li> This is one of the most cost efficient facal brushes i have ever come across. The price is so reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason i gave this 4 stars is because it does not come with a storage box like the other model sold else this is a wonderful product - http://www.amazon.com/Loel%C2%AE-Multi-functional-cleaning-Cleaning-Polisher/dp/B00DQ5G848/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1426280505&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;loel+multi+functional&lt;br /&gt;It comes with 5 replaceable soft bristle brush heads meet your all kinds of need: Nylon Brush, Soft Brush, Massor, Pumice Stone, Face Sponge.&lt;br /&gt;It really makes my face soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see the difference in my skin. The blackheads have reduced drastically and the skin pores are also not too visible.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the brush is good and the bristles on the brush is also smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish this would come with a box to store it in but other wise it is a great product. I was lucky to receive it under promotion but my opinion is unbiased.</li>
