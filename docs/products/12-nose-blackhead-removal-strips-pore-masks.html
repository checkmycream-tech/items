    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>and I try my best not to let it run anywhere allover my face.</li>
            <li>I was very happy with  it.</li>
            <li>The best way to avoid getting this everywhere is to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the best product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>The best part is that it doesn&#x27;t hurt when you take it off!</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>this is amazing product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Does a great job as if you been to a salon.</li>
            <li>Definitely a great value for my money.</li>
            <li>and I did not see any great removal of blackheads.</li>
            <li>It is a really great product.</li>
            <li>Got to say I love this product!!</li>
            <li>Much better than any nose strips you buy!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many blackhead removal methods, and these are the best of all of them.</li>
            <li>These packets are excellent for travelling or easy storage/access.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t do a good job.</li>
            <li>but out was a good amount that I applied.  </li>
            <li>I did use it once and it made my skin feel good but was picking it out of my hair for an hour.</li>
            <li>It does not do any good.</li>
            <li>I used it immediately &amp; was very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with this mask.</li>
            <li>Not as effective as the fabric pore strips that you can buy at the store.</li>
            <li>I still can&#x27;t believe how effective it is in removing my blackheads.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I always have this handy in my bag in cases of emergencies.</li>
            <li>I introduced to my brother and he really liked it.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and also quite affordable.</li>
            <li>for me they have been more effective then biore</li>
            <li>If the rave reviewers can tell more how they did it,  out would be nice.  </li>
            <li>THIS WAS AN OKAY PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>It dries okay and can be pealed off</li>
            <li>hairs rip off more than &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>and i love that its a liquid instead of a strip</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt to peel off the face (or maybe the nose area has a greater pain tolerance).</li>
            <li>It was okay but not for me</li>
            <li>It gets out everything while leaving your skin smooth!</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>and I love them the packets came shipped in a silver coloured jewlery type box.</li>
            <li>I love it so easy to use.</li>
            <li>and wow I got so happy they were gone</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a miracle to get the tiny blackheads off of my nose, for GOOD!  </li>
            <li>What it DOES do is create a tar like covering that neither peels nor washes off easily.  </li>
            <li>but once I did it was quite easy.</li>
            <li>I will strongly advice you against buying this product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good because you can make it adapt to your nose, normal strips don&#x27;t do that&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>(maybe fine if you use often)</li>
            <li>Since it was fairly cheap, I decided to go ahead and order these packets.</li>
            <li>It has a light scent that isnt too offending.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>After watching a video on these and the person claiming they were great, I ordered them for my teenage daughter.</li>
            <li>They made it sound like this things sucked out ALL the blackheads and whiteheads out</li>
            <li>Pulls out blackheads and leaves skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>I must sound like a corny salesman</li>
            <li>I still prefer the good old biore nose strips.</li>
            <li>This is very easy to use and it is gentle on the skin too.</li>
            <li>lol you pour the liquid on your nose and let it dry then peel off</li>
            <li>One packet is good for the entire face plus one or two nose applications.</li>
            <li>as many reviews said the quantity can cover the whole face.</li>
            <li>Overall: good brand and product.</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t work anywhere as good as a biore strip and all the instructions are not in English</li>
            <li>the product is good if u want a facial but not  if you want to remove your blackheads.</li>
            <li>It definitely does not do a perfect job, but it does much more than I expected it to!</li>
            <li>Other than those problem areas, GREAT at it&#x27;s job of clearing out my face</li>
            <li>These were perfect they made my skin so soft and really made a difference I will definitely be buying them again</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more because i keep giving them to friends to try!</li>
            <li>Not crazy about this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>This works great for my black heads!</li>
            <li>Pulled right off, and even though I washed my face, there was a lot of gunk it pulled out.</li>
            <li>so I just hope I used them right</li>
            <li>found that while it does get under nails that it washes off easy with water ( as warm as you personally can tolerate) and facial cleansing soap or dial soap.</li>
            <li>This is similar to the ones I&#x27;ve tried before but on of the reasons I prefer using this is because the mask doesn&#x27;t get easily removed which definitely shows that this is how effective its pore cleansing power.  </li>
            <li>First off these are NOT strips.</li>
            <li>I looked funny.</li>
            <li>The goo in this blackhead removing packets works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions pretty well.</li>
            <li>It was weird at first yet great because it did the job!</li>
            <li>The next day found more of it all over my sink and soap and wall...</li>
            <li>And now that the price has lowered down, I am pretty sure that it will be out of stock in no time!</li>
            <li>Work great, a little messy but love them.</li>
            <li>And also it takes more than 30 minutes to dry.</li>
            <li>This is just some kind of black silicone that won&#x27;t pull out anything but surface skin grease.</li>
            <li>but i honestly couldn&#x27;t believe when i peeled the mask off my nose how almost all the black heads were gone.</li>
            <li>Also the packets are all written in Chinese or Japanese so don&#x27;t count on being able to read them!</li>
            <li>I had so much in my nose area and when  I put this on</li>
            <li>I was very eager to try it</li>
            <li>To call these &#x27;strips&#x27; leaves much to be desired.</li>
            <li>These really hurt taking off..</li>
            <li>Only one star because the free tool advertise.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend like the results so much he gave it a go</li>
            <li>This product really helped me with blackhead problems.</li>
            <li>This product shipped fast and worked as described.</li>
            <li>Ample amount in package for your whole face.</li>
            <li>i expected more from it.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like these</li>
            <li>Be very.</li>
            <li>If there&#x27;s no edge, just use a needle to gently lift a section off.</li>
            <li>i really didnt like it.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin so much softer.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kinda like a latex texture when ready to peel.</li>
            <li>At least it makes your skin smell and feel good</li>
            <li>I had a little amount of blackheads to start with, and I&#x27;m pretty sure the mask takes them off.</li>
            <li>I did notice many black heads even after I used this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love my Asian brothers and sisters, but give me some instructions in English please.</li>
            <li>I gave it a try and used up all the little packages that came but in the end I feel like it was gluts making me break out even more</li>
            <li>(more than rinsing after normal strips), and generally it&#x27;s not really a clean method like with strips.</li>
            <li>so I was surprised how much hair came off.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the big deal is worth this liquid pore strips.  </li>
            <li>On the mask I saw a lot of hair but not blackheads like I&#x27;m used to seeing when using normal strips.</li>
            <li>It only rips off the top layer of my skin and leave it feeling incredibly dry.</li>
            <li>It only rips off the top layer of my skin and leave it feeling incredibly dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean up if you get it on a hard surface; just let it dry first and then peel off.</li>
            <li>These Chinese things were delivered very fast and I can&#x27;t complain about the service.</li>
            <li>It maked me laugh the first time with my face being all black.</li>
            <li>I took a hot steaming shower to open up the pores.</li>
            <li>I think that if you have either very little to little blackheads this is great.</li>
            <li>and my skin was so smooth and in the black bag there is a lot</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t seem to work for me and they made a huge mess.</li>
            <li>If you have ever used the Biore pore strips, you know that they need to be applied right after a hot shower while the skin is still wet to actually work.</li>
            <li>Whenever I use this product I can clearly see my blackheads removed by the strip.</li>
            <li>So far after two uses I have not had any breakouts.</li>
            <li>Pay the extra and get the real thing.</li>
            <li>Completely a miracle peel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was low cost and the shipping was fast though.</li>
            <li>Naturally, I turned to Amazon, because they sell everything.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money</li>
            <li>I still have some left very sufficient</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have to redo the process twice in order to completely remove blackheads, not like the old products that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Who really knows what this stuff is,everything is written in chinese.</li>
            <li>Its a mess to clean</li>
            <li>I dont have many blackheads but the strips didnt do much for my face other than take off my dead skin and leave it soft.</li>
            <li>On the first attempt, I waited for 30 minutes and still the cheek part didnt dry.</li>
            <li>,  my advice take a hot washcloth and pat your face and apply the gooey like strips and wait until totally dry and then peel.</li>
            <li>also, it&#x27;s not strong like normal strips, doesn&#x27;t clean deeply</li>
            <li>It takes a while to dry and really doesn&#x27;t remove anything like you would think it does.</li>
            <li>skin is dry and oily (depending on the day) and also sensitive ( prone to breakout triggered by high fragrance )</li>
            <li>At first, I was very dubious of this product after reading all of the negative reviews.</li>
            <li>AVOID applying over the upper lip as this area is just to sensitive for this</li>
            <li>I only use it on my nose and cheeks, and so far, I&#x27;ve gotten 6 uses with one of the packets.</li>
            <li>And it apparently was shipped from China, so it took forever.  </li>
            <li>Did not dry and if it did, it took FOREVER!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s super flimsy so it doesn&#x27;t grab the blackhead and pull it out like the ones I have tried in the past</li>
            <li>It washed out of my wash rags just fine, but I would hate to get it on a favorite shirt or something.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t hard to clean off, too.</li>
            <li>It will hurt a little in certain areas when peeling off because you can&#x27;t rip it off.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> If there&#x27;s no edge, just use a needle to gently lift a section off.</li>
            <li> i really didnt like it.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin so much softer.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kinda like a latex texture when ready to peel.</li>
            <li> At least it makes your skin smell and feel good</li>
            <li> I had a little amount of blackheads to start with, and I&#x27;m pretty sure the mask takes them off.</li>
            <li> I did notice many black heads even after I used this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love my Asian brothers and sisters, but give me some instructions in English please.</li>
            <li> I gave it a try and used up all the little packages that came but in the end I feel like it was gluts making me break out even more</li>
            <li> (more than rinsing after normal strips), and generally it&#x27;s not really a clean method like with strips.</li>
            <li> so I was surprised how much hair came off.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the big deal is worth this liquid pore strips.  </li>
            <li> On the mask I saw a lot of hair but not blackheads like I&#x27;m used to seeing when using normal strips.</li>
            <li> It only rips off the top layer of my skin and leave it feeling incredibly dry.</li>
            <li> It only rips off the top layer of my skin and leave it feeling incredibly dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean up if you get it on a hard surface; just let it dry first and then peel off.</li>
            <li> These Chinese things were delivered very fast and I can&#x27;t complain about the service.</li>
            <li> It maked me laugh the first time with my face being all black.</li>
            <li> I took a hot steaming shower to open up the pores.</li>
            <li> I think that if you have either very little to little blackheads this is great.</li>
            <li> and my skin was so smooth and in the black bag there is a lot</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t seem to work for me and they made a huge mess.</li>
            <li> If you have ever used the Biore pore strips, you know that they need to be applied right after a hot shower while the skin is still wet to actually work.</li>
            <li> Whenever I use this product I can clearly see my blackheads removed by the strip.</li>
            <li> So far after two uses I have not had any breakouts.</li>
            <li> Pay the extra and get the real thing.</li>
            <li> Completely a miracle peel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was low cost and the shipping was fast though.</li>
            <li> Naturally, I turned to Amazon, because they sell everything.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money</li>
            <li> I still have some left very sufficient</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have to redo the process twice in order to completely remove blackheads, not like the old products that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Who really knows what this stuff is,everything is written in chinese.</li>
            <li> Its a mess to clean</li>
            <li> I dont have many blackheads but the strips didnt do much for my face other than take off my dead skin and leave it soft.</li>
            <li> On the first attempt, I waited for 30 minutes and still the cheek part didnt dry.</li>
            <li> ,  my advice take a hot washcloth and pat your face and apply the gooey like strips and wait until totally dry and then peel.</li>
            <li> also, it&#x27;s not strong like normal strips, doesn&#x27;t clean deeply</li>
            <li> It takes a while to dry and really doesn&#x27;t remove anything like you would think it does.</li>
            <li> skin is dry and oily (depending on the day) and also sensitive ( prone to breakout triggered by high fragrance )</li>
            <li> At first, I was very dubious of this product after reading all of the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> AVOID applying over the upper lip as this area is just to sensitive for this</li>
            <li> I only use it on my nose and cheeks, and so far, I&#x27;ve gotten 6 uses with one of the packets.</li>
            <li> And it apparently was shipped from China, so it took forever.  </li>
            <li> Did not dry and if it did, it took FOREVER!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s super flimsy so it doesn&#x27;t grab the blackhead and pull it out like the ones I have tried in the past</li>
            <li> It washed out of my wash rags just fine, but I would hate to get it on a favorite shirt or something.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t hard to clean off, too.</li>
            <li> It will hurt a little in certain areas when peeling off because you can&#x27;t rip it off.</li>
            <li> No more large or darken blackheads on my nose.  </li>
            <li> Works great on those ugly black cats</li>
            <li> If you have a lot this may over time help to loosen and pull them out a long with a weekly facial steam and exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried a second time and tried to apply it thicker, still did nothing but dry out my face.  </li>
            <li> Not only this product does not remove any dirt from the face, it leaves your skin severally dry after removal.</li>
            <li> I guess my face was clean, but it was not worth all the trouble that it took to wash it off, not to mention the mess it makes in your sink.  </li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t strips, it&#x27;s a thick black paste that spreads fairly well and dries into a thin plastic-like mask.</li>
            <li> It takes so long, I am not using it often.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Takes a long time to dry, and even with two layers no blackheads come out at all.</li>
            <li> If there is a little under the nails after cleaning use an orange stick to clean underneath while holding fingernails under the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product will certainly pull out facial hair but this wasn&#x27;t all that painful and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> The thicker you apply, the longer it will take to dry and peel.</li>
            <li> The problem part is, it doesnt dry for me to peel it off.</li>
            <li> Waitied for 30 minutes and chin didnt dry.</li>
            <li> you spread it and wait for it to dry, then remove.</li>
            <li> Washed face, let it dry, then put on mask.</li>
            <li> Takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li> It takes about 10-15 minutes to dry.</li>
            <li> All it seemed to do was dry out my face.  </li>
            <li> I tried using it after a shower multiple times with no success.</li>
            <li> (I can&#x27;t tell if there&#x27;re blackheads on the black mask, it all looks the same).</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that I make a mess .</li>
            <li> You end up looking like you&#x27;re wearing a partial latex kinky bondage mask.</li>
            <li> but I only saw a few whiteheads and blackheads when I peeled it off.</li>
            <li> I decided to wait until my face no longer felt wet.</li>
            <li> This is a black goo that you smear all over your face and let dry.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package I was surprised though: those are bags of black thick liquid that you apply on your face.</li>
            <li> ( i knew from reading other reviews).</li>
            <li> Worked extremely well.</li>
            <li> I suggest someone tries it!</li>
            <li> I guess it would help people with excessive facial hair if used as waxing.</li>
            <li> This mask works as well as any other nose strips plus you can use it all over your face.</li>
            <li> VERY careful around your eyebrows and eye-bags.</li>
            <li> One thing it did do, when I touched my nose after it was less rough,  the bumping was gone.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s tried using them a few times and it hasn&#x27;t removed a single blackhead.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to find an edge thick enough</li>
            <li> I end up having black goop allover my face</li>
            <li> This a black paste.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because its black in color, I dont know if its taking out any black heads.</li>
            <li> This is like a black paste that you paint on your nose.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a black paste that you have to spread on your face, nose, wherever you want to remove blackheads.</li>
            <li> Product is black and will stain clothing.</li>
            <li> They are not strip but a black gooey substance.  </li>
            <li> they&#x27;re packets of black tar-like gel that you apply to your nose.</li>
            <li> i dont think it gets black heads out at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a black gel.</li>
            <li> You can use your hands but it&#x27;ll be a mess.</li>
            <li> The black goo is messy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is sticky, messy, and JET BLACK.  </li>
            <li> First, the product is very thin, it&#x27;s hard to apply to the face.  </li>
            <li> A little slip of paper with hand written instructions would be sufficient.</li>
            <li> It dried a little longer than stated, but I am in WA where it is humid this time of year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them a few times now, they don&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> Not strips so it is messy.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> They are not as harsh as biore strips, but somehow they draw out dirt.</li>
            <li> I hope no one else waste their money on this item.</li>
            <li> I can see that the mask takes off dead skin, and maybe some hairs.</li>
            <li> Product is extremely messy to apply.  </li>
            <li> Really messy to apply</li>
            <li> Messy but seems to work.</li>
            <li> plus it can be messy.</li>
            <li> kinda helpful but mostly messy</li>
            <li> Removing was pretty painful</li>
            <li> This is a thick, sticky, black liquid.</li>
            <li> Just sacks of weird, viscous, tarry, raw petroleum-like substance; no pore-strips at all, and all the writing on the packets was in an asian alphabet with no explanation of what the viscous s</li>
            <li> I could tell because ur nose is small</li>
            <li> use scissors to cut off a small corner of the pouch</li>
            <li> use a small plastic container ( with lid) to squeeze the liquid into&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using</li>
            <li> But there&#x27;s no magic mask that will.</li>
            <li> my face felt less gunky, like the Biore pore strips only less painful</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like putting black ink all over your face and bathroom!!</li>
            <li> If I could figure out how, I would have rated it a negative star.  </li>
            <li> it looked weird because it was the color black.</li>
            <li> Applying the liquid was a bit complicated a messy but you can get used to it.</li>
            <li> takes forever to dry, VERY VERY DIFFICULT to remove and  STAINS.</li>
            <li> It dries with a thin even layer in about 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li> The plus side is that it all comes off in one peal and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue behind.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I pout too thinly</li>
            <li> I look stupid with black paint on my face.</li>
            <li> and it is weird.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this stuff did nothing for me.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is laughable.</li>
            <li> That product is really terrible, it make me both hand totally black when I using it.</li>
            <li> If you like your shower cold then you might have to steam your face before apply the mask.</li>
            <li> What a rip-off!!  </li>
            <li> It feels like cold glue has been applied to my face and it is impossible to peel off.</li>
            <li> My face looks like I have done a very expensive treatment.</li>
            <li> It is a very disappointing product.</li>
            <li> you get a crap ton for the price</li>
            <li> Hoooly crap.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed...</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> Terrible product.</li>
            <li> This is truly one of the worst beauty products I have ever bought.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even remove any blackhead. I end up having black goop allover my face and I try my best not to let it run anywhere allover my face.</li>
            <li> Omg I burly got it today and I can&#x27;t believe how it works I had so much in my nose area and when  I put this on And I tock it off and wow I got so happy they were gone and my skin was so smooth and in the black bag there is a lot so I could do 3 times or 4 and burly one bag will be finish I could tell because ur nose is small</li>
            <li> THIS WAS AN OKAY PRODUCT. DIDNT WORK LIKE IT SAID IT WOULD. DIDNT REMOVE BLACKHEADS</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t tell a difference</li>
            <li> This works great for my black heads! I was very happy with  it. I didn&#x27;t know it was getting shipped from china though.</li>
            <li> That product is really terrible, it make me both hand totally black when I using it. And also it takes more than 30 minutes to dry. Don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> First off these are NOT strips. ( i knew from reading other reviews). This is a thick, sticky, black liquid. It dries with a thin even layer in about 15-20 minutes. You can get two uses per packet. The best way to avoid getting this everywhere is to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. use scissors to cut off a small corner of the pouch&lt;br /&gt;2. use a small plastic container ( with lid) to squeeze the liquid into&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using either your finger ( you can wear a disposable glove if you do not want it on hands and nails or apply with a larger brush such as a foundation style brush)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that while it does get under nails that it washes off easy with water ( as warm as you personally can tolerate) and facial cleansing soap or dial soap. If there is a little under the nails after cleaning use an orange stick to clean underneath while holding fingernails under the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product will certainly pull out facial hair but this wasn&#x27;t all that painful and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. AVOID applying over the upper lip as this area is just to sensitive for this ( I do not have noticeable hair there but if you do it will hurt)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not apply close to eyes or the hair line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally this mask worked well for me, besides seeing some hair on the leftovers I could see in the mirror that it did remove some blackheads. I think that if you have either very little to little blackheads this is great. If you have a lot this may over time help to loosen and pull them out a long with a weekly facial steam and exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is dry and oily (depending on the day) and also sensitive ( prone to breakout triggered by high fragrance ) So far after two uses I have not had any breakouts. It also hasn&#x27;t contributed to dryness or oil buildup.</li>
            <li> This product DOES NOT form a mask.  What it DOES do is create a tar like covering that neither peels nor washes off easily.  I guess my face was clean, but it was not worth all the trouble that it took to wash it off, not to mention the mess it makes in your sink.  Like motor oil.  Terrible.</li>
            <li> Worked extremely well.</li>
            <li> Not as effective as the fabric pore strips that you can buy at the store. Be mindful when applying this though. The thicker you apply, the longer it will take to dry and peel. It will hurt a little in certain areas when peeling off because you can&#x27;t rip it off. It&#x27;s easy to clean up if you get it on a hard surface; just let it dry first and then peel off. One packet is good for the entire face plus one or two nose applications.</li>
            <li> Nothing was removed when I pulled this off. I&#x27;ve tried them a few times now, they don&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. I tried using it after a shower multiple times with no success. It only rips off the top layer of my skin and leave it feeling incredibly dry. I&#x27;d stick to using a facial scrub.</li>
            <li> This a black paste. I was very eager to try it as many reviews said the quantity can cover the whole face. The problem part is, it doesnt dry for me to peel it off. On the first attempt, I waited for 30 minutes and still the cheek part didnt dry. Second attempt, I used it only on my nose and chin. Waitied for 30 minutes and chin didnt dry. Its a mess to clean if I cannot peel it off. It takes so long, I am not using it often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because its black in color, I dont know if its taking out any black heads. I did notice many black heads even after I used this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont think i will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> this product does not work as they say, no blackheads was removed when I used the product.</li>
            <li> Nothing Happened but there was no oil at my face for a while</li>
            <li> I like the mask. It maked me laugh the first time with my face being all black. I looked funny.</li>
            <li> I opened on of these packets and it was so gooey, I didn&#x27;t even want to touch it. I threw it in the garbage.</li>
            <li> This is like a black paste that you paint on your nose. It dries okay and can be pealed off but it doesn&#x27;t do a good job. Item is mislabeled; they aren&#x27;t strips. The black goo is messy. Pay the extra and get the real thing.</li>
            <li> It only rips off the top layer of my skin and leave it feeling incredibly dry. I&#x27;d stick to using a facial scrub.</li>
            <li> To call these &#x27;strips&#x27; leaves much to be desired. This is a black goo that you smear all over your face and let dry. You end up looking like you&#x27;re wearing a partial latex kinky bondage mask. You are then supposed to peal it off. Not crazy about this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.5/5, Will not buy again. Will spend the $10 to get the american branded strips next time.</li>
            <li> These really hurt taking off.. I only recommend putting them on your nose and chin.. I put the paste on my cheeks and just about cried taking them off.. Also the packets are all written in Chinese or Japanese so don&#x27;t count on being able to read them! hairs rip off more than &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> For a penny, I received lots of these samples.  I used it immediately &amp; was very pleased with the results.  No more large or darken blackheads on my nose.  Completely a miracle peel.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used.  I recommend it. My face looks like I have done a very expensive treatment.</li>
            <li> Takes a long time to dry, and even with two layers no blackheads come out at all.</li>
            <li> This is just some kind of black silicone that won&#x27;t pull out anything but surface skin grease. Not strips so it is messy. SCAM!</li>
            <li> Only one star because the free tool advertise. Not included</li>
            <li> i thought it was going to be strips, but inside there is actually a liquid. you spread it and wait for it to dry, then remove. it&#x27;s good because you can make it adapt to your nose, normal strips don&#x27;t do that&lt;br /&gt;but after you finish you have to wash well (more than rinsing after normal strips), and generally it&#x27;s not really a clean method like with strips. also, it&#x27;s not strong like normal strips, doesn&#x27;t clean deeply (maybe fine if you use often)</li>
            <li> This is not a strip it&#x27;s a black paste that you have to spread on your face, nose, wherever you want to remove blackheads.</li>
            <li> This is a peel off mask with no English instructions or ingredient list. I thought I was buying the pore strip cleaners, similar to what Biore makes. Product is black and will stain clothing.</li>
            <li> The goo in this blackhead removing packets works pretty well. I have been using it for a few weeks now and I can definitely see improvements in my skin. I thought I would be able to see the particles that the strips removed, but it is difficult to see. They are not as harsh as biore strips, but somehow they draw out dirt. The best part is that it doesn&#x27;t hurt when you take it off!</li>
            <li> I was hoping for Biore &amp;#34;type&amp;#34; strips, this is a liquid and it is weird.</li>
            <li> Washed face, let it dry, then put on mask. It dried a little longer than stated, but I am in WA where it is humid this time of year. Pulled right off, and even though I washed my face, there was a lot of gunk it pulled out. I also like it didn&#x27;t make me red or irritate my skin like some products I have found.</li>
            <li> takes forever to dry, VERY VERY DIFFICULT to remove and  STAINS. I hope no one else waste their money on this item.</li>
            <li> These removal strips works wonders. I love it so easy to use. Does a great job as if you been to a salon.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get rid of the blackheads around my nose. I look stupid with black paint on my face. It takes a while to dry and really doesn&#x27;t remove anything like you would think it does. The plus side is that it all comes off in one peal and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue behind. It would probably work for someone who was working with softer skin or on a different area.&lt;br /&gt;It was low cost and the shipping was fast though.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be mistaken this is not a pore strip it is a gel mask.</li>
            <li> If you were like me and bought it because of that tutorial you saw on youtube don&#x27;t even bother. It doesn&#x27;t work. Takes forever to dry. Save yourself some time.</li>
            <li> I am still in awe of this product! I still can&#x27;t believe how effective it is in removing my blackheads. And it can efficiently do the job in just a matter of minutes. This is very easy to use and it is gentle on the skin too. This set can last for around two months for me. And now that the price has lowered down, I am pretty sure that it will be out of stock in no time!</li>
            <li> Well worth the price. for me they have been more effective then biore and i love that its a liquid instead of a strip so i can put it only where i need it. I will definitely be ordering more because i keep giving them to friends to try!</li>
            <li> At first, I was very dubious of this product after reading all of the negative reviews. Since it was fairly cheap, I decided to go ahead and order these packets. They aren&#x27;t strips, it&#x27;s a thick black paste that spreads fairly well and dries into a thin plastic-like mask. It has a light scent that isnt too offending. There is also a lot of product within each packet. I only use it on my nose and cheeks, and so far, I&#x27;ve gotten 6 uses with one of the packets. It doesn&#x27;t hurt to peel off the face (or maybe the nose area has a greater pain tolerance). I can see that the mask takes off dead skin, and maybe some hairs. I had a little amount of blackheads to start with, and I&#x27;m pretty sure the mask takes them off. (I can&#x27;t tell if there&#x27;re blackheads on the black mask, it all looks the same). It leaves my skin smooth afterwards. It isn&#x27;t hard to clean off, too.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t seem to work for me and they made a huge mess. I followed the directions pretty well. At least it makes your skin smell and feel good</li>
            <li> I got this becuase it said it would help with the appearance of pore and I feel like it did nothing for my skin. I gave it a try and used up all the little packages that came but in the end I feel like it was gluts making me break out even more so I would not consider buying this product again.  It actually make my face feel a like ruff after using it. Terrible product.</li>
            <li> I ended up throwing it away.  If I could figure out how, I would have rated it a negative star.  There were no instructions, no English at all in packaging. Didn&#x27;t know how to use it, or what the ingredients were.</li>
            <li> you get a crap ton for the price</li>
            <li> I guess it worked well.</li>
            <li> Product is extremely messy to apply.  They are not strip but a black gooey substance.  Did not work at all.</li>
            <li> These packets are excellent for travelling or easy storage/access. The product works well, as I have nothing to compare it too. Overall: good brand and product.</li>
            <li> It was okay but not for me</li>
            <li> Got to say I love this product!! It gets out everything while leaving your skin smooth! My boyfriend like the results so much he gave it a go and its become a regular thing for us. Much better than any nose strips you buy!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many blackhead removal methods, and these are the best of all of them. These actually aren&#x27;t strips at all- they&#x27;re packets of black tar-like gel that you apply to your nose. It takes about 10-15 minutes to dry. You can actually see the blackheads on the strip, if you are so inclined to look and see the results for yourself. It definitely does not do a perfect job, but it does much more than I expected it to!</li>
            <li> I like them alot just don&#x27;t put on hairier areas</li>
            <li> This product really helped me with blackhead problems. Very easy to use and also quite affordable. You can already its effects after several minutes. Now, you can no longer see blemishes on my face. Great product!</li>
            <li> After watching a video on these and the person claiming they were great, I ordered them for my teenage daughter. They don&#x27;t work at all! She&#x27;s tried using them a few times and it hasn&#x27;t removed a single blackhead. Very disappointed...I don&#x27;t recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is similar to the ones I&#x27;ve tried before but on of the reasons I prefer using this is because the mask doesn&#x27;t get easily removed which definitely shows that this is how effective its pore cleansing power.  Definitely a great value for my money.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a miracle to get the tiny blackheads off of my nose, for GOOD!  Naturally, I turned to Amazon, because they sell everything.  Unfortunately, this stuff did nothing for me.  And it apparently was shipped from China, so it took forever.  This stuff is sticky, messy, and JET BLACK.  It washed out of my wash rags just fine, but I would hate to get it on a favorite shirt or something.  Overall, it didn&#x27;t really do much of anything but get messy.  Pass.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the big deal is worth this liquid pore strips.  I used it as directed on the packaging but I only saw a few whiteheads and blackheads when I peeled it off. I don&#x27;t know if I pout too thinly but out was a good amount that I applied.  One thing it did do, when I touched my nose after it was less rough,  the bumping was gone.  It was smoother. If the rave reviewers can tell more how they did it,  out would be nice.  They made it sound like this things sucked out ALL the blackheads and whiteheads out but that wasn&#x27;t the same for me.</li>
            <li> These just pull my baby hairs out.</li>
            <li> Product as described. Pulls out blackheads and leaves skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> This product shipped fast and worked as described. Very pleased with this mask. Ample amount in package for your whole face.</li>
            <li> didnt do anything for me.</li>
            <li> this is amazing product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a mask, not peel off strips</li>
            <li> I love my Asian brothers and sisters, but give me some instructions in English please. Had to get on here just to see how to properly use the product. A little slip of paper with hand written instructions would be sufficient. Gonna keep trying though.</li>
            <li> Did not dry and if it did, it took FOREVER! Didnt pull off blackheads and pores as well as regular pore strips, if at all.... Will not be buying again...</li>
            <li> What a rip-off!!  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!! Just sacks of weird, viscous, tarry, raw petroleum-like substance; no pore-strips at all, and all the writing on the packets was in an asian alphabet with no explanation of what the viscous s*** was for. BLAH! BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!</li>
            <li> These were perfect they made my skin so soft and really made a difference I will definitely be buying them again</li>
            <li> Really messy to apply and I did not see any great removal of blackheads.</li>
            <li> Work great, a little messy but love them.</li>
            <li> Messy but seems to work.</li>
            <li> i expected more from it. you see the pictures and a lot of block heads being removed, that is not entirely the case. plus it can be messy.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t work anywhere as good as a biore strip and all the instructions are not in English so I just hope I used them right lol you pour the liquid on your nose and let it dry then peel off but it&#x27;s super flimsy so it doesn&#x27;t grab the blackhead and pull it out like the ones I have tried in the past</li>
            <li> Works great on those ugly black cats</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money</li>
            <li> I dont have many blackheads but the strips didnt do much for my face other than take off my dead skin and leave it soft. the product is good if u want a facial but not  if you want to remove your blackheads.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like these but they didn&#x27;t do what they claimed.  I tried them twice.  First, the product is very thin, it&#x27;s hard to apply to the face.  It pulled nothing out, no blackheads or anything.  All it seemed to do was dry out my face.  I tried a second time and tried to apply it thicker, still did nothing but dry out my face.  It is a very disappointing product.</li>
            <li> It was weird at first yet great because it did the job! :) I suggest someone tries it! I still have some left very sufficient</li>
            <li> This works wonders for me. Whenever I use this product I can clearly see my blackheads removed by the strip. I don&#x27;t even have to redo the process twice in order to completely remove blackheads, not like the old products that I&#x27;ve tried. That&#x27;s why I always have this handy in my bag in cases of emergencies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had issues with excess oil on my nose and blackheads. I must sound like a corny salesman but i honestly couldn&#x27;t believe when i peeled the mask off my nose how almost all the black heads were gone. It blows my mind how well it works.</li>
            <li> Be very. VERY careful around your eyebrows and eye-bags. Hoooly crap. Other than those problem areas, GREAT at it&#x27;s job of clearing out my face (:</li>
            <li> This stuff is laughable.It&#x27;s like putting black ink all over your face and bathroom!! Who really knows what this stuff is,everything is written in chinese.I did use it once and it made my skin feel good but was picking it out of my hair for an hour.The next day found more of it all over my sink and soap and wall...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it didn&#x27;t work well for me as a blackhead remover. I still prefer the good old biore nose strips. These Chinese things were delivered very fast and I can&#x27;t complain about the service. When I opened the package I was surprised though: those are bags of black thick liquid that you apply on your face. Then when it dries up you remove it as a mask. Applying the liquid was a bit complicated a messy but you can get used to it. Removing was pretty painful - I felt like my face was coming off. On the mask I saw a lot of hair but not blackheads like I&#x27;m used to seeing when using normal strips. I&#x27;m not a hairy person so I was surprised how much hair came off. I guess it would help people with excessive facial hair if used as waxing. But as for blackheads... I&#x27;d say I&#x27;ll keep using these things until they finish but I won&#x27;t buy the product again.</li>
            <li> If you have ever used the Biore pore strips, you know that they need to be applied right after a hot shower while the skin is still wet to actually work. So that&#x27;s what I did with this mask. I took a hot steaming shower to open up the pores. If you like your shower cold then you might have to steam your face before apply the mask. Then I cut the pack open and squeezed everything in a ceramic disk. I used a foundation brush to apply it on my face, focusing on forehead, nose, cheeks and chin. You can use your hands but it&#x27;ll be a mess. The instructions tell you to leave it on for 10 minutes but I left it on for 30 minutes. I decided to wait until my face no longer felt wet. Peeling the mask off took some work. It took me a while to find an edge thick enough but once I did it was quite easy. If there&#x27;s no edge, just use a needle to gently lift a section off. You&#x27;ll have to peel the mask off in sections. I saw as I pulled it off that it did take off a lot of gunk. Did it take off everything? No. But there&#x27;s no magic mask that will. I know from trying 40, 50 different types of mask. There&#x27;s nothing that&#x27;ll return your skin to its glorious baby state. This mask works as well as any other nose strips plus you can use it all over your face. For that, I think it deserves 5 stars. If there&#x27;s any leftover mask on your face, just use a cleansing cloth and wipe it off. I used Olay but it doesn&#x27;t matter. Then just follow up by your daily skin care routine (tone, moisturize, treatment, etc.)</li>
            <li> This is truly one of the worst beauty products I have ever bought. It does not do any good. It feels like cold glue has been applied to my face and it is impossible to peel off. Not only this product does not remove any dirt from the face, it leaves your skin severally dry after removal. I will strongly advice you against buying this product.</li>
            <li> i just used it. it a liquid form. i put it all over my face. it looked weird because it was the color black. but it was like a peel mask. i really didnt like it. i dont think it gets black heads out at all.</li>
            <li> Too liquidly, doesn&#x27;t stay on well.</li>
            <li> kinda helpful but mostly messy</li>
            <li> THESE ARE NOT STRIPS!  It&#x27;s a black gel.</li>
            <li> It is a really great product. I introduced to my brother and he really liked it. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that I make a mess . It makes your skin so much softer. Everyone should try this product.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my at home facials and I love them the packets came shipped in a silver coloured jewlery type box. I tried one and they worked my face felt less gunky, like the Biore pore strips only less painful,  my advice take a hot washcloth and pat your face and apply the gooey like strips and wait until totally dry and then peel. It doesn&#x27;t hurt like the Biore strips when they peel up it&#x27;s kinda like a latex texture when ready to peel.</li>
