            <li>The shampoo was ok.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I find myself using a bit more than probably needed</li>
            <li>I was recommended by an employee at a beauty store to give this a try since it is healthy and safe for color treated hair.</li>
            <li>I do love the smell though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: After using this shampoo and conditioner for about a month, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair feels so nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I am sure it works well for others depending on ones hair.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>we all got the same great results, regardless of region!!!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall the shampoo is OK.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I was recommended to use this product.</li>
            <li>Not only does it make my hair feel healthy, it also smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>It smells great and leaves my hair very shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>The conditioner lets me glide my fingers right through it after use which is always a good sign.</li>
            <li>As long as you do not use too much it is perfect!</li>
            <li>This product is pretty good stuff.</li>
            <li>Healthy sexy hair products line is by far the best and seller is fast&amp;I highly recommend to all</li>
            <li>I use the shampoo and conditioned in conjunction with the sexy hair soy renewal and it leaves my hair shinny and smooth.  </li>
            <li>it makes your hair so soft and it smells very nice.</li>
            <li>Helps keep the hair strong after all the blow drying and straightening it gets.</li>
            <li>Strongly reccommend the duo though.</li>
            <li>I have been using the sexy healthy hair for color treated hair and decided to try this since it was such a good deal</li>
            <li>I have fine, dry fly away hair and love the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in the health of my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth</li>
            <li>So far so good with this duo.</li>
            <li>If this shampoo can make 65 yr old hair look and feel as good as mine</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo, it smells amazing and leaves my hair super soft and managable.</li>
            <li>I WAS SO EXCITED.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have tried Sexy Hair shampoo/conditioner - just switched from Biolage.</li>
            <li>Good hair days for the last week using it.</li>
            <li>After I&#x27;m finished with my hair, it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much, but I&#x27;m on the search for something I&#x27;d like better.</li>
            <li>and I love it just as much.</li>
            <li>I use more than normal.</li>
            <li>and it cost me just as much!!</li>
            <li>My hair looks healthy and soft and I give the product line credit!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sulfate free and really adds moisture to your hair which is one of my biggest concerns.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, this product made my hair soft, it stopped breaking and it just looked a million times better.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years and my hair is so nice.  </li>
            <li>I used Red Ken with IPC before this, not exactly crap, and this is way better.</li>
            <li>Smells pleasant and the large bottles are a much more affordable alternative to the small ones in salons.</li>
            <li>it was packed right</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just the right balance.</li>
            <li>I always order the soy shampoo, but apparently there is more than one variety.</li>
            <li>does....imagine what it could do for anyone younger (or older), the best hair I have ever had!!!I have tried every other shampoo imaginable</li>
            <li>GOT it yesterday and used it last night.. :-)</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the product, my hair feels soft, and is not frizzy.</li>
            <li>The Argan oil it has in it definitely adds luster and a healthy look and feel.</li>
            <li>I went to my local cosmo prof location in search for a nourishing, \\&quot;healthy for hair\\&quot; shampoo and conditioner duo.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than salon price!</li>
            <li>Not moisturizing enough for my hair, but it did have a lovely fragrance.</li>
            <li>I used to love this shampoo and conditioner set, but since my last purchase, I&#x27;ve noticed they changed the formula or</li>
            <li>I first tried it when my hair stylist used it on my hair after coloring.</li>
            <li>The product shipped pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this shampoo and conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s become very hard to find at most beauty retailers and if you do the bottles are much smaller and much more</li>
            <li>Would certainly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>Not only is my hair fine</li>
            <li>Not to mention the conditioner really worked at untangling my hair(which</li>
            <li>Works and kinky curly wavy and straight hair.</li>
            <li>It left my hair nice and shiny but nothing that made a big difference in the way my hair</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a decent shampoo when I purchased this product, however, that is not so.  </li>
            <li>The soy and cocoa makes my really soft!!</li>
            <li>Absolutely a rip off as far moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Has a fresh smell to it and the size is going to last awhile.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I ended up putting the shampoo to the side and being that I had no time to go on another hunt for more shampoo I picked up Suave Natural Shea butter shampoo and conditioner at my local walmart, which actually left my hair very soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I live in Arizona, and my daughter and her family live in Florida...</li>
            <li>So does my 38 yr old daughter, and 12 yr old granddaughter, and my 14 yr old grandson!!!</li>
            <li>I still don&#x27;t like the consistency of the products, but the effect it has on my hair has made me willing to use up the entire bottle before trying something else.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for my crazy hair!</li>
            <li>Not the first time buying and won&#x27;t be the last.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m 65yrs old!  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve dyed it dark and light a few times so a good portion of my hair is a little damaged.</li>
            <li>came quick, also came with a sample of other shampoos.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say enough!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as the conditioner</li>
            <li>This duo helped manage my flyaways while maintaining a soft silky sheen.</li>
            <li>I color my hair and it helps keep my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Less chemical than other Sexy products and neutral smell that allows you to wear fragrances without the need to match your hair products with them.</li>
            <li>I like that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy or dry it out too much</li>
            <li>Product arrived sooner than expected &amp; packaged very well, no leaks.</li>
            <li>I find that I have to use twice as much shampoo and conditioner as I do for any other brand I buy.</li>
            <li>No other shampoo I&#x27;ve bought has had such an effect on my hair before, so I&#x27;m raising my review from 3 stars to 4 for that reason.</li>

            <li> My hair was breaking, dull, and just looked plain horrible. This product was referred to me by a stylist and I went to buy it. The bad part was that it was the small bottles and they were $12.00 a bottle. I have thick hair and we have hard water so to get my hair clean I was using a ton of product and it just wasn&#x27;t lasting. HOWEVER, this product made my hair soft, it stopped breaking and it just looked a million times better. Thats when i found it here on amazon, and in 33.8 ounces.. I WAS SO EXCITED. So I ordered it. GOT it yesterday and used it last night.. :-) it was packed right and I will be ordering it again. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over 2 years now. This duo will last 4-6 months depending on the length of hair and frequency of wash. Excellent price for the purchase. Less chemical than other Sexy products and neutral smell that allows you to wear fragrances without the need to match your hair products with them.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the product, my hair feels soft, and is not frizzy. As long as you do not use too much it is perfect!</li>
            <li> The conditioner is garbage if you have thick or damaged hair. I was so mad that I paid 10 dollars for a bottle of conditioner that was as water based as one you would find at a dollar store. Absolutely a rip off as far moisturizing. The shampoo was ok.</li>
            <li> I am always on the hunt for shampoo and conditioners that work for my thick,treated,medium length,semi coarse hair. So far so good with this duo. The conditioner lets me glide my fingers right through it after use which is always a good sign. Good hair days for the last week using it. Has a fresh smell to it and the size is going to last awhile. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Great products great price!! Healthy sexy hair products line is by far the best and seller is fast&amp;I highly recommend to all</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. It&#x27;s sulfate free and really adds moisture to your hair which is one of my biggest concerns. Helps keep the hair strong after all the blow drying and straightening it gets. Smells pleasant and the large bottles are a much more affordable alternative to the small ones in salons. The Argan oil it has in it definitely adds luster and a healthy look and feel.</li>
            <li> I really love this product!!! The soy and cocoa makes my really soft!! It&#x27;s smells great!!! This is a great deal too!!! I went to the salon and bought the smaller bottles and it cost me just as much!! I&#x27;m really happy!!! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> came quick, also came with a sample of other shampoos. I really loved this product. It was a great buy</li>
            <li> Great product, great value.</li>
            <li> Sexy Hair always makes a good product.  I have fine, dry fly away hair and love the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> The product shipped pretty fast. This product is pretty good stuff. A bit expensive if you buy the bottles separately. The only thing I found to be wrong is the conditioner is a little watery. Still works great though. I find myself using a bit more than probably needed but I&#x27;m not use to slightly watery conditioner. I would recommend this product to others as it works great.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a decent shampoo when I purchased this product, however, that is not so.  It may be the soy that is in the product or the structure or chemical balance, but this shampoo does not cut it for me.  It does not lather up and feels almost like . . . well, NOTHING basically.  The conditioner is very thin and watery and you must use a handful of it for it to work.  This stuff is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I was recommended by an employee at a beauty store to give this a try since it is healthy and safe for color treated hair. I&#x27;ve used it 3 times now and I don&#x27;t like it. I find that I have to use twice as much shampoo and conditioner as I do for any other brand I buy. I also hate the way it feels while I&#x27;m in the shower lathering it up. It feels like I&#x27;ve just put some cheapie shampoo in my hair. After I&#x27;m finished with my hair, it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much, but I&#x27;m on the search for something I&#x27;d like better. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the soy since I&#x27;m not used to it or the brand itself, but this stuff is just not for me. I do love the smell though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: After using this shampoo and conditioner for about a month, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair feels so nice and smooth. No other shampoo I&#x27;ve bought has had such an effect on my hair before, so I&#x27;m raising my review from 3 stars to 4 for that reason. I still don&#x27;t like the consistency of the products, but the effect it has on my hair has made me willing to use up the entire bottle before trying something else.</li>
            <li> I always order the soy shampoo, but apparently there is more than one variety. This one leaves my hair feeling coated, so it may be a moisturizing shampoo. I need the type that I usually order, and I need to research the types that this manufacturer produces.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s perfect for my crazy hair! Not the first time buying and won&#x27;t be the last.  Will buy over and over again!!</li>
            <li> I have been using the sexy healthy hair for color treated hair and decided to try this since it was such a good deal and I love it just as much. It shampoo and conditioner are a little watery than I am used to, but work just the same and I am fully happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This product smells nice and feels great in the hair but it hasnt made my hair &amp;#34;healthier&amp;#34;. It is the best shampoo and conditioner that I have used but it still didnt solve my frizzy problem. I have long wavy blonde hair. Id say it is medium thickness. I am sure it works well for others depending on ones hair. It just didnt react the way I wanted it to with my hair.</li>
            <li> Our hairstylist recommended this product &amp; used in his salon.  Works wonderfully on on long hair. Product arrived sooner than expected &amp; packaged very well, no leaks.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews for this product and decided to buy it. I have thick hair but I&#x27;ve dyed it dark and light a few times so a good portion of my hair is a little damaged. When I use the shampoo and conditioner every day without any other product it makes my hair feel greasy and oily. It&#x27;s smooth but I have to wash it the next day or it feels very gross.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and Conditioner is the BEST SHAMPOO I have ever used in my life........and I&#x27;m 65yrs old!  It does for my hair what God intended our hair to be like!!!  Healthy, shiny, incredibly easy to manage!  If this shampoo can make 65 yr old hair look and feel as good as mine does....imagine what it could do for anyone younger (or older), the best hair I have ever had!!!I have tried every other shampoo imaginable, I don&#x27;t even care about the cost, and bar none..THERE IS NO SHAMPOO LIKE THIS SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER!!!!  I almost feel guilty about the price!!!  I love it, I love it, I love it!!!  So does my 38 yr old daughter, and 12 yr old granddaughter, and my 14 yr old grandson!!! I live in Arizona, and my daughter and her family live in Florida...we all got the same great results, regardless of region!!!  This shampoo works on everyone, both male and female, the same!!!  I really can&#x27;t say enough!!! You have to try it, to believe it!!! To whoever created this shampoo....THANK YOU!!!  It does exactly what you promise, actually, more so!!!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and I probably would too if I had any hair. She will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Love this product and the price! My hair is colored and I use a flat iron every day.  My hair looks healthy and soft and I give the product line credit!  I use the leave-in conditioner too!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, it smells amazing and leaves my hair super soft and managable. Can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, thick, colored hair and this is the best shampoo and conditioner that I have found that is a price I can afford. Wonderful, wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I went to my local cosmo prof location in search for a nourishing, \\&quot;healthy for hair\\&quot; shampoo and conditioner duo. I had been using Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Awapuhi Shampoo and felt like it was taking the moisture out of my hair, so one of the workers there had suggested Healthtysexyhair soy line and for the price (it was on sale, $6 for each) I figured why not??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the shampoo is OK. It left my hair nice and shiny but nothing that made a big difference in the way my hair felt.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the conditioner I was not such a big fan. It was a bit watery and didn&#x27;t leave me hair untangled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up putting the shampoo to the side and being that I had no time to go on another hunt for more shampoo I picked up Suave Natural Shea butter shampoo and conditioner at my local walmart, which actually left my hair very soft and moisturized. Not to mention the conditioner really worked at untangling my hair(which is something I always look for) and did not weigh down my hair at all.</li>
            <li> Loved the products. Great quality. So much cheaper than salon price! Will buy again, but add morracan oil as well!</li>
            <li> Not moisturizing enough for my hair, but it did have a lovely fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this shampoo and conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s become very hard to find at most beauty retailers and if you do the bottles are much smaller and much more expensive!&lt;br /&gt;This product is so great! it makes your hair so soft and it smells very nice. I like that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy or dry it out too much, it&#x27;s just the right balance. I also use the leave in conditioner spray with it.&lt;br /&gt;this is a great value, much better than buying it at the store.</li>
            <li> I used to love this shampoo and conditioner set, but since my last purchase, I&#x27;ve noticed they changed the formula or whatever it&#x27;s called and it does not work as well or makes my hair feel as great as it once did.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite shampoo and conditioner.  I have used this product for several years and my hair is so nice.  I recommend it to my friends and family as it is so nice.</li>
            <li> All I have to say is excellent.  The shampoo and conditioner has a very nice light scent. Works and kinky curly wavy and straight hair. Didn&#x27;t have any build up. I have finally found a shampoo and conditioner that work for the family.  No more buying different shampoos. I&#x27;m glad I was recommended to use this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Not only does it make my hair feel healthy, it also smells wonderful. Would certainly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Good stuff! I first tried it when my hair stylist used it on my hair after coloring. I decided to buy the duo and holy cow! It&#x27;s amazing. I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in the health of my hair. I used Red Ken with IPC before this, not exactly crap, and this is way better. Not only is my hair fine but I have a lot of it, talk about frizz city. This duo helped manage my flyaways while maintaining a soft silky sheen. My only complaint is with the shipping, but that has nothing to do with the product. Was shipped using OnTrac&#x3D;always horrible. They didn&#x27;t even try to leave the package at my house b4 going the my leasing office. Strongly reccommend the duo though. Does wonders especially for daily straightening!</li>
            <li> Pros: It smells great and leaves my hair very shiny and healthy. Virtually no product build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It does absolutely nothing for untangling thick hair, and the conditioner is so watery I use more than normal.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers that the conditioner seems a bit runny but I think it goes a long way.  It also smells great and leaves my hair feeling healthy.  I use the shampoo and conditioned in conjunction with the sexy hair soy renewal and it leaves my hair shinny and smooth.  This is the first time I have tried Sexy Hair shampoo/conditioner - just switched from Biolage.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I color my hair and it helps keep my hair soft and shiny. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
