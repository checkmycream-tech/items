            <li>I plan to buy more for gifts.</li>

            <li>LOVE them will buy</li>
            <li>BETTER THAN THE KNOCK OFFS</li>
            <li>But this file makes my heels completely smooth!</li>
            <li>These files were precisely what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Excellent price, 3 different sizes, etchings on both sides.  </li>
            <li>Got these on time and I love them.  </li>
            <li>Magic, I tell you.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to worry about trimming skin accidentally, and the smooth glass doesn&#x27;t hurt their skin!  </li>
            <li>I bought these files after reading that crystal files are actually better for your nails than the metal ones that can often do damage to the tips.</li>
            <li>These are a MUCH BETTER value</li>
            <li>I am really glad I got these.</li>
            <li>I think it will be their favorite gift.  </li>
            <li>I just love mine.  </li>
            <li>Fit anywhere and work like a dream!</li>
            <li>There are so many variations, and some of them appear not to be etched glass.</li>
            <li>wished beatuy stores would sell more of these</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>i love these.</li>
            <li>I really love these.  </li>
            <li>It does a nice smooth job and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;overfile&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>IF they lasted through more than one use.  </li>
            <li>works well, everyone in the house uses them and they all love it.</li>
            <li>So, I will gladly share my files for my fingernails and toenails with her.  </li>
            <li>I love glass files over metal files or the board ones.</li>
            <li>Still love this file.</li>
            <li>Love em.</li>
            <li>Because of the texture of the file it can give me a bit of a cringing nails-on-a-chalkboard feeling, but that&#x27;s more of a me thing instead of a fault of the file itself.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re sure to flinch</li>
            <li>I used to not be able to tell a difference when I used a file</li>
            <li>Love using them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are finely textured but also very strong in smoothing your nails.  </li>
            <li>They last an incredible amount of time, perform effectively, and are easily cleaned between uses in order to maximize their effectiveness.</li>
            <li>These came at a very reasonable price and are of good quality.</li>
            <li>I use files more to smooth my feet than anything and the large file is great with that.  </li>
            <li>the only issue i&#x27;ve found if the foot file isn&#x27;t the best for rougher feet but for personal use it works brilliantly.</li>
            <li>under hot water and good to go.</li>
            <li>These are really nice - great price and came individually in plastic sleeves.</li>
            <li>Great gift for anyone one who likes natural nails.</li>
            <li>They are really great and give nails a professional finish.  </li>
            <li>These glide almost smoothly across my nails (finger and toe) with MUCH better results.</li>
            <li>I found they work best when I file towards the center of the nail from both directions.  </li>
            <li>I once bought a cheap glass file thinking I was getting a better deal - Woo</li>
            <li>I love that these came in a nice packaging, each individually wrapped and together in a box, and that I know they are good - no mercury, shatterproof</li>
            <li>They do their job quickly and leave my nails with nice smooth edges.</li>
            <li>These are great bail files, but the grit is far too fine on the pedicure heel file.</li>
            <li>Very fine grain producing a super finish...</li>
            <li>They work perfectly and don&#x27;t lose their effectiveness with use, as other files tend to do.  </li>
            <li>I have used other nail files but have had best results with these.</li>
            <li>Easy peasy.</li>
            <li>These glass files cut well and are easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy on the nails &amp; fingers.</li>
            <li>I had heard that glass nail files were best for your nails and that only those made in the Czech Republic were worth buying.  </li>
            <li>She liked them so much, I ended up ordering some more which she gives to her girlfriends.</li>
            <li>Even though they are made of glass I don&#x27;t feel like the will break easily.</li>
            <li>Wow they are very nice so gentle but effective on nails and heels of my feet.</li>
            <li>You can just rinse them with soap and water, or I&#x27;ve even heard of putting them in the utinsel basket in the dishwasher, and they look/work as good as new.</li>
            <li>, the grain on these is so fine that it leaves your nails with an almost polished edge.</li>
            <li>Turns your nails into a fine powder.</li>
            <li>Ive been using them consistently for the last 8 months and they still file great!</li>
            <li>I used to have a tone of nail files with both medium and fine grains but one of these covers it all.</li>
            <li>Super product!  </li>
            <li>Cobalt Blue Crystal Glass Nail Files work great and are easy on my nails.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, nothing too exciting, I liked this color best because the pink was pretty girly.</li>
            <li>Little one stays in my purse and the size is perfect.</li>
            <li>that is a significant factor for anybody thinking to buy) that bend and tear easily</li>
            <li>The grit is perfect and they are dual sided, The file themselves are nice and thin so you can get into corners.</li>
            <li>These crystal nail files are fantastic.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>These leave my nails really smooth at the edges.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous nail files.</li>
            <li>but they last along time and give great results...</li>
            <li>Completely worth it :)</li>
            <li>sleeves and in a cotton filled box.  </li>
            <li>They really do an incredible job, without being too rough.</li>
            <li>(they have to be perfectly smooth at the ends</li>
            <li>The smaller ones are great.</li>
            <li>They leave my  nails feeling smooth after fileing</li>
            <li>I also use the largest one to smooth my feet.</li>
            <li>These are more than worth the investment as I can wash them when done</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to clean with soap, water, and a brush.</li>
            <li>Its smooth as butter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They do have different grits it seems, but they all work great.</li>
            <li>these files are fantastic.</li>
            <li>So smooth.</li>
            <li>The ends of my nails feel incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li>dear member of your family, perhaps these files will make a thoughtful gift for her.</li>
            <li>In 2004 a friend gave me a genuine Czech Etched Crystal Glass manicure file.  </li>
            <li>That is the most useful one.</li>
            <li>These make nails so smooth without roughing up the nail.  </li>
            <li>We purchased these primarily for my wife, who ordered two sets, but after trying one of hers, I got a set for myself as well.</li>
            <li>my wife and I enjoy using them.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t leave jagged edges on my nails like the cheap nail files do.</li>
            <li>After breaking my nail-biting habit a few years ago, I have had to keep my nails perfectly smooth and flawlessly shaped.</li>
            <li>It used to be a couple more steps while I slowly got them flawless</li>
            <li>I really like the glass files better than the metal ones and better than the emery boards.</li>
            <li>These files will leave your nails unbelievably smooth and are a thousand times better than any other nail file I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt that they are pretty!!</li>
            <li>They file cleanly and smoothly.</li>
            <li>These nail files work wonderfully for little baby fingernails!  </li>
            <li>My husband needed a more abrasive filer and these were definitely more for finishing nails, not hard core filing.</li>
            <li>They wear out quickly, so I decided to search for a more economical option.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>love these files, exactly what i was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I love, love, love these nail files, and I truly can&#x27;t say that enough.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>small size is just perfect to keep in my purse/bag.</li>
            <li>Unique gifts.</li>
            <li>These are good at both shaping and are fine enough for refining the edge.</li>
            <li>Very pretty to look at and fine</li>
            <li>This are very effective at filing the nails, but are much more gentle to the nails than the traditional emory board style.  </li>
            <li>They file nails quickly and leave the edges smooth.  </li>
            <li>Very nice files, came exactly as described, each with their own little pouch.</li>
            <li>I get a VERY smooth effect, so much nicer than emery boards or skin rasps.</li>
            <li>My hair and skin just have to get along without any special attention.</li>
            <li>Just stop reading right now and buy this, you WILL NOT regret it!</li>
            <li>but now I can go right from this to my really fine file</li>
            <li>They just feel more gentle on my nails than the cardboard ones you buy in the store.  </li>
            <li>I was also very concerned that filing would make a nails-on-a-chalkboard sound, but it doesn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li>I bought these Czech crystal glass nail files several years ago and they loved them.  </li>
            <li>I love how gentle they are on my nails.</li>
            <li>purchased good clippers at the same time and now it doesn&#x27;t bother me to cut or file my nails.</li>
            <li>and I got her the full set for Christmas.</li>
            <li>Also, they clean up quickly and thoroughly with a rinse under the faucet.</li>
            <li>But, today, I decided to use the tried and true clipper type ones on her toe nails, and she tried to bite me.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so much more gentle on nails than emery boards and steel files.</li>
            <li>These are absolutely hands down the best nail files ever!</li>
            <li>Super cute and really durable.</li>
            <li>Having the 3 sizes is great, I keep the smallest in my purse and the other 2 on my vanity.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t use other nail files or emery boards after experienced glass files.  </li>
            <li>I use the larger one the most because I feel I have more control with it.</li>
            <li>These things work and they work quick</li>
            <li>Loved it, wanted more, and wasted money on a number of the garbage &amp;#34;crystal&amp;#34; files sold in drugstores.</li>
            <li>quick,</li>
            <li>Although they work much like an emory board, they are easier and more pleasant to use due to their heft and rigidity.</li>
            <li>Happy enough with this item that I bought several more sets as stocking stuffers for Christmas -- my closest friends and all the women/girls in my family are getting a set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also much more economical than emery boards because they last virtually forever and require nothing more than a 5-second rinse under the faucet to refresh them.</li>
            <li>I even used the large one on my heels after the shower and it smoothed them over easily.</li>
            <li>Plus, they&#x27;re pretty!  </li>
            <li>I have several sets, one fore me, and another set for my pets, the parrots love getting their toes filed!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>Pretty colors too!</li>
            <li>Works great, but I am not sure it is really any better than a metal fingernail file....but perhaps.</li>
            <li>It was only nice when I needed to shorten my nails quickly.</li>
            <li>They work really great, with little effort they get alot done.</li>
            <li>The large file is great for smoothing rough places on feet.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve dropped this kind of file plenty of times and while it technically could break, they haven&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>The edges of my nails are so soft and look so healthy after using these, and my nails rarely split or break anymore.</li>
            <li>These are the only kind of files</li>
            <li>so definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>The bottom line is they&#x27;re truly worth the money.</li>
            <li>Anyways, it&#x27;s really worth a try.</li>
            <li>Worth it, trust me.</li>
            <li>The texture soon became smooth with enough use, even scratch off and reveal smooth glass underneath!</li>
            <li>just right*</li>
            <li>The main reason I chose a crystal file was because I heard they were better for nails and  left them smooth.</li>
            <li>I especially like that the big one is great for using to get calluses off your feet.  </li>
            <li>I had a glass file previously and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had weaker nails that tended to peel or split, but alas I kept fighting the good fight for healthy looking nails.</li>
            <li>: I have natural and strong nails.</li>
            <li>Also, they&#x27;re super gentle on my nails.</li>
            <li>I very much suggest and have been telling my friends about them.</li>
            <li>Admittedly, I haven&#x27;t had nails very much of my life.</li>
            <li>As far as filing goes works just fine.</li>
            <li>The large file does well on my feet and the small is great for travel.</li>
            <li>lol so don&#x27;t file too hard.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love these, the grit isn&#x27;t something like you&#x27;d fine on a normal files, it actually doesn&#x27;t really feel like they have a grit at all.</li>
            <li>There is no glue-0n grit; the teeth are cut into the glass, so you just rinse them off and they are like new and clean.</li>
            <li>Quality - will last many years</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking fot.</li>
            <li>I have been using crystal nail files for more than ten years.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I finally did.  </li>
            <li>These things last forever and they&#x27;re so cute.</li>
            <li>Love the different sizes.</li>
            <li>but it is exactly what you need for function.  </li>
            <li>I love how there are different sizes too.</li>
            <li>Will be purchasing more in a different color.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a pretty shade of blue too. :)</li>
            <li>These are my first glass files and I was a bit hesitant.  </li>
            <li>If you take care of these and make sure they don&#x27;t break they will last you forever.</li>
            <li>The middle sized one is the one I go for the most.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>the color is exact on the blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve asked many, many times for my cuticles to only be pushed back.  </li>
            <li>I filed them the first day I receive them and it like sealed the edges.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>(lately I have to do a fair amount every week as they&#x27;re growing pretty quick).</li>
            <li>Luckily my Mother-in-Law had the exact same files, only with a more preferable grit, so we swapped!</li>
            <li>The ones that I ordered came earlier than I expected and are just great.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect thing for soft, thin nails.  </li>
            <li>they are easier to use than emory boards, they dont make me grit my teeth, but i have to be very gentle, or they can really take off a lot of nail at one time.  </li>
            <li>These are fine, so if you are looking for a more coarse file, these are definitely not.</li>
            <li>I love the multiple sizes and the handy little sleeves they are in for storing.  </li>
            <li>I mistakenly thought the blue color would convince me it was more mainly, but I was still a guy too girly to filing his nails on a belt sander.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found that there are much better files than the cheap ones I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>My large toe nails have been used as weapons, but the large file takes them on without a problem.</li>
            <li>I like the large one for pedicure work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used the large one for my heels</li>
            <li>The ends not shown in the picture are pointed with exception of the large file, it is rounded on both ends.</li>
            <li>I mean if you apply gentle pressure, you can file away a lot of nail very quickly (like a coarse file) but the edges of your nail are super smooth the whole time (like a fine file).</li>
            <li>They are like a coarse file and a fine file all in one - by that</li>
            <li>they have a fine coarse side on one side and a smoother side on the ohter.</li>
            <li>The large nail file works really well for roughened/calloused cuticles.</li>
            <li>You really have to be cautious when filing because you might take a lot of your nail off</li>
            <li>The crystal glass works much better than traditional emery boards and leaves the edge of the nail smooth instead of rough cut.</li>
            <li>These seem to be very well made.</li>
            <li>They were packaged very well in their&lt;br /&gt;individual</li>
            <li>But, any time I&#x27;ve had nails, I HAVE to keep them filed… if they get much beyond the tips, they get in the way</li>
            <li>These were even better than I expected.</li>
            <li>They are very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>REAL crystal here..</li>
            <li>I talked them up so much that my Mom wanted one</li>
            <li>they wear really well</li>
            <li>These work really well and seem to be well made.</li>
            <li>My nails grow fast and require a lot of upkeep.</li>
            <li>Purchased these and they absolutely work.</li>
            <li>Leaves my nails actually smooth instead of gritty feeling.</li>
            <li>Better than I even expected</li>
            <li>aside, these files work very well</li>
            <li>These files are the real deal.</li>
            <li>and real crystal.</li>
            <li>These files are the real deal, not those bulky glass fakes.  </li>
            <li>But really I just wanted to offer this tip:&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>Really well made and well priced.</li>
            <li>They really make your nails feel smooth and they file your nails down quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The large pedicure one is great and the small purse size one is too, however the middle size which is about the size of a regular emery board is smooth on both sides, as I bought them in Feb.</li>
            <li>I ordered these to use on my baby as I heard they are more gentle then other options.</li>
            <li>I had been previously using some very fine grit (~280) nail files from the drug store, which were the finest grit I could find.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m trying to make my salon as echo friendly and sanitary as possible so my clients can be relaxed and not worry if they&#x27;ll catch something.</li>
            <li>Usually I have to go over my nails with a very fine sanding block to get rid of the sharp edges, but with these files it&#x27;s quick and easy.</li>
            <li>Last for ages and ages and just rinse under water to clean.  </li>
            <li>I need something a little more subtle, able to fine tune.</li>
            <li>Use them, rinse them with warm water, allow to dry and put back in their covers.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re sturdy, and I like the cool, blue color.</li>
            <li>I love the two smaller sizes, though find the larger size one not to have much use</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the redeeming quality of this product is it filed down my nails in a couple seconds.</li>
            <li>only part I didn&#x27;t love was that my nails felt a bit rough right after filling.</li>
            <li>I took the files out and used the clear side and was amazed at how smoothly and quickly they filed my nails down.</li>
            <li>and they seem to last for much longer than any other kind of file.</li>
            <li>Instead of going back and forth many times you get the same results with one or two strokes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>highly recommend them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>HIGH QUALITY NAIL FILES...</li>
            <li>would highly recommend these and have even gotten sets for friends.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend them highly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Filing with these crystal files does not leave your nails rough and I didn&#x27;t need to try and file in one direction all the time because the grain is so fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Emory boards are fine and all, but they&#x27;re really rough</li>
            <li>So far, I really like these.  </li>
            <li>Well worth buying the triple set to have in various locations.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s a normal amount of &amp;#34;ack!&amp;#34; then it&#x27;s no biggie.</li>
            <li>However, they give me a distinct nails-on-chalkboard sensation when I use them (especially the largest one).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this type of nail file to anyone who needs a new nail file.</li>
            <li>Other than that works fine.</li>
            <li>I have seen the same product in other retail stores for a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It might, if I could afford to use a new file every time, because the files wear out after one use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Another good use is to buff down any rough patches of skin that sometimes developed around my cuticle area.  </li>
            <li>you have never had these before get them they are the very best!And last forever!!Love them so much .</li>
            <li>so using a regular emery board just makes them even more ragged leaving, of course, a rough finish as well.</li>
            <li>These files are great for keeping nails healthy and retards splitting.</li>
            <li>problem, which isn&#x27;t really a problem unless it&#x27;s someones major issue, is that you *</li>
            <li>We kept this right next to the nursing chair and still use it now with a 1 year old.</li>
            <li>Not only do they work well, but they&#x27;re pretty.</li>
            <li>They also seem to be pretty solid</li>
            <li>I am absolutely in love with these glass nail files and will never again use a harsh, scratchy emery board or metal file ever again!</li>
            <li>The big one is REALLY big but love the smaller 2!</li>
            <li>Product as described and pretty blue.</li>
            <li>Pretty and blue.  </li>
            <li>The color is beautiful(dark blue to frost white), I get three sizes and clean up is so easy; just rinse,  air dry, then put them back in the sleeve.</li>
            <li>The smallest one is about the size of a cigarette or lighter, the middle one is the normal file size and the large one is rounded on each end and wider/taller than both of the others.</li>
            <li>Takes much less filing to smooth nails.  </li>
            <li>I had previously purchased a crystal file that had the abrasive surface &amp;#34;sprayed&amp;#34; on, and one file with my nail turned it into a sheet of smooth glass...</li>
            <li>It takes me half the time to file my nails with these as compared to cheap paper/foam emery boards.</li>
            <li>The little ones less, good for shaping.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how big the large one was</li>
            <li>efficient, clean, long lasting</li>
            <li>And i can see a clear difference in the health of my nails.</li>
            <li>These glide over your nails softly, without the gut-wrenching feel/sound of a regular file, and yet they get the job done twice as fast.</li>
            <li>So the two smaller files are very usable.</li>
            <li>My nails feel so much smoother than with your standard nail file</li>
            <li>My two year old sister plays with them and Ive never had one break.</li>
            <li>I am 65 years old &amp; I never knew these files existed.  </li>
            <li>I think that each side has both a &amp;#34;sharpening&amp;#34; spot (the section near the handle) and a &amp;#34;finishing&amp;#34; spot (which is the part near the tip).</li>
            <li>If I do happen to drop them and they break, I will replace them immediately as they have completely changed my willingness to care for my nails.</li>
            <li>really haven&#x27;t used the much larger 180 grit file.</li>
            <li>My old Revlon nail file is 7 years old, and while it still works, with 3 women in the house, we always fight for it.</li>
            <li>They easily round out your nails and leave a smooth edge.</li>
            <li>These have really taken my manicures to the next level, and have also really helped in my Jamberry Wrap application as a final step.</li>
            <li>These last, clean up well, and will take off as much or as little nail as you need, depending on how much pressure you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I LOVE these files - no more ripping, tearing, torturing my nails!</li>
            <li>And I can use it when my feet are dry (i.e. without soaking my feet first).</li>
            <li>I no longer cut, these can file really hard and fast or you can barely press and smooth the skin.</li>
            <li>They take my nails down quickly without that nails on chalkboard feeling.</li>
            <li>Love the sizes, a small one to throw in my bag, a medium one to use on my hands and a larger file for my feet.</li>
            <li>No, seriously, I just want them PUSHED BACK.  </li>
            <li>so I can get back to doing NORMAL guy stuff like hunting zombies.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Until you use a file that doesn&#x27;t disintegrate, you never really realize how much nail is coming off!</li>
            <li>They are far superior to metal (harsh) or emery board (slow, wears off &amp; becomes ineffective).</li>
            <li>These leave a very smooth edge, so far I have not experienced the splitting and cracking</li>
            <li>the big one is aggressive;  great for guys and artificial nails.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve dropped them several times on my tile floor already and so far they have yet to break.</li>
            <li>I am a guy, in my early 30&#x27;s, and no one had ever explained proper nail care to me.</li>
            <li>Shapes well with no rough edges.  </li>
            <li>Even though I read the rave reviews I was surprised by how different these are.</li>
            <li>If this sensation happens to be at the top of your list for things you can&#x27;t imagine worse than, then perhaps skip it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if they work just as good with artificial nails, because I&#x27;ve never tried those.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am able to file down the length efficiently, so no more need for those old files nor my nail clippers.</li>
            <li>(be it the file or the file case) because I looked away for a minute to get the next nail thing I need -- quick little thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very nice files and much less expensive than others you can buy.</li>
            <li>You can hardly use it to clean beneath you nails, once you file them.</li>
            <li>Nice files, however the longer file is a little too thick.</li>
            <li>blade is thin enough to edge under my nail for a cleaner edge:-)</li>
            <li>I suggest them to anyone with weak or strong nails.</li>
            <li>These are exactly the same for a lot less.</li>
            <li>This is my second order for these files--not because I wore out the first set, just misplaced them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had glass files in the past and liked them, but these files are quite thick</li>
            <li>Ever since I&#x27;ve started using my crystal nail files my finger nails have actually stopped splitting and peeling, and I don&#x27;t even use a nail clipper anymore because these nail files file the nail down SO quickly that that&#x27;s all I use now about once every other week.</li>
            <li>I really wish they were a little thinner.</li>

            <li> I plan to buy more for gifts.</li>

            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> LOVE them will buy</li>
            <li> BETTER THAN THE KNOCK OFFS</li>
            <li> But this file makes my heels completely smooth!</li>
            <li> These files were precisely what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Excellent price, 3 different sizes, etchings on both sides.  </li>
            <li> Got these on time and I love them.  </li>
            <li> Magic, I tell you.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to worry about trimming skin accidentally, and the smooth glass doesn&#x27;t hurt their skin!  </li>
            <li> I bought these files after reading that crystal files are actually better for your nails than the metal ones that can often do damage to the tips.</li>
            <li> These are a MUCH BETTER value</li>
            <li> I am really glad I got these.</li>
            <li> I think it will be their favorite gift.  </li>
            <li> I just love mine.  </li>
            <li> Fit anywhere and work like a dream!</li>
            <li> There are so many variations, and some of them appear not to be etched glass.</li>
            <li> wished beatuy stores would sell more of these</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> i love these.</li>
            <li> I really love these.  </li>
            <li> It does a nice smooth job and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;overfile&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> IF they lasted through more than one use.  </li>
            <li> works well, everyone in the house uses them and they all love it.</li>
            <li> So, I will gladly share my files for my fingernails and toenails with her.  </li>
            <li> I love glass files over metal files or the board ones.</li>
            <li> Still love this file.</li>
            <li> Love em.</li>
            <li> Because of the texture of the file it can give me a bit of a cringing nails-on-a-chalkboard feeling, but that&#x27;s more of a me thing instead of a fault of the file itself.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re sure to flinch</li>
            <li> I used to not be able to tell a difference when I used a file</li>
            <li> Love using them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are finely textured but also very strong in smoothing your nails.  </li>
            <li> They last an incredible amount of time, perform effectively, and are easily cleaned between uses in order to maximize their effectiveness.</li>
            <li> These came at a very reasonable price and are of good quality.</li>
            <li> I use files more to smooth my feet than anything and the large file is great with that.  </li>
            <li> the only issue i&#x27;ve found if the foot file isn&#x27;t the best for rougher feet but for personal use it works brilliantly.</li>
            <li> under hot water and good to go.</li>
            <li> These are really nice - great price and came individually in plastic sleeves.</li>
            <li> Great gift for anyone one who likes natural nails.</li>
            <li> They are really great and give nails a professional finish.  </li>
            <li> These glide almost smoothly across my nails (finger and toe) with MUCH better results.</li>
            <li> I found they work best when I file towards the center of the nail from both directions.  </li>
            <li> I once bought a cheap glass file thinking I was getting a better deal - Woo</li>
            <li> I love that these came in a nice packaging, each individually wrapped and together in a box, and that I know they are good - no mercury, shatterproof</li>
            <li> They do their job quickly and leave my nails with nice smooth edges.</li>
            <li> These are great bail files, but the grit is far too fine on the pedicure heel file.</li>
            <li> Very fine grain producing a super finish...</li>
            <li> They work perfectly and don&#x27;t lose their effectiveness with use, as other files tend to do.  </li>
            <li> I have used other nail files but have had best results with these.</li>
            <li> Easy peasy.</li>
            <li> These glass files cut well and are easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy on the nails &amp; fingers.</li>
            <li> I had heard that glass nail files were best for your nails and that only those made in the Czech Republic were worth buying.  </li>
            <li> She liked them so much, I ended up ordering some more which she gives to her girlfriends.</li>
            <li> Even though they are made of glass I don&#x27;t feel like the will break easily.</li>
            <li> Wow they are very nice so gentle but effective on nails and heels of my feet.</li>
            <li> You can just rinse them with soap and water, or I&#x27;ve even heard of putting them in the utinsel basket in the dishwasher, and they look/work as good as new.</li>
            <li> , the grain on these is so fine that it leaves your nails with an almost polished edge.</li>
            <li> Turns your nails into a fine powder.</li>
            <li> Ive been using them consistently for the last 8 months and they still file great!</li>
            <li> I used to have a tone of nail files with both medium and fine grains but one of these covers it all.</li>
            <li> Super product!  </li>
            <li> Cobalt Blue Crystal Glass Nail Files work great and are easy on my nails.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, nothing too exciting, I liked this color best because the pink was pretty girly.</li>
            <li> Little one stays in my purse and the size is perfect.</li>
            <li> that is a significant factor for anybody thinking to buy) that bend and tear easily</li>
            <li> The grit is perfect and they are dual sided, The file themselves are nice and thin so you can get into corners.</li>
            <li> These crystal nail files are fantastic.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> These leave my nails really smooth at the edges.  </li>
            <li> Fabulous nail files.</li>
            <li> but they last along time and give great results...</li>
            <li> Completely worth it :)</li>
            <li> sleeves and in a cotton filled box.  </li>
            <li> They really do an incredible job, without being too rough.</li>
            <li> (they have to be perfectly smooth at the ends</li>
            <li> The smaller ones are great.</li>
            <li> They leave my  nails feeling smooth after fileing</li>
            <li> I also use the largest one to smooth my feet.</li>
            <li> These are more than worth the investment as I can wash them when done</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re easy to clean with soap, water, and a brush.</li>
            <li> Its smooth as butter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They do have different grits it seems, but they all work great.</li>
            <li> these files are fantastic.</li>
            <li> So smooth.</li>
            <li> The ends of my nails feel incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li> dear member of your family, perhaps these files will make a thoughtful gift for her.</li>
            <li> In 2004 a friend gave me a genuine Czech Etched Crystal Glass manicure file.  </li>
            <li> That is the most useful one.</li>
            <li> These make nails so smooth without roughing up the nail.  </li>
            <li> We purchased these primarily for my wife, who ordered two sets, but after trying one of hers, I got a set for myself as well.</li>
            <li> my wife and I enjoy using them.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t leave jagged edges on my nails like the cheap nail files do.</li>
            <li> After breaking my nail-biting habit a few years ago, I have had to keep my nails perfectly smooth and flawlessly shaped.</li>
            <li> It used to be a couple more steps while I slowly got them flawless</li>
            <li> I really like the glass files better than the metal ones and better than the emery boards.</li>
            <li> These files will leave your nails unbelievably smooth and are a thousand times better than any other nail file I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt that they are pretty!!</li>
            <li> They file cleanly and smoothly.</li>
            <li> These nail files work wonderfully for little baby fingernails!  </li>
            <li> My husband needed a more abrasive filer and these were definitely more for finishing nails, not hard core filing.</li>
            <li> They wear out quickly, so I decided to search for a more economical option.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> love these files, exactly what i was looking for.  </li>
            <li> I love, love, love these nail files, and I truly can&#x27;t say that enough.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> small size is just perfect to keep in my purse/bag.</li>
            <li> Unique gifts.</li>
            <li> These are good at both shaping and are fine enough for refining the edge.</li>
            <li> Very pretty to look at and fine</li>
            <li> This are very effective at filing the nails, but are much more gentle to the nails than the traditional emory board style.  </li>
            <li> They file nails quickly and leave the edges smooth.  </li>
            <li> Very nice files, came exactly as described, each with their own little pouch.</li>
            <li> I get a VERY smooth effect, so much nicer than emery boards or skin rasps.</li>
            <li> My hair and skin just have to get along without any special attention.</li>
            <li> Just stop reading right now and buy this, you WILL NOT regret it!</li>
            <li> but now I can go right from this to my really fine file</li>
            <li> They just feel more gentle on my nails than the cardboard ones you buy in the store.  </li>
            <li> I was also very concerned that filing would make a nails-on-a-chalkboard sound, but it doesn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> I bought these Czech crystal glass nail files several years ago and they loved them.  </li>
            <li> I love how gentle they are on my nails.</li>
            <li> purchased good clippers at the same time and now it doesn&#x27;t bother me to cut or file my nails.</li>
            <li> and I got her the full set for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Also, they clean up quickly and thoroughly with a rinse under the faucet.</li>
            <li> But, today, I decided to use the tried and true clipper type ones on her toe nails, and she tried to bite me.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so much more gentle on nails than emery boards and steel files.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely hands down the best nail files ever!</li>
            <li> Super cute and really durable.</li>
            <li> Having the 3 sizes is great, I keep the smallest in my purse and the other 2 on my vanity.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use other nail files or emery boards after experienced glass files.  </li>
            <li> I use the larger one the most because I feel I have more control with it.</li>
            <li> These things work and they work quick</li>
            <li> Loved it, wanted more, and wasted money on a number of the garbage &amp;#34;crystal&amp;#34; files sold in drugstores.</li>
            <li> quick,</li>
            <li> Although they work much like an emory board, they are easier and more pleasant to use due to their heft and rigidity.</li>
            <li> Happy enough with this item that I bought several more sets as stocking stuffers for Christmas -- my closest friends and all the women/girls in my family are getting a set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also much more economical than emery boards because they last virtually forever and require nothing more than a 5-second rinse under the faucet to refresh them.</li>
            <li> I even used the large one on my heels after the shower and it smoothed them over easily.</li>
            <li> Plus, they&#x27;re pretty!  </li>
            <li> I have several sets, one fore me, and another set for my pets, the parrots love getting their toes filed!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> Pretty colors too!</li>
            <li> Works great, but I am not sure it is really any better than a metal fingernail file....but perhaps.</li>
            <li> It was only nice when I needed to shorten my nails quickly.</li>
            <li> They work really great, with little effort they get alot done.</li>
            <li> The large file is great for smoothing rough places on feet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dropped this kind of file plenty of times and while it technically could break, they haven&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The edges of my nails are so soft and look so healthy after using these, and my nails rarely split or break anymore.</li>
            <li> These are the only kind of files</li>
            <li> so definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> The bottom line is they&#x27;re truly worth the money.</li>
            <li> Anyways, it&#x27;s really worth a try.</li>
            <li> Worth it, trust me.</li>
            <li> The texture soon became smooth with enough use, even scratch off and reveal smooth glass underneath!</li>
            <li> just right*</li>
            <li> The main reason I chose a crystal file was because I heard they were better for nails and  left them smooth.</li>
            <li> I especially like that the big one is great for using to get calluses off your feet.  </li>
            <li> I had a glass file previously and loved it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had weaker nails that tended to peel or split, but alas I kept fighting the good fight for healthy looking nails.</li>
            <li> : I have natural and strong nails.</li>
            <li> Also, they&#x27;re super gentle on my nails.</li>
            <li> I very much suggest and have been telling my friends about them.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I haven&#x27;t had nails very much of my life.</li>
            <li> As far as filing goes works just fine.</li>
            <li> The large file does well on my feet and the small is great for travel.</li>
            <li> lol so don&#x27;t file too hard.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these, the grit isn&#x27;t something like you&#x27;d fine on a normal files, it actually doesn&#x27;t really feel like they have a grit at all.</li>
            <li> There is no glue-0n grit; the teeth are cut into the glass, so you just rinse them off and they are like new and clean.</li>
            <li> Quality - will last many years</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking fot.</li>
            <li> I have been using crystal nail files for more than ten years.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I finally did.  </li>
            <li> These things last forever and they&#x27;re so cute.</li>
            <li> Love the different sizes.</li>
            <li> but it is exactly what you need for function.  </li>
            <li> I love how there are different sizes too.</li>
            <li> Will be purchasing more in a different color.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a pretty shade of blue too. :)</li>
            <li> These are my first glass files and I was a bit hesitant.  </li>
            <li> If you take care of these and make sure they don&#x27;t break they will last you forever.</li>
            <li> The middle sized one is the one I go for the most.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> the color is exact on the blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve asked many, many times for my cuticles to only be pushed back.  </li>
            <li> I filed them the first day I receive them and it like sealed the edges.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> (lately I have to do a fair amount every week as they&#x27;re growing pretty quick).</li>
            <li> Luckily my Mother-in-Law had the exact same files, only with a more preferable grit, so we swapped!</li>
            <li> The ones that I ordered came earlier than I expected and are just great.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect thing for soft, thin nails.  </li>
            <li> they are easier to use than emory boards, they dont make me grit my teeth, but i have to be very gentle, or they can really take off a lot of nail at one time.  </li>
            <li> These are fine, so if you are looking for a more coarse file, these are definitely not.</li>
            <li> I love the multiple sizes and the handy little sleeves they are in for storing.  </li>
            <li> I mistakenly thought the blue color would convince me it was more mainly, but I was still a guy too girly to filing his nails on a belt sander.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found that there are much better files than the cheap ones I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> My large toe nails have been used as weapons, but the large file takes them on without a problem.</li>
            <li> I like the large one for pedicure work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used the large one for my heels</li>
            <li> The ends not shown in the picture are pointed with exception of the large file, it is rounded on both ends.</li>
            <li> I mean if you apply gentle pressure, you can file away a lot of nail very quickly (like a coarse file) but the edges of your nail are super smooth the whole time (like a fine file).</li>
            <li> They are like a coarse file and a fine file all in one - by that</li>
            <li> they have a fine coarse side on one side and a smoother side on the ohter.</li>
            <li> The large nail file works really well for roughened/calloused cuticles.</li>
            <li> You really have to be cautious when filing because you might take a lot of your nail off</li>
            <li> The crystal glass works much better than traditional emery boards and leaves the edge of the nail smooth instead of rough cut.</li>
            <li> These seem to be very well made.</li>
            <li> They were packaged very well in their&lt;br /&gt;individual</li>
            <li> But, any time I&#x27;ve had nails, I HAVE to keep them filed… if they get much beyond the tips, they get in the way</li>
            <li> These were even better than I expected.</li>
            <li> They are very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> REAL crystal here..</li>
            <li> I talked them up so much that my Mom wanted one</li>
            <li> they wear really well</li>
            <li> These work really well and seem to be well made.</li>
            <li> My nails grow fast and require a lot of upkeep.</li>
            <li> Purchased these and they absolutely work.</li>
            <li> Leaves my nails actually smooth instead of gritty feeling.</li>
            <li> Better than I even expected</li>
            <li> aside, these files work very well</li>
            <li> These files are the real deal.</li>
            <li> and real crystal.</li>
            <li> These files are the real deal, not those bulky glass fakes.  </li>
            <li> But really I just wanted to offer this tip:&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> Really well made and well priced.</li>
            <li> They really make your nails feel smooth and they file your nails down quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The large pedicure one is great and the small purse size one is too, however the middle size which is about the size of a regular emery board is smooth on both sides, as I bought them in Feb.</li>
            <li> I ordered these to use on my baby as I heard they are more gentle then other options.</li>
            <li> I had been previously using some very fine grit (~280) nail files from the drug store, which were the finest grit I could find.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m trying to make my salon as echo friendly and sanitary as possible so my clients can be relaxed and not worry if they&#x27;ll catch something.</li>
            <li> Usually I have to go over my nails with a very fine sanding block to get rid of the sharp edges, but with these files it&#x27;s quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Last for ages and ages and just rinse under water to clean.  </li>
            <li> I need something a little more subtle, able to fine tune.</li>
            <li> Use them, rinse them with warm water, allow to dry and put back in their covers.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sturdy, and I like the cool, blue color.</li>
            <li> I love the two smaller sizes, though find the larger size one not to have much use</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the redeeming quality of this product is it filed down my nails in a couple seconds.</li>
            <li> only part I didn&#x27;t love was that my nails felt a bit rough right after filling.</li>
            <li> I took the files out and used the clear side and was amazed at how smoothly and quickly they filed my nails down.</li>
            <li> and they seem to last for much longer than any other kind of file.</li>
            <li> Instead of going back and forth many times you get the same results with one or two strokes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> highly recommend them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> HIGH QUALITY NAIL FILES...</li>
            <li> would highly recommend these and have even gotten sets for friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend them highly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Filing with these crystal files does not leave your nails rough and I didn&#x27;t need to try and file in one direction all the time because the grain is so fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Emory boards are fine and all, but they&#x27;re really rough</li>
            <li> So far, I really like these.  </li>
            <li> Well worth buying the triple set to have in various locations.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s a normal amount of &amp;#34;ack!&amp;#34; then it&#x27;s no biggie.</li>
            <li> However, they give me a distinct nails-on-chalkboard sensation when I use them (especially the largest one).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this type of nail file to anyone who needs a new nail file.</li>
            <li> Other than that works fine.</li>
            <li> I have seen the same product in other retail stores for a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It might, if I could afford to use a new file every time, because the files wear out after one use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Another good use is to buff down any rough patches of skin that sometimes developed around my cuticle area.  </li>
            <li> you have never had these before get them they are the very best!And last forever!!Love them so much .</li>
            <li> so using a regular emery board just makes them even more ragged leaving, of course, a rough finish as well.</li>
            <li> These files are great for keeping nails healthy and retards splitting.</li>
            <li> problem, which isn&#x27;t really a problem unless it&#x27;s someones major issue, is that you *</li>
            <li> We kept this right next to the nursing chair and still use it now with a 1 year old.</li>
            <li> Not only do they work well, but they&#x27;re pretty.</li>
            <li> They also seem to be pretty solid</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with these glass nail files and will never again use a harsh, scratchy emery board or metal file ever again!</li>
            <li> The big one is REALLY big but love the smaller 2!</li>
            <li> Product as described and pretty blue.</li>
            <li> Pretty and blue.  </li>
            <li> The color is beautiful(dark blue to frost white), I get three sizes and clean up is so easy; just rinse,  air dry, then put them back in the sleeve.</li>
            <li> The smallest one is about the size of a cigarette or lighter, the middle one is the normal file size and the large one is rounded on each end and wider/taller than both of the others.</li>
            <li> Takes much less filing to smooth nails.  </li>
            <li> I had previously purchased a crystal file that had the abrasive surface &amp;#34;sprayed&amp;#34; on, and one file with my nail turned it into a sheet of smooth glass...</li>
            <li> It takes me half the time to file my nails with these as compared to cheap paper/foam emery boards.</li>
            <li> The little ones less, good for shaping.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how big the large one was</li>
            <li> efficient, clean, long lasting</li>
            <li> And i can see a clear difference in the health of my nails.</li>
            <li> These glide over your nails softly, without the gut-wrenching feel/sound of a regular file, and yet they get the job done twice as fast.</li>
            <li> So the two smaller files are very usable.</li>
            <li> My nails feel so much smoother than with your standard nail file</li>
            <li> My two year old sister plays with them and Ive never had one break.</li>
            <li> I am 65 years old &amp; I never knew these files existed.  </li>
            <li> I think that each side has both a &amp;#34;sharpening&amp;#34; spot (the section near the handle) and a &amp;#34;finishing&amp;#34; spot (which is the part near the tip).</li>
            <li> If I do happen to drop them and they break, I will replace them immediately as they have completely changed my willingness to care for my nails.</li>
            <li> really haven&#x27;t used the much larger 180 grit file.</li>
            <li> My old Revlon nail file is 7 years old, and while it still works, with 3 women in the house, we always fight for it.</li>
            <li> They easily round out your nails and leave a smooth edge.</li>
            <li> These have really taken my manicures to the next level, and have also really helped in my Jamberry Wrap application as a final step.</li>
            <li> These last, clean up well, and will take off as much or as little nail as you need, depending on how much pressure you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I LOVE these files - no more ripping, tearing, torturing my nails!</li>
            <li> And I can use it when my feet are dry (i.e. without soaking my feet first).</li>
            <li> I no longer cut, these can file really hard and fast or you can barely press and smooth the skin.</li>
            <li> They take my nails down quickly without that nails on chalkboard feeling.</li>
            <li> Love the sizes, a small one to throw in my bag, a medium one to use on my hands and a larger file for my feet.</li>
            <li> No, seriously, I just want them PUSHED BACK.  </li>
            <li> so I can get back to doing NORMAL guy stuff like hunting zombies.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Until you use a file that doesn&#x27;t disintegrate, you never really realize how much nail is coming off!</li>
            <li> They are far superior to metal (harsh) or emery board (slow, wears off &amp; becomes ineffective).</li>
            <li> These leave a very smooth edge, so far I have not experienced the splitting and cracking</li>
            <li> the big one is aggressive;  great for guys and artificial nails.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dropped them several times on my tile floor already and so far they have yet to break.</li>
            <li> I am a guy, in my early 30&#x27;s, and no one had ever explained proper nail care to me.</li>
            <li> Shapes well with no rough edges.  </li>
            <li> Even though I read the rave reviews I was surprised by how different these are.</li>
            <li> If this sensation happens to be at the top of your list for things you can&#x27;t imagine worse than, then perhaps skip it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they work just as good with artificial nails, because I&#x27;ve never tried those.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am able to file down the length efficiently, so no more need for those old files nor my nail clippers.</li>
            <li> (be it the file or the file case) because I looked away for a minute to get the next nail thing I need -- quick little thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very nice files and much less expensive than others you can buy.</li>
            <li> You can hardly use it to clean beneath you nails, once you file them.</li>
            <li> Nice files, however the longer file is a little too thick.</li>
            <li> blade is thin enough to edge under my nail for a cleaner edge:-)</li>
            <li> I suggest them to anyone with weak or strong nails.</li>
            <li> These are exactly the same for a lot less.</li>
            <li> This is my second order for these files--not because I wore out the first set, just misplaced them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had glass files in the past and liked them, but these files are quite thick</li>
            <li> Ever since I&#x27;ve started using my crystal nail files my finger nails have actually stopped splitting and peeling, and I don&#x27;t even use a nail clipper anymore because these nail files file the nail down SO quickly that that&#x27;s all I use now about once every other week.</li>
            <li> I really wish they were a little thinner.</li>
            <li> It was so much easier to use the small nail file on those tiny baby fingernails and toenails rather than battling with the clipper!  </li>
            <li> The large one I use for toenails, the medium one I use for fingernails and the small one I keep in my handbag.</li>
            <li> I keep the small one at work, and the large one at home.</li>
            <li> I am hoping they will last a long time.</li>
            <li> They last a really long time.  </li>
            <li> if you use the flat portions but the sanding effect does not go around so when trying to file the corners of nails I had to find another type of file.  </li>
            <li> I can tell the minor jags the larger grit can&#x27;t pick up.</li>
            <li> With care, I expect them to last for a long time and</li>
            <li> Now that my baby is older, I use the clipper, but I still reach for these to file down rough edges.  </li>
            <li> and I feel like they will last a long time!</li>
            <li> I have a couple of other sets and they are thinner especially the smaller ones.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than cutting</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are the same grit on all three and work as expected.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re obviously more expensive than your typical nail file</li>
            <li> When they feel like they are getting dull, just wash the nail dust out and they are new again!</li>
            <li> They seem really sturdy and since they&#x27;re glass they don&#x27;t wear down and become dull like standard nail files.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard they can last years as long as you don&#x27;t drop/step on and break them, but I&#x27;ve only had mine a few months</li>
            <li> The other types of nail files often left my nails with an edge</li>
            <li> I do lose them on occasion, which is the only reason I ever have to buy a other set.</li>
            <li> The other two, however, aren&#x27;t that terrific.  </li>
            <li> I actually had to be very careful not to over-file.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the goal--to use these in addition to emu oil to avoid cuticle debauchery by every single nail salon I&#x27;ve ever, ever, ever visited.  </li>
            <li> I had gotten so sick of how quickly emery boards and nail files wore out that I came on amazon to find a highly rated metal one.</li>
            <li> and I have actually used them to take down the length with no trouble and very little wear on the file.  </li>
            <li> my nails are actually splitting less at the ends.  </li>
            <li> And it actually makes much less noise than the disposable filers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Less gross feeling than an emery board.</li>
            <li> I just file out any inconsistencies once.</li>
            <li> They can also leave your nails rough</li>
            <li> They are glass and are breakable, so careful where you drop them.</li>
            <li> I used to shave off the callused skin with one of those skin slicer things (think cheese slicer) but you have to be careful with those</li>
            <li> and it still left them feeling jagged or uneven.</li>
            <li> careful when selecting from Amazon, as well.</li>
            <li> and l don&#x27;t feel like they are too rough for nails</li>
            <li> I had a set of these a few years ago, but lost the 2 smaller ones.</li>
            <li> I was curious how they would perform since I had never heard of them before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He loves them, not too keen on the pink shade we now have</li>
            <li> No thanks.  </li>
            <li> for some reason my cat loves it too  and tries to lick and bite it</li>
            <li> I am a man, but my toenails get rough</li>
            <li> carefully while filing&lt;br /&gt;Too</li>
            <li> did not take a star off since the fact that it is so sharp and thus rough</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent in years!</li>
            <li> i had come across these at a local festival that was charging $8 for a small file and $30 for the set.</li>
            <li> I bought the small one but lost it before I left.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the middle sized one, and have the small one in my purse if I need it.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;ll be using the giant one or not,</li>
            <li> I have other Crystal Files that have not had this issue.</li>
            <li> No more splits for my fragile, brittle nails!  </li>
            <li> actually keep the small one at my desk at work, just in case it is needed.</li>
            <li> The grooves are etched into the glass and doesn&#x27;t feel very rough like sand paper the way other nail files do, but they file nails like knives through butter.</li>
            <li> … I&#x27;m way too active (and fidgety) to have them any longer than that.</li>
            <li> A little too rough, bulky.</li>
            <li> makes you have to file less than any other file.</li>
            <li> The big one is hard to use.</li>
            <li> Prior to the past few months, it might have totaled about a month maybe.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews, especially the negative ones.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they are really thick even the smaller ones.</li>
            <li> and my PC has been down</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are sharp, a little sharper than essie (which means it will leave you with nails</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a few other files before and none did the job as well as this or lasted this long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A nail clipper is still slightly faster though...</li>
            <li> slightly rougher)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Before you realize it, half your nail is gone.</li>
            <li> At first use, I thought they weren&#x27;t doing anything because I&#x27;m accustomed to the harsher cutting of diamond files and emory.</li>
            <li> From past experience, they can break if they are dropped to a hard surface from enough height.</li>
            <li> Rinse them or pour a little alcohol over them to sanitize every once in awhile.</li>
            <li> so they tear off on any little</li>
            <li> You can take off as much or as little as you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought these as a little gift for the wife.</li>
            <li> These work really well on artificial nails</li>
            <li> I only had ONE problem with them, they came taped together in their pouches and when you remove the tape it leaves that irritating sticky residue that even my degreaser couldn&#x27;t get rid of.</li>
            <li> I put the baby one in my purse and have used it a few times.  </li>
            <li> The medium one is missing.</li>
            <li> Now I have to go through the trouble of returning it.</li>
            <li> Especially on rough heels.</li>
            <li> and I feel like they peel less too!</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve never had a nail file damage my nails and leave them so rough and broken before.</li>
            <li> feeling I usually get with nail files.</li>
            <li> I bought a small glass file on a whim years ago.</li>
            <li> No more split peeling nails.</li>
            <li> If they had a set of just small sizes, I&#x27;d get that, too...&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a huge investment,  and your nails will thank you!</li>
            <li> and I find them hard to use on my small fingers.</li>
            <li> It did take some getting used to; you can&#x27;t push too hard, you have to let the file do the work.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t dull after repeated use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They will break if you hit it against hard surface.</li>
            <li> was skeptical about using a glass one because I worried that it might leave rough edges or just be ineffective.</li>
            <li> It loses it&#x27;s finish after one use.</li>
            <li> but I still treat them delicately because they are made of glass.</li>
            <li> or I don&#x27;t know what, but they snagged delicate clothes.</li>
            <li> No more emery boards!  </li>
            <li> (cause you know the small one is in my purse!)</li>
            <li> but I thought they were a little too expensive.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle and also doesn&#x27;t make the terrible nails on a chalk board</li>
            <li> but the performance was not great.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m going to either get annoyed with them or start picking at them</li>
            <li> I have thin nails(if</li>
            <li> I have not had a broken nail ever since.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for awhile now, and they have yet to fail me.</li>
            <li> or else I&#x27;ll get obsessed and pick at it…)</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with these nail files</li>
            <li> and unfortunately I gave them as gifts.</li>
            <li> Sadly this is nothing like it.</li>
            <li> , I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Thin sounds like it would be bad when you&#x27;re thinking about a glass file</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll work for artificial nails.</li>
            <li> If I wasn&#x27;t worried about getting nail/cuticle fungus again, I would opt for the cutting.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with it!</li>
            <li> Nothing bad to say.</li>
            <li> I have always hated the feeling of nail files and clippers, and because of this I have often failed at keeping my nails neatly trimmed.</li>
            <li> but now if I file and don&#x27;t follow up with these bad boys, it just drives me crazy!</li>
            <li> I was very unhappy with this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I adore them, and I used to hate the feeling of filing my nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always hated having roughness or jagged edges anywhere on my nails.</li>
            <li> Worst of all, it took 1 hour to file my toenails.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost been 2 years since I&#x27;ve bought these and they still work great! I use the larger one the most because I feel I have more control with it. It smooths out the edges of my nail and feels like it&#x27;s not damaging it. You really have to be cautious when filing because you might take a lot of your nail off lol so don&#x27;t file too hard.</li>
            <li> The main reason I chose a crystal file was because I heard they were better for nails and  left them smooth. However, I&#x27;ve never had a nail file damage my nails and leave them so rough and broken before. I was very unhappy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;However, the redeeming quality of this product is it filed down my nails in a couple seconds. It was only nice when I needed to shorten my nails quickly. I actually had to be very careful not to over-file. A nail clipper is still slightly faster though...</li>
            <li> You have to try these to believe it. Had for over a year, they work as good as the day I got them. I use them incessantly, for nails and the skin around the nails. I no longer cut, these can file really hard and fast or you can barely press and smooth the skin. Just so amazing, would buy again and again but they last forever so no need :)</li>
            <li> Love the set.  Files nails beautifully</li>
            <li> Quality - will last many years</li>
            <li> Great product. Much better quality than a previously-owned glass nail file made in China.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely hands down the best nail files ever!</li>
            <li> These work really well on artificial nails and they seem to last for much longer than any other kind of file.</li>
            <li> So far, I really like these.  They just feel more gentle on my nails than the cardboard ones you buy in the store.  I am hoping they will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Happy enough with this item that I bought several more sets as stocking stuffers for Christmas -- my closest friends and all the women/girls in my family are getting a set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike emory boards or metal nail files, the grain on these is so fine that it leaves your nails with an almost polished edge.</li>
            <li> Wonderful!  I will never use a drug store emery board again. Great gift for anyone one who likes natural nails.</li>
            <li> Yes, I&#x27;m a guy, but I still can&#x27;t stand it when my nails look or feel ragged. These things work and they work quick so I can get back to doing NORMAL guy stuff like hunting zombies.</li>
            <li> they are easier to use than emory boards, they dont make me grit my teeth, but i have to be very gentle, or they can really take off a lot of nail at one time.  i like them.</li>
            <li> Received 2 sets, one for me and one for my sis.  These files are the best no rough edges no tearing of the nails. Takes much less filing to smooth nails.  Last for ages and ages and just rinse under water to clean.  I have been telling my friends about them.  No contest between these and emery boards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these sets before and love them!</li>
            <li> My wife loves these files. She said they are the best she has ever used.</li>
            <li> Great glass files that really do the job. My large toe nails have been used as weapons, but the large file takes them on without a problem. Filing in any direction helps too.</li>
            <li> These crystal nail files are fantastic. I had been previously using some very fine grit (~280) nail files from the drug store, which were the finest grit I could find. These are even finer, but they are so effective at filing. I am able to file down the length efficiently, so no more need for those old files nor my nail clippers. Having the 3 sizes is great, I keep the smallest in my purse and the other 2 on my vanity. They work so well, my nails are actually splitting less at the ends.  I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> I love these Etched Crystal Glass Manicure Nail files,I have been gifting these because they do what they say!When i get a snag and i do often these are perfect!If you have never had these before get them they are the very best!And last forever!!Love them so much .</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking fot. Love the color. Works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always hated having roughness or jagged edges anywhere on my nails. I used to spend an exorbitant amount of time trying to file my nails *just right* with a metal nail file. More often than not, I&#x27;d end up finding more places that needed filing just after I finished filing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I just file out any inconsistencies once. Done. Best ten buck I&#x27;ve spent in years!</li>
            <li> Very nice files, came exactly as described, each with their own little pouch. I only had ONE problem with them, they came taped together in their pouches and when you remove the tape it leaves that irritating sticky residue that even my degreaser couldn&#x27;t get rid of. Nothing makes me more angry. But files are great so it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Great product.  When they feel like they are getting dull, just wash the nail dust out and they are new again!</li>
            <li> Product arrived promptly. Beautiful colors but the performance was not great.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews,  they are even more beautiful in person.  I bought a set for myself and another for part of a mother&#x27;s day gift. I know that see will love she has been borrowing mine.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I have been using crystal nail files for more than ten years.  They are really great and give nails a professional finish.  No more emery boards!  Bought this set for my niece.  I make sure they are made in the Czech Republic. Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried these yet, you&#x27;re going to love them. Beautiful AND so practical.</li>
            <li> Good quality, bought a couple sets because they will break easily if they are dropped. These are great for feet....love them in the summertime!</li>
            <li> Best Nail file ever. It will be the last one you ever buy.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to try a glass file for a while now and I&#x27;m glad I finally did.  These leave a very smooth edge, so far I have not experienced the splitting and cracking I&#x27;ve had with emery boards or sapphire files.  Plus they are very pretty, and the smallest one is perfect for carrying around in my purse.  I&#x27;m very happy I decided to buy these.</li>
            <li> These leave my nails really smooth at the edges.  I keep in their cases and wash with soap and water after each use.  Will have for many years.</li>
            <li> Nice files, however the longer file is a little too thick. Of course, if it were thinner, it would be too fragile. So the two smaller files are very usable.</li>
            <li> I ordered these to use on my baby as I heard they are more gentle then other options. I&#x27;m so glad I did! It is very gentle and also doesn&#x27;t make the terrible nails on a chalk board feeling I usually get with nail files.</li>
            <li> All ends were suppose to be rounded and they are not.</li>
            <li> great quality... works great... love them and would buy again</li>
            <li> I had gotten so sick of how quickly emery boards and nail files wore out that I came on amazon to find a highly rated metal one. These came up in the results and people had really great things to say, so I said, &amp;#34;What the heck?&amp;#34; And decided to try them myself. Not only are they beautiful, they work great and I feel like they will last a long time!</li>
            <li> Great crystal files. The large one I use for toenails, the medium one I use for fingernails and the small one I keep in my handbag. Use them, rinse them with warm water, allow to dry and put back in their covers. Easy peasy.</li>
            <li> I love these types of files. They come in great colors.</li>
            <li> these files are awesome and do an incredible job.  I especially like that the big one is great for using to get calluses off your feet.  Highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> I had a glass file previously and loved it.  It broke so I found these replacements. I like the large one for pedicure work.</li>
            <li> Fabulous nail files. Came across these at a friend&#x27;s house and it has revolutionized my nail filing needs. The crystal glass works much better than traditional emery boards and leaves the edge of the nail smooth instead of rough cut. Well worth buying the triple set to have in various locations. These seem to be very well made. Color is great and they each come in a plastic protective cover.</li>
            <li> My sister loved these. Not only do they work well, but they&#x27;re pretty.</li>
            <li> These are terrific!  I like the two smaller sizes best because they fit my toe and finger nails best.  These have allowed me to reduce the amount of trimming I do to my nails, and I like that.  If I broke these, I&#x27;d buy another set.</li>
            <li> Love. Love. Love. These things last forever and they&#x27;re so cute. I love the multiple sizes and the handy little sleeves they are in for storing.  My nails feel so much smoother than with your standard nail file and I feel like they peel less too! Double win! They&#x27;re obviously more expensive than your typical nail file but they last along time and give great results... Completely worth it :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for awhile now, and they have yet to fail me. I adore them, and I used to hate the feeling of filing my nails. Rinse them or pour a little alcohol over them to sanitize every once in awhile. Mine are holding up great.</li>
            <li> i LOVE these and highly recommend them, excellent quality!!</li>
            <li> I love that these come in a set of 3. One for my office desk, one for my purse, one at home. My two year old sister plays with them and Ive never had one break. And i can see a clear difference in the health of my nails. ive been using them for months now. I very much suggest and have been telling my friends about them.</li>
            <li> These were suggested to me as a purchase when I was expecting my baby.  It was so much easier to use the small nail file on those tiny baby fingernails and toenails rather than battling with the clipper!  Now that my baby is older, I use the clipper, but I still reach for these to file down rough edges.  Beautiful, useful, and a great price!</li>
            <li> Turns your nails into a fine powder. Great for this massage therapist.</li>
            <li> After breaking my nail-biting habit a few years ago, I have had to keep my nails perfectly smooth and flawlessly shaped. I have been using 4-way disposable filers from my local beauty shop. They wear out quickly, so I decided to search for a more economical option.&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical about using a glass one because I worried that it might leave rough edges or just be ineffective. I was also very concerned that filing would make a nails-on-a-chalkboard sound, but it doesn&#x27;t! And it actually makes much less noise than the disposable filers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> These are the best files of any type that I&#x27;ve ever used!  There are no nail snags when using these files.  They seem to polish the edges.</li>
            <li> Already have some at home so I ordered extras for work</li>
            <li> Very pleased with these files.  My nails look so nice after using. They were packaged very well in their&lt;br /&gt;individual sleeves and in a cotton filled box.  Little one stays in my purse and the size is perfect.</li>
            <li> Love these, perfect in every way. Nails nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Never tried these before then ended up buying a second set as a gift in a different color. It did take some getting used to; you can&#x27;t push too hard, you have to let the file do the work. Otherwise, nothing too exciting, I liked this color best because the pink was pretty girly.</li>
            <li> It loses it&#x27;s finish after one use.</li>
            <li> I really love this type of nail file. The file has a nice fine grit so you don&#x27;t tear up your nail. They are a nice color and I like the different sizes. My only complaint is that they are really thick even the smaller ones. I really wish they were a little thinner. I have a couple of other sets and they are thinner especially the smaller ones. Otherwise this is a great product. I give them as gifts all the time.</li>
            <li> I am 65 years old &amp; I never knew these files existed.  Using metal files or emery boards can ruin your nail or cause mistakes in filing and you need to cut your nails off so you can start again. They can also leave your nails rough so they tear off on any little catch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filing with these crystal files does not leave your nails rough and I didn&#x27;t need to try and file in one direction all the time because the grain is so fine. And when I consider that they won&#x27;t wear out, the mind boggles.</li>
            <li> Nothing bad to say. So happy I bought these</li>
            <li> Love the different sizes. One for fingers, one for toes, and one for travel</li>
            <li> Beautiful set of files. Very fine grain producing a super finish...no snagging:-)&lt;br /&gt;The blade is thin enough to edge under my nail for a cleaner edge:-)</li>
            <li> love these files, exactly what i was looking for.  The grit is perfect and they are dual sided, The file themselves are nice and thin so you can get into corners. Thin sounds like it would be bad when you&#x27;re thinking about a glass file but it is exactly what you need for function.  They are plenty durable.  I&#x27;ve dropped this kind of file plenty of times and while it technically could break, they haven&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Beautiful product.  Elegant tool for lifetime.</li>
            <li> i had come across these at a local festival that was charging $8 for a small file and $30 for the set. I bought the small one but lost it before I left. I was so happy when I found the set here. The price is amazing and so is the quality!!</li>
            <li> I love glass nail files. They say they don&#x27;t wear out but the last one I had did. These look a lot better and nicer quality. I love how there are different sizes too.</li>
            <li> Glass is the way to go! Best nail files ever &amp; travel sized one comes in handy! Will be purchasing more in a different color.</li>
            <li> Love these! Came in a nice box &amp; separate cases for each one. Expect to enjoy them for years!</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best the nail files around. don&#x27;t hesitate, GET IT!</li>
            <li> These files are great! Admittedly, I haven&#x27;t had nails very much of my life. Prior to the past few months, it might have totaled about a month maybe. But, any time I&#x27;ve had nails, I HAVE to keep them filed… if they get much beyond the tips, they get in the way and I&#x27;m going to either get annoyed with them or start picking at them… I&#x27;m way too active (and fidgety) to have them any longer than that. SO, I do have experience filing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emory boards are fine and all, but they&#x27;re really rough and you also end up replacing them often if you have a lot of filing to do (lately I have to do a fair amount every week as they&#x27;re growing pretty quick). I bought these as sort of a present to myself for actually keeping my nails for several weeks. They really do an incredible job, without being too rough. It used to be a couple more steps while I slowly got them flawless (they have to be perfectly smooth at the ends or else I&#x27;ll get obsessed and pick at it…) but now I can go right from this to my really fine file and I&#x27;m done. Until you use a file that doesn&#x27;t disintegrate, you never really realize how much nail is coming off! So you might want to make sure you file over something with these. They clean up flawless too. I&#x27;ve been using the middle sized one, and have the small one in my purse if I need it. Not sure if I&#x27;ll be using the giant one or not, but it&#x27;s there if I need it. They&#x27;re a pretty shade of blue too. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only problem, which isn&#x27;t really a problem unless it&#x27;s someones major issue, is that you *can* get that &amp;#34;nails/chalkboard&amp;#34; feeling. I remember seeing someone ask about that in the questions. I&#x27;ve gotten it a couple brief times, and yeah, it&#x27;s jarring, but it&#x27;s brief. But when you get the hang of the file, you can avoid it by the angle or something (I didn&#x27;t have any issue last time, so it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s a regular occurrence). If this sensation happens to be at the top of your list for things you can&#x27;t imagine worse than, then perhaps skip it. If it&#x27;s a normal amount of &amp;#34;ack!&amp;#34; then it&#x27;s no biggie.</li>
            <li> These were even better than I expected. They seem really sturdy and since they&#x27;re glass they don&#x27;t wear down and become dull like standard nail files. I&#x27;ve dropped them several times on my tile floor already and so far they have yet to break.</li>
            <li> These are my first glass files and I was a bit hesitant.  Now, I love them.  They are very sturdy.  They file nails quickly and leave the edges smooth.  The large file is great for smoothing rough places on feet.  Plus, they&#x27;re pretty!  I&#x27;m back to buy a set for a family member...</li>
            <li> I have never heard of these until I ordered them. Wow they are very nice so gentle but effective on nails and heels of my feet. I get a VERY smooth effect, so much nicer than emery boards or skin rasps. I am so happy with the results. I plan to buy more for gifts.</li>
            <li> Why I like these files:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are sharp, a little sharper than essie (which means it will leave you with nails slightly rougher)&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t dull after repeated use.&lt;br /&gt;The quality is amazing! It fell and did not break unlike my essie file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that it comes in 3 different sizes and each one has an individual plastic case. I conveniently keep the mini size in my handbag for emergency filling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a few other files before and none did the job as well as this or lasted this long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that they can be sanitized and reused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only part I didn&#x27;t love was that my nails felt a bit rough right after filling. I have to go over them with a buffer or finer file or wait a day or two till it smoothes out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not take a star off since the fact that it is so sharp and thus rough makes you have to file less than any other file. Instead of going back and forth many times you get the same results with one or two strokes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review is helpful to you :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a lot of crystal nails, and these are by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> These files are wonderful. Great quality, pretty, &amp; the price is the cherry on the sundae!</li>
            <li> Works well and great to have one in my office, purse and manicure box.</li>
            <li> Perfect files, I am glad I purchased these.</li>
            <li> I have used crystal files for years, and when my last one broke, I ordered these.  Very nice files and much less expensive than others you can buy.</li>
            <li> Before you realize it, half your nail is gone. I need something a little more subtle, able to fine tune.</li>
            <li> I like the files but I thought they were a little too expensive. I have seen the same product in other retail stores for a more reasonable price. Colors are beautiful. Nice purse size as well.</li>
            <li> As far as filing goes works just fine. However issue that I am having is thickness of the file. You can hardly use it to clean beneath you nails, once you file them. That is downside. Other than that works fine.</li>
            <li> These are the ones I was looking for.  Love them.</li>
            <li> These files work wonderful.</li>
            <li> REAL crystal here.. not glass.. LOVE them will buy again!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have several sets, one fore me, and another set for my pets, the parrots love getting their toes filed! There is no stress for the dogs or birds anymore!!</li>
            <li> These glass files cut well and are easy to use.  They last a really long time.  To keep them from clogging up, wash them once in a while to prolong their life.</li>
            <li> I bought these Czech crystal glass nail files several years ago and they loved them.  Have looked for them for a while and was happy to find them again.  They are glass and are breakable, so careful where you drop them.</li>
            <li> Great quality! I just wish they came with cases....</li>
            <li> I love love love this nail file set! Ive been using them consistently for the last 8 months and they still file great! Works well on toenails or fingernails. Super cute and really durable. I doubt I would need to replace them anytime soon but if I did, I would buy again!</li>
            <li> These are beautiful and they work very well.  However, they give me a distinct nails-on-chalkboard sensation when I use them (especially the largest one).</li>
            <li> HIGH QUALITY NAIL FILES...REALLY LAST.  BETTER THAN THE KNOCK OFFS</li>
            <li> These are very nice but they are very fine, so you may need more time to file your nails. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll work for artificial nails.</li>
            <li> These leave my nails smoother than my metal nail file. I think that each side has both a &amp;#34;sharpening&amp;#34; spot (the section near the handle) and a &amp;#34;finishing&amp;#34; spot (which is the part near the tip). I like this because I don&#x27;t have to keep flipping my nail file over. I&#x27;ve also used the large one for my heels and I love it! I used to shave off the callused skin with one of those skin slicer things (think cheese slicer) but you have to be careful with those and it still left them feeling jagged or uneven. But this file makes my heels completely smooth! And I can use it when my feet are dry (i.e. without soaking my feet first). I definitely recommend these.</li>
            <li> The ever lasting nail file is here!</li>
            <li> Great files just the right tooth.  And great color.</li>
            <li> These files were precisely what I was looking for! They do their job quickly and leave my nails with nice smooth edges. They also seem to be pretty solid so I&#x27;m not constantly worried about breaking them. Also they were a great price.</li>
            <li> Very pretty to look at and fine if you use the flat portions but the sanding effect does not go around so when trying to file the corners of nails I had to find another type of file.  I have other Crystal Files that have not had this issue.</li>
            <li> Great files. Work great &amp; look exactly like they do in pic.</li>
            <li> The files are great. I&#x27;ve read that they are sturdy but I still treat them delicately because they are made of glass. The color is beautiful(dark blue to frost white), I get three sizes and clean up is so easy; just rinse,  air dry, then put them back in the sleeve. I have thin nails(if that is a significant factor for anybody thinking to buy) that bend and tear easily so using a regular emery board just makes them even more ragged leaving, of course, a rough finish as well. The large file does well on my feet and the small is great for travel. I say this is a great buy.</li>
            <li> These glass nail files are AMAZING!  They are like a coarse file and a fine file all in one - by that I mean if you apply gentle pressure, you can file away a lot of nail very quickly (like a coarse file) but the edges of your nail are super smooth the whole time (like a fine file). I highly recommend this type of nail file to anyone who needs a new nail file. Aside from the functionality, they&#x27;re beautiful!  After using these, I don&#x27;t even know why metal files exist anymore.</li>
            <li> No more splits for my fragile, brittle nails!  These are amazing!  Don&#x27;t hesitate.  The smallest one goes in my purse for emergencies, the medium is in my nail drawer, and is the largest is there too for toes.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with these nail files and unfortunately I gave them as gifts. They have a tendency to tear your nails and the feeling is similar to nails on a chalkboard. I would definitely not order again.</li>
            <li> works great,  looks stylish, durable</li>
            <li> The smaller ones are great. The big one is hard to use. A little too rough, bulky.</li>
            <li> These are the best nail files in the world.  Excellent price, 3 different sizes, etchings on both sides.  Perfect!</li>
            <li> Got these on time and I love them.  They leave my  nails feeling smooth after fileing</li>
            <li> There are only two parts of me that I take care of &#x3D; my teeth and my nails. My hair and skin just have to get along without any special attention. I&#x27;ve been doing mani/pedi at home since I was eleven-years-old so I&#x27;m quite expert at it by now (I&#x27;ll be 81 in May).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just gave away (to my trainer at the gym) my entire collection of nail files; I&#x27;m using the Czech glass ones exclusively. I love how gentle they are on my nails. I also use the largest one to smooth my feet. At first use, I thought they weren&#x27;t doing anything because I&#x27;m accustomed to the harsher cutting of diamond files and emory. But they work quietly and get the job done. My only caution is to remember that they&#x27;re glass and to handle them with care (as opposed to throwing a metal file in my handbag).</li>
            <li> Does a great job and great for plane travel! I have had the crystal glass finger nail file in my purse as a carry on for years. Now I have even more!</li>
            <li> These are really nice - great price and came individually in plastic sleeves. They file very smoothly.</li>
            <li> I have always hated the feeling of nail files and clippers, and because of this I have often failed at keeping my nails neatly trimmed. When I recently did research into proper nail care I found that there are much better files than the cheap ones I have used in the past. These glide almost smoothly across my nails (finger and toe) with MUCH better results. These are more than worth the investment as I can wash them when done and they are instantly as good as new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually keep the small one at my desk at work, just in case it is needed. I am a guy, in my early 30&#x27;s, and no one had ever explained proper nail care to me. My parents should have and with them failing, the U.S. Marine Corps should have, but I was only ever told to cut them short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased good clippers at the same time and now it doesn&#x27;t bother me to cut or file my nails. It is wonderful when you use the right tools for the job. If I do happen to drop them and they break, I will replace them immediately as they have completely changed my willingness to care for my nails.</li>
            <li> beautiful and get the job done</li>
            <li> Great manicure set!  I have 2 sets now and love them!</li>
            <li> Just stop reading right now and buy this, you WILL NOT regret it! I am absolutely in love with these glass nail files and will never again use a harsh, scratchy emery board or metal file ever again! These glide over your nails softly, without the gut-wrenching feel/sound of a regular file, and yet they get the job done twice as fast. Magic, I tell you. You can just rinse them with soap and water, or I&#x27;ve even heard of putting them in the utinsel basket in the dishwasher, and they look/work as good as new. I&#x27;ve heard they can last years as long as you don&#x27;t drop/step on and break them, but I&#x27;ve only had mine a few months so I can&#x27;t testify of that myself. The edges of my nails are so soft and look so healthy after using these, and my nails rarely split or break anymore. Just please, buy yourself some of these. It&#x27;s not a huge investment,  and your nails will thank you!</li>
            <li> These files are great for keeping nails healthy and retards splitting. I suggest them to anyone with weak or strong nails.</li>
            <li> Super product!  My nails have never been easier to maintain. Easy on the nails &amp; fingers. So good, I made sure I got some for everyone I know.</li>
            <li> These files are great. Do not buy glass files unless the say specifically that they are etched or else there will just be a textured sticker on the file that will wear off within one use. This seller has a great variety. These files leave a very smooth finish on your nail. They&#x27;re easy to clean with soap, water, and a brush. If you take care of these and make sure they don&#x27;t break they will last you forever.</li>
            <li> These nail files work wonderfully for little baby fingernails!  You don&#x27;t have to worry about trimming skin accidentally, and the smooth glass doesn&#x27;t hurt their skin!  We kept this right next to the nursing chair and still use it now with a 1 year old.</li>
            <li> I love these files! They take my nails down quickly without that nails on chalkboard feeling. I keep the small one at work, and the large one at home. I had previously purchased a crystal file that had the abrasive surface &amp;#34;sprayed&amp;#34; on, and one file with my nail turned it into a sheet of smooth glass... Not the case with these babies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really haven&#x27;t used the much larger 180 grit file.</li>
            <li> Excellent files well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Bought for ME &amp; a gift.  They are very nice</li>
            <li> I love, love, love these nail files, and I truly can&#x27;t say that enough. I&#x27;ve always had weaker nails that tended to peel or split, but alas I kept fighting the good fight for healthy looking nails. I bought these files after reading that crystal files are actually better for your nails than the metal ones that can often do damage to the tips. Ever since I&#x27;ve started using my crystal nail files my finger nails have actually stopped splitting and peeling, and I don&#x27;t even use a nail clipper anymore because these nail files file the nail down SO quickly that that&#x27;s all I use now about once every other week. A couple more positives they don&#x27;t make that stereotypical nail file noise that always make me crings, AND while I wasn&#x27;t expecting it the pedicure size file is AWESOME!!! I&#x27;ve never had smoother feet. I talked them up so much that my Mom wanted one so she went to a craft fair and paid $20 for ONE FILE. These are a MUCH BETTER value and I got her the full set for Christmas.</li>
            <li> When I got this I thought the colored side was the filing side and tried to use it. I thought there was no way I paid for something that couldnt file anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THEN I took the files out and used the clear side and was amazed at how smoothly and quickly they filed my nails down. I can file my nails and run them under my teeth and I cant feel any marks. Its smooth as butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is really nice as well. I am really glad I got these. Maybe now I can curb my nail biting habit</li>
            <li> I am giving a set to all the ladies on my list for Christmas.  I think it will be their favorite gift.  I just love mine.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt that they are pretty!!</li>
            <li> The big one is REALLY big but love the smaller 2! Fit anywhere and work like a dream!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these, the grit isn&#x27;t something like you&#x27;d fine on a normal files, it actually doesn&#x27;t really feel like they have a grit at all. They work really great, with little effort they get alot done. The smallest one is about the size of a cigarette or lighter, the middle one is the normal file size and the large one is rounded on each end and wider/taller than both of the others. They do have different grits it seems, but they all work great. Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> These are great!  the big one is aggressive;  great for guys and artificial nails.  The little ones less, good for shaping.  There is no glue-0n grit; the teeth are cut into the glass, so you just rinse them off and they are like new and clean.</li>
            <li> I bought a small glass file on a whim years ago. Loved it, wanted more, and wasted money on a number of the garbage &amp;#34;crystal&amp;#34; files sold in drugstores. It has to be etched glass, and for some reason only the Czechs make them. The others just have the grit glued on which means it comes off in use -- you may as well just buy emery boards. These last, clean up well, and will take off as much or as little nail as you need, depending on how much pressure you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful when selecting from Amazon, as well.There are so many variations, and some of them appear not to be etched glass. Read the reviews, especially the negative ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for quite awhile now and they work just as well now as the day I got them. They really make your nails feel smooth and they file your nails down quickly. Usually I have to go over my nails with a very fine sanding block to get rid of the sharp edges, but with these files it&#x27;s quick and easy. One step! These would make a great gift!</li>
            <li> Most amazing nail file set ever. thank you</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a nail tech and i&#x27;m trying to make my salon as echo friendly and sanitary as possible so my clients can be relaxed and not worry if they&#x27;ll catch something. these files are fantastic. the only issue i&#x27;ve found if the foot file isn&#x27;t the best for rougher feet but for personal use it works brilliantly. i&#x27;ll defiantly be buying again.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought these for gifts for people! they love them! they wear really well and l don&#x27;t feel like they are too rough for nails like some emories do</li>
            <li> Bought for my mother in-law years ago. Product as described and pretty blue.</li>
            <li> Very nice crystal glass manicure set.  Beautiful colors and excelent files.  They made great Christmas presents.  Will order again in the future.</li>
            <li> Very good nail files. These work really well and seem to be well made.</li>
            <li> These are the only kind of files I&#x27;ll ever use in my nails again</li>
            <li> My nails grow fast and require a lot of upkeep. These are good at both shaping and are fine enough for refining the edge. I used to have a tone of nail files with both medium and fine grains but one of these covers it all. These are the best I have used and I have yet to wear one out. I keep one at home, one in my purse and one in my car.</li>
            <li> I had a set of these a few years ago, but lost the 2 smaller ones. The ones that I ordered came earlier than I expected and are just great. Love them!</li>
            <li> Listen to the people who have had these for a while. Buy them. My old Revlon nail file is 7 years old, and while it still works, with 3 women in the house, we always fight for it. Worst of all, it took 1 hour to file my toenails. Now: not only are we amazed by the beauty of these files, but by the ease of use.</li>
            <li> Nice files. Shapes well with no rough edges.  A variety of sizes for all your needs.</li>
            <li> Great nail files!  So smooth.</li>
            <li> wished beatuy stores would sell more of these</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these files for a while and they seem to be losing their ability to file over time.</li>
            <li> Read where glass files were great for peeling nails, could not find in stores. Purchased these and they absolutely work. No more split peeling nails. Keep one in car, purse and one in manicure stuff</li>
            <li> Love these. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Even though I read the rave reviews I was surprised by how different these are. The ends of my nails feel incredibly smooth. Love them!</li>
            <li> Had I known about glass nail files earlier... I would have never bought anything else. They are far superior to metal (harsh) or emery board (slow, wears off &amp; becomes ineffective). The other types of nail files often left my nails with an edge or I don&#x27;t know what, but they snagged delicate clothes. Now that I&#x27;m using these, I haven&#x27;t had this problem.&lt;br /&gt;The small size is just perfect to keep in my purse/bag. If they had a set of just small sizes, I&#x27;d get that, too...&lt;br /&gt;Note: I have natural and strong nails. I don&#x27;t know if they work just as good with artificial nails, because I&#x27;ve never tried those.&lt;br /&gt;Since they are made of glass, they will break when dropped onto ceramic tile floor. Oops, that was not the product&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li> I am a man that had jagged nails and a Amazon Prime account. I mistakenly thought the blue color would convince me it was more mainly, but I was still a guy too girly to filing his nails on a belt sander.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are the same grit on all three and work as expected.</li>
            <li> These are really great - I was curious how they would perform since I had never heard of them before.&lt;br /&gt;They are finely textured but also very strong in smoothing your nails.  I found they work best when I file towards the center of the nail from both directions.  I will always have a set of these to take care of my nails from now on!!!</li>
            <li> Love the sizes, a small one to throw in my bag, a medium one to use on my hands and a larger file for my feet. Also, they&#x27;re super gentle on my nails. I&#x27;ll only use glass files from now on.</li>
            <li> These are the best files. Like how effective they are. I like a &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; file. These are fine, so if you are looking for a more coarse file, these are definitely not. But they work so well why use anything else...&lt;br /&gt;Run under hot water and good to go.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a nail file aficionado, but these seem to work great. They easily round out your nails and leave a smooth edge. They&#x27;re sturdy, and I like the cool, blue color. Also, they clean up quickly and thoroughly with a rinse under the faucet. Good product!</li>
            <li> This is my second order for these files--not because I wore out the first set, just misplaced them.  This are very effective at filing the nails, but are much more gentle to the nails than the traditional emory board style.  They work perfectly and don&#x27;t lose their effectiveness with use, as other files tend to do.  Seem like they&#x27;ll last a lifetime, so definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I had heard that glass nail files were best for your nails and that only those made in the Czech Republic were worth buying.  So I did my research and shopped around and decided on these - mine are actually the pink/purple gradient version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They arrived on time, packed in a nice box with cushy cotton.  Haven&#x27;t used the really big one yet.  The middle sized one is the one I go for the most.  I put the baby one in my purse and have used it a few times.  They do a good job of smoothing the nail edge and I have actually used them to take down the length with no trouble and very little wear on the file.  You can wash these so they are about as sanitary as it gets.  It&#x27;s very easy to get the perfect nail shape with these files.  You can take off as much or as little as you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another good use is to buff down any rough patches of skin that sometimes developed around my cuticle area.  It&#x27;s better than cutting and I have found that over time, the patches lessen somewhat so I don&#x27;t have to use the file as often.  I think the larger size file is meant for buffing foot callouses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend these and have even gotten sets for friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had glass files in the past and liked them, but these files are quite thick and I find them hard to use on my small fingers.</li>
            <li> My wife loves these files.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know these came in different grits. My husband needed a more abrasive filer and these were definitely more for finishing nails, not hard core filing. Luckily my Mother-in-Law had the exact same files, only with a more preferable grit, so we swapped! He loves them, not too keen on the pink shade we now have but I don&#x27;t mind. ;)</li>
            <li> i love these. efficient, clean, long lasting</li>
            <li> 5++++++++ stars!!!!! I LOVE these files - no more ripping, tearing, torturing my nails! I just received them so I can&#x27;t speak to their durability, but they work far better than I had hoped and I am very very happy! Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> I really love these.  they have a fine coarse side on one side and a smoother side on the ohter. the color is exact on the blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The large pedicure one is great and the small purse size one is too, however the middle size which is about the size of a regular emery board is smooth on both sides, as I bought them in Feb. and my PC has been down I couldn&#x27;t contact the company but maybe will later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend these The files are excellent ,feel good to use , gentle on the nail , gets the job done faster , and they are so pretty!</li>
            <li> Amazing nail files!  This is the perfect thing for soft, thin nails.  It does a nice smooth job and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;overfile&amp;#34; my nails.  I can&#x27;t believe the difference between this and all the files I&#x27;ve used over the years.  Very good choice!  Pretty colors too!</li>
            <li> Beautiful and works so much better than all the metal ones I&#x27;ve been using. Leaves my nails actually smooth instead of gritty feeling.</li>
            <li> I will never purchase a different nail file again. Ride or die best files ever!</li>
            <li> IF they lasted through more than one use.  Here&#x27;s the goal--to use these in addition to emu oil to avoid cuticle debauchery by every single nail salon I&#x27;ve ever, ever, ever visited.  In the magazines--and here&#x27;s what cracks me up--they tout the ability of a salon-goer to say, &amp;#34;No! Don&#x27;t cut my cuticles!&amp;#34;  Hmmm.  I&#x27;ve asked many, many times for my cuticles to only be pushed back.  Pushed back.  No, seriously, I just want them PUSHED BACK.  Here&#x27;s the thing--there&#x27;s no job security for the nail tech in &amp;#34;pushing back&amp;#34; my cuticles.  I thought that the combination of emu oil and these files would make all the difference, so that I could manage my own cuticle world.  It might, if I could afford to use a new file every time, because the files wear out after one use.  ONE USE.  If I wasn&#x27;t worried about getting nail/cuticle fungus again, I would opt for the cutting.  No thanks.  What is a girl to do???</li>
            <li> This was a gift because I already have them and like them so well.</li>
            <li> works well, everyone in the house uses them and they all love it. just wish it would have came with a cary case</li>
            <li> I purchased a set of these glass nail files some time ago. The bottom line is they&#x27;re truly worth the money. If you  have&lt;br /&gt;a dear member of your family, perhaps these files will make a thoughtful gift for her. My &amp;#34;Daughter-In-My -Heart&amp;#34;  is&lt;br /&gt;such a person.</li>
            <li> Better than I even expected</li>
            <li> I saw these at a trade show selling for about $25. These are exactly the same for a lot less. They are great nail files.</li>
            <li> Great quality and just beautiful files</li>
            <li> Best nail file set ever! I&#x27;m obsessed with it! I don&#x27;t know how I lived without it...I filed them the first day I receive them and it like sealed the edges. I have not had a broken nail ever since. They have actually grown. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Great product. I really like the glass files better than the metal ones and better than the emery boards.</li>
            <li> Works well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for some reason my cat loves it too  and tries to lick and bite it -- of course I don&#x27;t let her get to the biting but I often have to take it away from her licking (be it the file or the file case) because I looked away for a minute to get the next nail thing I need -- quick little thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That aside, these files work very well, I am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> In 2004 a friend gave me a genuine Czech Etched Crystal Glass manicure file.  I was amazed.  The only reason purchased this set is because I had dropped my manicure file on the floor and .... stepped on it.  Yup.  It broke after 14 years.  This is a wonderful set.  I&#x27;m still figuring out how to use the big one for my feet, and haven&#x27;t yet tried the wee one, but I have even used the middle one on the toe nails for my cat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little Socks allows me to do this with no issue.  But, today, I decided to use the tried and true clipper type ones on her toe nails, and she tried to bite me.  She didn&#x27;t like it at all.  So, I will gladly share my files for my fingernails and toenails with her.  This is an excellent price for this product and cost what the singular file cost 14 years ago.</li>
            <li> Another fantastic product work great.</li>
            <li> Pretty and blue.  Just learning how to use files and buffers on my nails.  Less gross feeling than an emery board.</li>
            <li> I  just opened the well sealed envelope and it has only two pieces in it. The medium one is missing. That is the most useful one. Now I have to go through the trouble of returning it.</li>
            <li> These are great bail files, but the grit is far too fine on the pedicure heel file. I got a great set made by Swarovski in Czech Republic, but the heel file broke and I was looking to replace it. Sadly this is nothing like it.</li>
            <li> These came at a very reasonable price and are of good quality. I didn&#x27;t realize how big the large one was but it&#x27;s definitely a statement. Anyways, it&#x27;s really worth a try. I love glass files over metal files or the board ones.</li>
            <li> Cobalt Blue Crystal Glass Nail Files work great and are easy on my nails. I have used other nail files but have had best results with these. They will break if you hit it against hard surface. That why I ordered this set to replace the one I broke. I had my set for years before I had to replace it. Still love this file.</li>
            <li> I am no expert, but this is the best nail file I have ever seen or used. They last an incredible amount of time, perform effectively, and are easily cleaned between uses in order to maximize their effectiveness. I would recommend these without hesitation to anyone seeking a quality emory board.</li>
            <li> These files are simply wonderful. They&#x27;re so much more gentle on nails than emery boards and steel files. They&#x27;re also much more economical than emery boards because they last virtually forever and require nothing more than a 5-second rinse under the faucet to refresh them. I do lose them on occasion, which is the only reason I ever have to buy a other set.</li>
            <li> Very good.  I am a man, but my toenails get rough so I bought this for them.  Works great, but I am not sure it is really any better than a metal fingernail file....but perhaps.</li>
            <li> Great files.  Unique gifts.</li>
            <li> I have purchased these glass files before, this set was a gift.  They are very beautiful and make a wonderful gift.  Glass files will last forever, unless they are dropped and break.  This price was excellent!</li>
            <li> Love em. Strong, good texture, makes filing my nails a cinch. Worth it, trust me. I once bought a cheap glass file thinking I was getting a better deal - Woo, I was wrong. The texture soon became smooth with enough use, even scratch off and reveal smooth glass underneath! These files are the real deal. Because of the texture of the file it can give me a bit of a cringing nails-on-a-chalkboard feeling, but that&#x27;s more of a me thing instead of a fault of the file itself.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous shades of blue&lt;br /&gt;Use carefully while filing&lt;br /&gt;Too quick, and you&#x27;re sure to flinch</li>
            <li> These are really nice files for a great price. I love the two smaller sizes, though find the larger size one not to have much use (The one star off). These have really taken my manicures to the next level, and have also really helped in my Jamberry Wrap application as a final step. I used to not be able to tell a difference when I used a file but now if I file and don&#x27;t follow up with these bad boys, it just drives me crazy! I can tell the minor jags the larger grit can&#x27;t pick up. I love that these came in a nice packaging, each individually wrapped and together in a box, and that I know they are good - no mercury, shatterproof (cause you know the small one is in my purse!) and real crystal. Also I get to pick which color I like - blue💙</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how wonderful these are!!  I gave the set to my mother for her birthday and will be ordering a set for myself.  These files will leave your nails unbelievably smooth and are a thousand times better than any other nail file I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and well made. Love using them.</li>
            <li> Bought these as a little gift for the wife. She liked them so much, I ended up ordering some more which she gives to her girlfriends. Since I don&#x27;t use them, all I can go by is what my wife has told me...she LOVES them!</li>
            <li> Great file. Would never go back to emery boards or regular nail file. Doesn&#x27;t split nails and gives nice even shape.</li>
            <li> These files are the real deal, not those bulky glass fakes.  The 3 pack provides the best sizes for home, purse or desk.  I won&#x27;t use other nail files or emery boards after experienced glass files.  These make nails so smooth without roughing up the nail.  I think they are perfect.</li>
            <li> The large nail file works really well for roughened/calloused cuticles. But really I just wanted to offer this tip:&lt;br /&gt;A travel toothbrush holder is the perfect size to use as a carrying case. Can hold all three files or 2 files and a cuticle trimmer, etc. Keeps glass nail files from breaking in an abused purse...</li>
            <li> Really well made and well priced. I&#x27;d recommend them highly.</li>
            <li> We purchased these primarily for my wife, who ordered two sets, but after trying one of hers, I got a set for myself as well. Although they work much like an emory board, they are easier and more pleasant to use due to their heft and rigidity. The &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; size is enough to remove nail material at a satisfactory rate, but not so coarse that they leave roughness, even when used on the nail surface. They&#x27;re good looking too. From past experience, they can break if they are dropped to a hard surface from enough height. They are glass, after all. With care, I expect them to last for a long time and my wife and I enjoy using them.</li>
            <li> The largest of the file is really great.  The other two, however, aren&#x27;t that terrific.  I use files more to smooth my feet than anything and the large file is great with that.  I tried to file my nails with the two smaller ones and didn&#x27;t feel like I was making a lot of progress</li>
            <li> These work great! Especially on rough heels. I use them on my feet and then put lotion on and it feels like a pedi.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to regular emery boards. They file cleanly and smoothly. They don&#x27;t leave jagged edges on my nails like the cheap nail files do. I even used the large one on my heels after the shower and it smoothed them over easily. They are sturdy. Even though they are made of glass I don&#x27;t feel like the will break easily. The ends not shown in the picture are pointed with exception of the large file, it is rounded on both ends. The grooves are etched into the glass and doesn&#x27;t feel very rough like sand paper the way other nail files do, but they file nails like knives through butter. It takes me half the time to file my nails with these as compared to cheap paper/foam emery boards. I will never go back.</li>
