            <li>great buy fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed with this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I am a nursing student and just wanted something to have around to practice on my family and friends, this works just fine for that!</li>
            <li>Got my product very quickly and was nicely packaged.</li>
            <li>Used it at health fairs on many patients.</li>
            <li>It was actually better than some of the ones we have at work.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t  even used this cuff more than 5 times before this happend.</li>
            <li>This one is better than 1st.</li>
            <li>After learning how to take BP manually in class, I wanted to get more practice in, so I bought this.</li>
            <li>After using it on just about every person I know, some more than once, it still works.</li>
            <li>The material for the cuff feels more like plastic.</li>
            <li>This is a grand piece piece of equipment for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>And works ok.</li>
            <li>so I am confident it&#x27;s being used correctly.</li>
            <li>It sits better on the patient&#x27;s arm.</li>
            <li>This should say more like a medium.  </li>
            <li>I am a nursing student and needed an inexpensive cuff for practice, I was able to get a large and adult cuff at an amazing price both of which work perfectly.</li>
            <li>Not high quality, but perfect for the home user.</li>
            <li>I received my BP cuff in a pretty timely manner from the date of purchase and was very pleased w/ the product.  </li>
            <li>Very Quick shipping....</li>
            <li>Easy fix.</li>
            <li>I HAVE RESULTS VERY QUICKLY.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use and easy to read.</li>
            <li>Cuff works just fine, no problems.</li>
            <li>Seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li>It worked fine until it gave out..</li>
            <li>The cuff is fine</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>It came quickly and I was able to use it at work.</li>
            <li>Cheap and great quality with key to calibrate included!</li>
            <li>Does not give accurate reading like the mercury blood pressure meter, they should sell the sthethescope along with it as well.</li>
            <li>but I have had problems getting an accurate reading.</li>
            <li>it inflates and deflates and reads accurately?</li>
            <li>This purchase was hassle free and dealing with the seller was a pleasure.  </li>
            <li>Overall great product and will continue to purchase from this company.</li>
            <li>So far workin good, I like it</li>
            <li>The quality was pretty good and the price was reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I am using it to learn and its a straightforward reliable, affordable cuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a unique customer for this product.</li>
            <li>But there is nothing special about this sphygmomanometer, though.</li>
            <li>I got what I expected and I happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li>This is the most accurate, but also the most technical, way to check blood pressure.</li>
            <li>Works great, came faster than expected.</li>
            <li>Not bad for $10.</li>
            <li>It pumps up easily, seems accurate, and the velcro holds very well.</li>
            <li>This BP cuff looks pretty sturdy and the dial is easy to read and all that</li>
            <li>Pretty good, better than what expected</li>
            <li>I use it daily and it works better than most blood pressure prescription medicines.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to monitor my blood pressure while pregnant.</li>
            <li>May be better to spend a little more money to get better quality.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>This cuff is appropriate for adults of normal size.</li>
            <li>Very well made product easy to use.</li>
            <li>cheap but works well and very rugged prefect for ems work.</li>
            <li>Instead of buying cheap plastic toys, I opted for the real thing.</li>
            <li>It LOOKS like the same kind I use at the hospital where I work as a nurse when I need a manual pressure, but it doesn&#x27;t function like it at all.</li>
            <li>Just as my own personal one, when facility ones were hard-to-find.</li>
            <li>Opened it right away</li>
            <li>just right it doesn&#x27;t inflate correctly.</li>
            <li>Good start up piece for a student.&lt;br /&gt;The additional pieces are included and black cask.</li>
            <li>So far so good a simple cuff</li>
            <li>lt was very fast shipping and packaged well but</li>
            <li>Anyway, it does what I need it to do, appears accurate, and so far has not injured or made anyone cry.</li>
            <li>If there is a phone number somewhere, it&#x27;s pretty well buried.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I was dis-satisfied with my Amazon experience.</li>
            <li>I have been using it to practice on family members and the readings seem to be consistent</li>
            <li>Holds air and gave a consistent reading.</li>
            <li>This is exactly whatI wanted.</li>
            <li>It is the ability to discern the pressure at which the sounds muffle (the actual diastolic) that requires the most experience.</li>
            <li>The cuff stitching started to separate the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>i would reccomend this for the price it is the best u can buy  as per usual a big thank you to amazon</li>
            <li>I would purchasr higher quality if buying again.</li>
            <li>buy a better quality cuff that will last for years.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>it comes exactly as description</li>
            <li>My first cuff broke on day one of using it.</li>
            <li>and I got it while i was in med school 3 years ago and still works as the first day I got it.</li>
            <li>I did not know that it was for personal use; it is OK otherwise.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, very clear to see the numbers, not hard to pup up or release the air, l would recommend this cuff as a X LARGE cuff</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t quite sure how much calibrating it would need in the long run.</li>
            <li>Being a registered nurse I know what a large bp cuff should be.  </li>
            <li>Stated was large cuff and was not.</li>
            <li>I needed the large size.</li>
            <li>If you want a large, this is for you.</li>
            <li>The clip on the back of the dial broke after about 3 uses, but I still get accurate readings when I use it.</li>
            <li>Fast.</li>
            <li>Turning the valve even slighlty released too much air.</li>
            <li>I was suprised when I received the cuff, that it was very well made considering how lowpriced it was.  </li>
            <li>really should mentionyou will need a stethoscope.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a retired firefighter who used these my whole career.</li>
            <li>Expected more longetivity than I received.</li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t really read the directions on calibration.</li>
            <li>Very helpful when you know how to use it.</li>
            <li>so what is there really to say haha.</li>
            <li>You can pump it up, but the air comes out very sporadically and well, if you can&#x27;t make out the sounds, it&#x27;s basically garbage.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li>The product arrived promptly, fits our arms and works very well.</li>
            <li>this was a very reasonable adult B/P cuff and it includes and stethoscope.</li>
            <li>The merchant then shipped a new blood pressure cuff to me within days!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The quality seems decent.</li>
            <li>It comes with its own stethescope, but not a very good one.</li>
            <li>My husband has high blood pressure and this helps to keep tract of his blood pressure.</li>
            <li>Ordered this product because my Cardiologist said I needed an Adult &#x27;Large&#x27; BP Cuff.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recomend this cuff, the valve on the bulb doesn&#x27;t let out air like normal cuffs.</li>
            <li>works well on normal size arms</li>
            <li>Works just fine, took off one star due to sizing.  </li>
            <li>I bought the large and extra large cuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little stiff, but it works great.</li>
            <li>It is dependable and it comes with a small booklet of instructions on how to use for those unfamiliar with manual cuffs. :)</li>
            <li>Spend the extra money and buy another brand of higher quality.</li>
            <li>First time user Received product 20hrs later.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t have the controlled leak for smooth pressure drop that better cuffs have,and it takes a lot of practice to crack the shutoff valve open just a tiny bit to get a slow pressure drop.  </li>
            <li>First of all, the cuff is a standard adult sized cuff, unlike what the description read as a &amp;#34;large adult&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Large cuffs should be both longer and wider than a regular sized cuff.  </li>
            <li>I requested a large blood pressure cuff and received a regular size.</li>
            <li>not the product I was actually looking for which was a large bp cuff.</li>
            <li>I had been looking for an adult cuff -</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see its size today..</li>
            <li>I would not recommend for professional use</li>
            <li>Works seamlessly and effortlessly.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for in home use and anyone in the medical field who wants to practice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s going straight back!</li>
            <li>The cuff is not an adult size.  </li>
            <li>I ended up going to a local medical suply store to get the right thing.</li>
            <li>A large wouldn&#x27;t be as long as an extra large.</li>
            <li>but the dial doesn&#x27;t move until the cuff is already half full with air.</li>
            <li>I need a adult long cuff or a large adult .  </li>
            <li>I like that it comes with a little case to keep it in to keep it organized and clean.</li>
            <li>Additionally, unless you have gigantic arms (mine are bigger than average), this is not the cuff for you, it&#x27;s huge.</li>
            <li>Obese people require a larger cuff or the pressures will be artificially high.</li>
            <li>yourself a reasonable double tube stethoscope poor better ability to hear the pulses</li>
            <li>Also you have to make sure the cuff is very tight when you put it on or you will be pumping it up for a long time.</li>
            <li>Similarly, this cuff is too large for children and will result in pressures that are artificially low.</li>
            <li>This is a large cuff, but it only inflates on one side of it, so as it inflates it also pops the velcro open</li>
            <li>so if you have even a non-obese but full size adult, it will be too small.</li>
            <li>I guess I should&#x27;ve spent a few bucks more.</li>
            <li>Like even the people I&#x27;ve used it on with normal to slightly muscular arms, it pops open when you use it where as all the other adult cuffs I&#x27;ve used are fine.....</li>
            <li>stated a adult cuff and when I received item it was an extra large adult cuff not adult regular.  </li>
            <li>this is a LARGE adult cuff that cannot be used on average sized adults.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cuffs such as this can also be used in certain biofeedback exercises for low back therapy.</li>
            <li>I was sent an Adult &#x27;Regular&#x27; BP cuff.</li>
            <li>I guess I only need the cuff as I wanted it to replace my old cuff on an automatic unit as the cuff fell apart after 20  years.</li>
            <li>It is a regular adult size  Returned item.  </li>
            <li>Lasted me two weeks before it&#x27;s started to and so on, and died completely the third week.</li>
            <li>The balloon inside seems too small and as you start to pump the balloon is full at 20 and the velcro is coming apart.  </li>
            <li>Second, it is made out of the most cheapest, flimsiest, paper thin plastic-like material that I have ever seen.</li>
            <li>This cuff is not big enough for a standard adult.</li>
            <li>Will not purchase this item again, the little gray thing where you clip the actual face on the cuff ripped, not sewn very well at all.</li>
            <li>However, I never bothered to request a refund so maybe this company would have made good on this bad deal.</li>
            <li>My husband has an average sized arm for an adult male, and it just barely is in the acceptable size range.</li>

            <li> I am a nursing student and needed an inexpensive cuff for practice, I was able to get a large and adult cuff at an amazing price both of which work perfectly.</li>
            <li> Not high quality, but perfect for the home user.</li>
            <li> I received my BP cuff in a pretty timely manner from the date of purchase and was very pleased w/ the product.  </li>
            <li> Very Quick shipping....</li>
            <li> Easy fix.</li>
            <li> I HAVE RESULTS VERY QUICKLY.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use and easy to read.</li>
            <li> Cuff works just fine, no problems.</li>
            <li> Seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li> It worked fine until it gave out..</li>
            <li> The cuff is fine</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> It came quickly and I was able to use it at work.</li>
            <li> Cheap and great quality with key to calibrate included!</li>
            <li> Does not give accurate reading like the mercury blood pressure meter, they should sell the sthethescope along with it as well.</li>
            <li> but I have had problems getting an accurate reading.</li>
            <li> it inflates and deflates and reads accurately?</li>
            <li> This purchase was hassle free and dealing with the seller was a pleasure.  </li>
            <li> Overall great product and will continue to purchase from this company.</li>
            <li> So far workin good, I like it</li>
            <li> The quality was pretty good and the price was reasonable.  </li>
            <li> I am using it to learn and its a straightforward reliable, affordable cuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a unique customer for this product.</li>
            <li> But there is nothing special about this sphygmomanometer, though.</li>
            <li> I got what I expected and I happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is the most accurate, but also the most technical, way to check blood pressure.</li>
            <li> Works great, came faster than expected.</li>
            <li> Not bad for $10.</li>
            <li> It pumps up easily, seems accurate, and the velcro holds very well.</li>
            <li> This BP cuff looks pretty sturdy and the dial is easy to read and all that</li>
            <li> Pretty good, better than what expected</li>
            <li> I use it daily and it works better than most blood pressure prescription medicines.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to monitor my blood pressure while pregnant.</li>
            <li> May be better to spend a little more money to get better quality.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> This cuff is appropriate for adults of normal size.</li>
            <li> Very well made product easy to use.</li>
            <li> cheap but works well and very rugged prefect for ems work.</li>
            <li> Instead of buying cheap plastic toys, I opted for the real thing.</li>
            <li> It LOOKS like the same kind I use at the hospital where I work as a nurse when I need a manual pressure, but it doesn&#x27;t function like it at all.</li>
            <li> Just as my own personal one, when facility ones were hard-to-find.</li>
            <li> Opened it right away</li>
            <li> just right it doesn&#x27;t inflate correctly.</li>
            <li> Good start up piece for a student.&lt;br /&gt;The additional pieces are included and black cask.</li>
            <li> So far so good a simple cuff</li>
            <li> lt was very fast shipping and packaged well but</li>
            <li> Anyway, it does what I need it to do, appears accurate, and so far has not injured or made anyone cry.</li>
            <li> If there is a phone number somewhere, it&#x27;s pretty well buried.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I was dis-satisfied with my Amazon experience.</li>
            <li> I have been using it to practice on family members and the readings seem to be consistent</li>
            <li> Holds air and gave a consistent reading.</li>
            <li> This is exactly whatI wanted.</li>
            <li> It is the ability to discern the pressure at which the sounds muffle (the actual diastolic) that requires the most experience.</li>
            <li> The cuff stitching started to separate the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> i would reccomend this for the price it is the best u can buy  as per usual a big thank you to amazon</li>
            <li> I would purchasr higher quality if buying again.</li>
            <li> buy a better quality cuff that will last for years.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> it comes exactly as description</li>
            <li> My first cuff broke on day one of using it.</li>
            <li> and I got it while i was in med school 3 years ago and still works as the first day I got it.</li>
            <li> I did not know that it was for personal use; it is OK otherwise.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, very clear to see the numbers, not hard to pup up or release the air, l would recommend this cuff as a X LARGE cuff</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t quite sure how much calibrating it would need in the long run.</li>
            <li> Being a registered nurse I know what a large bp cuff should be.  </li>
            <li> Stated was large cuff and was not.</li>
            <li> I needed the large size.</li>
            <li> If you want a large, this is for you.</li>
            <li> The clip on the back of the dial broke after about 3 uses, but I still get accurate readings when I use it.</li>
            <li> Fast.</li>
            <li> Turning the valve even slighlty released too much air.</li>
            <li> I was suprised when I received the cuff, that it was very well made considering how lowpriced it was.  </li>
            <li> really should mentionyou will need a stethoscope.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a retired firefighter who used these my whole career.</li>
            <li> Expected more longetivity than I received.</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t really read the directions on calibration.</li>
            <li> Very helpful when you know how to use it.</li>
            <li> so what is there really to say haha.</li>
            <li> You can pump it up, but the air comes out very sporadically and well, if you can&#x27;t make out the sounds, it&#x27;s basically garbage.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li> The product arrived promptly, fits our arms and works very well.</li>
            <li> this was a very reasonable adult B/P cuff and it includes and stethoscope.</li>
            <li> The merchant then shipped a new blood pressure cuff to me within days!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The quality seems decent.</li>
            <li> It comes with its own stethescope, but not a very good one.</li>
            <li> My husband has high blood pressure and this helps to keep tract of his blood pressure.</li>
            <li> Ordered this product because my Cardiologist said I needed an Adult &#x27;Large&#x27; BP Cuff.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recomend this cuff, the valve on the bulb doesn&#x27;t let out air like normal cuffs.</li>
            <li> works well on normal size arms</li>
            <li> Works just fine, took off one star due to sizing.  </li>
            <li> I bought the large and extra large cuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little stiff, but it works great.</li>
            <li> It is dependable and it comes with a small booklet of instructions on how to use for those unfamiliar with manual cuffs. :)</li>
            <li> Spend the extra money and buy another brand of higher quality.</li>
            <li> First time user Received product 20hrs later.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t have the controlled leak for smooth pressure drop that better cuffs have,and it takes a lot of practice to crack the shutoff valve open just a tiny bit to get a slow pressure drop.  </li>
            <li> First of all, the cuff is a standard adult sized cuff, unlike what the description read as a &amp;#34;large adult&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Large cuffs should be both longer and wider than a regular sized cuff.  </li>
            <li> I requested a large blood pressure cuff and received a regular size.</li>
            <li> not the product I was actually looking for which was a large bp cuff.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for an adult cuff -</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see its size today..</li>
            <li> I would not recommend for professional use</li>
            <li> Works seamlessly and effortlessly.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for in home use and anyone in the medical field who wants to practice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going straight back!</li>
            <li> The cuff is not an adult size.  </li>
            <li> I ended up going to a local medical suply store to get the right thing.</li>
            <li> A large wouldn&#x27;t be as long as an extra large.</li>
            <li> but the dial doesn&#x27;t move until the cuff is already half full with air.</li>
            <li> I need a adult long cuff or a large adult .  </li>
            <li> I like that it comes with a little case to keep it in to keep it organized and clean.</li>
            <li> Additionally, unless you have gigantic arms (mine are bigger than average), this is not the cuff for you, it&#x27;s huge.</li>
            <li> Obese people require a larger cuff or the pressures will be artificially high.</li>
            <li> yourself a reasonable double tube stethoscope poor better ability to hear the pulses</li>
            <li> Also you have to make sure the cuff is very tight when you put it on or you will be pumping it up for a long time.</li>
            <li> Similarly, this cuff is too large for children and will result in pressures that are artificially low.</li>
            <li> This is a large cuff, but it only inflates on one side of it, so as it inflates it also pops the velcro open</li>
            <li> so if you have even a non-obese but full size adult, it will be too small.</li>
            <li> I guess I should&#x27;ve spent a few bucks more.</li>
            <li> Like even the people I&#x27;ve used it on with normal to slightly muscular arms, it pops open when you use it where as all the other adult cuffs I&#x27;ve used are fine.....</li>
            <li> stated a adult cuff and when I received item it was an extra large adult cuff not adult regular.  </li>
            <li> this is a LARGE adult cuff that cannot be used on average sized adults.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cuffs such as this can also be used in certain biofeedback exercises for low back therapy.</li>
            <li> I was sent an Adult &#x27;Regular&#x27; BP cuff.</li>
            <li> I guess I only need the cuff as I wanted it to replace my old cuff on an automatic unit as the cuff fell apart after 20  years.</li>
            <li> It is a regular adult size  Returned item.  </li>
            <li> Lasted me two weeks before it&#x27;s started to and so on, and died completely the third week.</li>
            <li> The balloon inside seems too small and as you start to pump the balloon is full at 20 and the velcro is coming apart.  </li>
            <li> Second, it is made out of the most cheapest, flimsiest, paper thin plastic-like material that I have ever seen.</li>
            <li> This cuff is not big enough for a standard adult.</li>
            <li> Will not purchase this item again, the little gray thing where you clip the actual face on the cuff ripped, not sewn very well at all.</li>
            <li> However, I never bothered to request a refund so maybe this company would have made good on this bad deal.</li>
            <li> My husband has an average sized arm for an adult male, and it just barely is in the acceptable size range.</li>
            <li> This was not a large blood pressure cuff it was a regular adult size cuff.</li>
            <li> Would certainly not want to use on a chemically sensitive client.</li>
            <li> I doubt that it will last long.</li>
            <li> I bought manual blood pressure cuff large adult, because my previous cuff was small.</li>
            <li> I was unable to get an accurate reading.</li>
            <li> Works the same as some of my friends who spent 3x the money.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> In two days, it was not working I tried to use the key to return the pointer to zero as the manual stated with no success.</li>
            <li> It took too long to pump up and then immediately began leaking air with the valve closed.</li>
            <li> This makes it awkward using on someone with arms that are much larger near the shoulder and smaller near the elbow.</li>
            <li> I returned this item, which cost me over half the price of the item to ship back.</li>
            <li> Although the stethoscope provided is a minimal one</li>
            <li> It was as expected...</li>
            <li> IT WAS JUST WHAT WE EXPECTED</li>
            <li> Not much to say about this cuff</li>
            <li> Edit a few months later:</li>
            <li> It is everything I expected it would be.</li>
            <li> THis was not a large cuff.</li>
            <li> Not a Large size cuff as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Re-ordered acomplete other set and waiting on it.</li>
            <li> Usually if it&#x27;s anything other than regular size the ad states that information  </li>
            <li> Giant waste of money, don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> It is  just like any other blood pressure gauge, It works What else can I say about a blood pressure cuff.</li>
            <li> Item took a little longer than expected to receive but is as advertised</li>
            <li> In short, they are a bit hard to use well.</li>
            <li> So I ordered the wrong item but the delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> If you want to throw $11 down the drain</li>
            <li> No need to spend ridiculous amounts on a regular cuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s odd.</li>
            <li> Had it for less than a month, used it maybe 15 times, and it is already messed up.</li>
            <li> Velcro wont hold it tight when you pump it up</li>
            <li> DOESN&#x27;T SQUEEZE TOO TIGHT.</li>
            <li> it will not let out air if you have your finger on the valve, so turn it a little and let go for it to release any air.</li>
            <li> The little fabric hook for the dial to hang on tore off after 2 days of use.</li>
            <li> It comes with instructions on how to calibrate it and a little tool.</li>
            <li> However, it is overall a poor quality blood pressure cuff.</li>
            <li> The cuff fell apart just after a few days of using.</li>
            <li> Waste of the $11 it costs.</li>
            <li> I called and had another one sent and received in just a few days.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> We returned it and were disappointed that only half of the cost of the unit was credited to our account because we were automatically charged a flat fee for the return shipping fee--even though we are Amazon Prime members.</li>
            <li> The pump/bulb falls off all the time &amp; the valve is too difficult to open &amp; close.  </li>
            <li> But not sure why.</li>
            <li> I am pretty disappointed because I need this for school.  </li>
            <li> Although it arrived quickly, I was very disappointed with this sphygmomanometer.</li>
            <li> The cuff is also VERY small</li>
            <li> Pressure control valve is stiff and difficult to release, even after spraying with graphite.</li>
            <li> The value to release pressuse does not work well and is difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> This BP cuffs is useless.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> Very poorly made.  </li>
            <li> Not calibrated properly, has an annoying ring through which one must slide the patient&#x27;s arm... worthless.</li>
            <li> You will not be unhappy if you buy it.</li>
            <li> VERY poor quality!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been disappointed in the quality of the cuff.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> and it is a piece of crap.</li>
            <li> It is not even fixable if I were to sew it by hand because the material is so flimsy... very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when I received the product.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Velcro wont hold it tight when you pump it up it comes apart</li>
            <li> I bought manual blood pressure cuff large adult, because my previous cuff was small. I got what I expected and I happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you. Paul</li>
            <li> Being a registered nurse I know what a large bp cuff should be.  This cuff was not \\&quot;large\\&quot; in any way.  Large cuffs should be both longer and wider than a regular sized cuff.  Both of these criteria were not met.</li>
            <li> It fell apart about a month after I started using it. When I finally got around to sending it back it was not eligible. The piece of cloth that the meter is supposed to clip on to frayed completed. It is not even fixable if I were to sew it by hand because the material is so flimsy... very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It pumps up easily, seems accurate, and the velcro holds very well.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for an adult cuff - my mother is a nurse and I preferred to have her take it manually because I knew that&#x27;s what would happen in my doctor&#x27;s office. It works wonderfully and because I can monitor my blood pressure at home it may save me from going on medications!</li>
            <li> I give this merchant an A+ rating.  I received a defective blood pressure cuff, and after emailing the merchant, I had a reply within hours.  The merchant then shipped a new blood pressure cuff to me within days!  This purchase was hassle free and dealing with the seller was a pleasure.  The cuff works perfectly.</li>
            <li> This was a portable blood pressure cuff that works like it is supposed to.  It&#x27;s lightweight and comes with a pouch that fits the blood pressure cuff and a stethoscope.</li>
            <li> Good quality. Fast. No problems.</li>
            <li> Good quality for price. Used it at health fairs on many patients. Its standard size. Sometimes have to push the air out to manually flatten it</li>
            <li> Ordered this product because my Cardiologist said I needed an Adult &#x27;Large&#x27; BP Cuff. I was sent an Adult &#x27;Regular&#x27; BP cuff. They accepted my return properly, but I never had any oppotunity to speak to anyone about this. If there is a phone number somewhere, it&#x27;s pretty well buried. Not acceptable when ordering medical supplies or equipment. I ended up going to a local medical suply store to get the right thing. This was the first time I was dis-satisfied with my Amazon experience.</li>
            <li> I bought a bunch of these for a lab class.  They don&#x27;t have the controlled leak for smooth pressure drop that better cuffs have,and it takes a lot of practice to crack the shutoff valve open just a tiny bit to get a slow pressure drop.  In short, they are a bit hard to use well.</li>
            <li> It shows my BP to be 40 mmHg above what it shows on a hospitals electric BP machine.. May be better to spend a little more money to get better quality.</li>
            <li> My husband has high blood pressure and this helps to keep tract of his blood pressure.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Arrived quickly! It is dependable and it comes with a small booklet of instructions on how to use for those unfamiliar with manual cuffs. :)</li>
            <li> This item did appear as advertised and included the carrying case. However, it is overall a poor quality blood pressure cuff. I was unable to get an accurate reading. It took too long to pump up and then immediately began leaking air with the valve closed. Turning the valve even slighlty released too much air. I returned this item, which cost me over half the price of the item to ship back. Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> I was suprised when I received the cuff, that it was very well made considering how lowpriced it was.  It was actually better than some of the ones we have at work.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality. The balloon inside of the cuff popped while doing a BP on a patient. I hadn&#x27;t  even used this cuff more than 5 times before this happend. Spend the extra money and buy another brand of higher quality.</li>
            <li> Great deal on supplies</li>
            <li> THis was not a large cuff. I was surprised to see its size today.. I would like to replace it.</li>
            <li> Stated was large cuff and was not. I am a nurse and this was a regular size cuff. I needed the large size. O</li>

            <li> I was very happy with the manual blood pressure cuff that I received. It works well. It met my expectations. Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> great buy fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li> Second buy. This one is better than 1st.</li>
            <li> Works well, does the job. Great price.</li>
            <li> Very poorly made.  The pump/bulb falls off all the time &amp; the valve is too difficult to open &amp; close.  It&#x27;s collecting dust at this time because I had to replace it. However, I never bothered to request a refund so maybe this company would have made good on this bad deal.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recomend this cuff, the valve on the bulb doesn&#x27;t let out air like normal cuffs. it will not let out air if you have your finger on the valve, so turn it a little and let go for it to release any air.</li>
            <li> I bought this so that I could monitor my husband&#x27;s blood pressure regularly.  The large cuff is perfect for him as he is about 250 lbs.  It works just as well as the BP cuffs in my office (I&#x27;m a practitioner).  The quality was pretty good and the price was reasonable.  If you don&#x27;t have experience using a manual cuff, you may want to get an automatic BP cuff.  This product was a good buy!  For those of you who may be unaware- you will need a stethoscope as well if you purchase this BP cuff.</li>
            <li> Not bad for $10. It will definitely get me through nursing school. I have been using it to practice on family members and the readings seem to be consistent</li>
            <li> You get what you see. Simple regular blood cuff.</li>
            <li> Not high quality, but perfect for the home user. I would not recommend for professional use</li>
            <li> Pieces &amp; part. Assembly required.  But not sure why.</li>
            <li> Cuff works just fine, no problems. But the smell!&lt;br /&gt;The bladder in the cuff smells like a chemical dump site! I literally left it outside for a week just to de-gas. That helped, still smells. Would certainly not want to use on a chemically sensitive client.</li>
            <li> Good value. Good cuff. It works well and we&#x27;re using it to learn and practice!  I&#x27;m very pleased with the product and the service!</li>
            <li> Seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li> I guess I only need the cuff as I wanted it to replace my old cuff on an automatic unit as the cuff fell apart after 20  years. I did hook it up but it may be giving me a lower reading ---I will have to check that out.</li>
            <li> No complaints. Works the same as some of my friends who spent 3x the money. Holds air and gave a consistent reading.</li>
            <li> really should mentionyou will need a stethoscope. Re-ordered acomplete other set and waiting on it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little stiff, but it works great.</li>
            <li> Very Quick shipping....Works perfectly!!</li>
            <li> this was a very reasonable adult B/P cuff and it includes and stethoscope. Although the stethoscope provided is a minimal one and I would not recommend using it .get yourself a reasonable double tube stethoscope poor better ability to hear the pulses</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Save your money. This cuff broke after 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big guy so I got the big size.  It was way to big.</li>
            <li> This is exactly whatI wanted. I&#x27;m a retired firefighter who used these my whole career. They are simple to use and last along time.</li>
            <li> This sphygmomanometer comes without a stethoscope. This is the most accurate, but also the most technical, way to check blood pressure. You will need a stethoscope and you should have been trained in how to hear the systolic and diastolic sounds. It is the ability to discern the pressure at which the sounds muffle (the actual diastolic) that requires the most experience. This cuff is appropriate for adults of normal size. Obese people require a larger cuff or the pressures will be artificially high. Similarly, this cuff is too large for children and will result in pressures that are artificially low. The device is of good quality, perhaps a step below the cuffs you will find in physician&#x27;s offices but quite suitable for home use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cuffs such as this can also be used in certain biofeedback exercises for low back therapy. That discussion is beyond the scope of this review.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Cheap and great quality with key to calibrate included! Have already begun using it and it works wonderfully. No need to spend ridiculous amounts on a regular cuff.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, very clear to see the numbers, not hard to pup up or release the air, l would recommend this cuff as a X LARGE cuff so if you want or need it, I would get this one to have it in your medical care bag .</li>
            <li> Great BP cuff! Works seamlessly and effortlessly.</li>
            <li> Quality product, looks no different than what they use at the hospital. How can you beat the price! These are for arms larger than 18 inch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a tip, if you take the NOW brand L arginine powder form, 5g once a day , your blood pressure will be lowered by 15 points guaranteed! I use it daily and it works better than most blood pressure prescription medicines. L Argenine works by relaxing the artery. That water removing agent will also interact with celebrex and prevent celebrex from doing its job relieving joint pain. Obviously removing water from the body increases joint pain and stiffness.</li>
            <li> I work at a nursing home and use this every day....works great still have not had any difficulties And I would recommended</li>
            <li> For the price, gets the job done. I am using it to learn and its a straightforward reliable, affordable cuff.</li>
            <li> just what we needed, and it works real fine thanks you for a great product and for the great service</li>
            <li> Very well made product easy to use. cheap but works well and very rugged prefect for ems work. anyone can use it.</li>
            <li> The needle in the dial broke off within 3 days of use. The little fabric hook for the dial to hang on tore off after 2 days of use. I threw this BP cuff away after 3 days of use.</li>
            <li> After learning how to take BP manually in class, I wanted to get more practice in, so I bought this. After using it on just about every person I know, some more than once, it still works. Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> All the connections leaked air. I had to glue the ends on. Easy fix.</li>
            <li> Works great. The material for the cuff feels more like plastic.</li>
            <li> Opened it right away and it doesn&#x27;t work.  I am pretty disappointed because I need this for school.  I guess you get what you pay for sometimes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a unique customer for this product. I didn&#x27;t buy it to take actual blood pressure, I bought it for my 6-year-old daughter to pretend to be a doctor Instead of buying cheap plastic toys, I opted for the real thing. For this reason, I can&#x27;t comment on the accuracy of the product. But my daughter loves it!</li>
            <li> In two days, it was not working I tried to use the key to return the pointer to zero as the manual stated with no success. Disappointed</li>
            <li> This is a grand piece piece of equipment for the price. Good start up piece for a student.&lt;br /&gt;The additional pieces are included and black cask.</li>
            <li> It was as expected... An affordable cuff that works. The clip on the back of the dial broke after about 3 uses, but I still get accurate readings when I use it. Keep it around the house as a back-up. You can get the same quality product locally at any pharmacy though, wouldn&#x27;t go out of my way to order one from amazon to try and get a deal.</li>
            <li> I requested a large blood pressure cuff and received a regular size.</li>
            <li> The cuff stitching started to separate the first time I used it.  VERY poor quality!</li>
            <li> Pretty good, better than what expected</li>
            <li> I just replaced it.Expected more longetivity than I received. It worked fine until it gave out.. I do use it daily but for no&lt;br /&gt;more than 5 pt&#x27;s daily. Avg. is 3</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M HAPPY I CHOSE THIS ITEM. WORKS WELL, FITS IN POUCH NEATLY. I HAVE RESULTS VERY QUICKLY. DOESN&#x27;T SQUEEZE TOO TIGHT.</li>
            <li> good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> stated a adult cuff and when I received item it was an extra large adult cuff not adult regular.  Usually if it&#x27;s anything other than regular size the ad states that information  I kept it and donated and ordered another from a different company.</li>
            <li> This blood pressure cuff was fair. I didn&#x27;t like that the cuff had a mile of extra material that kinda got in the way of reading the gauge. A large wouldn&#x27;t be as long as an extra large. But gets the job done. It comes with instructions on how to calibrate it and a little tool. The needle was on 0 but and I wasn&#x27;t quite sure how much calibrating it would need in the long run. I have another cuff I use so I haven&#x27;t really read the directions on calibration. If anything it&#x27;s just a back up for now.</li>
            <li> This thing I just got and it is a piece of crap. It does not even stay fastened on the arm. 13 bucks thrown in the trash can.</li>
            <li> Not calibrated properly, has an annoying ring through which one must slide the patient&#x27;s arm... worthless. Giant waste of money, don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. Good price and gets the job done. Design is blah.</li>
            <li> IT WAS JUST WHAT WE EXPECTED</li>
            <li> i would reccomend this for the price it is the best u can buy  as per usual a big thank you to amazon</li>
            <li> So far so good a simple cuff</li>
            <li> i will never recommend it. The low price means low quality in this case. The cuff fell apart just after a few days of using.</li>
            <li> Great manual blood pressure cuff</li>
            <li> Does not give accurate reading like the mercury blood pressure meter, they should sell the sthethescope along with it as well.</li>
            <li> Diastolic was off and bladder kept twisting and coming put</li>
            <li> First time user Received product 20hrs later.  most impressive.  Will use amazon again.</li>
            <li> I just need it for a school project that would help me out with the different things that I had to figure out</li>
            <li> works great, good quality.</li>
            <li> This BP cuff looks pretty sturdy and the dial is easy to read and all that but I have had problems getting an accurate reading. The inflating rubber balloon in the cuff does not surround the arm so if you don&#x27;t have it just right it doesn&#x27;t inflate correctly. Also you have to make sure the cuff is very tight when you put it on or you will be pumping it up for a long time. This makes it awkward using on someone with arms that are much larger near the shoulder and smaller near the elbow. You just don&#x27;t get a good reading.</li>
            <li> Works, I needed it for school. I would purchasr higher quality if buying again. Thankfully I do not need to.</li>
            <li> I am a nursing student and needed an inexpensive cuff for practice, I was able to get a large and adult cuff at an amazing price both of which work perfectly. Not much to say about this cuff I would recommend it for in home use and anyone in the medical field who wants to practice.</li>
            <li> My daughter is a nurse and she says this is a good product for the money. She uses it at home and it is great.</li>
            <li> Although it arrived quickly, I was very disappointed with this sphygmomanometer. First of all, the cuff is a standard adult sized cuff, unlike what the description read as a &amp;#34;large adult&amp;#34; sized cuff! Second, it is made out of the most cheapest, flimsiest, paper thin plastic-like material that I have ever seen. I doubt that it will last long. It&#x27;s going straight back! Do not buy this item- buy a better quality cuff that will last for years.</li>
            <li> Very helpful when you know how to use it.</li>
            <li> good product at a great price&lt;br /&gt;i like the product and will be back for more&lt;br /&gt;as soon as possibly can</li>
            <li> Works great, came faster than expected. Very happy!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read the description close enough. I missed &amp;#34;large&amp;#34;. I wanted a regular, but mistakenly ordered this. If you want a large, this is for you. I can almost put it around my waist!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality seems decent.</li>
            <li> great cuff great price</li>
            <li> I bought the large and extra large cuff. Both started to rip and come unstitched within 2 weeks. I would not recommend this product ever. Who has time to try and get a refund and ship the item back???</li>
            <li> works great&lt;br /&gt;loved the price</li>
            <li> The cuff is fine but I thought it was just an \\&quot;Adult\\&quot; size when I ordered it. So I ordered the wrong item but the delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> But there is nothing special about this sphygmomanometer, though. As a home health nurse, I use it daily on my patients, and occasionally when you try to pump it up, the needle will get like stuck and then all at one jump up. It&#x27;s odd. Anyway, it does what I need it to do, appears accurate, and so far has not injured or made anyone cry. Will report back if any incident would occur. Edit a few months later: Will not purchase this item again, the little gray thing where you clip the actual face on the cuff ripped, not sewn very well at all.</li>
            <li> The thread for the loop that holds on the sphygmomanometer has already come apart!</li>
            <li> It is  just like any other blood pressure gauge, It works What else can I say about a blood pressure cuff.</li>
            <li> I received my BP cuff in a pretty timely manner from the date of purchase and was very pleased w/ the product.  I would consider this manufacturer in the future when I need to replace the cuff I just purchased.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a blood pressure cuff so what is there really to say haha. it inflates and deflates and reads accurately? i would reccomend for an inexpensive way to monitor you BP.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my husband can not use a regular size cuff. It has done a great job and I anticipate using it for some time to come</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use and easy to read. It is everything I expected it would be. I love it!</li>
            <li> This item arrived on time. And works ok. Good quality. I hope it continuous working well. You will not be unhappy if you buy it.</li>
            <li> Just like the one I use on the firetruck.</li>
            <li> It works well on smaller arms</li>
            <li> it comes exactly as description</li>
            <li> This unit is oversized. This unit is not hor a human. Ther is no such hand size unless the person is 450 pounds.</li>
            <li> I needed a replacement Blood Pressure machine. Found the cheapest one on the market. It&#x27;s fine. Thank you Gene Walsh, genewalsh01@aol.com</li>
            <li> I bought this to use at home. It LOOKS like the same kind I use at the hospital where I work as a nurse when I need a manual pressure, but it doesn&#x27;t function like it at all. You can pump it up, but the air comes out very sporadically and well, if you can&#x27;t make out the sounds, it&#x27;s basically garbage. The cuff is also VERY small so if you have even a non-obese but full size adult, it will be too small.</li>
            <li> This product product probably wouldn&#x27;t have been so difficult to operate if the directions were more adquate.  We returned it and were disappointed that only half of the cost of the unit was credited to our account because we were automatically charged a flat fee for the return shipping fee--even though we are Amazon Prime members.</li>
            <li> I ordered this blood pressure cuff in hopes it was as said in advertisement. This was not a large blood pressure cuff it was a regular adult size cuff. I was very disappointed when I received the product. lt was very fast shipping and packaged well but not the product I was actually looking for which was a large bp cuff.</li>
            <li> Got my product very quickly and was nicely packaged. I like that it comes with a little case to keep it in to keep it organized and clean. Overall great product and will continue to purchase from this company.</li>
            <li> Gift! She loved it, go figure!!!!!</li>
            <li> This BP cuffs is useless. Had it for less than a month, used it maybe 15 times, and it is already messed up. The bladder fills with air when you start pumping it up but the dial doesn&#x27;t move until the cuff is already half full with air. Waste of the $11 it costs. If you want to throw $11 down the drain it&#x27;s a good buy. So disappointed. Have a practical exam in a week which I will have to take manual BP during and wanted this to practice. Doesn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li> I am a nursing student and just wanted something to have around to practice on my family and friends, this works just fine for that!</li>
            <li> Nothing too fancy. Works well.</li>
            <li> this is a LARGE adult cuff that cannot be used on average sized adults.</li>
            <li> This product works great!</li>
            <li> Not a Large size cuff as advertised.  It is a regular adult size  Returned item.  I need a adult long cuff or a large adult .  NOT REGULAR</li>
            <li> This is a large cuff, but it only inflates on one side of it, so as it inflates it also pops the velcro open and you have to deflate the thing and start all over again. Complete waste of money. Find one that inflates equally all the way around and save yourself it irritation I had with this thing.</li>
            <li> It came quickly and I was able to use it at work. My first cuff broke on day one of using it. I called and had another one sent and received in just a few days. I have had no problems since! Works great!</li>
            <li> The cuff is not an adult size.  The balloon inside seems too small and as you start to pump the balloon is full at 20 and the velcro is coming apart.  I dont recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this one for use at work. Just as my own personal one, when facility ones were hard-to-find. So, don&#x27;t be misled, this definitely was not over used. Lasted me two weeks before it&#x27;s started to and so on, and died completely the third week. I guess I should&#x27;ve spent a few bucks more. This one is a dog,  folks. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to monitor my blood pressure while pregnant. This cuff does not work. The needle does not move when the bulb is squeezed. My husband is a doctor so I am confident it&#x27;s being used correctly. I am returning.</li>
            <li> Pressure control valve is stiff and difficult to release, even after spraying with graphite.</li>
            <li> Material too flexible for me...Next time around I will get a firmer cuff. It sits better on the patient&#x27;s arm.</li>
            <li> This cuff is not big enough for a standard adult. Like even the people I&#x27;ve used it on with normal to slightly muscular arms, it pops open when you use it where as all the other adult cuffs I&#x27;ve used are fine.....</li>
            <li> The product arrived promptly, fits our arms and works very well.</li>
            <li> I use this cuff today and I got it while i was in med school 3 years ago and still works as the first day I got it.</li>
            <li> works well on normal size arms</li>
            <li> So far workin good, I like it</li>
            <li> Works just fine, took off one star due to sizing.  This should say more like a medium.  My husband has an average sized arm for an adult male, and it just barely is in the acceptable size range.</li>
            <li> Item took a little longer than expected to receive but is as advertised</li>
            <li> I did not know that it was for personal use; it is OK otherwise.  It comes with its own stethescope, but not a very good one.</li>
