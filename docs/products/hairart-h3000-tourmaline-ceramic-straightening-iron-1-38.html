            <li>and i is  Always good.</li>

            <li>OMG AMAZING, I don&#x27;t even have to put product in my hair, that&#x27;s how good this iron is.</li>
            <li>This product is used in many salons, so that&#x27;s say something great about this brand.</li>

            <li>Love the product!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this!</li>
            <li>Love my hairart!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>I love this hair straightener!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This HairArt straightener is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Once you get turning of curling with it, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok I&#x27;ve used this brand before and loved it.  </li>
            <li>nice silky finish</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not as effective as others I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li>--it doesn&#x27;t frizz, but if I use just the heat protectant and put a shine product on my hair after I straighten it then it does kind of frizz by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Even on the highest setting, it just felt warm.</li>
            <li>It was a nice purchase.</li>
            <li>Its nice that you can control the temperature according to your hair type.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice and compact, but I guess that could be a downside if you had a lot of hair</li>
            <li>so she would have her own and stop using mine, LOL.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, great product.</li>
            <li>The plate fell out of my old one this year, which was kind of impressive</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly, doesn&#x27;t pull my hair, and seems to be great quality.</li>
            <li>i think it is a good quality and a good investment, i recommend it to every one who ask me about my hair and i am thinking on getting one for my mother in law, who is always complaining about her &amp;#34;pharmacy hair iron&amp;#34;, and once she tried it at my house she noticed how easy it was to do her hair and how silky and smooth her hair</li>
            <li>So far, so good!!</li>
            <li>Perfect for our natural 4c hair. :-)</li>
            <li>I have tried so many irons and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>As a hairdresser, I can honestly tell you that these are the best flat irons you can buy.</li>
            <li>Super Fast delivery and excellent product!</li>
            <li>It is very hot and leaves your hair silky and straight and at a great price for what it does!</li>

            <li>Great flat iron heats up in seconds!!</li>
            <li>It is even better than my electric hot comb.  </li>
            <li>It is awesome left my hair feeling like silk way better then the flat iron I had before</li>
            <li>(from my husband&#x27;s prime account).&lt;br /&gt;So with that said,  is a really good iron, leaves your hair smooth, it is not necessary to go twice on your hair and it doesn&#x27;t pull or break your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a pretty straightening iron,I bought the same one years ago and it lasted a lifetime, I hope this one lasts a long time too, the temperature is perfect and your hair looks great!!</li>

            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good product for a decent price</li>
            <li>I purchased a HairArt flat iron 15 years ago and loved it.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t pull or snag my hair.  </li>
            <li>This straightener works great, and stays straight for multiple days.</li>
            <li>So I had to quickly replace them.</li>
            <li>recommend it more highly.</li>
            <li>Now my hair is smooth even on the really humid days!  </li>
            <li>, it is still working ( it makes funny sound when you close it</li>
            <li>and it heats up very fast!</li>
            <li>Very  Hot</li>
            <li>This is quite possibly the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair.</li>
            <li>(Be sure to use a heat protective hair product before using any flat iron; it&#x27;ll keep your hair shiny and healthy.)</li>
            <li>I have thick hair and this is the BEST iron for really straightening it out smooth.</li>
            <li>I tried dozen of flat irons, but this flat iron is THE BEST one ever.</li>
            <li>Same one my hair stylist uses, love it!</li>
            <li>I bought this item first when I was 18 in a mall in one of those kiosks!</li>
            <li>They work like the stove hot irons!</li>
            <li>First of all, the price was affordable!</li>
            <li>Thanks a bunch!!</li>
            <li>This straightens it fine and doesn&#x27;t seem to damage it too much.  </li>
            <li>The flat irons get hot and they do a good job of straightening my hair</li>
            <li>Love this flat iron use professionally cost is reasonable super good product</li>
            <li>It does not smooths my ends or calm any frizz.  </li>
            <li>Also straightens amazingly and simply. !</li>
            <li>It makes my hair straight as a pin and keeps it shiny and smooth.</li>

            <li>This is one of those rare products..</li>
            <li>Worth the investment</li>

            <li>This one takes a little longer to heat up, but it stays hot and works great.</li>
            <li>or if you wrap the cord it will stop heating up right</li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s what we all want, right?</li>
            <li>I am completely thrilled with this flat iron!</li>
            <li>The old one was about 7 years old and still working perfectly until I dropped it one too many times on my hard tile floor.  </li>
            <li>And my older sister has long wavy hair, so it does a perfect job in 3 different types of hair.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>its just to replace an old one, if she wants the same i thinks is because is a great product</li>
            <li>It heat up quick and works really well for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>I was a bit nervous at first because I wasn&#x27;t sure how my hair would turn out with this flatiron, but my hair was left feeling really soft and silky and smooth and straight!!</li>
            <li>Received hair straightener very fast.</li>
            <li>Like it very much.</li>
            <li>but I need a new one and when I found this product I was excited</li>

            <li>, my sister bought her first one 6 years ago</li>
            <li>My wife loves it, the first</li>
            <li>I recommend this straightener to everyone and it&#x27;s kept my hair pretty fab for years.</li>
            <li>and it still works just as the first day I used it.</li>
            <li>If not for that, I am sure this product could easily last years.</li>
            <li>french if it&#x27;s better for you.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>They works great and last a long time.  </li>
            <li>i love this straightener it actually works and doesn&#x27;t damage hair</li>
            <li>I would look for something better, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>four stars because this was my first time trying it.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertized.</li>
            <li>I bought this one as a backup for my first one, just in case it goes out.</li>
            <li>Revlon or Gold N&#x27; Hot.</li>
            <li>my hair will be straight again!</li>
            <li>I am a person obsessed with the quest for perfect hair.</li>
            <li>My dog chewed the cord on my first pair.</li>
            <li>I have used one everyday for over 6 years and went looking for a good quality replacement.  </li>
            <li>I have used professional ones that my hair dresser has sold me down to the cheap ones from target and this by far lasts longer and does a great job.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>love this flat iron</li>
            <li>My favorite flat iron ever.  </li>
            <li>Love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>Love my flat iron.</li>
            <li>I love these flat iron</li>
            <li>I looked at many different hair straighteners and eventually consulted my hair-stylist friend who always has perfectly straight hair.</li>
            <li>I had one like this a long time ago and it lasted for so many years, but eventually gave out.  </li>
            <li>I love this flat iron so much that I gave one to my niece for her birthday this year.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really great straightener on my natural African American hair</li>
            <li>it gets hot and gets my hair really straight and glides through my hair and makes my hair feel like silk.</li>
            <li>It gets extremely hot and the storage case works very well.  </li>
            <li>Heats up fast and is hot.</li>
            <li>I love its long cord; it makes handling the iron</li>
            <li>They get really hot and works very well.</li>
            <li>They heat up fast and leave your hair straight and shiny!</li>
            <li>It flat irons nicely and so far</li>
            <li>It comes with its own case so you don&#x27;t have to worry about where I sat it down.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other flat irons that I just wasn&#x27;t happy with.</li>
            <li>And this is the first and only flat iron I&#x27;ve ever bothered to own.</li>
            <li>Five stars from me for this excellent flat iron for quality, wide heat surface, long cord, fast heating, on/off button, and variety of temperatures.</li>
            <li>I love my new flat iron!</li>
            <li>When my Dallas hair stylist DeAnna Rosenblum said to try this one I was ready.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Bone Straight</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a VERY PICKY woman when it comes to my hair...</li>
            <li>if it&#x27;s not bouncy, flowy shiny and my ROOTS aren&#x27;t straight</li>
            <li>I washed and blow-dryed my hair and got straight to it....and let me tell you guys</li>
            <li>cuz it gave me that Bone Straight, Bouncy, Flowy, Shiny look just like my mommy does it</li>
            <li>Im a Very Picky woman when it comes to my hair....</li>
            <li>Also, my hair always frizzes when I&#x27;m out, but after using this straightener, it doesn&#x27;t as much.</li>
            <li>you very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nadine</li>
            <li>And Get The Hair Straight...</li>
            <li>I have used it for the past 2-months now and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>, I wish the company would send it to me, I really need that travel case.</li>
            <li>Very please with this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The straight look never lasted.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this one, my hair is moving, shiny shiny shiny, and straight.  </li>
            <li>Straight and silky in one pass.  </li>
            <li>She absolutely loves the straightener.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I always take a shower in the morning because if I took it the night before I would spend so much time fixing it from sleeping on it.</li>
            <li>I decided that I would take a shower the night before and see how this flatiron would work on my hair and to see how much work I would have to spend on my hair to &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34;it.</li>
            <li>I think I like it equally as much as the BabyBliss porcelain one.</li>
            <li>My hair even stayed straight during a thunderstorm, which is unheard of for me.  </li>
            <li>Really like this flat iron; first read the reviews, all favorable, and they were right!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my third flat iron and, while not the most expensive, it&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t very thick, but I&#x27;m thinking this flat iron might work best on permed hair.</li>
            <li>I had one before and last forever, it  does flat iron your hair really nice and shiny.</li>
            <li>cause it doesn&#x27;t snag on my hair like most other straighteners I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I have to say, that is a pretty amazing run for an iron that is used at LEAST twice a week for seven years.    </li>
            <li>I usually spend between $50 and $100 on a flat iron, and this is priced reasonably and works great.</li>
            <li>This is the 3rd HairArt Flat Iron I have ordered.&lt;br /&gt;The first pooped out after many years</li>
            <li>My previous brand that I&#x27;ve paid double of the price is not as good as this one is...</li>
            <li>Brand new!</li>
            <li>but you need to be careful because it can crack easily</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommended, my old one lasted like 8 years until it eventually broke from dropping it so much but its very durable</li>
            <li>It really leaves your hair soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>I only have to run it over my hair once because it can get very hot.</li>
            <li>Using this iron almost every day, I highly recommend it as it does not ruin your hair like others I have tried.</li>
            <li>The trick to protect hair from damage is to not have the temperature at a high setting.</li>
            <li>Then, in high school, I hauled it everywhere between houses with said girlfriends.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This is the same one my hair dresser uses on my hair and do far, not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Using them doesn&#x27;t require as much much work as my old ones.</li>
            <li>I received this nearly a week and a half ago, but I didn&#x27;t want to review it until I&#x27;d tried it more than once to see if it wasn&#x27;t a fluke.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this hair straightener for 10 years and only had to replace it twice - both times because it got dropped or pulled off the counter more than once and eventually made the plates loose</li>
            <li>I have extremely wavy hair and this product makes it smooth and sleek.</li>
            <li>After 15 years it was time for a new one</li>
            <li>I am now 26 and bought a new one.</li>
            <li>I had the BabyBliss one before, but I like to try new ones after about a year.</li>
            <li>I rarely take the time to write reviews, but this flat iron deserves it!  </li>
            <li>Wow, wow, wow!!!</li>
            <li>I am white but have very, very curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I have very natural curly hair</li>
            <li>I have thick, wavy, coarse hair (am Mexican-American) and always concerned heating tools won&#x27;t get hot enough for a good straightening.</li>
            <li>It seems to have a power that makes my hair feel silky, soft, and manageable!</li>
            <li>I have only bought this iron twice because my first one lasted 12 years.</li>
            <li>and so I replaced it with the same exact one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a quality device with a generous 1-3/8&amp;#34; wide ironing surface, 3/8&amp;#34; wider than many flat irons.</li>
            <li>It does tend to make a noise (can only describe it as an &amp;#34;electrical buzzing&amp;#34;) while in use</li>
            <li>I like this straightening iron better than any other that I&#x27;ve tried and there has been many of them; however, the only negative thing I can say about it is that it doesn&#x27;t close completely on the hair.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>It looks soft and touchable.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair so soft and shiny..</li>
            <li>Bought this one to replace my old that I had for years.</li>
            <li>Secondly, it shipped a day earlier than expected, so I was really pleased.</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly,you can straighten and curl with it.the only problem</li>
            <li>The Pro-liss worked, but my hair only stayed straight for about an hour</li>
            <li>works well with my thick hair  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I can just slide the iron in the case when done vs waiting for it to cool down.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through about 15 flat irons that really damaged my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard so much about this flat iron.</li>
            <li>, my little sister has super curly hair and believe me it works (of course it takes her longer than me because she has a lot of curly hair), before we discovered this product, she used to take a couples hour trying to straight her hair with different types of iron (from Revlon, to conair, etc).</li>
            <li>and i just got one as a present for my older sister.</li>
            <li>I bought my first one (this same one) over 10 years ago, back in highschool and it just now broke.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the same one since high school (2006) and just had to replace it since the cord wore out</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m not mixed with anything--noticed a lot of positive reviews from mixed girls).</li>
            <li>It can straighten very coarse/ thick/ natural African American hair textures with ease.</li>
            <li>I immediately went searching on Amazon, and found my exact same flat iron (just newer and improved).</li>
            <li>and I tried once and fell in love- none of my other more expensive flat irons can compete.  </li>
            <li>I bought a new one, for the low price of $60</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m not really liking having to go over a small section more than 3 times.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to everyone and it lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy directly from the company next time</li>
            <li>Now I only allow my mother to do my hair because she&#x27;s a professional hair stylist and she gets my hair</li>
            <li>The 3rd I just ordered for my 12year old for Christmas</li>
            <li>It has lasted 2 and 1/2 years so far, and it is only now starting to lose it&#x27;s heating power.  </li>
            <li>I use this straightener on my African American chemically treated hair as well as my daughters natural hair.  </li>
            <li>I had to  straighten the same area of hair repetitively, and the hair quickly reverted to a frizzy state.</li>
            <li>On the highest setting, it is no longer hot enough, but it has outlasted other flat irons by leaps and bounds.  </li>
            <li>First lasted about 5 years with using it everyday.</li>
            <li>I actually bought this to replace my previous hair straightener, which is the exact same one.</li>
            <li>In my book, no other flat iron beats this one.</li>
            <li>and i didn&#x27;t really see that in other leading flat irons.</li>
            <li>I have only had the Hair Art for a month or so, but I can straighten my long, natural, multi-ethnic hair to the quality of a salon.</li>
            <li>I have had a few different flat irons - Revlon, Chi, Gold n Hot.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> best thing I love about this straightener is that when you&#x27;re using it and place your hands on the top where the gold plates are positioned underneath it doesn&#x27;t burn!</li>
            <li> and i is  Always good.</li>
            <li> Arrived today, as scheduled, in a good condition.</li>
            <li> OMG AMAZING, I don&#x27;t even have to put product in my hair, that&#x27;s how good this iron is.</li>
            <li> This product is used in many salons, so that&#x27;s say something great about this brand.</li>
            <li> Great iron for curling I&#x27;m a hair stylist and love the weight if it , also shine it gives hair I purchased every size iron they have .</li>
            <li> received this product in a timely manner and was very pleased.</li>
            <li> Love the product!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this!</li>
            <li> Love my hairart!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li> I love this hair straightener!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> This HairArt straightener is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Once you get turning of curling with it, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok I&#x27;ve used this brand before and loved it.  </li>
            <li> nice silky finish</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not as effective as others I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> --it doesn&#x27;t frizz, but if I use just the heat protectant and put a shine product on my hair after I straighten it then it does kind of frizz by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Even on the highest setting, it just felt warm.</li>
            <li> It was a nice purchase.</li>
            <li> Its nice that you can control the temperature according to your hair type.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nice and compact, but I guess that could be a downside if you had a lot of hair</li>
            <li> so she would have her own and stop using mine, LOL.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, great product.</li>
            <li> The plate fell out of my old one this year, which was kind of impressive</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly, doesn&#x27;t pull my hair, and seems to be great quality.</li>
            <li> i think it is a good quality and a good investment, i recommend it to every one who ask me about my hair and i am thinking on getting one for my mother in law, who is always complaining about her &amp;#34;pharmacy hair iron&amp;#34;, and once she tried it at my house she noticed how easy it was to do her hair and how silky and smooth her hair</li>

            <li> This straightener works great, and stays straight for multiple days.</li>
            <li> So I had to quickly replace them.</li>
            <li> recommend it more highly.</li>
            <li> Now my hair is smooth even on the really humid days!  </li>
            <li> , it is still working ( it makes funny sound when you close it</li>
            <li> and it heats up very fast!</li>
            <li> Very  Hot</li>
            <li> This is quite possibly the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair.</li>
            <li> (Be sure to use a heat protective hair product before using any flat iron; it&#x27;ll keep your hair shiny and healthy.)</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and this is the BEST iron for really straightening it out smooth.</li>
            <li> I tried dozen of flat irons, but this flat iron is THE BEST one ever.</li>
            <li> Same one my hair stylist uses, love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this item first when I was 18 in a mall in one of those kiosks!</li>
            <li> They work like the stove hot irons!</li>
            <li> First of all, the price was affordable!</li>
            <li> Thanks a bunch!!</li>
            <li> This straightens it fine and doesn&#x27;t seem to damage it too much.  </li>
            <li> The flat irons get hot and they do a good job of straightening my hair</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron use professionally cost is reasonable super good product</li>
            <li> It does not smooths my ends or calm any frizz.  </li>
            <li> Also straightens amazingly and simply. !</li>
            <li> It makes my hair straight as a pin and keeps it shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> better than her old one and way cheaper than buying it in a beauty supply store.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is one of those rare products..</li>
            <li> Worth the investment</li>
            <li> Straightens and curls my fine hair better than any flat or straightening iron</li>
            <li> It is better does way better than the other name brands that I use on my hair.</li>
            <li> better deal than the chi and works just as well if not better - love that you can adjust the temp!</li>
            <li> hot quick, doesn&#x27;t damage hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one takes a little longer to heat up, but it stays hot and works great.</li>
            <li> or if you wrap the cord it will stop heating up right</li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s what we all want, right?</li>
            <li> I am completely thrilled with this flat iron!</li>
            <li> The old one was about 7 years old and still working perfectly until I dropped it one too many times on my hard tile floor.  </li>
            <li> And my older sister has long wavy hair, so it does a perfect job in 3 different types of hair.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> its just to replace an old one, if she wants the same i thinks is because is a great product</li>
            <li> It heat up quick and works really well for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> I was a bit nervous at first because I wasn&#x27;t sure how my hair would turn out with this flatiron, but my hair was left feeling really soft and silky and smooth and straight!!</li>
            <li> Received hair straightener very fast.</li>
            <li> Like it very much.</li>
            <li> but I need a new one and when I found this product I was excited</li>
            <li> She was right, I LOVE this flat iron!</li>
            <li> , my sister bought her first one 6 years ago</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, the first</li>
            <li> I recommend this straightener to everyone and it&#x27;s kept my hair pretty fab for years.</li>
            <li> and it still works just as the first day I used it.</li>
            <li> If not for that, I am sure this product could easily last years.</li>
            <li> french if it&#x27;s better for you.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> They works great and last a long time.  </li>
            <li> i love this straightener it actually works and doesn&#x27;t damage hair</li>
            <li> I would look for something better, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Thanks again!</li>
            <li> four stars because this was my first time trying it.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertized.</li>
            <li> I bought this one as a backup for my first one, just in case it goes out.</li>
            <li> Revlon or Gold N&#x27; Hot.</li>
            <li> my hair will be straight again!</li>
            <li> I am a person obsessed with the quest for perfect hair.</li>
            <li> My dog chewed the cord on my first pair.</li>
            <li> I have used one everyday for over 6 years and went looking for a good quality replacement.  </li>
            <li> I have used professional ones that my hair dresser has sold me down to the cheap ones from target and this by far lasts longer and does a great job.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.</li>

            <li> I love these flat iron</li>
            <li> I looked at many different hair straighteners and eventually consulted my hair-stylist friend who always has perfectly straight hair.</li>
            <li> I had one like this a long time ago and it lasted for so many years, but eventually gave out.  </li>
            <li> I love this flat iron so much that I gave one to my niece for her birthday this year.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really great straightener on my natural African American hair</li>
            <li> it gets hot and gets my hair really straight and glides through my hair and makes my hair feel like silk.</li>
            <li> It gets extremely hot and the storage case works very well.  </li>
            <li> Heats up fast and is hot.</li>
            <li> I love its long cord; it makes handling the iron</li>
            <li> They get really hot and works very well.</li>
            <li> They heat up fast and leave your hair straight and shiny!</li>
            <li> It flat irons nicely and so far</li>
            <li> It comes with its own case so you don&#x27;t have to worry about where I sat it down.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other flat irons that I just wasn&#x27;t happy with.</li>
            <li> And this is the first and only flat iron I&#x27;ve ever bothered to own.</li>

            <li> I love my new flat iron!</li>
            <li> When my Dallas hair stylist DeAnna Rosenblum said to try this one I was ready.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Bone Straight</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a VERY PICKY woman when it comes to my hair...</li>
            <li> if it&#x27;s not bouncy, flowy shiny and my ROOTS aren&#x27;t straight</li>
            <li> I washed and blow-dryed my hair and got straight to it....and let me tell you guys</li>
            <li> cuz it gave me that Bone Straight, Bouncy, Flowy, Shiny look just like my mommy does it</li>
            <li> Im a Very Picky woman when it comes to my hair....</li>
            <li> Also, my hair always frizzes when I&#x27;m out, but after using this straightener, it doesn&#x27;t as much.</li>
            <li> you very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nadine</li>
            <li> And Get The Hair Straight...</li>
            <li> I have used it for the past 2-months now and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> , I wish the company would send it to me, I really need that travel case.</li>
            <li> Very please with this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The straight look never lasted.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this one, my hair is moving, shiny shiny shiny, and straight.  </li>
            <li> Straight and silky in one pass.  </li>
            <li> She absolutely loves the straightener.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I always take a shower in the morning because if I took it the night before I would spend so much time fixing it from sleeping on it.</li>
            <li> I decided that I would take a shower the night before and see how this flatiron would work on my hair and to see how much work I would have to spend on my hair to &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34;it.</li>
            <li> I think I like it equally as much as the BabyBliss porcelain one.</li>
            <li> My hair even stayed straight during a thunderstorm, which is unheard of for me.  </li>
            <li> Really like this flat iron; first read the reviews, all favorable, and they were right!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my third flat iron and, while not the most expensive, it&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t very thick, but I&#x27;m thinking this flat iron might work best on permed hair.</li>
            <li> I had one before and last forever, it  does flat iron your hair really nice and shiny.</li>
            <li> cause it doesn&#x27;t snag on my hair like most other straighteners I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have to say, that is a pretty amazing run for an iron that is used at LEAST twice a week for seven years.    </li>
            <li> I usually spend between $50 and $100 on a flat iron, and this is priced reasonably and works great.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd HairArt Flat Iron I have ordered.&lt;br /&gt;The first pooped out after many years</li>
            <li> My previous brand that I&#x27;ve paid double of the price is not as good as this one is...</li>
            <li> Brand new!</li>
            <li> but you need to be careful because it can crack easily</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommended, my old one lasted like 8 years until it eventually broke from dropping it so much but its very durable</li>
            <li> It really leaves your hair soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> I only have to run it over my hair once because it can get very hot.</li>
            <li> Using this iron almost every day, I highly recommend it as it does not ruin your hair like others I have tried.</li>
            <li> The trick to protect hair from damage is to not have the temperature at a high setting.</li>
            <li> Then, in high school, I hauled it everywhere between houses with said girlfriends.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the same one my hair dresser uses on my hair and do far, not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Using them doesn&#x27;t require as much much work as my old ones.</li>
            <li> I received this nearly a week and a half ago, but I didn&#x27;t want to review it until I&#x27;d tried it more than once to see if it wasn&#x27;t a fluke.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this hair straightener for 10 years and only had to replace it twice - both times because it got dropped or pulled off the counter more than once and eventually made the plates loose</li>
            <li> I have extremely wavy hair and this product makes it smooth and sleek.</li>
            <li> After 15 years it was time for a new one</li>
            <li> I am now 26 and bought a new one.</li>
            <li> I had the BabyBliss one before, but I like to try new ones after about a year.</li>
            <li> I rarely take the time to write reviews, but this flat iron deserves it!  </li>
            <li> Wow, wow, wow!!!</li>
            <li> I am white but have very, very curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very natural curly hair</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy, coarse hair (am Mexican-American) and always concerned heating tools won&#x27;t get hot enough for a good straightening.</li>
            <li> It seems to have a power that makes my hair feel silky, soft, and manageable!</li>
            <li> I have only bought this iron twice because my first one lasted 12 years.</li>
            <li> and so I replaced it with the same exact one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a quality device with a generous 1-3/8&amp;#34; wide ironing surface, 3/8&amp;#34; wider than many flat irons.</li>
            <li> It does tend to make a noise (can only describe it as an &amp;#34;electrical buzzing&amp;#34;) while in use</li>
            <li> I like this straightening iron better than any other that I&#x27;ve tried and there has been many of them; however, the only negative thing I can say about it is that it doesn&#x27;t close completely on the hair.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> It looks soft and touchable.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair so soft and shiny..</li>
            <li> Bought this one to replace my old that I had for years.</li>
            <li> Secondly, it shipped a day earlier than expected, so I was really pleased.</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly,you can straighten and curl with it.the only problem</li>
            <li> The Pro-liss worked, but my hair only stayed straight for about an hour</li>
            <li> works well with my thick hair  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I can just slide the iron in the case when done vs waiting for it to cool down.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through about 15 flat irons that really damaged my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard so much about this flat iron.</li>
            <li> , my little sister has super curly hair and believe me it works (of course it takes her longer than me because she has a lot of curly hair), before we discovered this product, she used to take a couples hour trying to straight her hair with different types of iron (from Revlon, to conair, etc).</li>
            <li> and i just got one as a present for my older sister.</li>
            <li> I bought my first one (this same one) over 10 years ago, back in highschool and it just now broke.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the same one since high school (2006) and just had to replace it since the cord wore out</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not mixed with anything--noticed a lot of positive reviews from mixed girls).</li>
            <li> It can straighten very coarse/ thick/ natural African American hair textures with ease.</li>
            <li> I immediately went searching on Amazon, and found my exact same flat iron (just newer and improved).</li>
            <li> and I tried once and fell in love- none of my other more expensive flat irons can compete.  </li>
            <li> I bought a new one, for the low price of $60</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m not really liking having to go over a small section more than 3 times.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to everyone and it lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy directly from the company next time</li>
            <li> Now I only allow my mother to do my hair because she&#x27;s a professional hair stylist and she gets my hair</li>
            <li> The 3rd I just ordered for my 12year old for Christmas</li>
            <li> It has lasted 2 and 1/2 years so far, and it is only now starting to lose it&#x27;s heating power.  </li>
            <li> I use this straightener on my African American chemically treated hair as well as my daughters natural hair.  </li>
            <li> I had to  straighten the same area of hair repetitively, and the hair quickly reverted to a frizzy state.</li>
            <li> On the highest setting, it is no longer hot enough, but it has outlasted other flat irons by leaps and bounds.  </li>
            <li> First lasted about 5 years with using it everyday.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this to replace my previous hair straightener, which is the exact same one.</li>
            <li> In my book, no other flat iron beats this one.</li>
            <li> and i didn&#x27;t really see that in other leading flat irons.</li>
            <li> I have only had the Hair Art for a month or so, but I can straighten my long, natural, multi-ethnic hair to the quality of a salon.</li>
            <li> I have had a few different flat irons - Revlon, Chi, Gold n Hot.  </li>
            <li> I am an african amerian/indian mix woman, my hair is very curly, slightly course and thick therefore I needed a flat iron that gets really hot and that can give me that bouncy, flowy and shiny look.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing all the other sizes of the HairArt Tourmaline flat irons in the NEAR future.</li>
            <li> It gets 50 degrees hotter than my last flat iron (HAI).  </li>
            <li> I have had this flat iron (the model before the tourmaline)vfor seven years, and it just died on me last week.  </li>
            <li> I received this flat iron about 6 years ago as a birthday present</li>
            <li> This is my second one of these flat irons.  </li>
            <li> This is my second HairArt flat iron.</li>
            <li> This is my second HairArt flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think televisions last that long.    </li>
            <li> and I use this flat iron every day.  </li>
            <li> Does this flat iron go up to 450 degrees, instead of the listed 410??</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;ve never bought an electrical flat iron because I&#x27;ve never had to</li>
            <li> I have had this flat iron for over 7 years</li>
            <li> I wanted these for a long time and finally order them.</li>
            <li> The flat iron works well with variation of controls and ability to style.  </li>
            <li> After reading the reviews on this flat iron</li>
            <li> So, that being said this flat iron serves it purpose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this flat iron since I was in 8th grade</li>
            <li> I have thick, very wavy hair that reacts instantly to humidity in the air.</li>
            <li> hair is hard to straighten and this makes it happen so much quicker&lt;</li>
            <li> this flat iron is THE TRUTH!!!</li>
            <li> You will never need to purchase another flat iron in your life, Just stick with the HairART!!!</li>
            <li> Between all the hauling and abuse the straightener took, it&#x27;s lasted a hell of a long time.</li>
            <li> I found out my hair is so soft I had to adjust the temperature a few times.</li>
            <li> If you have thin hair, it would slide right out of it.</li>
            <li> I need to run it through my hair once or twice (usually 4 times with my other one) and it is completely straight.</li>
            <li> I had received one 6-7 years ago and it was the one thing I COULD NOT live without.</li>
            <li> I flat iron my hair about every other day and it is not damaged.</li>
            <li> I considered this flat iron after watching some You Tube demos and reading other reviews.</li>
            <li> The average flat iron that I&#x27;ve purchased has lasted about 1 year.  </li>
            <li> Bought this same model at hair saloon a few years ago for $100.  </li>
            <li> Minimal damage when I go without a trim for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li> I used it all throughout 8th grade with a bunch of my other girlfriends too.</li>
            <li> to do if i want a other one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I just had to take one star away because in the pictures it shows that there should be a travel case, and by reading the other reviews I can see that some people had it with the case, mine arrived without the travel case</li>
            <li> but flatiron it straight.my other flatiron was always pulling on my hair.</li>
            <li> Be careful when you buy!</li>
            <li> and i would never buy any other iron</li>
            <li> (the other just wouldn&#x27;t turn on).</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace my old one that finally started to fail after 9 years.</li>
            <li> However, the first time I bought the product after about two weeks it kept cutting off.</li>
            <li> I used a little grapeseed oil to protect it, and then the iron.  </li>
            <li> and i decided to go with the hairart because when I saw black women using it on youtube there hair wasn&#x27;t stiff</li>
            <li> My last straightener sizzled and fried like crazy to the point that the gold plates came off the second time of use</li>
            <li> I was frustrated with my old iron and did not like how it did not put out enough heat to make my hair sleek, not frizzy, even though it went up to 450 degrees.  </li>
            <li> I had the Chi for a few years now and decided to purchase one of these for myself.  </li>
            <li> I had it since then for a few years.</li>
            <li> buy my iron few weeks ago</li>
            <li> heats up to 450 in just few seconds.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> have thick heavy hair</li>
            <li> I found a youtube video review on it, so if you&#x27;re still not sure, go watch it.</li>
            <li> It was a small investment for years of use.</li>
            <li> Never really satisfied with the outcome, straightness or shine.</li>
            <li> there is a small mm sized space between unless you hold very firm.  </li>
            <li> Finally, I found this straightener and purchased it, since it didn&#x27;t have a single bad review.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews that are not happy about the warranty</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed as I have purchased this flat iron before but apparently after reading other reviews (too late) the quality has changed for the worse!  </li>
            <li> and the wires were slowly disconnecting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener in the past and it lasted me over 10 years!</li>
            <li> Handles well and heats up in a few seconds!!  </li>
            <li> I am so serious.</li>
            <li> I have thick, poofy, frizzy hair and this straightener worked wonders!</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair &amp; this straightener</li>
            <li> I was not happy with what I had found on the market and decided to stay with Hairart</li>
            <li> I see it as false advertising, but maybe that&#x27;s just me...</li>
            <li> so i think that&#x27;s false advertising. ...</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one...</li>
            <li> then I&#x27;m unhappy.</li>
            <li> This ceramic straightening iron was a disappointing purchase.</li>
            <li> but were disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Well, I was shocked!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this flat iron. It is better does way better than the other name brands that I use on my hair. It makes my hair shiny and full of body!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok I&#x27;ve used this brand before and loved it.  There&#x27;s something about this iron that I don&#x27;t love. I&#x27;ll buy directly from the company next time</li>
            <li> I Love this Iron. It heat up quick and works really well for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I actually bought this for my daughter&lt;br /&gt;She is thrilled with the performance.&lt;br /&gt;Great but ! Great price.</li>
            <li> Using this iron almost every day, I highly recommend it as it does not ruin your hair like others I have tried. It styles your hair quickly and very smoothly. The trick to protect hair from damage is to not have the temperature at a high setting.</li>
            <li> Good product, really like it get hot pretty quick and does a good job... with any hair.</li>
            <li> love this flat iron.  I had one like this a long time ago and it lasted for so many years, but eventually gave out.  so happy I found it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through about 15 flat irons that really damaged my hair. When my Dallas hair stylist DeAnna Rosenblum said to try this one I was ready.  Now my hair is smooth even on the really humid days!  She was right, I LOVE this flat iron!</li>
            <li> Received hair straightener very fast. Love the product! It doesn&#x27;t burn your hand when you use it. It comes with its own case so you don&#x27;t have to worry about where I sat it down.</li>
            <li> Thank you..be Blessed</li>
            <li> My review won&#x27;t say i am a buyer of this product, but i am a receiver and lover of this product.&lt;br /&gt;My husband got it for my birthday 2 years ago, my sister bought her first one 6 years ago and i just got one as a present for my older sister. (from my husband&#x27;s prime account).&lt;br /&gt;So with that said,  is a really good iron, leaves your hair smooth, it is not necessary to go twice on your hair and it doesn&#x27;t pull or break your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick heavy hair so sometimes all i have to do is  my endings, my little sister has super curly hair and believe me it works (of course it takes her longer than me because she has a lot of curly hair), before we discovered this product, she used to take a couples hour trying to straight her hair with different types of iron (from Revlon, to conair, etc). And my older sister has long wavy hair, so it does a perfect job in 3 different types of hair.&lt;br /&gt;The one she bought 6 years ago, it is still working ( it makes funny sound when you close it and you have to angle it so it doesn&#x27;t break on you) but  for an iron that is been used for 6 years probably almost every day, (except on Sundays)  i think it is a good quality and a good investment, i recommend it to every one who ask me about my hair and i am thinking on getting one for my mother in law, who is always complaining about her &amp;#34;pharmacy hair iron&amp;#34;, and once she tried it at my house she noticed how easy it was to do her hair and how silky and smooth her hair was.&lt;br /&gt;I would give it  10 stars if amazon would have the option.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product. It gets 50 degrees hotter than my last flat iron (HAI).  I ordered the product on Tuesday and it arrived before the weekend. Great service</li>
            <li> Best flat iron I love this</li>
            <li> I have had this flat iron (the model before the tourmaline)vfor seven years, and it just died on me last week.  I have to say, that is a pretty amazing run for an iron that is used at LEAST twice a week for seven years.    I don&#x27;t think televisions last that long.    Buy one, I am going to buy one today!!!</li>
            <li> This flat iron is great.  I chemically relax my hair once every 5 weeks and I use this flat iron every day.  It has lasted 2 and 1/2 years so far, and it is only now starting to lose it&#x27;s heating power.  On the highest setting, it is no longer hot enough, but it has outlasted other flat irons by leaps and bounds.  The average flat iron that I&#x27;ve purchased has lasted about 1 year.  I usually spend between $50 and $100 on a flat iron, and this is priced reasonably and works great.</li>
            <li> better deal than the chi and works just as well if not better - love that you can adjust the temp!</li>
            <li> Same one my hair stylist uses, love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this!</li>
            <li> I tried dozen of flat irons, but this flat iron is THE BEST one ever. It seems to have a power that makes my hair feel silky, soft, and manageable! I would mos def tell everyone women and child to use this product</li>
            <li> Bought this same model at hair saloon a few years ago for $100.  It works great, heats up fast.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, the first H3000 she had for years.</li>
            <li> Great product, my sister loves it</li>
            <li> Absolutely love, love, love.  I had the Chi for a few years now and decided to purchase one of these for myself.  (my hairdresser uses on her clients and recommended)  Think it does a much better job straightening and i love the heat control setting.</li>
            <li> Does this flat iron go up to 450 degrees, instead of the listed 410?? Does anyone know? Some are saying it does, maybe they didnt update the ad. Thanks</li>
            <li> Perfect for our natural 4c hair. :-) nice silky finish and it heats up very fast!</li>
            <li> This is a great flat iron, however the moment I turned it on it smelled burnt &amp; it still does.</li>
            <li> Love it. Leaves hair smooth. Minimal damage when I go without a trim for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li> OMG THIS FLATIRON SAVED MY LIFE!! this flat iron is THE TRUTH!!! do you hear me. You will never need to purchase another flat iron in your life, Just stick with the HairART!!! OMG AMAZING, I don&#x27;t even have to put product in my hair, that&#x27;s how good this iron is. It leaves your hair straight and moisturized silky sheen!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect size and heating... This was recommended to me by my stylist who uses the same one.</li>
            <li> I have had this flatiron before so knew that I would love it!!! This is the best one I ever used...</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, great product. I love my hair using this product. Easy to use, has wonderful storage case. I would recommend this product to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> Super Fast delivery and excellent product!</li>
            <li> Great was a gift she loved it, The second one that I have bought, I would buy it again.It was a great price and was sent on time .</li>
            <li> I purchased a HairArt flat iron 15 years ago and loved it. Even bought one for my daughter. After 15 years it was time for a new one and I did not hesitate to purchase from HairArt again. I love this flat iron!!!!</li>
            <li> GREAT...Does wonders on my hair....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the best iron I&#x27;ve ever had.  It does it&#x27;s job but it&#x27;s not as effective as others I&#x27;ve owned.  It does not smooths my ends or calm any frizz.  I&#x27;m just not crazy about it, and I&#x27;ve had others that I really liked.</li>
            <li> Now I only allow my mother to do my hair because she&#x27;s a professional hair stylist and she gets my hair Bone Straight just how i like it.   I&#x27;m a VERY PICKY woman when it comes to my hair... if it&#x27;s not bouncy, flowy shiny and my ROOTS aren&#x27;t straight then I&#x27;m unhappy. Now I&#x27;ve never bought an electrical flat iron because I&#x27;ve never had to and I didn&#x27;t know which flat iron would be Best to invest in seeing the fact that there are alot of good flat irons out there. So I did my research, looked at reviews and watched some youtubes and i decided to go with the hairart because when I saw black women using it on youtube there hair wasn&#x27;t stiff, it had that bouncy,flowy shiny look that I was looking for and i didn&#x27;t really see that in other leading flat irons. I am an african amerian/indian mix woman, my hair is very curly, slightly course and thick therefore I needed a flat iron that gets really hot and that can give me that bouncy, flowy and shiny look. The HairArt H3000 is 5 star rating, the temp. goes from 140 to 450 degrees which is a BIG plus for me, it has tourmaline which seals the ends of your hair, another plus for me and its a ceramic straightening and Curling iron. As soon as it came in the mail I opened it right away! I washed and blow-dryed my hair and got straight to it....and let me tell you guys I was Astonished! cuz it gave me that Bone Straight, Bouncy, Flowy, Shiny look just like my mommy does it and I Am a Happy customer...Im a Very Picky woman when it comes to my hair....i know what I want and what i want to see and The HairArt H3000 did that for Picky Me</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift to my girl and she likes it.&lt;br /&gt;Way better than her old one and way cheaper than buying it in a beauty supply store.&lt;br /&gt;Should come with some kind of case or sock but other than that, it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair straightener my daughter has ever used!  We have purchased 2 cheaper models thinking they would work well but were disappointed.  This HairArt straightener is amazing.  It heats well, straightens beautifully and doesn&#x27;t burn like some of the other brands we have tried.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is the best out there and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it. Is easy to use and does the work. This product is used in many salons, so that&#x27;s say something great about this brand. Thanks so much for a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this to replace my previous hair straightener, which is the exact same one. The plate fell out of my old one this year, which was kind of impressive considering I&#x27;ve had it since I was 12 (I&#x27;m currently 22 - 10 years!). I used it all throughout 8th grade with a bunch of my other girlfriends too. Then, in high school, I hauled it everywhere between houses with said girlfriends. When I finally moved out to my dorm, I took this straightener everywhere with me. Between all the hauling and abuse the straightener took, it&#x27;s lasted a hell of a long time. I recommend this straightener to everyone and it&#x27;s kept my hair pretty fab for years. Plus it&#x27;s a great curler as well as straightener.</li>
            <li> Great price for professional model.</li>
            <li> I have only bought this iron twice because my first one lasted 12 years. I have thick hair and this is the BEST iron for really straightening it out smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a pretty straightening iron,I bought the same one years ago and it lasted a lifetime, I hope this one lasts a long time too, the temperature is perfect and your hair looks great!!</li>
            <li> love this flat iron I am a hairstylist and this iron is great for silk pressing and gives the best shine.</li>
            <li> I looked at many different hair straighteners and eventually consulted my hair-stylist friend who always has perfectly straight hair. She uses this one and has had hers for 9 years now. This sold me on it. I&#x27;ve used mine a few times and it&#x27;s worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> I love it !! Once you get turning of curling with it, it&#x27;s amazing. Also straightens amazingly and simply. !</li>
            <li> I received this flat iron about 6 years ago as a birthday present and it still works just as the first day I used it. I love this flat iron so much that I gave one to my niece for her birthday this year. In my book, no other flat iron beats this one. I found a youtube video review on it, so if you&#x27;re still not sure, go watch it. It might help you make up your mind. I recommend it 100%.</li>
            <li> I received this nearly a week and a half ago, but I didn&#x27;t want to review it until I&#x27;d tried it more than once to see if it wasn&#x27;t a fluke. It&#x27;s a really great straightener on my natural African American hair (I&#x27;m not mixed with anything--noticed a lot of positive reviews from mixed girls). Also, my hair always frizzes when I&#x27;m out, but after using this straightener, it doesn&#x27;t as much. I realized that it depends on the products I use as I&#x27;m using the straightener. If I use my Pantene shine with argon oil--and a heat protectant, of course--it doesn&#x27;t frizz, but if I use just the heat protectant and put a shine product on my hair after I straighten it then it does kind of frizz by the end of the day. I&#x27;d also like to point out that when using hair products while I&#x27;m straightening my hair, the product doesn&#x27;t make the gold plate come off! My last straightener sizzled and fried like crazy to the point that the gold plates came off the second time of use but this one didn&#x27;t. And the residue of product use doesn&#x27;t stick to it, so once it&#x27;s cooled off, just wipe it off and the sides, really easy to get off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing I love about this straightener is that when you&#x27;re using it and place your hands on the top where the gold plates are positioned underneath it doesn&#x27;t burn! Even on the highest setting, it just felt warm. Didn&#x27;t burn at all. I&#x27;m really pleased with this straightener. It was a nice purchase.</li>
            <li> Showed item comes with heat resistant carrying case but was not included, sent back, unused</li>
            <li> I bought this item first when I was 18 in a mall in one of those kiosks! I had it since then for a few years. I am now 26 and bought a new one. So mine lasted a good 7+ years! This flat iron is the best. I have used professional ones that my hair dresser has sold me down to the cheap ones from target and this by far lasts longer and does a great job. Also I do curls/tousles with it and the width &amp; shape of this iron lets me do it effortlessly! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I Absolute love it, I&#x27;ve use different iron straightener and this is my favorite, does not frye your hair a!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this hair straightener for 10 years and only had to replace it twice - both times because it got dropped or pulled off the counter more than once and eventually made the plates loose and it would snag my hair. If not for that, I am sure this product could easily last years. It is my go to straightener. I have extremely wavy hair and this product makes it smooth and sleek. The cord swivels so no matter how I twist or turn it, the cords never get tangled. The price is reasonable for the quality as well; love the product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of this iron. It heats up quickly, doesn&#x27;t pull my hair, and seems to be great quality. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, does the job without damaging and burning hair, like other products.</li>
            <li> I love this straightener, it works really well and don&#x27;t pull my hair. My previous brand that I&#x27;ve paid double of the price is not as good as this one is... Me and my daughter are very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> By far, the best flat iron I&#x27;ve used! I bought this when I was 16 for almost $300 and it JUST broke (add a decade and a bit!), so I had no hesitation in buying another.  In the interim I bought a &amp;#34;newer&amp;#34; replacement that was total garbage!  Love my hairart!</li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;I buy my iron few weeks ago and i did work anymore. I us it  only 2 times. My sister buy the same 20 years ago and i is  Always good. My dauther had  the same to since 2 years. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a problem of fabrication. I don&#x27;t know what  i have  to do if i want a other one.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have my box anymore because i think it was i very good product.&lt;br /&gt;I gone wait your reply.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m french if it&#x27;s better for you.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nadine Boucher&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My email is nad.b@bell.net</li>
            <li> This is my second one of these flat irons.  They works great and last a long time.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in time promised and was product I wanted.</li>
            <li> its just to replace an old one, if she wants the same i thinks is because is a great product</li>
            <li> They Work Great And Get The Hair Straight...Very  Hot Wish  You Guys Carried The 2In Ones AS Well In hairarts</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace my old one that finally started to fail after 9 years. SO happy with product</li>
            <li> I have thick, poofy, frizzy hair and this straightener worked wonders! I need to run it through my hair once or twice (usually 4 times with my other one) and it is completely straight. It also adds shine to the hair and I don&#x27;t need to re straighten my hair for a couple days. Love this product!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener in the past and it lasted me over 10 years! I love it cause it doesn&#x27;t snag on my hair like most other straighteners I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair &amp; this straightener works well with my thick hair  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Great straightening iron at a great price.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best flat iron I have used. I have used it for the past 2-months now and I am very pleased. Good quality product and a great price. I would definitely recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> Horrors!  I set the temp to 300 degrees - when I used it, the blades fell apart and a chunk of hair was stuck to the blades with the lower hair falling out!  I was so disappointed as I have purchased this flat iron before but apparently after reading other reviews (too late) the quality has changed for the worse!  DO NOT Purchase!!</li>
            <li> Love this iron. Makes my hair silky.  Tried others but always go back to this one. Definitely recommend this iron.</li>
            <li> Great iron for curling I&#x27;m a hair stylist and love the weight if it , also shine it gives hair I purchased every size iron they have .</li>
            <li> Arrived today, as scheduled, in a good condition. plugged it in and it worked just fine. heats up to 450 in just few seconds. I just had to take one star away because in the pictures it shows that there should be a travel case, and by reading the other reviews I can see that some people had it with the case, mine arrived without the travel case, I wish the company would send it to me, I really need that travel case.</li>
            <li> I have had this flat iron for over 7 years and it is still in great shape! I flat iron my hair about every other day and it is not damaged. Love it!!! Will order another whenever this one kicks the bucket!</li>
            <li> The wife loves it but the cords are good for about a year at best.</li>
            <li> My favorite flat iron ever.  This is one of those rare products.. Something my mom was using and I tried once and fell in love- none of my other more expensive flat irons can compete.  Great price-cheap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that the plates don&#x27;t line up 100%- as in when they press together to clamp hair there is a small mm sized space between unless you hold very firm.  I don&#x27;t think my moms identical flatiron did this so it might just be my individual one... Nonetheless it seems to work great!</li>
            <li> I love my new flat iron! it gets hot and gets my hair really straight and glides through my hair and makes my hair feel like silk. you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one...</li>
            <li> I bought this one before about 10 or  11 years ago.  It still works but the ceramic part is wearing.  After 10 years, who can beat it for the price.</li>
            <li> Buying this to replace the one i had for 4 1/2 yrs.  Used almost daily! Strongly Recommend.</li>
            <li> I have used one everyday for over 6 years and went looking for a good quality replacement.  I was not happy with what I had found on the market and decided to stay with Hairart</li>
            <li> I love this hair iron.  My hair stylist recommended it and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a licensed cosmetologist n I love this tool. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good product for a decent price</li>
            <li> the travel bag that was shown did not come with the Iron. Very disappointing. I see it as false advertising, but maybe that&#x27;s just me...</li>
            <li> As a hairdresser, I can honestly tell you that these are the best flat irons you can buy. I have tried others but none compare to the HairArt brand. You need these in your life. They will get your hair silky smooth every time!</li>
            <li> This machine works great!!</li>
            <li> i love this straightener it actually works and doesn&#x27;t damage hair</li>
            <li> Best flatiron ever!!! I wanted these for a long time and finally order them. My sister have pair and I just had to get me a pair!</li>
            <li> I rarely take the time to write reviews, but this flat iron deserves it!  I&#x27;ve had it for about 4 years now and it still works great.  It&#x27;s like my ride or die hair styling tool, lol.  I have chemically relaxed hair and it treats my hair with TLC. Never burns it. Leaves it smooth and shining.  After all these years, the blades show no sign of wear.  It was a small investment for years of use. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly. Its nice that you can control the temperature according to your hair type. I can straighten my hair in 5 minutes, it is so easy. Leaves my hair soft and shiny. Very please with this product.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd one . Like it very much.First lasted about 5 years with using it everyday.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent flat iron.  It gets extremely hot and the storage case works very well.  I can just slide the iron in the case when done vs waiting for it to cool down.  I like the heat dial and with this iron I do not need to press my hair.    LOVE IT!  Great price and great product.</li>
            <li> I have never used a straightener before, so I can&#x27;t compare this to anything else.  It goes up to 450 degrees.  I am white but have very, very curly hair.  This straightens it fine and doesn&#x27;t seem to damage it too much.  It&#x27;s also nice and compact, but I guess that could be a downside if you had a lot of hair (I have an undercut so I&#x27;m only straightening about 25% of my hair).  I would probably recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I am completely thrilled with this flat iron! I had received one 6-7 years ago and it was the one thing I COULD NOT live without. one day it finally broke and I was so devastated. I immediately went searching on Amazon, and found my exact same flat iron (just newer and improved). I have been so happy with this product, I rave about it to my friends!</li>
            <li> I love this hair straightener! I highly recommend it to everyone and it lasts a really long time. Worth the investment</li>
            <li> This iron is great. I found out my hair is so soft I had to adjust the temperature a few times.</li>
            <li> LOVE this straightener. I&#x27;ve used the same one since high school (2006) and just had to replace it since the cord wore out and the wires were slowly disconnecting. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The best I&#x27;ve ever owned. The curved edge on the heat plate makes such a difference.</li>
            <li> I have had a few different flat irons - Revlon, Chi, Gold n Hot.  Never really satisfied with the outcome, straightness or shine. The straight look never lasted.&lt;br /&gt;With this one, my hair is moving, shiny shiny shiny, and straight.  It looks soft and touchable. I used 320 degrees, and my hair is awesome. Straight and silky in one pass.  I am on day 3, and my hair is awesome, if I say so myself. I used a little grapeseed oil to protect it, and then the iron.  AWESOME. Get it. I am so serious.</li>
            <li> This is my second HairArt flat iron. My last one lasted about 8 years, so when it gave out I knew I was going to stick to the same brand. What&#x27;s so great about this one is that it works even better than my last one! It leaves my hair so soft and shiny..I&#x27;ve gotten so many great compliments on my hair!! It took a bit longer than I thought to ship out to me, but I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Excellent straightener! Very hot!</li>
            <li> This ceramic straightening iron was a disappointing purchase. I had to  straighten the same area of hair repetitively, and the hair quickly reverted to a frizzy state. The shipping was excellent.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for our daughter.  She absolutely loves the straightener.  The temperature setting is great.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!!!  I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Heats up fast and is hot.</li>
            <li> This is my second HairArt flat iron.  Love this flat iron.  Bought this one to replace my old that I had for years.</li>
            <li> Love my flat iron. Delivery time was excellent.  But i don&#x27;t K  ke how it shows the cover case and i didn&#x27;t receive one. I was expecting one.  Called amazon it doesn&#x27;t come with it so i think that&#x27;s false advertising. ...</li>
            <li> This is amazing! I saw a review on it on youtube which made me want to purchase it. It can straighten very coarse/ thick/ natural African American hair textures with ease. It heats up very quickly as well. I bought this a few years ago and it still works very well.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd HairArt Flat Iron I have ordered.&lt;br /&gt;The first pooped out after many years and so I replaced it with the same exact one.  The 3rd I just ordered for my 12year old for Christmas so she would have her own and stop using mine, LOL.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in a timely manner and was very pleased.</li>
            <li> Really like this flat iron; first read the reviews, all favorable, and they were right!  Works great on human hair wigs and you can set the temperature.  Handles well and heats up in a few seconds!!  You won&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> Very good for the price. Doesn&#x27;t damage you&#x27;re hair</li>
            <li> This is quite possibly the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair. It makes my hair straight as a pin and keeps it shiny and smooth. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I will be ordering this again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard so much about this flat iron. I was frustrated with my old iron and did not like how it did not put out enough heat to make my hair sleek, not frizzy, even though it went up to 450 degrees.  My hairdresser uses this one from HairArt and recommended it to me.  I read the reviews and went ahead and got it.  Although it is better than the iron I had, this one is just one step better. It still does not meet my expectations. I even had my hairdresser try it out with her  &amp;#34;magic touch&amp;#34; and it is not the same as the one they use in salons. It seems like it is a knock off.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. I would look for something better, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Love this straightener. The ONLY thing I would change is that I wish it had an automatic off on it.</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT ITS THE SECOND ONE WE&#x27;VE HAD</li>
            <li> I have only had the Hair Art for a month or so, but I can straighten my long, natural, multi-ethnic hair to the quality of a salon.</li>
            <li> I had one before and last forever, it  does flat iron your hair really nice and shiny.</li>
            <li> These work wonderful! Great buy! They work like the stove hot irons! Dont hesitate, buy them!</li>
            <li> I brought this for my mom because my sister and I have the same one. We have had it for over 10 years and still works great.</li>
            <li> I ordered this flatiron a week ago. It arrived in 2 days! I have very natural curly hair but flatiron it straight.my other flatiron was always pulling on my hair.I have a friend who uses this flatiron and I was so impressed!! It really leaves your hair soft and shiny! I always take a shower in the morning because if I took it the night before I would spend so much time fixing it from sleeping on it.I decided that I would take a shower the night before and see how this flatiron would work on my hair and to see how much work I would have to spend on my hair to &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34;it. Well, I was shocked!! It was just as perfect as the night before!! This is the best flatiron ever! It does not have a automatic turn off sensor but for me that is not a problem, I always unplug everything. Give it a try, you will be hooked!!</li>
            <li> Brand new! Thanks again!</li>
            <li> Five stars from me for this excellent flat iron for quality, wide heat surface, long cord, fast heating, on/off button, and variety of temperatures. Whew!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my third flat iron and, while not the most expensive, it&#x27;s the best. It&#x27;s a quality device with a generous 1-3/8&amp;#34; wide ironing surface, 3/8&amp;#34; wider than many flat irons. I love its long cord; it makes handling the iron so easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It heats in a matter of seconds, has an on-off button and a temperature range of 140 to 450 degrees, which makes it a workable appliance for all hair types! Wheee!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: Buy it! (Be sure to use a heat protective hair product before using any flat iron; it&#x27;ll keep your hair shiny and healthy.)</li>
            <li> I like this straightening iron better than any other that I&#x27;ve tried and there has been many of them; however, the only negative thing I can say about it is that it doesn&#x27;t close completely on the hair.  If you have thin hair, it would slide right out of it.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t pull or snag my hair.  I had to buy this one to replace the one I broke (totally my fault).  The old one was about 7 years old and still working perfectly until I dropped it one too many times on my hard tile floor.  I hope this one holds up as well.</li>
            <li> Very best straightener I have ever owned. It is the same one my hairdresser uses.</li>
            <li> This is WONDERFUL my hair has never looked this good!!! I&#x27;ve used other flat irons that I just wasn&#x27;t happy with. Until this one came into my life woohoo!! I&#x27;m going to buy the next they have as well. My daughter keeps borrowing mine. Best purchase EVER!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing. This is my second one. I also have clients who have purchased it. And love it as well</li>
            <li> Wow, wow, wow!!! I am really impressed! First of all, the price was affordable! Secondly, it shipped a day earlier than expected, so I was really pleased. And lastly, the Hair Art did an amazing job on my hair!! I was a bit nervous at first because I wasn&#x27;t sure how my hair would turn out with this flatiron, but my hair was left feeling really soft and silky and smooth and straight!! I give the Hair Art H3000 four stars because this was my first time trying it. However I do recommend this flatiron! I do not regret the purchase!</li>
            <li> It is awesome left my hair feeling like silk way better then the flat iron I had before</li>
            <li> Very good product!!!!</li>
            <li> I have this straightener and have had it for 10 years but I need a new one and when I found this product I was excited but When I received the product I plugged it in and it didn&#x27;t work. I tried different outlets thinking it was my house but it wasn&#x27;t. Be careful when you buy!</li>
            <li> I love this tool because being a hair stylist you have to work with the best quality of tools. It&#x27;s soooo much better than the Chi that I USED to use, the Chi did not straighten the hair, did not leave moisture and it did not leave body and bounce. I will be purchasing all the other sizes of the HairArt Tourmaline flat irons in the NEAR future.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it. I brought one 10 years ago, used it every day. Great quality product, see you in 10 years, lol</li>
            <li> I luv luv this hair straightener! It heats up very quickly,you can straighten and curl with it.the only problem was I had to change the plug from a 2 pin to a 3 pin because I&#x27;m in the uk.besides that,its a great product,thank you!</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron use professionally cost is reasonable super good product</li>
            <li> These Straighteners are amazing! They get really hot and works very well. The straighteners are durable and great! Great buy</li>
            <li> I use this straightener on my African American chemically treated hair as well as my daughters natural hair.  It works perfectly on both.  It is even better than my electric hot comb.  I LOVE this straightener.  I hope it holds up as well as it works.  So far, so good!!</li>
            <li> I chose this product, because my hair stylist has this product and they curls my hair wonderfully. I love these flat iron</li>
            <li> The flat iron works well with variation of controls and ability to style.  I have a problem accessing controls on the inside, so I don&#x27;t turn it off. I unplug it.  I have a problem doing the hair flips, but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many irons and this is by far the best. It is very hot and leaves your hair silky and straight and at a great price for what it does! HIGHLY recommended, my old one lasted like 8 years until it eventually broke from dropping it so much but its very durable and i would never buy any other iron</li>
            <li> Great product, love it!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a perm in about 3 years. I&#x27;ve have had my hair braided up as I transition from perms. After reading the reviews on this flat iron I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. So far I&#x27;m not really liking having to go over a small section more than 3 times. My hair isn&#x27;t very thick, but I&#x27;m thinking this flat iron might work best on permed hair.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertized.</li>
            <li> I bought this one as a backup for my first one, just in case it goes out. Very easy to handle and the temperature settings are accurate. I love this!</li>
            <li> Product came on time but it does not work well. I was very disappointed. It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Straightens and curls my fine hair better than any flat or straightening iron I have used.&lt;br /&gt;Lives up to the Hair Art name.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this straighter before and works great but you need to be careful because it can crack easily or if you wrap the cord it will stop heating up right so take precious of it so u don&#x27;t have to keep repurchasing it like me</li>
            <li> I bought this as a birthday(04/01 )present for myself and it was a great choice. I only have to run it over my hair once because it can get very hot. I would suggest keeping the temperature at 370, not the max. However, the first time I bought the product after about two weeks it kept cutting off. I contacted the company and they sent me another one. So far it&#x27;s still going strong. Let&#x27;s pray it stays that way!!!</li>
            <li> I just received these flat irons today and they are great!! Using them doesn&#x27;t require as much much work as my old ones. They heat up fast and leave your hair straight and shiny!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter.  She was quite pleased with it and uses it all the time.  It does as promised and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love this straightening iron. I had the BabyBliss one before, but I like to try new ones after about a year. I&#x27;ve been using this one for 7 months now, and it is holding up excellent. The blades are not burnt, nor scratched, still smooth and shiny. It works perfectly for curling also. I think I like it equally as much as the BabyBliss porcelain one. This one takes a little longer to heat up, but it stays hot and works great.</li>
            <li> I considered this flat iron after watching some You Tube demos and reading other reviews. I like to write my reviews after I&#x27;ve had the product awhile and have actually used it. So, that being said this flat iron serves it purpose. I do believe it&#x27;s better than a store bought Revlon or Gold N&#x27; Hot. It flat irons nicely and so far neither my daughter or I have singed our hair. It does tend to make a noise (can only describe it as an &amp;#34;electrical buzzing&amp;#34;) while in use but no problems have occured. I like it and definitely recommend it for the money. I&#x27;ve read other reviews that are not happy about the warranty so definitely read up about that before purchase.</li>
            <li> Great flat iron heats up in seconds!!</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy, coarse hair (am Mexican-American) and always concerned heating tools won&#x27;t get hot enough for a good straightening. This one has done a great job so far. This is the same one my hair dresser uses on my hair and do far, not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have never written a review for anything on amazon but feel compelled to after buy this straightener.  Six months ago my trusty CHI finally broke, and I&#x27;ve been trying to fill its place since then.  I have thick, very wavy hair that reacts instantly to humidity in the air. That said, I&#x27;ve purchased a Pro-liss, a Remington, and two babyliss straighteners in the meantime.  The Pro-liss worked, but my hair only stayed straight for about an hour once I went outside, no matter the weather.  Same for the Remington and one of the Babyliss&#x27;s (the other just wouldn&#x27;t turn on). Finally, I found this straightener and purchased it, since it didn&#x27;t have a single bad review.  finally! my hair will be straight again! I feel like I&#x27;ve been wearing it in a bun for the last six months. This straightener works great, and stays straight for multiple days. My hair even stayed straight during a thunderstorm, which is unheard of for me.  Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> The flat irons get hot and they do a good job of straightening my hair I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> I am a person obsessed with the quest for perfect hair. I always have been. And this is the first and only flat iron I&#x27;ve ever bothered to own. I bought my first one (this same one) over 10 years ago, back in highschool and it just now broke. (and thats after dropping it on the tile floor many, many, many times).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought a new one, for the low price of $60 (I would pay over $300 for this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t recommend it more highly. Everyone who borrows it ends up buying one for themselves. :)</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this item. My dog chewed the cord on my first pair. So I had to quickly replace them. I searched Amazon and there they we&#x27;re. I had replaced curlers within 7 days. Thanks a bunch!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this flat iron since I was in 8th grade and I&#x27;m now a Sophomore in college. Besides the fact that it is still in great condition, it&#x27;s easy to use and leaves hair so shiny and soft. I&#x27;m such a fan.</li>
            <li> Great straight iron for the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never use another&lt;br /&gt;Gets hot quick, doesn&#x27;t damage hair.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is hard to straighten and this makes it happen so much quicker&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s what we all want, right?</li>
            <li> I am an african american woman with coarse but relaxed hair. This is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever had. It makes my hair so bouncy.  I love it!</li>
            <li> This flat iron is amazing! It straigtens or curls my hair just the way I like it. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
