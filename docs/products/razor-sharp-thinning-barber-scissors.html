            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve received this item, and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>I gave a generous 3-star rating because I assume that these are suitable for thinning and texturizing</li>
            <li>Also, my fingers fit in the holes best, and they felt most comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Maybe they work better on stiffer hair.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>After thinning with these shears, my hair is much more manageable and has lost the triangle shape.</li>
            <li>It was worth the effort because the finished hair is much better than before.</li>
            <li>Really sharp and work great</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very sharp and great for thinning hair.</li>
            <li>The edge holds a good sharp edge!</li>
            <li>I cut hair regularly and was surprised that these shears was this good.</li>
            <li>but I was looking for an affordable pair of decent shears to trim my daughter&#x27;s bangs, and these seemed worth trying due to the good reviews.</li>
            <li>But it can not cut fine and soft hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very grateful for that!</li>
            <li>exactly what i wanted.  </li>
            <li>I should bought the higher cost one $30.</li>
            <li>work exactly as needed.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I cut my husbands hair and this works very well once they get adjusted.</li>
            <li>These did the job perfectly, without pulling the hair instead of cutting.  </li>
            <li>They work very well.</li>
            <li>They are sharp, very easy to use and high quality.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perfect for bangs because you can cut your own and feel like you won&#x27;t mess up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yay!</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t the sharpest, but again I didn&#x27;t pay much - they didn&#x27;t do much for my sons super thick hair, but would probably work on normal thickness.</li>
            <li>They were great for neatly cutting my bangs on my hair.</li>
            <li>Perhaps this would go without saying, for hair stylists, but it should be bolded in the title and clearly pointed out in the listing for people with no experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I simply wanted to cut hair normally with normal scissors.</li>
            <li>Maybe I need to wait a little longer to check its true quality.</li>
            <li>High quality and Japanese  steel ?</li>
            <li>Why 2 star rating because I thin out my hair was ok.</li>
            <li>I had a bit of trouble at the first getting the tension adjusted.</li>
            <li>other have notes, the finger holes are pretty small, so if you have large fingers, keep shopping.</li>
            <li>They handle really well and cut just as well and doesn&#x27;t leave half cut hairs etc.</li>
            <li>I wanted to save some money by cutting my husband&#x27;s hair, and these clippers work like magic!</li>

            <li> Used it to thin out hair on top of my head because my hair is really thick.  </li>
            <li> It is just what was needed to keep my bangs from getting too long and heavy when it&#x27;s almost time for another cut.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got long layers in my hair, but it looks like a triangle when dry because it&#x27;s so thick.</li>
            <li> I tried several brands with a patient friend, and he found this brand to pull his hair the least.</li>
            <li> I have long hair (past my shoulders).</li>
            <li> When I first got them, the blades must have been bent and kept hitting each other, which prevented the shears from closing or cutting any hair.</li>
            <li> I am baffled why this is not mentioned anywhere in the listing, or even the previous reviews.</li>
            <li> They are small and sharp.</li>
            <li> I did notice the funny-looking edge, which should&#x27;ve been a red flag, but I assumed these were just regular hair shears with some sort of \\&quot;cutting edge\\&quot; design (pun intended)</li>
            <li> so I was worried I would have a tough time using these, but they come with rubber inserts so I could cut without slipping out of the holes.</li>
            <li> the holes for the fingers are way too small.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After having no luck with these, I did some research and gathered that this style of shears are for thinning and texturizing -- not for regular hair cutting.</li>
            <li> I bought these to use on my dog, and they&#x27;re useless on him.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not savvy in hair cutting or styling</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not savvy in hair cutting or styling but I was looking for an affordable pair of decent shears to trim my daughter&#x27;s bangs, and these seemed worth trying due to the good reviews. I did notice the funny-looking edge, which should&#x27;ve been a red flag, but I assumed these were just regular hair shears with some sort of \\&quot;cutting edge\\&quot; design (pun intended) so I bought them on a whim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having no luck with these, I did some research and gathered that this style of shears are for thinning and texturizing -- not for regular hair cutting. I am baffled why this is not mentioned anywhere in the listing, or even the previous reviews. Perhaps this would go without saying, for hair stylists, but it should be bolded in the title and clearly pointed out in the listing for people with no experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need regular hair shears, these are not what you&#x27;re looking for. I gave a generous 3-star rating because I assume that these are suitable for thinning and texturizing but I simply wanted to cut hair normally with normal scissors. I will keep these to experiment with but I will have to buy a regular pair of shears now too.</li>
            <li> These shears do the job. When I first got them, the blades must have been bent and kept hitting each other, which prevented the shears from closing or cutting any hair. I had to straighten the blades myself, after which they worked okay. I&#x27;ve got long layers in my hair, but it looks like a triangle when dry because it&#x27;s so thick. After thinning with these shears, my hair is much more manageable and has lost the triangle shape. I&#x27;m very grateful for that!</li>
            <li> I tried several brands with a patient friend, and he found this brand to pull his hair the least. Also, my fingers fit in the holes best, and they felt most comfortable and easy to use. I&#x27;m keeping them. They&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair and use these thinning scissors at the end of sessions. They handle really well and cut just as well and doesn&#x27;t leave half cut hairs etc.</li>
            <li> Everything was on time and perfect!</li>
            <li> exactly what i wanted.  amazing. these are the bomb. hey get these scissors if you want to cut your hair nice. hey</li>
            <li> High quality and Japanese  steel ? But it can not cut fine and soft hair. Why 2 star rating because I thin out my hair was ok. Some time it  pull my hair too. I should bought the higher cost one $30.</li>
            <li> I cut hair regularly and was surprised that these shears was this good. They are great for bangs and men&#x27;s hair. They&#x27;re very sharp and great for thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I cut my husbands hair and this works very well once they get adjusted. I had a bit of trouble at the first getting the tension adjusted. It was worth the effort because the finished hair is much better than before.</li>
            <li> the holes for the fingers are way too small.  Also, the blades seemed to be a bit bent and didn&#x27;t close properly.  I sent it back.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for.  They aren&#x27;t the sharpest, but again I didn&#x27;t pay much - they didn&#x27;t do much for my sons super thick hair, but would probably work on normal thickness.</li>
            <li> Scissors are great. You can remove the inserts for larger fingers.</li>
            <li> Bought for occasional use, just for bangs. It is just what was needed to keep my bangs from getting too long and heavy when it&#x27;s almost time for another cut. They are small and sharp. I didn&#x27;t need the finger hole fillers but it&#x27;s good that it&#x27;s offered.</li>
            <li> Bought these to trim my dog&#x27;s feet so they would look neat and not like she was wearing &#x27;slippers&#x27;!  These did the job perfectly, without pulling the hair instead of cutting.  These make an affordable addition to a groomer&#x27;s tool box.</li>
            <li> work exactly as needed.  Cutting thin hair is awesome with this tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other have notes, the finger holes are pretty small, so if you have large fingers, keep shopping.</li>
            <li> Use it to trim my fringes/bangs!  Works great!</li>
            <li> Used it to thin out hair on top of my head because my hair is really thick.  I have long hair (past my shoulders). It worked great.  Did not pull hair.</li>
            <li> These are so cool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for bangs because you can cut your own and feel like you won&#x27;t mess up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yay! Thx scissors!</li>
            <li> The edge holds a good sharp edge! I would recommend these scissors to anyone. They were great for neatly cutting my bangs on my hair. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Really sharp and work great</li>
            <li> I found these to be a great deal.  They work very well.</li>
            <li> I wanted to save some money by cutting my husband&#x27;s hair, and these clippers work like magic! They are sharp, very easy to use and high quality. I have skinny fingers so I was worried I would have a tough time using these, but they come with rubber inserts so I could cut without slipping out of the holes. My husbands hair looks great and I plan to use these from here on out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied!</li>
