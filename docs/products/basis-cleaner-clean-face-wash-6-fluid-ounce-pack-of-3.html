            <li>A great gentle face cleanser and for a great price.</li>

            <li>It leaves my face feeling kind of stripped.</li>
            <li>Cleaned all my makeup off, love the smell and price is good.  </li>
            <li>Have used for many years, love this!</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, for me, this doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s going to be a good fit.</li>
            <li>Wonderful scent for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Just love the clean, very lightly floral, scent of this mild, wonderful face soap.</li>
            <li>Love this face wash; it has a light citrus fragrance and cleans very well at a very good price.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to buy this at Walmart, but they&#x27;ve discontinued carrying it</li>
            <li>I have found nothing better.</li>
            <li>Thank you for such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li>(it is on my hands mostly)</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure how I would like it.  </li>
            <li>Bought it because it is recommended by dermatologists and am glad I did.</li>
            <li>Best facial wash ever.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Love the Basis face wash.  </li>
            <li>This is an awesome basic face cleanser.</li>
            <li>I love how it smells, lathers, rinses, and how my face feels afterwards.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that Amazon carries it and at an even better price than before since I&#x27;m using Subscribe and Save.</li>
            <li>Make sure you do not get this stuff in your eyes.</li>
            <li>This is an ok product.</li>
            <li>most days.&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li>sure to wash/rinse skin immediately after any exercise.&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li>My favorite face wash</li>
            <li>This, has been lovely.</li>
            <li>I also love how it foams up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too overwhelming that it&#x27;ll disturb your smell.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Better than Ceptaphil.</li>
            <li>This is much more &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; than I like.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for many years</li>
            <li>We love this face wash.</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance as well.</li>
            <li>I bought in the grocery store for almost $2 more per bottle than what this 3 pack cost.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to buy this from CVS, but they no longer carry it.</li>
            <li>This is what I most prefer for washing face.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s simply the best one I&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now confidently make-up free most days :)&lt;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably one of the best cleansers I&#x27;ve used in a long time.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I love that this is paraben free and leaves a clean feeling for my face.</li>
            <li>Gel consistency, lovely scent and mild.  </li>
            <li>A month ago when i got it, i had mild acne, now i have none!</li>
            <li>The scent is very pleasing and it sure does the work!</li>
            <li>The scent is very-very light.  </li>
            <li>Both the husband and I enjoy using this--face truly feels clean after use and</li>
            <li>Have used this product for many years and it takes all makeup off very gently and thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Makes skin feel so refreshing and really takes off makeup!</li>
            <li>Totally worth it!</li>
            <li>I love this facewash, it is mild enough to not dry out or irritate skin but does the job wonderfully of cleaning your face!</li>
            <li>Your face feels so clean and fresh after using it!</li>
            <li>Washes away makeup easily and leaves my face feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>but none of them make me feel as clean as this one.</li>
            <li>If you want to get clean this is the stuff to get.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive, and this product caters to that amazingly.</li>
            <li>My skin feels ahhhh-mazing right now!</li>
            <li>This is an awesome product and now hard to find</li>
            <li>Yup, good face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was one of those people that thought I was &amp;#34;battling acne&amp;#34; since my teen years.</li>
            <li>have used it for at least 10 years and still very happy but cannot find it at CVS, walgreens, and the like anymore....  </li>
            <li>It is reasonably priced and it is Oil free so it leaves my face feeling very clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Firstly, this cleans quite well without leaving your skin dry which makes it good for any kind of skin type, especially sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>If all you&#x27;re looking for is a gentle and basic face wash, this is a great buy considering the price.</li>
            <li>Lucky for me</li>
            <li>It is fragrance free and very gentle on tender eyelids.  </li>
            <li>Love it for my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Scent is fine, packaging fine, no other concerns!</li>
            <li>Well worth the four dollars i paid for it.</li>
            <li>Safe, clean, mildly scented face wash works very well for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Buying 3 packs is economical.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Currently trying to decide if it&#x27;s worth pushing through, sometimes these things just take time to adjust, but I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks now</li>
            <li>The only face wash that I have found to be relatively effective on my oily face.</li>
            <li>Be sure to get the Basis sensitive skin bar soap to complement this cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>, makes my skin look FABULOUS and makes it feel super clean and refreshed (more than any other washed I&#x27;ve ever tried).</li>
            <li>It really works and leaves your face clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard only good things about this face wash, and since I was looking for a new one I figured I should give this one a try.</li>
            <li>It removes even waterproof makeup very well and it has a cool feeling leaving you refreshed.</li>
            <li>Basis Cleaner Clean is the only face wash that actually leaves my face feeling squeaky clean (and I&#x27;ve tried almost every kind out there).  </li>
            <li>This removes my make up very quickly and completely.</li>
            <li>, I have sensitive skin--when I started treating it like sensitive skin, this amazing thing happened: it stopped rebelling against me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, great basic cleanser.</li>
            <li>Good for removing makeup and just enough of the natural skin oil to get rid of grime, dust.  </li>
            <li>A very gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li>I only wished it came in a more convenient pump dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend first aid beauty face wash instead.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite  facial wash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this facial cleanser for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>so I purchased some... and for the first time ever I am breaking out all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a crisp, fresh smell that really invigorates you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a facial cleanser remove dirt and makeup more thoroughly.</li>
            <li>The whole family uses it!</li>
            <li>Good for an everyday face wash.</li>
            <li>Skin is clean and soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comparable as its just as gentle and good for sensitive skin, but foams and removes makeup really well, leaves a tight, clean feeling.</li>
            <li>The only face wash I can use in any season, will not over dry during the winter, and gives a nice clean feeling after a sweaty summer day.  </li>
            <li>Another great thing I like about this is the very subtle fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li>Most face washes really dry out my skin</li>
            <li>This cleanser took off my make-up and really gave me balanced results--</li>
            <li>and this is getting really</li>
            <li>It does really get all the makeup and mascara - even waterproof.  </li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a whole bunch of cleansers like neutrogena, aveeno, cerave, etc</li>
            <li>; if it doesn&#x27;t even remove makeup then I just don&#x27;t feel that it cleans very well either.</li>
            <li>Does not tighten skin TOO much.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very minimal and the consistency is very smooth.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make you feel really clean or anything, just a very basic and gentle face wash.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cleanser.</li>
            <li>This was highly recommended</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s never dried my face out, never made me break out; just left me feeling amazingly clean.  </li>
            <li>This cleanser is said to be for normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li>(yep, that&#x27;s more than half my life!)</li>
            <li>This is now a part of my new face care regime.</li>
            <li>I think this just might be my new fav face cleanser.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I tried other formulas that are made for sensitive skin (Cetaphil) and found those to be too gentle that it didn&#x27;t give me the clean feeling I wanted.</li>
            <li>But if you have sensitive skin that is not SUPER sensitive, I&#x27;m sure you can use this.</li>
            <li>52 and different cleansers have triggered my rosacea more quickly as I&#x27;ve aged.  </li>
            <li>At the same time, it is very gentle.</li>
            <li>I have naturally pretty non problematic skin, but I ran out of the giant costco sized facewash I had been using for a while.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t bother it at all!</li>
            <li>As this is only a basic cleanser, it won&#x27;t help you treat any of those, but it does help just keep your face clean from the day&#x27;s grime and sweat.</li>
            <li>I use it with a natural scrub sponge and it does wonders for me as I have a very sensitive skins...</li>
            <li>I also use this daily and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry like most facial cleansers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried tons of expensive  products so to read the great reviews about this and to see it actually works well</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t remove makeup too well or clear up problem skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear</li>
            <li>My skin also isnt as oily, after use of the product my face feels soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>hope this helps someone that is struggling with their &amp;#34;acne prone&amp;#34; sensitive skin while reading reviews...</li>
            <li>It also dissolves make-up, but won&#x27;t completely get rid of all traces of it.</li>
            <li>I am 54 years old and it still works well for my skin.</li>
            <li>so finding a good face wasg that will remove make up has been difficult.  </li>
            <li>This is the only face wash I can use with my super dry skin that cleans and hydrates.</li>
            <li>This is the only stuff that completely removes all my makeup, even eye makeup.</li>
            <li>So far I do not find that it dries my skin, I do usually put on lotion right after which probably helps.  </li>
            <li>Not dry out your skin</li>
            <li>It did not dry my face out.  </li>
            <li>I have tried some very expensive cleansers that weren&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry you out and doesn&#x27;t irritate my somewhat sensitive skin at all.</li>

            <li> Better than Ceptaphil.</li>
            <li> This is much more &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; than I like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for many years</li>
            <li> We love this face wash.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance as well.</li>
            <li> I bought in the grocery store for almost $2 more per bottle than what this 3 pack cost.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to buy this from CVS, but they no longer carry it.</li>
            <li> This is what I most prefer for washing face.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s simply the best one I&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now confidently make-up free most days :)&lt;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably one of the best cleansers I&#x27;ve used in a long time.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love that this is paraben free and leaves a clean feeling for my face.</li>
            <li> Gel consistency, lovely scent and mild.  </li>
            <li> A month ago when i got it, i had mild acne, now i have none!</li>
            <li> The scent is very pleasing and it sure does the work!</li>
            <li> The scent is very-very light.  </li>
            <li> Both the husband and I enjoy using this--face truly feels clean after use and</li>
            <li> Have used this product for many years and it takes all makeup off very gently and thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Makes skin feel so refreshing and really takes off makeup!</li>
            <li> Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I love this facewash, it is mild enough to not dry out or irritate skin but does the job wonderfully of cleaning your face!</li>
            <li> Your face feels so clean and fresh after using it!</li>
            <li> Washes away makeup easily and leaves my face feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> but none of them make me feel as clean as this one.</li>
            <li> If you want to get clean this is the stuff to get.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive, and this product caters to that amazingly.</li>
            <li> My skin feels ahhhh-mazing right now!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product and now hard to find</li>
            <li> Yup, good face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was one of those people that thought I was &amp;#34;battling acne&amp;#34; since my teen years.</li>
            <li> have used it for at least 10 years and still very happy but cannot find it at CVS, walgreens, and the like anymore....  </li>
            <li> It is reasonably priced and it is Oil free so it leaves my face feeling very clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Firstly, this cleans quite well without leaving your skin dry which makes it good for any kind of skin type, especially sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> If all you&#x27;re looking for is a gentle and basic face wash, this is a great buy considering the price.</li>
            <li> Lucky for me</li>
            <li> It is fragrance free and very gentle on tender eyelids.  </li>
            <li> Love it for my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Scent is fine, packaging fine, no other concerns!</li>
            <li> Well worth the four dollars i paid for it.</li>
            <li> Safe, clean, mildly scented face wash works very well for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Buying 3 packs is economical.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Currently trying to decide if it&#x27;s worth pushing through, sometimes these things just take time to adjust, but I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks now</li>
            <li> The only face wash that I have found to be relatively effective on my oily face.</li>
            <li> Be sure to get the Basis sensitive skin bar soap to complement this cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> , makes my skin look FABULOUS and makes it feel super clean and refreshed (more than any other washed I&#x27;ve ever tried).</li>
            <li> It really works and leaves your face clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard only good things about this face wash, and since I was looking for a new one I figured I should give this one a try.</li>
            <li> It removes even waterproof makeup very well and it has a cool feeling leaving you refreshed.</li>
            <li> Basis Cleaner Clean is the only face wash that actually leaves my face feeling squeaky clean (and I&#x27;ve tried almost every kind out there).  </li>
            <li> This removes my make up very quickly and completely.</li>
            <li> , I have sensitive skin--when I started treating it like sensitive skin, this amazing thing happened: it stopped rebelling against me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, great basic cleanser.</li>
            <li> Good for removing makeup and just enough of the natural skin oil to get rid of grime, dust.  </li>
            <li> A very gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li> I only wished it came in a more convenient pump dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend first aid beauty face wash instead.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite  facial wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this facial cleanser for years and love it.  </li>
            <li> so I purchased some... and for the first time ever I am breaking out all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a crisp, fresh smell that really invigorates you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a facial cleanser remove dirt and makeup more thoroughly.</li>
            <li> The whole family uses it!</li>
            <li> Good for an everyday face wash.</li>
            <li> Skin is clean and soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comparable as its just as gentle and good for sensitive skin, but foams and removes makeup really well, leaves a tight, clean feeling.</li>
            <li> The only face wash I can use in any season, will not over dry during the winter, and gives a nice clean feeling after a sweaty summer day.  </li>
            <li> Another great thing I like about this is the very subtle fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li> Most face washes really dry out my skin</li>
            <li> This cleanser took off my make-up and really gave me balanced results--</li>
            <li> and this is getting really</li>
            <li> It does really get all the makeup and mascara - even waterproof.  </li>
            <li> Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a whole bunch of cleansers like neutrogena, aveeno, cerave, etc</li>
            <li> ; if it doesn&#x27;t even remove makeup then I just don&#x27;t feel that it cleans very well either.</li>
            <li> Does not tighten skin TOO much.  </li>
            <li> The scent is very minimal and the consistency is very smooth.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make you feel really clean or anything, just a very basic and gentle face wash.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cleanser.</li>
            <li> This was highly recommended</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s never dried my face out, never made me break out; just left me feeling amazingly clean.  </li>
            <li> This cleanser is said to be for normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li> (yep, that&#x27;s more than half my life!)</li>
            <li> This is now a part of my new face care regime.</li>
            <li> I think this just might be my new fav face cleanser.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I tried other formulas that are made for sensitive skin (Cetaphil) and found those to be too gentle that it didn&#x27;t give me the clean feeling I wanted.</li>
            <li> But if you have sensitive skin that is not SUPER sensitive, I&#x27;m sure you can use this.</li>
            <li> 52 and different cleansers have triggered my rosacea more quickly as I&#x27;ve aged.  </li>
            <li> At the same time, it is very gentle.</li>
            <li> I have naturally pretty non problematic skin, but I ran out of the giant costco sized facewash I had been using for a while.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t bother it at all!</li>
            <li> As this is only a basic cleanser, it won&#x27;t help you treat any of those, but it does help just keep your face clean from the day&#x27;s grime and sweat.</li>
            <li> I use it with a natural scrub sponge and it does wonders for me as I have a very sensitive skins...</li>
            <li> I also use this daily and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry like most facial cleansers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried tons of expensive  products so to read the great reviews about this and to see it actually works well</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t remove makeup too well or clear up problem skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear</li>
            <li> My skin also isnt as oily, after use of the product my face feels soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> hope this helps someone that is struggling with their &amp;#34;acne prone&amp;#34; sensitive skin while reading reviews...</li>
            <li> It also dissolves make-up, but won&#x27;t completely get rid of all traces of it.</li>
            <li> I am 54 years old and it still works well for my skin.</li>
            <li> so finding a good face wasg that will remove make up has been difficult.  </li>
            <li> This is the only face wash I can use with my super dry skin that cleans and hydrates.</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff that completely removes all my makeup, even eye makeup.</li>
            <li> So far I do not find that it dries my skin, I do usually put on lotion right after which probably helps.  </li>
            <li> Not dry out your skin</li>
            <li> It did not dry my face out.  </li>
            <li> I have tried some very expensive cleansers that weren&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry you out and doesn&#x27;t irritate my somewhat sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li> Additionally, I have some other skin concerns such as black heads and large pores.</li>
            <li> it lathers, and when I use it my face does feel clean, but after about a week of using this face wash and changing nothing else, my face started breaking out pretty bad.</li>
            <li> The only problem I&#x27;ve ever encountered w/product is that the top of cap can become distended and break off, so that it is quite difficult to store between uses; it slimed out all over the place and was a big mess and a wate.  </li>
            <li> This is probably due to the fact that the face wash does not remove all of my makeup no matter how much I lather it up, and so I have to also wipe my face with my toner a few times to remove it</li>
            <li> long hair up or with a headband</li>
            <li> dry parts were cleaned without over drying and oily parts were cleaned and unwanted oils were removed.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s more painful than when I get shampoo/soap suds in my eyes.</li>
            <li> With eczema I have to be careful about the soap I use</li>
            <li> A little dab goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Have a hard time finding it locally, and even when I can, Amazon can beat the price (although I have to buy three!).</li>
            <li> So now I keep it upside down on cap</li>
            <li> Been using for a few years now.</li>
            <li> I have used this face cleaner for years; it cleans without being harsh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for a few years now</li>
            <li> I have slightly oily skin that doesn&#x27;t break out much, so this was an unpleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> Use this product everyday, leaves me feeling refreshed!</li>
            <li> but in a small plastic ashtray.</li>
            <li> The consistency isn&#x27;t too runny, nor is it too thick.</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t be for you</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this stuff!</li>
            <li> and I hate using them.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Both the husband and I enjoy using this--face truly feels clean after use and the scent refreshing!  I used to be able to buy this at Walmart, but they&#x27;ve discontinued carrying it --so glad I can still get it online!</li>
            <li> recommended by my facialist when i asked for drug store recommendations.  no greasy after feel with this.  have recommended it to others and they like it as well.</li>
            <li> This is the best product!  Your face feels so clean and fresh after using it!</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff that completely removes all my makeup, even eye makeup. The smell is great, too.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. I love it! I wish they would stop pulling it off store shelves and then reintroducing years later. I have found nothing better. Believe me, I have tried. Thank you for such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> With eczema I have to be careful about the soap I use (it is on my hands mostly) so finding a good face wasg that will remove make up has been difficult.  Some mixed reviews about this drying skin so I wasn&#x27;t sure how I would like it.  So far I do not find that it dries my skin, I do usually put on lotion right after which probably helps.  This removes my make up very quickly and completely.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for many years and it takes all makeup off very gently and thoroughly.</li>
            <li> LOVE this face wash!!  Bought it because it is recommended by dermatologists and am glad I did.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cleanser for 16 years (yep, that&#x27;s more than half my life!) and have yet to find anything that even comes close to the awesomeness that is in this tube. It smells great and leaves my skin feeling like perfection. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this stuff!</li>
            <li> Basis face Wash smell wonderful &amp; fresh . Not dry out your skin # 1 recommend for drugstore face wash.</li>
            <li> I order this because it is not sold locally anymore &amp; I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Best facial wash ever. I&#x27;ve tried tons of expensive  products so to read the great reviews about this and to see it actually works well is Amazing. This is now a part of my new face care regime.</li>
            <li> This is best face cleaner I have ever bought.  I totally removes all makeup and mascara without harshness and dryness.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Gel consistency, lovely scent and mild.  Love it.  Takes off all my make up!</li>
            <li> Makes skin feel so refreshing and really takes off makeup!</li>
            <li> Love the Basis face wash.  Have a hard time finding it locally, and even when I can, Amazon can beat the price (although I have to buy three!). Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome basic face cleanser. I love how it smells, lathers, rinses, and how my face feels afterwards. Skin is clean and soft. This cleanser is said to be for normal to oily skin. But if you have sensitive skin that is not SUPER sensitive, I&#x27;m sure you can use this. That&#x27;s the kind of skin I have. I tried other formulas that are made for sensitive skin (Cetaphil) and found those to be too gentle that it didn&#x27;t give me the clean feeling I wanted. This cleanser took off my make-up and really gave me balanced results--dry parts were cleaned without over drying and oily parts were cleaned and unwanted oils were removed. I stopped using this cleanser for a while only because I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anymore. I&#x27;m so glad that Amazon carries it and at an even better price than before since I&#x27;m using Subscribe and Save. I highly recommend this cleanser. I only wished it came in a more convenient pump dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last note: Make sure you do not get this stuff in your eyes. I feel like when it gets in my eyes, it&#x27;s more painful than when I get shampoo/soap suds in my eyes. It might be effects of the minty botanicals... but just heed my caution.</li>
            <li> I think this just might be my new fav face cleanser. My skin feels ahhhh-mazing right now!</li>
            <li> A great gentle face cleanser and for a great price. Doesn&#x27;t strip your skin or cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> Great for your face no breakouts no drying</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive, and this product caters to that amazingly. A month ago when i got it, i had mild acne, now i have none! My skin also isnt as oily, after use of the product my face feels soft and refreshed. The product doesnt burn or cause irritation either. Well worth the four dollars i paid for it. Extreamly reccomend the product.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing (citrus... yummm), makes my skin look FABULOUS and makes it feel super clean and refreshed (more than any other washed I&#x27;ve ever tried). I am always getting compliments on my skin. LOVE this stuff, and it is a great price here! (about $4 per bottle)</li>
            <li> Always a reliable and trusted product.</li>
            <li> This thing has become my daily face wash and I can&#x27;t live without it. The smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is an ok product. Great value and I love the soapless concept, but I didn&#x27;t get any overwhelmingly great results. It doesn&#x27;t make you feel really clean or anything, just a very basic and gentle face wash. It doesn&#x27;t remove makeup too well or clear up problem skin. If all you&#x27;re looking for is a gentle and basic face wash, this is a great buy considering the price. I&#x27;d recommend first aid beauty face wash instead. It&#x27;s comparable as its just as gentle and good for sensitive skin, but foams and removes makeup really well, leaves a tight, clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Great product. The scent is very pleasing and it sure does the work!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite  facial wash. It really works and leaves your face clean. this is my second order and would buy again.</li>
            <li> Use this product everyday, leaves me feeling refreshed!</li>
            <li> Just love the clean, very lightly floral, scent of this mild, wonderful face soap.</li>
            <li> Good cleanser for makeup wearers</li>
            <li> Yup, good face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was one of those people that thought I was &amp;#34;battling acne&amp;#34; since my teen years. As it turns out, I don&#x27;t have acne, I have sensitive skin--when I started treating it like sensitive skin, this amazing thing happened: it stopped rebelling against me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Current regimen:&lt;br /&gt;Wear long hair up or with a headband most days.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to wash/rinse skin immediately after any exercise.&lt;br /&gt;Use exfoliating sponge daily.&lt;br /&gt;Wash with Basis in the AM&lt;br /&gt;Use Witch Hazel as a toner (Thayer&#x27;s)&lt;br /&gt;Use Fruit of the Earth Aloe as a moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it! I&#x27;m now confidently make-up free most days :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps someone that is struggling with their &amp;#34;acne prone&amp;#34; sensitive skin while reading reviews...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this facial cleanser for years and love it.  It&#x27;s mild, yet does a good job, at a great price.</li>
            <li> The only face wash I can use in any season, will not over dry during the winter, and gives a nice clean feeling after a sweaty summer day.  Basis products are just amazing</li>
            <li> This cleanser is great for sensitive skin. Washes off all eye makeup-no trace of makeup left on the skin. A very gentle cleanser. This is the only cleanser that I use.</li>
            <li> Safe, clean, mildly scented face wash works very well for my sensitive skin.  Buying 3 packs is economical.</li>
            <li> Washes away makeup easily and leaves my face feeling fresh. My favorite face wash</li>
            <li> Best product around for gently removing mascara. It is fragrance free and very gentle on tender eyelids.  I&#x27;ve used it for years!</li>
            <li> I have naturally pretty non problematic skin, but I ran out of the giant costco sized facewash I had been using for a while. This was highly recommended so I purchased some... and for the first time ever I am breaking out all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently trying to decide if it&#x27;s worth pushing through, sometimes these things just take time to adjust, but I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks now and this is getting really old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for me, this doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s going to be a good fit. That doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t be for you though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent is fine, packaging fine, no other concerns!</li>
            <li> Love this face wash; it has a light citrus fragrance and cleans very well at a very good price.</li>
            <li> It comes three in a package. I have one that stays in my shower and one that stays at my sink all the time.  It does really get all the makeup and mascara - even waterproof.  The scent is very-very light.  It&#x27;s clear so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m slathering stuff on my face that I have to constantly rinse off. It&#x27;s probably one of the best cleansers I&#x27;ve used in a long time. I&#x27;m 52 and different cleansers have triggered my rosacea more quickly as I&#x27;ve aged.  This, has been lovely. Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Been using for a few years now. No frills, gets the job done stuff.</li>
            <li> I like using this face wash. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 years now and I buy them in packs of three here at Amazon. It is reasonably priced and it is Oil free so it leaves my face feeling very clean and fresh. It definitely beats buying overpriced department store brands they push on you when you are buying mascara!</li>
            <li> Recently it seems like Basis products just disappeared from the shelves of stores that always stocked them.  I&#x27;m glad I thought to look on Amazon!  Not only is it the only place I can find Basis, but I can get three bottles for about the same price of ONE bottle in the store!  Basis Cleaner Clean is the only face wash that actually leaves my face feeling squeaky clean (and I&#x27;ve tried almost every kind out there).  It&#x27;s never dried my face out, never made me break out; just left me feeling amazingly clean.  Oh, and the scent...the scent is one of the best parts.  It&#x27;s got a crisp, fresh smell that really invigorates you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a facial cleanser remove dirt and makeup more thoroughly. At the same time, it is very gentle.</li>
            <li> Great product, good price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best for cleaning your face.</li>
            <li> The only face wash that I have found to be relatively effective on my oily face.</li>
            <li> I like this cleanser for a couple of reasons. Firstly, this cleans quite well without leaving your skin dry which makes it good for any kind of skin type, especially sensitive skin. It also dissolves make-up, but won&#x27;t completely get rid of all traces of it. I also love how it foams up. The cleanser is transparent when it comes out of the container, but it foams up and turns white when you start using it on your face and with water. The consistency isn&#x27;t too runny, nor is it too thick. If I could compare it to something, I&#x27;d go with castor oil&#x27;s consistency. Another great thing I like about this is the very subtle fresh fragrance. It&#x27;s not too overwhelming that it&#x27;ll disturb your smell. Overall, great basic cleanser. I have combination skin, so I do tend to have some breakouts around the forehead and chin area. Additionally, I have some other skin concerns such as black heads and large pores. As this is only a basic cleanser, it won&#x27;t help you treat any of those, but it does help just keep your face clean from the day&#x27;s grime and sweat.</li>
            <li> I have used this face cleaner for years; it cleans without being harsh.</li>
            <li> Have used for many years, love this!</li>
            <li> I have used this for years. Love it. Amazon is about the only place I can find it now.</li>
            <li> I like the face wash. It is a good value and the smell and ingredients are good. I would have like for it to have exfoliating beads in the mixture but it fomes and cleans well it seems. Good for an everyday face wash.</li>
            <li> Love it for my super sensitive skin. Better than Ceptaphil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a whole bunch of cleansers like neutrogena, aveeno, cerave, etc but none of them make me feel as clean as this one. It removes even waterproof makeup very well and it has a cool feeling leaving you refreshed. It doesn&#x27;t dry you out and doesn&#x27;t irritate my somewhat sensitive skin at all. I&#x27;d recommend it. My fiance loves it too.</li>
            <li> Love the smell! Cleanses without being too drying</li>
            <li> If you want to get clean this is the stuff to get. Wonderful scent for sensitive skin. Be sure to get the Basis sensitive skin bar soap to complement this cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;With they made a perfume of this scent it would sell sell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard only good things about this face wash, and since I was looking for a new one I figured I should give this one a try. I like that it lathers, and when I use it my face does feel clean, but after about a week of using this face wash and changing nothing else, my face started breaking out pretty bad. This is probably due to the fact that the face wash does not remove all of my makeup no matter how much I lather it up, and so I have to also wipe my face with my toner a few times to remove it; if it doesn&#x27;t even remove makeup then I just don&#x27;t feel that it cleans very well either. I have slightly oily skin that doesn&#x27;t break out much, so this was an unpleasant surprise. However, I seem to be in the minority here with my experience so it must just be that my skin doesn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> This cleanser works great. Clears up my daughters face in about 3 days.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser; good price.</li>
            <li> This is much more &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; than I like. It leaves my face feeling kind of stripped.</li>
            <li> Great. I&#x27;ve been using it for many years</li>
            <li> Great soap free face wash!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. The whole family uses it!</li>
            <li> We love this face wash. This is the only face wash I can use with my super dry skin that cleans and hydrates. Most face washes really dry out my skin and I hate using them. I have been using this face wash for 3 years and will never use another brand.</li>
            <li> Kid says it works great- I agree.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 10 years or so. I am 54 years old and it still works well for my skin. I love the fragrance as well.</li>
            <li> I have 3 teenage daughters so obviously acne can be an issue. This is definitely helping. I also use this daily and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry like most facial cleansers. A little dab goes a long way. I will continue to purchase this as the price is great too!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product and now hard to find</li>
            <li> have used it for at least 10 years and still very happy but cannot find it at CVS, walgreens, and the like anymore....  I use it with a natural scrub sponge and it does wonders for me as I have a very sensitive skins...</li>
            <li> I love this facewash, it is mild enough to not dry out or irritate skin but does the job wonderfully of cleaning your face! The scent is very minimal and the consistency is very smooth. I bought in the grocery store for almost $2 more per bottle than what this 3 pack cost. Will definitely be ordering again!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this face wash for years, I love it and the price was very fair.  I am very pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Best gentle/effective face wash out there. I used to be able to buy this from CVS, but they no longer carry it. Lucky for me Amazon has almost EVERYTHING!</li>
            <li> I love that this is paraben free and leaves a clean feeling for my face.</li>
            <li> Item as described and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> What a deal.  This good product already inexpensive, but here Amazon gets me three of them at a great price.  This is what I most prefer for washing face.  Does not tighten skin TOO much.  Good for removing makeup and just enough of the natural skin oil to get rid of grime, dust.  AND it washes off so well!  The only problem I&#x27;ve ever encountered w/product is that the top of cap can become distended and break off, so that it is quite difficult to store between uses; it slimed out all over the place and was a big mess and a wate.  So now I keep it upside down on cap but in a small plastic ashtray.</li>
            <li> Cleaned all my makeup off, love the smell and price is good.  It did not dry my face out.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for a few years now and it&#x27;s simply the best one I&#x27;ve found! I have tried some very expensive cleansers that weren&#x27;t as good. This cleans thoroughly without drying. It takes off just about all my makeup as well. I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t bother it at all!</li>
