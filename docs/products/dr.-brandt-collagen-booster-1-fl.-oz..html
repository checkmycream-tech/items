            <li>That being said, I&#x27;ll give this my best shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not the best at sticking with beauty products.</li>
            <li>Go out and get samples from Sephora and department stores until you find the perfect combination of products.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s Incredible for Unisex, Whipped, 1</li>
            <li>I use it with my ultrasonic face machine, which works great together.</li>
            <li>So dont be discouraged everyone, there are good products out there.</li>
            <li>After using this product for a month I can see a difference in myself when I look in the mirror; a good difference.</li>
            <li>Except that is, for a brightening of my complexion which I do like.&lt;br /&gt;One surprising effect I noticed was on my hands.</li>
            <li>Truly amazing.</li>
            <li>The lines by my eyes, mouth and on my forehead are diminishing at an amazing rate.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a nice quality</li>

            <li>I liked this product:&lt;br /</li>
            <li>* A light, pleasant fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I will say that my skin has a nice \\&quot;glow\\&quot; to it and my skin tone appears to be more even.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll get better results if you go with the manufacturer recommendation of twice a day.</li>
            <li>This product has a nice smell and feel and it does seem to work, but not to a huge level of difference.  </li>
            <li>A more streamlined packaging, in my view, would be more in line with the \\&quot;doctor line\\&quot; product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it in more of a preventative fashion, but, I did happen to notice my skin tightening up a bit.</li>
            <li>but it gets even better with time.</li>
            <li>The following is the perfect mix that I found helps my skin more than anything else:</li>
            <li>but you will save A LOT of money, look better than you ever have and feel</li>
            <li>Not finding a full line that met my needs, I mixed the best products from many lines.</li>
            <li>The pump dispenser makes it quite easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it is definitely strong.  </li>
            <li>It plumps the fine wrinkles around my eyes up and makes my complexion look smoother.</li>
            <li>I do like the way it makes my face feel smooth, and it gives me a glow</li>
            <li>Thank you for having it available</li>
            <li>It has a very strong odor when you first apply it, but that quickly fades.  </li>
            <li>I have a fondness for face products and am constantly trying new ones in hopes of finding that perfect one (that is not too pricey).  </li>
            <li>If any of this is sounding familiar, stick with me a bit longer.</li>
            <li>My wife--a more seasoned cosmetic critic--</li>
            <li>This is a nice, lightweight serum that leaves your skin feeling silky soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Skincare products also seem to contain special ingredients like these that promise to address your skin issues.  </li>

            <li>It is amazing, and as far as collagen boosters go</li>
            <li>This bottle is listed as containing a month&#x27;s supply of product, and I do have a fair amount left.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a true collagen booster try what I did Radiantly Ageless Peptide Fusion Collagen Booster or The Triple Serum De Luxe by radiantlyageless.com  </li>
            <li>I actually see good results on my skin.</li>
            <li>I did however find something that has similar ingredeients, but might be more potent or something.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and I don&#x27;t detect any sticky residue.  </li>
            <li>this a known benefit of this product, or just a lucky unintended consequence?</li>
            <li>I got visible results from the very first application</li>
            <li>Love this new product.  </li>
            <li>When smoothed on carefully and sparingly, the immediate sensation of this product is pleasant, and I didn&#x27;t encounter any longer-term sensations of tackiness, unlike the offputting scent and lingering stickiness of some hand creams billed as \\&quot;repairing\\&quot; or super-moisturizing.</li>

            <li>/&gt;It is light and has little if any scent which is a good thing in my opinion.</li>
            <li>process, along with some corner-of-the-eye \\&quot;smile lines\\&quot; that I&#x27;d rather not see in the mirror, have prompted me to amp up my slapdash skin care arsenal from moisturizer and sunscreen to a face-quality elixir containing collagen.</li>
            <li>More to the point, the serum it contains has been developed to maintain the collagen you&#x27;ve got, and add to</li>
            <li>Collagen Booster comes in a pump bottle, which should keep the product fresh over time.  </li>
            <li>This is easily absorbed and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or sticky.</li>
            <li>When it first arrived I was concerned about the strong smell, but the smell disappears completely very soon after application.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fussy about not using heavy creams on my face and this works great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so sure I will continue to use this as there are conflicting reports on whether lavender oil in skincare could actually be a detriment to collagen production.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll report back and will update my review as I use this more.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed some positive results when using the collagen booster.</li>
            <li>I am 50, lived with severe breakouts, oily skin and large pores</li>
            <li>However, I plead to sufficient vanity that I didn&#x27;t want a midline to be readily visible.)</li>
            <li>I think with careful application you&#x27;d be able to eke five weeks of twice-daily use of the product from each container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, after using the whole bottle over about 5 weeks, twice a day, followed by moisturizer as suggested, I noticed absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>We are really talking about very minute changes, even if you feel that a product works for you.  </li>
            <li>It really depends on your beauty budget.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a plus sized girl, so my weight really shows in my face.</li>
            <li>Since I was 12 I tried almost everything on the market, tortured my skin, and wore too much makeup.</li>
            <li>It appears much firmer.</li>
            <li>I can sustain using something twice a day for only a short time, but in order to review this honestly i did apply it faithfully twice a day for  almost a month.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it certainly reduces the appearance of small wrinkles and is really nice for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin, and this does burn/tingle a bit when I first put it on.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for Brandt.</li>
            <li>rare in this industry to find something actually works.  </li>
            <li>When I don&#x27;t manage to get a good sleep and wake up with my skin looking tired and greyish, I apply this product and it gives me a healthier, rested look.</li>
            <li>It has an odd scent to it, but the scent dissipates pretty quickly once you apply</li>
            <li>if it&#x27;s worth the hefty price.&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks of use, I can say I like the way it is absorbed into my skin when I apply it.</li>
            <li>I know that this is a common cosmetic company ploy - it looks like you&#x27;re getting so much more than you really are - but how wasteful.</li>
            <li>I know that this is a common cosmetic company ploy - it looks like you&#x27;re getting so much more than you really are - but how wasteful.</li>
            <li>It is important to apply only a very tiny amount of the product because if you overuse it, it has a tendency to clump on the face.</li>
            <li>The treated areas feel a bit plumper and more resilient, springing back rapidly following fingertip pressure, similar to how you&#x27;d test a cake for doneness when baking.</li>
            <li>(more than likely due to one of the ingredients).</li>
            <li>Its just a habit Ive developed over the years.</li>
            <li>Philosophy Retinol pads (at night), Dr. Brandt collagen booster (day and night), Liftfusion eye syrum (day and night), Rexaline eye cream (at night), and I wash my face with Neutrogena natural face cleanser and use their astringent.</li>
            <li>Wow</li>
            <li>I use hand lotion frequently, but after about a week of using this collagen booster I noticed that the back of my left hand looked smoother and brighter somehow than my right hand.</li>
            <li>This is good, though, because a small bottle of the product can last a very long time.</li>
            <li>I squirt the product on the back of my left hand, and then pick it up with my right hand fingers to apply to my face.</li>
            <li>I started squirting the product to the back of my right hand and after a week noticed the same pleasing effect on that hand</li>
            <li>Most days, I&#x27;m a believer in such platitudes as \\&quot;you&#x27;re only as old as you</li>
            <li>Alistin - minimizes the breakdown of collagen fibers by protecting them from becoming stiff and brittle due to free radicals, sugar, MMPs, and other skin</li>
            <li>Alistin - minimizes the breakdown of collagen fibers by protecting them from becoming stiff and brittle due to free radicals, sugar, MMPs, and other skin</li>
            <li>My pores are diminishing in appearance, oil is no longer a problem, I use a little makeup and it stays fresh all day.</li>
            <li>Such a large container for such a tiny amount of product!  </li>
            <li>Such a large container for such a tiny amount of product!  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this product because I had tried quite a few brands of collagen-boosting serums, and none of them really worked.</li>
            <li>The smaller inner bottle which contains the product and to which the pump is attached is There is inserted into a clear outer bottle.  </li>
            <li>I generally follow up with a moisturizer, though occasionally I&#x27;ll use the serum alone.  </li>
            <li>old and thought I&#x27;d try something \\&quot;better\\&quot; and more expensive to see if there would be an improvement on wrinkles, dryness, and pore refinement than neutrogena or the cheaper facial lotions that you can find at the pharmacy.</li>
            <li>Me: Dry, menopausal sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect a &#x27;chemical face lift&#x27; or some revolutionary miracle, but this definitely works at least a little magic.</li>

            <li> This is good, though, because a small bottle of the product can last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I squirt the product on the back of my left hand, and then pick it up with my right hand fingers to apply to my face.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have a fondness for face products and am constantly trying new ones in hopes of finding that perfect one (that is not too pricey).  A well known facialist swears by it and I saw a difference immediately.  This was also working 16 hr days so not a good condition for skin.  Buying another one to stock up.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;d have to use this serum for a long time before I could say if it does what is promised. It&#x27;s hard to know yet if it&#x27;s worth the hefty price.&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks of use, I can say I like the way it is absorbed into my skin when I apply it. I also like the way it gives my face a slightly softer look after application. When it first arrived I was concerned about the strong smell, but the smell disappears completely very soon after application. The directions say to use this twice a day, but I&#x27;m not that regimented, so I usually end up only using it once a day. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll get better results if you go with the manufacturer recommendation of twice a day.</li>
            <li> Most days, I&#x27;m a believer in such platitudes as \\&quot;you&#x27;re only as old as you feel\\&quot; and \\&quot;you&#x27;re not old if you still have a sense of wonder.\\&quot; However, I still slather on sunscreen before heading into the sun, and I&#x27;ve pledged to start reading up on collagen, essential oils, and such, because what we put on our bodies should be as carefully considered as what we put in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This process, along with some corner-of-the-eye \\&quot;smile lines\\&quot; that I&#x27;d rather not see in the mirror, have prompted me to amp up my slapdash skin care arsenal from moisturizer and sunscreen to a face-quality elixir containing collagen. If any of this is sounding familiar, stick with me a bit longer. I mention all this because the folks at dr. brandt have done their homework regarding our demographic. This vial of collagen booster arrives in packaging that manages to be encouraging and not embarrassing. More to the point, the serum it contains has been developed to maintain the collagen you&#x27;ve got, and add to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After five weeks of use on my face and on half of the skin under my chin, I am noticing subtle differences. (Yes, you are reading that correctly, I wanted to have test and control areas so that my evaluation would be objective, not subjective. However, I plead to sufficient vanity that I didn&#x27;t want a midline to be readily visible.) The treated areas feel a bit plumper and more resilient, springing back rapidly following fingertip pressure, similar to how you&#x27;d test a cake for doneness when baking. This bottle is listed as containing a month&#x27;s supply of product, and I do have a fair amount left. Although I eased into use to check for any adverse reactions -- building from once every three days to alternate days to daily use -- I am using extra product on my neck. I think with careful application you&#x27;d be able to eke five weeks of twice-daily use of the product from each container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for reactions, nothing negative, and my skin can be sensitive, which is one of the reasons I use Cetaphil wash on my face and neck. When smoothed on carefully and sparingly, the immediate sensation of this product is pleasant, and I didn&#x27;t encounter any longer-term sensations of tackiness, unlike the offputting scent and lingering stickiness of some hand creams billed as \\&quot;repairing\\&quot; or super-moisturizing. I will update this review with longer-term observations, but at this point my experience has been positive and I plan to continue using this product.f the reasons I use Cetaphil wash on my face and neck.

            <li> I used Dr. Brandt for almost 2 months with no changes. I used it every day and as directed. I know everyones skin is different so I am not complaining. I did however find something that has similar ingredeients, but might be more potent or something. I found it on Amazon once but now I cant find it except on the company website. I started to see visible results in just 5 days. Truly amazing. So dont be discouraged everyone, there are good products out there. If you are looking for a true collagen booster try what I did Radiantly Ageless Peptide Fusion Collagen Booster or The Triple Serum De Luxe by radiantlyageless.com  i found it on ebay once for I want to say 30 dollars. It is amazing, and as far as collagen boosters go I had high hopes for Brandt.</li>
            <li> This product has a nice smell and feel and it does seem to work, but not to a huge level of difference.  I would continue to use it, but (1) it is very expensive for the level of results and (2) it has a lot of questionable ingredients such as parabens.</li>
            <li> After using the product I did not notice any results, but I guess some beauty products work for some people but not for others.  You will not know untill you try.  I thought that, given the price, it will be an expensive try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I thought the packaging was wasteful and gimmiky.  The smaller inner bottle which contains the product and to which the pump is attached is There is inserted into a clear outer bottle.  The outer bottle seems absolutely unnecessary.  In addition, the green-cardboard-and-clear-plastic tubular box the product came in seemed unnecessary, and did not project quality especially in the areas where the round top connected to the tublar sides of the box.  A more streamlined packaging, in my view, would be more in line with the \\&quot;doctor line\\&quot; product.  What I am getting at is that it appeared to me that the product manufacturer tried to justify the inflated price by spiffing up the packaging.</li>
            <li> I have been hearing about collagen &amp; the benefits of collagen boosters, so I tried this very expensive product at the suggestion of a Sephora staff (they usually steer me right)  However, after using the whole bottle over about 5 weeks, twice a day, followed by moisturizer as suggested, I noticed absolutely nothing. Not one iota of difference in my skin. There goes $75!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really tough to review anti-aging products.  For one thing, it&#x27;s hard to substantiate some of the manufacturer&#x27;s claims.  This product claims to \\&quot;boost and maintain collagen levels\\&quot;; I&#x27;ll have to take their word for it.  The other problem is the perception of results.  We are really talking about very minute changes, even if you feel that a product works for you.  That being said, I&#x27;ll give this my best shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a lightweight serum with an almost gel-like consistency.  It has a very strong odor when you first apply it, but that quickly fades.  I do not find the odor unpleasant; it&#x27;s kind of an herbal type smell rather than fragrance - but it is definitely strong.  The serum is used after cleansing but before moisturizing.  It absorbs quickly and I don&#x27;t detect any sticky residue.  It does not make my combination skin (slightly oily in the t-zone) feel greasy.  You are supposed to use it twice a day, but I only use it at night (I don&#x27;t feel like my make-up lasts as long if I apply it over the serum ).  It does not cause any irritation, but I did notice a brief (a minute or two) slight stinging sensation the first few times I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this nightly for 5 weeks.  I generally follow up with a moisturizer, though occasionally I&#x27;ll use the serum alone.  I have noticed that my skin feels softer and that I need to use less moisturizer when I&#x27;m using this product.  Results?  I will say that my skin has a nice \\&quot;glow\\&quot; to it and my skin tone appears to be more even.  A little goes a long way - I&#x27;m still using this (though not twice a day as recommended), so although you only get 1 oz. it does seem to last.  Would I recommend this?  It really depends on your beauty budget.  This is meant to be used before your moisturizer; it doesn&#x27;t replace your moisturizer.  You have to weigh the cost of adding yet another product to your regimen v/s the benefits of the serum.  However, if money is not a consideration then I say \\&quot;go for it\\&quot; - - it&#x27;s a nice quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word about the packaging...tsk, tsk.  Such a large container for such a tiny amount of product!  I know that this is a common cosmetic company ploy - it looks like you&#x27;re getting so much more than you really are - but how wasteful.&#x27;s a nice quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word about the packaging...tsk, tsk.  Such a large container for such a tiny amount of product!  I know that this is a common cosmetic company ploy - it looks like you&#x27;re getting so much more than you really are - but how wasteful.</li>
            <li> Me: Dry, menopausal sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 weeks so it&#x27;s too soon to tell if this actually boosts collagen production, but I do like the way it makes my face feel smooth, and it gives me a glow (more than likely due to one of the ingredients). So far this serum hasn&#x27;t caused any bad reactions, and doesn&#x27;t make me any drier than I normally would be. What I don&#x27;t care for is the lavender scent, but it dissipates within 5 minutes. I&#x27;m not so sure I will continue to use this as there are conflicting reports on whether lavender oil in skincare could actually be a detriment to collagen production.</li>
            <li> dr. brandt Collagen Booster is supposed to be a &#x27;blend of key amino acids&#x27; that help &#x27;minimize the breakdown of collagen, stimulate collagen production, and maximize collagen formation&#x27; to give you younger looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if Collagen Booster does all that, but it certainly reduces the appearance of small wrinkles and is really nice for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One fluid ounce goes a long way.  My wife--a more seasoned cosmetic critic--and I used this for about a month.  A smaller than pea-sized pump is enough to cover your entire face. We have both been using this and there is still a lot left in the bottle after almost 30 days. The liquid is slightly greenish in color and has an slight evergreen odor to it.  Once placed on the face it has almost no odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over a period of about five to seven days it definitely reduces the appearance of small wrinkles at the corner of your eyes.  It is not necessarily a moisturizer, but it definitely has prevented dryness.  My wife has been using it under her eyes and it smoothed out creased skin but did not decrease under eye, dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My guess is that it plumps up your skin a bit rather than acting as a skin tightener.  But once it is on, you&#x27;d hardly know it is there.  It isn&#x27;t a skin tightener type product that somehow pulls wrinkles out and later in the day wears off. It seems to stick with you throughout the day, no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At it&#x27;s present price, it is definitely an investment, but there are definitely higher-priced products on the market. That said, it would be better if you could somehow use a sample to see if it works for you before you spend the big bucks on a whole bottle.  But such is often life in the cosmetic industry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s rare in this industry to find something actually works.  Don&#x27;t expect a &#x27;chemical face lift&#x27; or some revolutionary miracle, but this definitely works at least a little magic. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed some positive results when using the collagen booster. I&#x27;m using it in more of a preventative fashion, but, I did happen to notice my skin tightening up a bit. I&#x27;m a plus sized girl, so my weight really shows in my face. After using this product for a month I can see a difference in myself when I look in the mirror; a good difference. I&#x27;ll definitely continue using the product. -1 star for the price. Ouch!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this product because I had tried quite a few brands of collagen-boosting serums, and none of them really worked. This product, however, does deliver on all of its promises, so I have started using it regularly. When I don&#x27;t manage to get a good sleep and wake up with my skin looking tired and greyish, I apply this product and it gives me a healthier, rested look. I got visible results from the very first application but it gets even better with time. It is important to apply only a very tiny amount of the product because if you overuse it, it has a tendency to clump on the face. This is good, though, because a small bottle of the product can last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Have been using for over 3 week and haven&#x27;t noticed anything. I bought all of the products for age and pore refining, from the cleanser, pores no more vacuum, refiner, mattifying lotion... But they were a rip off. I am 40 yrs. old and thought I&#x27;d try something \\&quot;better\\&quot; and more expensive to see if there would be an improvement on wrinkles, dryness, and pore refinement than neutrogena or the cheaper facial lotions that you can find at the pharmacy. Unfortunately, Dr. Brandt did nothing to clear pores, moisturize, or refine wrinkles. Just a rip off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the best at sticking with beauty products. I can sustain using something twice a day for only a short time, but in order to review this honestly i did apply it faithfully twice a day for  almost a month.&lt;br /&gt;It is light and has little if any scent which is a good thing in my opinion. Any changes seen on my face were subtle i.e not noticeable to me yet. Except that is, for a brightening of my complexion which I do like.&lt;br /&gt;One surprising effect I noticed was on my hands. I squirt the product on the back of my left hand, and then pick it up with my right hand fingers to apply to my face. No particular reason for this. Its just a habit Ive developed over the years. I rub off the excess under my chin which also moisturizes my neck. My hands are not in bad shape.  Not wrinkly. No age spots.I use hand lotion frequently, but after about a week of using this collagen booster I noticed that the back of my left hand looked smoother and brighter somehow than my right hand. I started squirting the product to the back of my right hand and after a week noticed the same pleasing effect on that hand also.&lt;br /&gt;Is this a known benefit of this product, or just a lucky unintended consequence? I don&#x27;t know but I&#x27;m going to continue to use it even after this bottle is used up.</li>
            <li> Below is a list of the products I began to use a couple weeks ago and already see a big difference in my skin. I am 50, lived with severe breakouts, oily skin and large pores and yes, I have scars. Since I was 12 I tried almost everything on the market, tortured my skin, and wore too much makeup. Not finding a full line that met my needs, I mixed the best products from many lines. The following is the perfect mix that I found helps my skin more than anything else: Philosophy Retinol pads (at night), Dr. Brandt collagen booster (day and night), Liftfusion eye syrum (day and night), Rexaline eye cream (at night), and I wash my face with Neutrogena natural face cleanser and use their astringent. My makeup starts with NARS pore refining face primer, TIGI whipped foundation and then powder. There is no shine or pore problems and my makeup lasts day. The lines by my eyes, mouth and on my forehead are diminishing at an amazing rate. My pores are diminishing in appearance, oil is no longer a problem, I use a little makeup and it stays fresh all day. Don&#x27;t be discouraged if one product line doesn&#x27;t do all you need. Go out and get samples from Sephora and department stores until you find the perfect combination of products. The initial investment is a little staggering but you will save A LOT of money, look better than you ever have and feel great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The items I found work best for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002WUJL9W Dr. Brandt Skincare dr brandt(R) collagen booster(TM)]][[ASIN:B00205PQS4 Fusion Beauty LiftFusion Micro-Injected M-Tox Face Lift, Unboxed]][[ASIN:B00279RD3Y FusionBeauty LiftFusion Eye Lift]][[ASIN:B0031NRC86 Philosophy Miracle Worker Retinoid Pads, 60 Count &amp; Solution 2 fl. oz.]][[ASIN:B003ARR8O6 Rexaline Hydra-Dose Hyper-Hydrating Skin Densifying Anti-Wrinkle Cream 1.69]][[ASIN:B000NWBHWU TIGI Wow It&#x27;s Incredible for Unisex, Whipped, 1 Ounce]][[ASIN:B004KXIF1Y NARS Pro-Prime(TM) Pore Refining Primer - Oil-Free 1 oz]]</li>
            <li> This is a nice, lightweight serum that leaves your skin feeling silky soft and smooth. The directions state to apply it twice a day.  Since I already use a daytime serum that is helps control the dermatitis I get, I&#x27;ve been using this a few days in the evenings, letting it sink in a bit before I apply my Retin-A.  Doing so had made me less flakey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Collagen Booster comes in a pump bottle, which should keep the product fresh over time.  It has an odd scent to it, but the scent dissipates pretty quickly once you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t pill up under foundation if you let it sink in a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin, and this does burn/tingle a bit when I first put it on.  It hasn&#x27;t caused any redness, though, so I&#x27;ve continued to use it since I like how my skin feels with it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I found it odd that this product didn&#x27;t include an ingredient list anywhere either on the product itself or in the packaging/pamphlet inside the tube it came in.  I went to the Dr. Brandt website, and found this list of ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WATER (AQUA), METHYLSILANOL HYDROXYPROLINE ASPARTATE, GLYCERIN, XANTHAN GUM, TRIHEPTANOIN, ACETYL HEXAPEPTIDE -20, TRIISOSTEARIN, CYATHEA CUMINGII LEAF EXTRACT, PHENOXYETHANOL, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, DECARBOXY CARNOSINE HCL, CAPRYLYL TRIMETHICONE, GLYCERYL ACRYLATE/ACRYLIC ACID COPOLYMER, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, LECITHIN, GLYCINE SOJA (SOYBEAN) GERM EXTRACT, PVM/MA COPOLYMER, SODIUM ACRYLATES COPOLYMER, METHYLPARABEN, ALCOHOL, SORBITOL, HYDROGENATED LECITHIN, GLYCINE, PROLINE, HYDROXYPROLINE, ALANINE, GLUTAMIC ACID, ARGININE, MAGNESIUM ASCORBYL PHOSPHATE, HYDROGENATED POLYISOBUTENE, ETHYLPARABEN, BUTYLPARABEN, LAVANDULA ANGUSTIFOLIA (LAVENDER) OIL, PHOSPHOLIPIDS, PROPYLPARABEN, ISOBUTYLPARABEN, POLYGLYCERYL-10 STEARATE, HELIANTHUS ANNUUS (SUNFLOWER) SEED OIL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it contains some nice peptides, I&#x27;m disappointed in the number of parabens it contains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also according to the Dr. Brandt website, this product contains the following \\&quot;specialty\\&quot; ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Hydroxyprolisilane CN - tissue regenerator that stimulates, strengthens and protects collagen and elastin fibers.&lt;br /&gt; *Alistin - minimizes the breakdown of collagen fibers by protecting them from becoming stiff and brittle due to free radicals, sugar, MMPs, and other skin scavengers.&lt;br /&gt;*  Isocell Map - stable Vitamin C derivative that stimulates collagen synthesis and production.&lt;br /&gt;*Liftessence - improves firmness and decreases surface lines.&lt;br /&gt;*Exclusive Proprietary Custom Blend of Key Amino Acids - maximizes and strengthens the formation of collagen fibers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skincare products also seem to contain special ingredients like these that promise to address your skin issues.  Since I&#x27;ve only used this for a few days, I can&#x27;t yet say whether or not it&#x27;s making a difference in teh level of my wrinkles, but it does seem to be improving my skin tone and my skin feels noticeably softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll report back and will update my review as I use this more.  For now, I like it as a serum.ite, this product contains the following \\&quot;specialty\\&quot; ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Hydroxyprolisilane CN - tissue regenerator that stimulates, strengthens and protects collagen and elastin fibers.&lt;br /&gt; *Alistin - minimizes the breakdown of collagen fibers by protecting them from becoming stiff and brittle due to free radicals, sugar, MMPs, and other skin scavengers.&lt;br /&gt;*  Isocell Map - stable Vitamin C derivative that stimulates collagen synthesis and production.&lt;br /&gt;*Liftessence - improves firmness and decreases surface lines.&lt;br /&gt;*Exclusive Proprietary Custom Blend of Key Amino Acids - maximizes and strengthens the formation of collagen fibers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skincare products also seem to contain special ingredients like these that promise to address your skin issues.

            <li> I am a skeptic when it comes to facial creams, but this product really did make my skin appear smoother after only a few days&#x27; use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I liked this product:&lt;br /&gt;* My skin looked and felt noticeably smoother after only a few days&#x27; use.&lt;br /&gt;* A light, pleasant fragrance.  It smelled like lavender to me.&lt;br /&gt;* The pump dispenser makes it quite easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use this product at night, since I use sunscreen and other creams during the day.  Even with just using it once a day, it has made a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> This is easily absorbed and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or sticky. I&#x27;m very fussy about not using heavy creams on my face and this works great.  It plumps the fine wrinkles around my eyes up and makes my complexion look smoother. I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup and just use this as my foundation.</li>
            <li> Love this new product.  Works wonders.  Thank you for having it available</li>
            <li> I have used it for a week and it seems to make my skin smoother.  It does have an order when you first put it on.</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle already. I use it with my ultrasonic face machine, which works great together. I actually see good results on my skin. It appears much firmer. No more sagging!</li>
