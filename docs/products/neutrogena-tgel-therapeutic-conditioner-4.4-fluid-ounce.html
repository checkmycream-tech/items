            <li>My wife is using this product along with the Shampoo and is very happy with the results she is having !</li>
            <li>If you have scalp psoriasis, this is great!  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife and she really loved it!</li>
            <li>Its a great product, works great in my case...</li>
            <li>Great item.</li>
            <li>Very quick delivery and exceeds expectations!!</li>
            <li>Good quality and very safe packaging.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased this hair conditioner before and I am very pleased with the product and will  purchase again when needed.</li>
            <li>Cost effective, and smells really good.</li>
            <li>Still, better than no conditioner and my scalp doesn&#x27;t get itchy.</li>
            <li>My scalp is doing better since I began using this conditioner.</li>
            <li>This works pretty good</li>
            <li>There are better options available.</li>
            <li>Easy transaction.</li>
            <li>I ran out of it very quickly.</li>
            <li>It works very well for me, especially since I have a real nice case of psoriasis in my hair.</li>
            <li>This is a good price and in my case, the only option for getting a product I like and that works well for it&#x27;s intended purpose when combined with T-gel.</li>
            <li>yeah lucky me</li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t make my hair smooth that much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, the T/Sal product is actually quite amazing.  </li>
            <li>It may smell a bit but is worth the end results</li>
            <li>However I have a severe case of sebbhoriac scalp dermititus and I need a powerful conditioner.  </li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>On the shelf they offer 5 or more different kinds of T-Gel Shampoos, but NO conditioners at all.</li>
            <li>Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Since Amazon does not accept returns of grocery items, they let me keep it though they refunded my money since it was an error on their part - and I was willing to return it to get what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>This product, as useful as it may seem, dries out my hair as much as the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It matches up great with the T/Sal shampoo, as they have the same active ingredients.</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t want to do</li>
            <li>Helps so much when used with the T-Sal shampoo.</li>
            <li>I am writing this review to let you know that this product really works.</li>
            <li>The key is to condition just your scalp with this stuff, then use a regular conditioner for your own hair.  </li>
            <li>(2-3x the times of normal conditioners) for decent cleaning.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does not make my hair luxurious and soft like the more expensive conditioners I own, but I&#x27;ve solved that problem by massaging the T/Sal conditioner into my scalp, and then using my regular conditioner (I use Pureology Hydrate) on the ends of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>Use of the product helps my scalp clear up over time.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner is not very slick and one must use a lot of it before your hair feels conditioned.  </li>
            <li>Regular conditioner makes my d.s. worse, but this one&#x27;s fine.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It really has help to cut down on my dry, flaky dandruff issues, and trust me I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING homeopathic to fix the problem before going to the big guns like this stuff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since turned to a different conditioner that makes my hair silky soft without being heavy.</li>

            <li> Less value for money.</li>
            <li> Seemed to help with my dandruff a little, but did nothing to moisturize my hair.</li>
            <li> Keeps it down to a dull roar, and improves my looks.</li>
            <li> but then I also use H&amp;S Conditioner with it because the T-Gel is a very little bottle</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see anything negative with this product...</li>
            <li> and I have very thick hair.</li>

            <li> Very quick delivery and exceeds expectations!!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this hair conditioner before and I am very pleased with the product and will  purchase again when needed.</li>
            <li> I ordered THIS product from Amazon (am reviewing it from my &#x27;purchased items&#x27; page) but was actually sent Neutrogena T/Sal Therapeutic Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Since Amazon does not accept returns of grocery items, they let me keep it though they refunded my money since it was an error on their part - and I was willing to return it to get what I wanted.  I used it, just to try it out to see if I should order the T/Gel as I&#x27;d intended.&lt;br /&gt;So, the T/Sal product is actually quite amazing.  I ordered just the conditioner, not both conditioner and shampoo.  I wash my hair as I regularly do, and then I will put the conditioner in and let it sit while I do my other things in the shower (~3-5 minutes).  Then I rinse it out.  It really has help to cut down on my dry, flaky dandruff issues, and trust me I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING homeopathic to fix the problem before going to the big guns like this stuff (the next step was prescription and I really don&#x27;t want to do that).&lt;br /&gt;It does not make my hair luxurious and soft like the more expensive conditioners I own, but I&#x27;ve solved that problem by massaging the T/Sal conditioner into my scalp, and then using my regular conditioner (I use Pureology Hydrate) on the ends of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving 4 stars because I didn&#x27;t get what I ordered.  I would try to review the T/Sal conditioner on Amazon, but I cannot find a listing for T/Sal conditioner - only T/Sal Shampoo.  Oh well!</li>
            <li> Good quality and very safe packaging.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she really loved it! It helps for dandruff too. I recommend this product</li>
            <li> Ugh....having been born with SD, life can be a royal pain. This works pretty good but then I also use H&amp;S Conditioner with it because the T-Gel is a very little bottle and I have very thick hair. I also use it on my face after washing &#x27;cause I also get SD there too, yeah lucky me, right? I have found that it is sold also at CVS for about the same price so I just get it here when CVS is out of stock. Bottom line, it works and that&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
            <li> Helps so much when used with the T-Sal shampoo. T-Sal doesn&#x27;t have a conditioner so T-Gel conditioner works with it. I have itching to the point of being painful 24/7 and since I&#x27;ve been using the T-Sal shampoo with this conditioner the itching has all but stopped. It is &amp;#34;THE&amp;#34; finishing touch to the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I am writing this review to let you know that this product really works. It may smell a bit but is worth the end results</li>
            <li> I have been hunting for this for several years locally. It works very well for me, especially since I have a real nice case of psoriasis in my hair. Keeps it down to a dull roar, and improves my looks. I need all the help I can get.</li>
            <li> Yes it works.  The key is to condition just your scalp with this stuff, then use a regular conditioner for your own hair.  Otherwise you&#x27;ll use this up in less than a week if you&#x27;ve got long hair.</li>
            <li> This product, as useful as it may seem, dries out my hair as much as the shampoo.  I&#x27;ve since turned to a different conditioner that makes my hair silky soft without being heavy.</li>
            <li> Great item. Easy transaction.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is not very slick and one must use a lot of it before your hair feels conditioned.  However I have a severe case of sebbhoriac scalp dermititus and I need a powerful conditioner.  I use it after I use the T-Sal shampoo.  Use of the product helps my scalp clear up over time.  Also one must resist the temptation to pick at spots on one&#x27;s head.  My scalp is doing better since I began using this conditioner.</li>
            <li> It is what it is... the stores around here stopped selling this for some odd reason, so online I went.  This is a good price and in my case, the only option for getting a product I like and that works well for it&#x27;s intended purpose when combined with T-gel.</li>
            <li> Cost effective, and smells really good. I also use as leave in conditioner for added softness and controllable curls all day.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy. You have to apply a lot of conditioner (2-3x the times of normal conditioners) for decent cleaning. Less value for money. I ran out of it very quickly. There are better options available.</li>
