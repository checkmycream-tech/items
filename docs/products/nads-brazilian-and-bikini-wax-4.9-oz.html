    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Works great for me!</li>
            <li>technique was not the best</li>
            <li>but when you do it works perfect.</li>
            <li>Great product Nad&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>good product!!!</li>
            <li>Having heard wonderful things, I gave this product a try...</li>
            <li>This stuff works great!</li>
            <li>The best wax, but I do not like the smell.</li>
            <li>What a hasel to look and feel my best lol&lt;</li>
            <li>awesome!!</li>
            <li>Nad&#x27;s Brazilian wax is the best.</li>
            <li>It is the best!</li>
            <li>Still not my ideal wax, but it will do.</li>
            <li>but great product, works beautifully</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>It works great</li>
            <li>Worked great.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that out of all of the ones I&#x27;ve tried, nads was the best experience.</li>
            <li>The lady always did a great job, but I moved.</li>
            <li>In theory it may work great, but I&#x27;ll stick with the professionals for waxing.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>and they work great...</li>
            <li>Home alone would work better!!</li>
            <li>This stuff is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>make sure you go in the direction of the hairs for it to work perfectly.</li>
            <li>Loved them both (and have been using them now for 2years).</li>
            <li>and I think I made good choice.&lt;br /&gt;Im</li>
            <li>its a good product, it worked.</li>
            <li>so I couldn&#x27;t get a good pull.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I could not get a good one for my underarms and</li>
            <li>The wax smelled good..</li>
            <li>This wax is good.</li>
            <li>It just has a really good consistency for waxing.  </li>
            <li>am very satisfied with this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the results though.  </li>
            <li>My first use of this product was great!</li>
            <li>Love that!</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li>These work amazingly.</li>
            <li>Ive never done any waxing before on my own or a salon.</li>
            <li>after using product twice:&lt;br /&gt;After using this twice, I can say that this is a nice product.</li>
            <li>I will be doing all of my own waxes from now on.  </li>
            <li>This product did not perform as effectively as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>and i liked them</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t nearly as strong as I thought it would be...but who needs good smelling wax?</li>
            <li>Smells good but too strong for me.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>think this is a great product and definitely worth a try to save a lot of money from salon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The best advise that i can give anyone is don&#x27;t give up if the first time doesn&#x27;t work but try it again and find a position that is comfortable for you but also allows you to see whats going on.</li>
            <li>As such, Nads is great for newbies as well as experienced home</li>
            <li>I was getting at the salon, what a HUGE saving!  </li>
            <li>I wont be using it more than once without lidocaine cream</li>
            <li>I have had great results with this product and would recommend it to absolutely anyone.</li>
            <li>I wish it was more in the container.</li>
            <li>I will love to use it all over.</li>
            <li>Four stars because it should be more in the container.</li>
            <li>but I think it will get a lot better and quicker with time.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have baby oil.</li>
            <li>Pulling downward was a lot better than upward, but many people recommend going up against the direction of the hair.</li>
            <li>I really hope it gets shorter when I&#x27;m more experienced.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for more than 5</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>This explains the ease of using it, and why it makes me re-buy it each time :)</li>
            <li>and I honestly think spending the $50 to have a professional get it done perfectly in 15 minutes is 100% worth it and spending $7 buying a do-it-yourself kit</li>
            <li>and I both enjoy the results, but in all honestly the smoothness is something _</li>
            <li>Buying more, will keep on hand</li>
            <li>and I hope I can do a more thorough job.</li>
            <li>I would suggest using the Gigi brazilian wax, I like that one MUCH better</li>
            <li>It does not smell like peaches, more like chemicals</li>
            <li>I was able to get 3 uses out of 1 kit at $10,</li>
            <li>I have worked with many waxes</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it will work just as well.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Worked significantly better than I could have imagined</li>
            <li>The sender was great the product not so much.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Works like how it&#x27;s suppose to and gets most of my hair off.</li>
            <li>It remove most of the hair from the bikini region.</li>
            <li>Buy this, read the instructions, and you won&#x27;t regret  it! :-)</li>
            <li>It missed so many hairs.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use, way better than the wax you have to use with strips!</li>
            <li>I was more skilled at using it after two times and the hair is thinner and easier and not painful to wax off now.</li>
            <li>I loved not having to mess with strips, and the was was very effective at removing bikini line hair.</li>
            <li>I decided to write this review to let people know that waxing yourself is Not going to be easy until you try it a couple of times and still its not going to be as easy as having someone else wax you.</li>
            <li>It was really easy to get the wax correct temp in microwave.</li>
            <li>It applied easily.</li>
            <li>and I think it should easily reheat to wax again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so it removes fairly easily taking off all that stubborn hair with it.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It was so easy then.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best quality wax I have found.  </li>
            <li>This is the best wax I&#x27;ve ever used, but I wish more came in that little container!</li>
            <li>But worked fine for d legs</li>
            <li>so the microwave would not freak out and the wax heated up just fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really only good for a nice bikini clean up on aisle 4.</li>
            <li>This is a great product if you know how to wax properly.</li>
            <li>and I would end up tweezing the hair under the piece of wax to free myself from pain.</li>
            <li>I am so unbelievably happy that I found something that actually worked!</li>
            <li>I_ enjoy, for heightening sensitivity of that area.</li>
            <li>I have never had a Brazilian wax because I don&#x27;t feel comfortable baring myself to strangers.</li>
            <li>but this Nads one is fantastic.</li>
            <li>it wouldn&#x27;t go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Maybe will work well for your legs, or a mans back, lol?</li>
            <li>Second time purchasing this item never will i stop lol.</li>
            <li>So it took a couple of try&#x27;s to make the wax fit for my skin.</li>
            <li>Compared to using a sugar wax on my bikini area, it leaves fewer ingrown hairs and takes the hair off more easily, and I don&#x27;t think it hurts as much.  </li>
            <li>The wax is a bright red color making it easy to see where it dripped or where you applied</li>
            <li>So hard to find the microwaveable wax any more so was happy to be able to get it.  </li>
            <li>i like the original NAD&#x27;s product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the original Nad&#x27;s gel since it came out, literally.  </li>
            <li>As for the smell, it in no way smells like mango or has a fruity odor like the original.  </li>
            <li>I am so excited to have it around.</li>
            <li>For clean up, this just needed to cool</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to smell fruity, but it smells more like plastic than any real fruit or perfume.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>I would have chosen &amp;#34;I love it&amp;#34; but who really &amp;#34;loves&amp;#34; having the hair in your privates ripped out by lukewarm wax?</li>
            <li>Only good thing.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;The directions said to heat for about 90 seconds for a full container.  </li>
            <li>Just keep in mind that if you use oil on your fingertips to keep wax from sticking, your waxing area is going to get greasy soon from touching it so much and may prevent the wax from adhering.</li>
            <li>Was not as easy to rip off as strip hot wax.</li>
            <li>Lol, be careful using this one!  </li>
            <li>it is bikini wax, i have used it on my upper lip, and it works wonderfully there also, with no red bumps, rash, or itching.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I&#x27;ve only used it that one time, because aside from the pain, it&#x27;s also extremely messy to use on my own, it gets all over the place, my fingers, also be advised that if you&#x27;re wearing nail polish, you&#x27;ll need to remove them afterwards if you accidentally gets it on your hands/fingers/nails because no matter how you scrubbed, it just kind of bind with my nail polish</li>
            <li>Fast &amp; easy</li>
            <li>id put it back for 2 minutes and it melts pretty good, then use it again until it starts to thicken again, i keep doing this process until</li>
            <li>Finally built up the courage to try waxing myself and I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li>I have used many other hot waxes before and I love this one!</li>
            <li>and it really helped!!</li>
            <li>I promise you, on a 1-10 scale it will be a pain of about 9 for your first wax, (or for a wax you get after shaving inbetween waxes) so get it done at a salon!</li>
            <li>This cost a lot less than professional waxing, and was the best home kit I have found.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect there to be no pain, but it&#x27;s all worth it.</li>
            <li>If you master the technique its worth the money</li>
            <li>Worth the buy online or in the store if you can find it.</li>
            <li>is 0% worth it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>all of my experience and training, I thought it wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal to try and do my own.</li>
            <li>it took forever to get the thing at just the right consistency.</li>
            <li>just right</li>
            <li>and it came right up.  </li>
            <li>You have to use it the right way though</li>
            <li>I used surgi wax in the past and it works great for brazillian waxing.</li>
            <li>Microwavable, easy to apply and remove, no strips needed, no mess creator.</li>
            <li>First of all - OMG the smel, is horrrrrrrrible.</li>
            <li>when I first used this one, which does not use cloth strips, it was a surprise when I removed the first strip.  </li>
            <li>but I decided to stop for first day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it once, but I was pretty pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>It is my first time</li>
            <li>This was the first wax that I tried.</li>
            <li>Sure beats traditional wax that gets burning hot.</li>
            <li>This stuff gets the job done...if you follow the directions exactly.</li>
            <li>This product works as described and I have been able to modify my &amp;#34;nether hair&amp;#34; to my satisfaction several times with the amount in the package.</li>
            <li>I had done a lot of research before trying my first at home bikini wax.</li>
            <li>First of all, I don&#x27;t think this stuff would melt on the surface of the Sun, let alone my microwave.  </li>
            <li>I have waxed at home many times prior to trying this product.</li>
            <li>Tried it on my legs first.</li>
            <li>(Considering your doing a bikini or a Brazilian wax &amp; your microwave is in the kitchen and your bedroom is upstairs and I am married with children).</li>
            <li>Next, you should wear finger condoms or something because it took more than some oil to get the wax off.</li>
            <li>When I first put this product in the microwave I followed all the instructions but the microwave started to spark and it scared me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In conclusion, the product worked well the first time but is not reusable.</li>
            <li>it does exactly what i says.</li>
            <li>- you have to keep waxing to weaken the follicle and it won&#x27;t hurt so damn much!</li>
            <li>For $10 I&#x27;m extremely satisfied, totally going to keep self-waxing!</li>
            <li>Nearly pain free.  </li>
            <li>Will most likely buy this again when i need it.  </li>
            <li>soo much gets the job done!</li>
            <li>At first it would brake off</li>
            <li>So glad it was only $13.</li>
            <li>I loved the green Nads that came off with water but cannot seem to find it.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it took me an hr to find the right rhythm, thereafter was much easier.  </li>
            <li>The wax dries quickly and removes hair better than any other wax I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that even in the morning ,when running out of time to get ready, if I find some shoots in the upper lips, I can get rid of them in approx 5 minutes (2 min heating + 1 min applying +</li>
            <li>Your very next wax (DIY or professionally) will be nothing compared to the previous wax and you&#x27;ll have a much more pleasant time waxing at home.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking I need to heat it up a lot more then wait for it cool down.</li>
            <li>This wax is simple, you just microwave and your good to go, no dumb heating pot is necessary or waxing strips, so this makes it all the more simple.</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time and it works really well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After researching a whole lot on the whole process and reading the instructions, I went on ahead!</li>
            <li>when it gets used to it doesn&#x27;t feel that much pain like first time.</li>
            <li>I think there is another comment somewhere that says it breaks off before you can remove any hair, and that pretty much sums it up.</li>
            <li>I love the shapes that came a long with the box.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didnt get completely finished and wax started to get to cool to use</li>
            <li>Although I was satisfied the first time around, I decided to try other products before returning to this one.</li>
            <li>It would probably be a good product to try if you don&#x27;t have a wax warmer and want to try a hard wax.  </li>
            <li>smells good, real wax, does not irritate my skin, does not suffocate me compared to the gigi brazilian hard wax made in china, i dont trust products from china anymore, as much as i can avoid it, I WILL..</li>
            <li>I was licensed so this wasn&#x27;t much of a challenge for me.</li>
            <li>very clear.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>only available online,</li>
            <li>and I found myself waiting much longer), using powder, etc.</li>
            <li>In others, the pain level was more than okay, but the wax would only grab on to a few hairs</li>
            <li>The spatula puts on a wider strip of wax and really speeds up the time it takes!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I nuked it for almost 6 straight minutes</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this product 100%.</li>
            <li>It does not stick too much to the skin</li>
            <li>whole jar didnt melted in 90 seconds, it takes about 7 minutes for the whole jar to melt, i have to do 2 minutes at a time, and pause for 2 minutes before i heat it again</li>
            <li>I was a bit scared  to try this because I had all ready</li>
            <li>but when I saw this it just seemed like it would be so much easier.  </li>
            <li>but if you can get past that, it does work pretty nicely.  </li>
            <li>The wax thickens pretty quickly which makes application more difficult because it&#x27;s a goopy consistency instead of a smooth liquid.</li>
            <li>This product works much better than any other at-home waxing product that I have tried.</li>
            <li>I feel like it held the hair much better than other waxes and came off cleaner.  </li>
            <li>Works so much better than other types of wax.</li>
            <li>I think I prefer going back to the original Nad&#x27;s wax.</li>
            <li>I heat it up in the microwave, then set the plastic pot of hot wax on a small plate, on top of my beverage warmer to keep it hot.</li>
            <li>This is a decent product that really delivers.</li>
            <li>The wax is good enough quality that I think it would work anywhere - that is why it is being marketed and packaged for one of the most difficult areas to wax.</li>
            <li>If you follow the directions and put down an old sheet (even for the experienced)with practice it works great and goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Most of the problems were due to me just being messy and inexperienced, but I think the more frequently I do this, the more streamlined the whole process will become.</li>
            <li>The only thing I wish was that it came with more sticks (they give you two) and that the wax stayed at the proper temp longer.</li>
            <li>Of course, I couldn&#x27;t manage the very sensitive areas because it hurts!</li>
            <li>and it just did not cure fast enough and wasnt strong enough to get my hair pulled from the root.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised that you don&#x27;t need cloths to use this version!!</li>
            <li>But trying to do the entire area with this was a huge hassle and literal pain that took up more than an hour of my day to produce hardly any</li>
            <li>i.e. Brazilian...hurts too much on that sensitive area.</li>
            <li>I went to buy my refill like normal and to my horror</li>
            <li>Also the area I was able to wax broke out a few days after I waxed, even though I exfoliated a day before use.</li>
            <li>It was getting comical of undressing-doing a few strips-then rerobing, running to kitchen to nuke.  </li>
            <li>It takes a little while to get your technique down, but when you do, it&#x27;s pretty easy to spread it on and rip it off cleanly.  </li>
            <li>If you have a pretty decent layer of wax you could actually just pull the wax off with your fingers.</li>
            <li>At first, trick was to peel off when it had cooled down to just the right temp.</li>
            <li>I first purchased this one based on some youtube reviews and several of them recommended this.</li>
            <li>All in all I would definitely recommend this if you are interested in DIY waxing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its slightly more expensive but so worth the convenience compared to purchasing 2 or 3 others that all suck!</li>
            <li>Be sure to read the directions, start with small areas, and hold the skin taut.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes it would come clean, sometimes there would be several pieces of hair still left, and I would just tweeze them out.</li>
            <li>It is also important to make sure that the hair is about 1/4 inch long, and that if you are new to waxing you try doing really small inch long sections until you get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li>This wax works great for DIY upper lips, brows and other small areas.</li>
            <li>One of the best things I like about nads is that it always remains somewhat pliable; other brands (Sally Hansen) of hardwax become completely solid too quickly (this is really bad for newbies; they tend to take longer in between strips).</li>
            <li>and I know first times usually are more painful, then as the root grows weaker, waxing is easy, but sometimes it wouldn&#x27;t rip clean and would end up in clumps</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to using the natural wax with the cloth strips, so</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten a professional Brazilian a couple times before</li>
            <li>I have gotten professional bikini waxes before, but decided to try it at home because of the cost.</li>
            <li>this product does not work well, the nads wax is just too soft.</li>
            <li>I decided I&#x27;m just going to go professional.</li>
            <li>I very well may use this for my legs and underarms next summer.  </li>
            <li>Yet, it was not messy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve  using this product about 3 times and notice the hair that does grow back, is much thinner.</li>
            <li>I have used the wax stripes before,The nads natural hair removal gel</li>
            <li>You have so much wax but the other stuff isn&#x27;t really quality type.</li>
            <li>Although it is a really good product and it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as others that I have tried in the past, it&#x27;s hard not to messed up with it</li>
            <li>The product does takes a long time to get the wax to the right consistency, however, it does what the makers say- remove thick hair smoothly.</li>
            <li>It is a million times better than those ridiculous wax strips that Walgreens and CVS advertise.</li>
            <li>It was easier to clean up than other brands of wax - especially sugar based waxes.  </li>
            <li>, I apply a thin, quarter sized amount at a time, let it cool for 20-30 seconds, pull skin taught and then COMMIT to pulling it off, in the right direction.</li>
            <li>I used regular paper strips made for waxing and it works only if the wax is at a certain temperature.</li>
            <li>This was my first time doing a Brazilian wax and my first time using hard wax.</li>
            <li>It works as expected although it&#x27;s pretty painful and causes a great deal of apprehension.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I am sooo glad I did!</li>
            <li>Okay next time I didn&#x27;t, still missed so many hairs, so annoying I would not waste my money or time with this product again.</li>
            <li>i tried out a couple of strips on my legs to see how it worked first, but i can&#x27;t imagine going straight to my private area with all the stringy waxy mess!</li>
            <li>but OMG waxing is sooo painful, lol.</li>
            <li>I accidently put too much on at once and left it on too long</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several professional Brazilian waxes done</li>
            <li>Believe it or not, ripping this wax off BARELY hurts.</li>
            <li>It will break off midway through ripping if it gets too cool, too thin, or if you don&#x27;t brace yourself and rip it off fast.  </li>
            <li>There were a few small patches I was able to do with only a little pain and those ended up being free of hair for about a month</li>
            <li>The first thought for this review is really the PAIN factor, it&#x27;s really unbearable, I don&#x27;t know if I was doing it wrong, but it did remove the hair on the area which I applied it on.</li>
            <li>Still, both require a certain amount of time before the nerves endings in the area give up screaming and settle down to a general howl.</li>
            <li>I am shocked at how fast and easy it really is to use.  </li>
            <li>recommend purchasing a sensitive skin soft-wax for after-use on (and ONLY) the upper bikini line.</li>
            <li>I spent the extra $40 for a wax pot and this stuff worked REALLY well.</li>
            <li>It is just the running back and forth to keep it soft enough to apply without burning yourself and you waste so much of it-I am not sure I will get 2 full uses out of 1 container.  </li>
            <li>I was having trouble with microwaving the wax because I did not want to make it too hot</li>
            <li>I wish it came with wider applicators instead of just popsicle sticks, but they are still workable since you don&#x27;t want to lay down too much wax when doing a brazilian anyway.  </li>
            <li>Just remember you can not do large strips, one inch in with and go from there, it took me a little getting use to.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Works great for me!</li>
            <li> technique was not the best</li>
            <li> but when you do it works perfect.</li>
            <li> Great product Nad&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> good product!!!</li>
            <li> Having heard wonderful things, I gave this product a try...</li>
            <li> This stuff works great!</li>
            <li> The best wax, but I do not like the smell.</li>
            <li> What a hasel to look and feel my best lol&lt;</li>
            <li> awesome!!</li>
            <li> Nad&#x27;s Brazilian wax is the best.</li>
            <li> It is the best!</li>
            <li> Still not my ideal wax, but it will do.</li>

            <li> It works great</li>
            <li> Worked great.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that out of all of the ones I&#x27;ve tried, nads was the best experience.</li>
            <li> The lady always did a great job, but I moved.</li>
            <li> In theory it may work great, but I&#x27;ll stick with the professionals for waxing.</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> and they work great...</li>
            <li> Home alone would work better!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> make sure you go in the direction of the hairs for it to work perfectly.</li>
            <li> Loved them both (and have been using them now for 2years).</li>
            <li> and I think I made good choice.&lt;br /&gt;Im</li>
            <li> its a good product, it worked.</li>
            <li> so I couldn&#x27;t get a good pull.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I could not get a good one for my underarms and</li>
            <li> The wax smelled good..</li>
            <li> This wax is good.</li>
            <li> It just has a really good consistency for waxing.  </li>
            <li> am very satisfied with this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the results though.  </li>
            <li> My first use of this product was great!</li>
            <li> Love that!</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li> These work amazingly.</li>
            <li> Ive never done any waxing before on my own or a salon.</li>
            <li> after using product twice:&lt;br /&gt;After using this twice, I can say that this is a nice product.</li>
            <li> I will be doing all of my own waxes from now on.  </li>
            <li> This product did not perform as effectively as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> and i liked them</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t nearly as strong as I thought it would be...but who needs good smelling wax?</li>
            <li> Smells good but too strong for me.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> think this is a great product and definitely worth a try to save a lot of money from salon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The best advise that i can give anyone is don&#x27;t give up if the first time doesn&#x27;t work but try it again and find a position that is comfortable for you but also allows you to see whats going on.</li>
            <li> As such, Nads is great for newbies as well as experienced home</li>
            <li> I was getting at the salon, what a HUGE saving!  </li>
            <li> I wont be using it more than once without lidocaine cream</li>
            <li> I have had great results with this product and would recommend it to absolutely anyone.</li>
            <li> I wish it was more in the container.</li>
            <li> I will love to use it all over.</li>
            <li> Four stars because it should be more in the container.</li>
            <li> but I think it will get a lot better and quicker with time.</li>
            <li> Make sure you have baby oil.</li>
            <li> Pulling downward was a lot better than upward, but many people recommend going up against the direction of the hair.</li>
            <li> I really hope it gets shorter when I&#x27;m more experienced.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than 5</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> This explains the ease of using it, and why it makes me re-buy it each time :)</li>
            <li> and I honestly think spending the $50 to have a professional get it done perfectly in 15 minutes is 100% worth it and spending $7 buying a do-it-yourself kit</li>
            <li> and I both enjoy the results, but in all honestly the smoothness is something _</li>
            <li> Buying more, will keep on hand</li>
            <li> and I hope I can do a more thorough job.</li>
            <li> I would suggest using the Gigi brazilian wax, I like that one MUCH better</li>
            <li> It does not smell like peaches, more like chemicals</li>
            <li> I was able to get 3 uses out of 1 kit at $10,</li>
            <li> I have worked with many waxes</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure it will work just as well.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Worked significantly better than I could have imagined</li>
            <li> The sender was great the product not so much.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Works like how it&#x27;s suppose to and gets most of my hair off.</li>
            <li> It remove most of the hair from the bikini region.</li>
            <li> Buy this, read the instructions, and you won&#x27;t regret  it! :-)</li>
            <li> It missed so many hairs.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use, way better than the wax you have to use with strips!</li>
            <li> I was more skilled at using it after two times and the hair is thinner and easier and not painful to wax off now.</li>
            <li> I loved not having to mess with strips, and the was was very effective at removing bikini line hair.</li>
            <li> I decided to write this review to let people know that waxing yourself is Not going to be easy until you try it a couple of times and still its not going to be as easy as having someone else wax you.</li>
            <li> It was really easy to get the wax correct temp in microwave.</li>
            <li> It applied easily.</li>
            <li> and I think it should easily reheat to wax again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so it removes fairly easily taking off all that stubborn hair with it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It was so easy then.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best quality wax I have found.  </li>
            <li> This is the best wax I&#x27;ve ever used, but I wish more came in that little container!</li>
            <li> But worked fine for d legs</li>
            <li> so the microwave would not freak out and the wax heated up just fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really only good for a nice bikini clean up on aisle 4.</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you know how to wax properly.</li>
            <li> and I would end up tweezing the hair under the piece of wax to free myself from pain.</li>
            <li> I am so unbelievably happy that I found something that actually worked!</li>
            <li> I_ enjoy, for heightening sensitivity of that area.</li>
            <li> I have never had a Brazilian wax because I don&#x27;t feel comfortable baring myself to strangers.</li>
            <li> but this Nads one is fantastic.</li>
            <li> it wouldn&#x27;t go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Maybe will work well for your legs, or a mans back, lol?</li>
            <li> Second time purchasing this item never will i stop lol.</li>
            <li> So it took a couple of try&#x27;s to make the wax fit for my skin.</li>
            <li> Compared to using a sugar wax on my bikini area, it leaves fewer ingrown hairs and takes the hair off more easily, and I don&#x27;t think it hurts as much.  </li>
            <li> The wax is a bright red color making it easy to see where it dripped or where you applied</li>
            <li> So hard to find the microwaveable wax any more so was happy to be able to get it.  </li>
            <li> i like the original NAD&#x27;s product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the original Nad&#x27;s gel since it came out, literally.  </li>
            <li> As for the smell, it in no way smells like mango or has a fruity odor like the original.  </li>
            <li> I am so excited to have it around.</li>
            <li> For clean up, this just needed to cool</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to smell fruity, but it smells more like plastic than any real fruit or perfume.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> I would have chosen &amp;#34;I love it&amp;#34; but who really &amp;#34;loves&amp;#34; having the hair in your privates ripped out by lukewarm wax?</li>
            <li> Only good thing.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;The directions said to heat for about 90 seconds for a full container.  </li>
            <li> Just keep in mind that if you use oil on your fingertips to keep wax from sticking, your waxing area is going to get greasy soon from touching it so much and may prevent the wax from adhering.</li>
            <li> Was not as easy to rip off as strip hot wax.</li>
            <li> Lol, be careful using this one!  </li>
            <li> it is bikini wax, i have used it on my upper lip, and it works wonderfully there also, with no red bumps, rash, or itching.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I&#x27;ve only used it that one time, because aside from the pain, it&#x27;s also extremely messy to use on my own, it gets all over the place, my fingers, also be advised that if you&#x27;re wearing nail polish, you&#x27;ll need to remove them afterwards if you accidentally gets it on your hands/fingers/nails because no matter how you scrubbed, it just kind of bind with my nail polish</li>
            <li> Fast &amp; easy</li>
            <li> id put it back for 2 minutes and it melts pretty good, then use it again until it starts to thicken again, i keep doing this process until</li>
            <li> Finally built up the courage to try waxing myself and I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li> I have used many other hot waxes before and I love this one!</li>
            <li> and it really helped!!</li>
            <li> I promise you, on a 1-10 scale it will be a pain of about 9 for your first wax, (or for a wax you get after shaving inbetween waxes) so get it done at a salon!</li>
            <li> This cost a lot less than professional waxing, and was the best home kit I have found.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect there to be no pain, but it&#x27;s all worth it.</li>
            <li> If you master the technique its worth the money</li>
            <li> Worth the buy online or in the store if you can find it.</li>
            <li> is 0% worth it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> all of my experience and training, I thought it wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal to try and do my own.</li>
            <li> it took forever to get the thing at just the right consistency.</li>
            <li> just right</li>
            <li> and it came right up.  </li>
            <li> You have to use it the right way though</li>
            <li> I used surgi wax in the past and it works great for brazillian waxing.</li>
            <li> Microwavable, easy to apply and remove, no strips needed, no mess creator.</li>
            <li> First of all - OMG the smel, is horrrrrrrrible.</li>
            <li> when I first used this one, which does not use cloth strips, it was a surprise when I removed the first strip.  </li>
            <li> but I decided to stop for first day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it once, but I was pretty pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> It is my first time</li>
            <li> This was the first wax that I tried.</li>
            <li> Sure beats traditional wax that gets burning hot.</li>
            <li> This stuff gets the job done...if you follow the directions exactly.</li>
            <li> This product works as described and I have been able to modify my &amp;#34;nether hair&amp;#34; to my satisfaction several times with the amount in the package.</li>
            <li> I had done a lot of research before trying my first at home bikini wax.</li>
            <li> First of all, I don&#x27;t think this stuff would melt on the surface of the Sun, let alone my microwave.  </li>
            <li> I have waxed at home many times prior to trying this product.</li>
            <li> Tried it on my legs first.</li>
            <li> (Considering your doing a bikini or a Brazilian wax &amp; your microwave is in the kitchen and your bedroom is upstairs and I am married with children).</li>
            <li> Next, you should wear finger condoms or something because it took more than some oil to get the wax off.</li>
            <li> When I first put this product in the microwave I followed all the instructions but the microwave started to spark and it scared me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In conclusion, the product worked well the first time but is not reusable.</li>
            <li> it does exactly what i says.</li>
            <li> - you have to keep waxing to weaken the follicle and it won&#x27;t hurt so damn much!</li>
            <li> For $10 I&#x27;m extremely satisfied, totally going to keep self-waxing!</li>
            <li> Nearly pain free.  </li>
            <li> Will most likely buy this again when i need it.  </li>
            <li> soo much gets the job done!</li>
            <li> At first it would brake off</li>
            <li> So glad it was only $13.</li>
            <li> I loved the green Nads that came off with water but cannot seem to find it.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it took me an hr to find the right rhythm, thereafter was much easier.  </li>
            <li> The wax dries quickly and removes hair better than any other wax I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that even in the morning ,when running out of time to get ready, if I find some shoots in the upper lips, I can get rid of them in approx 5 minutes (2 min heating + 1 min applying +</li>
            <li> Your very next wax (DIY or professionally) will be nothing compared to the previous wax and you&#x27;ll have a much more pleasant time waxing at home.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking I need to heat it up a lot more then wait for it cool down.</li>
            <li> This wax is simple, you just microwave and your good to go, no dumb heating pot is necessary or waxing strips, so this makes it all the more simple.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time and it works really well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After researching a whole lot on the whole process and reading the instructions, I went on ahead!</li>
            <li> when it gets used to it doesn&#x27;t feel that much pain like first time.</li>
            <li> I think there is another comment somewhere that says it breaks off before you can remove any hair, and that pretty much sums it up.</li>
            <li> I love the shapes that came a long with the box.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didnt get completely finished and wax started to get to cool to use</li>
            <li> Although I was satisfied the first time around, I decided to try other products before returning to this one.</li>
            <li> It would probably be a good product to try if you don&#x27;t have a wax warmer and want to try a hard wax.  </li>
            <li> smells good, real wax, does not irritate my skin, does not suffocate me compared to the gigi brazilian hard wax made in china, i dont trust products from china anymore, as much as i can avoid it, I WILL..</li>
            <li> I was licensed so this wasn&#x27;t much of a challenge for me.</li>
            <li> very clear.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> only available online,</li>
            <li> and I found myself waiting much longer), using powder, etc.</li>
            <li> In others, the pain level was more than okay, but the wax would only grab on to a few hairs</li>
            <li> The spatula puts on a wider strip of wax and really speeds up the time it takes!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I nuked it for almost 6 straight minutes</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this product 100%.</li>
            <li> It does not stick too much to the skin</li>
            <li> whole jar didnt melted in 90 seconds, it takes about 7 minutes for the whole jar to melt, i have to do 2 minutes at a time, and pause for 2 minutes before i heat it again</li>
            <li> I was a bit scared  to try this because I had all ready</li>
            <li> but when I saw this it just seemed like it would be so much easier.  </li>
            <li> but if you can get past that, it does work pretty nicely.  </li>
            <li> The wax thickens pretty quickly which makes application more difficult because it&#x27;s a goopy consistency instead of a smooth liquid.</li>
            <li> This product works much better than any other at-home waxing product that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I feel like it held the hair much better than other waxes and came off cleaner.  </li>
            <li> Works so much better than other types of wax.</li>
            <li> I think I prefer going back to the original Nad&#x27;s wax.</li>
            <li> I heat it up in the microwave, then set the plastic pot of hot wax on a small plate, on top of my beverage warmer to keep it hot.</li>
            <li> This is a decent product that really delivers.</li>
            <li> The wax is good enough quality that I think it would work anywhere - that is why it is being marketed and packaged for one of the most difficult areas to wax.</li>
            <li> If you follow the directions and put down an old sheet (even for the experienced)with practice it works great and goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Most of the problems were due to me just being messy and inexperienced, but I think the more frequently I do this, the more streamlined the whole process will become.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish was that it came with more sticks (they give you two) and that the wax stayed at the proper temp longer.</li>
            <li> Of course, I couldn&#x27;t manage the very sensitive areas because it hurts!</li>
            <li> and it just did not cure fast enough and wasnt strong enough to get my hair pulled from the root.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised that you don&#x27;t need cloths to use this version!!</li>
            <li> But trying to do the entire area with this was a huge hassle and literal pain that took up more than an hour of my day to produce hardly any</li>
            <li> i.e. Brazilian...hurts too much on that sensitive area.</li>
            <li> I went to buy my refill like normal and to my horror</li>
            <li> Also the area I was able to wax broke out a few days after I waxed, even though I exfoliated a day before use.</li>
            <li> It was getting comical of undressing-doing a few strips-then rerobing, running to kitchen to nuke.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little while to get your technique down, but when you do, it&#x27;s pretty easy to spread it on and rip it off cleanly.  </li>
            <li> If you have a pretty decent layer of wax you could actually just pull the wax off with your fingers.</li>
            <li> At first, trick was to peel off when it had cooled down to just the right temp.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this one based on some youtube reviews and several of them recommended this.</li>
            <li> All in all I would definitely recommend this if you are interested in DIY waxing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its slightly more expensive but so worth the convenience compared to purchasing 2 or 3 others that all suck!</li>
            <li> Be sure to read the directions, start with small areas, and hold the skin taut.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes it would come clean, sometimes there would be several pieces of hair still left, and I would just tweeze them out.</li>
            <li> It is also important to make sure that the hair is about 1/4 inch long, and that if you are new to waxing you try doing really small inch long sections until you get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> This wax works great for DIY upper lips, brows and other small areas.</li>
            <li> One of the best things I like about nads is that it always remains somewhat pliable; other brands (Sally Hansen) of hardwax become completely solid too quickly (this is really bad for newbies; they tend to take longer in between strips).</li>
            <li> and I know first times usually are more painful, then as the root grows weaker, waxing is easy, but sometimes it wouldn&#x27;t rip clean and would end up in clumps</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to using the natural wax with the cloth strips, so</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten a professional Brazilian a couple times before</li>
            <li> I have gotten professional bikini waxes before, but decided to try it at home because of the cost.</li>
            <li> this product does not work well, the nads wax is just too soft.</li>
            <li> I decided I&#x27;m just going to go professional.</li>
            <li> I very well may use this for my legs and underarms next summer.  </li>
            <li> Yet, it was not messy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  using this product about 3 times and notice the hair that does grow back, is much thinner.</li>
            <li> I have used the wax stripes before,The nads natural hair removal gel</li>
            <li> You have so much wax but the other stuff isn&#x27;t really quality type.</li>
            <li> Although it is a really good product and it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as others that I have tried in the past, it&#x27;s hard not to messed up with it</li>
            <li> The product does takes a long time to get the wax to the right consistency, however, it does what the makers say- remove thick hair smoothly.</li>
            <li> It is a million times better than those ridiculous wax strips that Walgreens and CVS advertise.</li>
            <li> It was easier to clean up than other brands of wax - especially sugar based waxes.  </li>
            <li> , I apply a thin, quarter sized amount at a time, let it cool for 20-30 seconds, pull skin taught and then COMMIT to pulling it off, in the right direction.</li>
            <li> I used regular paper strips made for waxing and it works only if the wax is at a certain temperature.</li>
            <li> This was my first time doing a Brazilian wax and my first time using hard wax.</li>
            <li> It works as expected although it&#x27;s pretty painful and causes a great deal of apprehension.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I am sooo glad I did!</li>
            <li> Okay next time I didn&#x27;t, still missed so many hairs, so annoying I would not waste my money or time with this product again.</li>
            <li> i tried out a couple of strips on my legs to see how it worked first, but i can&#x27;t imagine going straight to my private area with all the stringy waxy mess!</li>
            <li> but OMG waxing is sooo painful, lol.</li>
            <li> I accidently put too much on at once and left it on too long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several professional Brazilian waxes done</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, ripping this wax off BARELY hurts.</li>
            <li> It will break off midway through ripping if it gets too cool, too thin, or if you don&#x27;t brace yourself and rip it off fast.  </li>
            <li> There were a few small patches I was able to do with only a little pain and those ended up being free of hair for about a month</li>
            <li> The first thought for this review is really the PAIN factor, it&#x27;s really unbearable, I don&#x27;t know if I was doing it wrong, but it did remove the hair on the area which I applied it on.</li>
            <li> Still, both require a certain amount of time before the nerves endings in the area give up screaming and settle down to a general howl.</li>
            <li> I am shocked at how fast and easy it really is to use.  </li>
            <li> recommend purchasing a sensitive skin soft-wax for after-use on (and ONLY) the upper bikini line.</li>
            <li> I spent the extra $40 for a wax pot and this stuff worked REALLY well.</li>
            <li> It is just the running back and forth to keep it soft enough to apply without burning yourself and you waste so much of it-I am not sure I will get 2 full uses out of 1 container.  </li>
            <li> I was having trouble with microwaving the wax because I did not want to make it too hot</li>
            <li> I wish it came with wider applicators instead of just popsicle sticks, but they are still workable since you don&#x27;t want to lay down too much wax when doing a brazilian anyway.  </li>
            <li> Just remember you can not do large strips, one inch in with and go from there, it took me a little getting use to.</li>
            <li> I notice that when I tried to cover a larger region of maybe 4inches or more... it got harder because it was wider and pain level was another big &amp;#34;ouchy&amp;#34; Then if i only did small areas of waxing, my fingers got sticky and plus the wax cooled down, so i would have to keep microwaving the wax.</li>
            <li> I got mine at Rite Aid, even though it is a bit more expensive than amazon, but at least I had it right</li>
            <li> I was super excited to try this stuff out but EXTREMELY disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It even cut my time in half because it got the really thin hairs that the old gel couldn&#x27;t get and some are super thin and really light (been waxing for over 15 years).  </li>
            <li> Although it is a bit messy, and quite painful, it leaves the targeted area smooth and hair free is long lasting.</li>
            <li> I usually get VERY irritated skin after waxing/shaving, but I used this and had no problems.</li>
            <li> Long story short, I had to use oil, scissors, a mirror and my mom to get the wax</li>
            <li> Very smooth, very few hairs left behind.</li>
            <li> I should have just paid a professional, this stuff is a mess</li>
            <li> I just made a complete mess when I used this.</li>
            <li> A recently purchased Nair one I tossed in the trash can after half an application as it left everything there and left me with sticky underarms</li>
            <li> Application was slightly messy, but nothing some old newspapers can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> I have very course hair that is thick</li>
            <li> Hard wax removes coarse hair, and it will not remove all hair on the bikini line (another method is tweezing, but I find using soft wax the day after using hard wax much easier).</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to other users.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t remove a SINGLE hair.</li>
            <li> have about half the container left</li>
            <li> By the time I could get even a little bit of it to melt, it solidified instantly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done bikini waxing using soft wax on myself before and have used hard wax on others (I&#x27;m a licensed esthetician)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You so have to heat it for about 3 times the amount specified on the package, but that ends up being just a few minutes, so it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> I will probably buy again because it worked-but will have to be careful when I do this.  </li>
            <li> After trying it a few different times on both sides I gave up and decided this product was garbage.  </li>
            <li> I have been using an electric shaver but the frequency of use is annoying and not as smooth as waxing as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> It goes on thick enough and sticky enough that when you pull on it, the hair comes up.  </li>
            <li> But PLEASE follow my advice: if you have not had a professional Brazilian done within the past 6 weeks or so, do not attempt to do one DIY!</li>
            <li> half a sec waiting for it to dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten several Brazilians at salons, and purchased this when the lady I usually go see ($20) went out of business.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t afford the $50 or $60 price tag at other places around town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought I would try something else, and I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll go back.  </li>
            <li> As with other waxes I&#x27;ve tried, you have to heat it longer than it says.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, no complaints.</li>
            <li> Resorted to other methods.</li>
            <li> I have used traditional waxes at home in the past, as well as gone to the salon.</li>
            <li> My first attempt was a bit of a fail.</li>
            <li> I am planning on investing in a small wax heater for my future waxing needs.</li>
            <li> Finally I resorted to trying hard wax.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this as an intro wax to see if you like hard wax before making a bigger investment.</li>
            <li> I used at least 3 different products before i decided to give both the no heat wax and the Brazilian wax a go.</li>
            <li> I even started peeling some skin down there afterward.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t ventured down south with it yet</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m talking about the \\&quot;inner bits\\&quot; if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> Then I used an epilator, but that wasn&#x27;t too clean and it was unbearably painful.</li>
            <li> I had sticky residue on my fingers that wouldn&#x27;t wash off with soap and water for about a half day afterwards.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also think it hurt less than surgi wax.  </li>
            <li> The wax would not only stick to my hair but also my skin and was much too painful to remove in some areas.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what my microwave wattage is, but I had to microwave it about 2 min 30 sec.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Second time around I decided to use a little ice to harden the wax a bit</li>
            <li> its a little messy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get the wax on to be thick enough to rip it off.</li>
            <li> a few pointers:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It is quite messy, and I don&#x27;t know where the mango and peach scent is, but I don&#x27;t smell it.</li>
            <li> After trying to apply twice and only getting a thin layer I gave up.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it has almost completely turned me off of bikini waxing.</li>
            <li> I def recommend taking a few advils before you start, so as you stave off the pain</li>
            <li> Then i applied petrolium jelly on it and it heeled up after a few days.</li>
            <li> You only need a thin layer.</li>
            <li> and I was left patchy, red and very very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s painful at first time, but</li>
            <li> sometimes its a little hard to rip off though.</li>
            <li> and then once you do that, you have very little time to get it on you before it stiffens up in mid-air.</li>
            <li> The sticks they provide are small Popsicle sticks.</li>
            <li> Way to small for this.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even bother; it&#x27;s a waste!</li>
            <li> I also have used an epillator and I have to say that having the hair ripped out in chucks is &amp;#34;easier&amp;#34; than having it yanked out in swipes of a small machine.</li>
            <li> I also used a small, 1&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> spatula to apply as opposed to the Popsicle sticks which are just too small.</li>
            <li> so I put a small bowl of water in there with it</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never waxed before it could be very messy and time consuming.</li>
            <li> As the headline notes, it does the trick but is very messy.</li>
            <li> but then I realized I did it wrong and let it harden too long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: after using this a few times, I must agree with other reviewers that it does get quite annoying running to the microwave several times for one job.</li>
            <li> The wax takes forever to harden, and once it does, it leaves half the hair behind.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so hard to melt in the microwave.</li>
            <li> If you do manage to keep some of the hard wax intact, it just doesn&#x27;t remove the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s then plenty hard to get a grip on.  </li>
            <li> Not too sticky and does not get too hard.</li>
            <li> It work well for thick hairs too.</li>
            <li> you know how bad that part is, and this wax barely made me flinch.</li>
            <li> And if you don&#x27;t pull it off in the 30-60 second window suggested then the wax gets hard and becomes really painful to remove.</li>
            <li> The scent is almost undetectable, which I found a little disappointing.  </li>
            <li> With something this painful I expected it to work.</li>
            <li> I was so tired of spending the money to get this done that I decided to give it a go on doing it myself.</li>
            <li> The stickers are the worse part.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something new, and it turned out to be horrible.</li>
            <li> tried a few other waxes  that where horrible!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used such a horrible product before, though.</li>
            <li> WRONG.</li>
            <li> Anymore, and I guarantee you will be sad... and sore.</li>
            <li> and the mess is annoying!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t try to go too crazy</li>
            <li> The pain is not that bad comparig to Nad cold wax strips.</li>
            <li> I thought this wax was very difficult to use, I could not get the end to curl up.</li>
            <li> This hurts SO BAD.</li>
            <li> But it wasnt as bad as I thought.</li>
            <li> After the numbness kicks in its not so bad.</li>
            <li> let the wax set then pull like it said and &amp;#34;OUCH.&amp;#34; I was bad in pain level.</li>
            <li> What I found was it was too painful and sticky to remove the wax no matter what I tried.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Worthless.</li>
            <li> anyway - very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed</li>
            <li> Terrible product!</li>
            <li> but this was horrible!</li>
            <li> IT IS SO PAINFUL!!!</li>
            <li> in a word, this product is awful!</li>
            <li> It was horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> First of all - OMG the smel, is horrrrrrrrible. Dint wrk well for my bikini area. But worked fine for d legs</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time and it works really well. It does not come with any practical paper strips so you would have to order it separately. I used regular paper strips made for waxing and it works only if the wax is at a certain temperature. It work well for thick hairs too. I actually ended up not using any strips. If you have a pretty decent layer of wax you could actually just pull the wax off with your fingers.</li>
            <li> Terrible product! Took too long &amp; barely removed any hair. With something this painful I expected it to work.</li>
            <li> Great product.  A lot cheaper than going to the spa.  Don&#x27;t expect there to be no pain, but it&#x27;s all worth it.</li>
            <li> Ive been getting my legs waxed for the last 12 years and a Brazilian for the last 10years. I was so tired of spending the money to get this done that I decided to give it a go on doing it myself. I used at least 3 different products before i decided to give both the no heat wax and the Brazilian wax a go. Loved them both (and have been using them now for 2years). I decided to write this review to let people know that waxing yourself is Not going to be easy until you try it a couple of times and still its not going to be as easy as having someone else wax you. The best advise that i can give anyone is don&#x27;t give up if the first time doesn&#x27;t work but try it again and find a position that is comfortable for you but also allows you to see whats going on.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re into pain, buy this!!!    I followed all the directions to a \\&quot;T\\&quot; but this was horrible! I&#x27;ve had several professional Brazilian waxes done so I figured an at home treatment would hurt but this product just stuck to me and I had to scrape it off.  It might work if they sold the cloth strips with it so it wouldn&#x27;t crumble when trying to peel off but I&#x27;m not gonna find out! Otherwise this stuff is a joke.</li>
            <li> Lol, be careful using this one!  Its no joke!  I&#x27;m used to using the natural wax with the cloth strips, so when I first used this one, which does not use cloth strips, it was a surprise when I removed the first strip.  It works great and I suggest using it in smaller applications.</li>
            <li> This hurts SO BAD. I wont be using it more than once without lidocaine cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of waxes, and I go to the salon on a regular basis. I&#x27;ve never used such a horrible product before, though. The wax takes forever to harden, and once it does, it leaves half the hair behind. Not to mention, this wax drips and drizzles everywhere. I just ordered a different product that I&#x27;ve used before, and I am throwing the rest of this product away. I am so disappointed. I wanted to try something new, and it turned out to be horrible.</li>
            <li> After trying innumerous bikini waxes, I decided to order this one as a last resort. Needless to say, I am sooo glad I did! The wax dries quickly and removes hair better than any other wax I have ever tried. It is a million times better than those ridiculous wax strips that Walgreens and CVS advertise. I have had great results with this product and would recommend it to absolutely anyone.</li>
            <li> Works great for me! Its probably only enough for the bikini area! I wish it was more in the container. I will love to use it all over. The smell is like burning plastic. The pain is not that bad comparig to Nad cold wax strips. Four stars because it should be more in the container.</li>
            <li> This product works much better than any other at-home waxing product that I have tried. You so have to heat it for about 3 times the amount specified on the package, but that ends up being just a few minutes, so it&#x27;s not a big deal. The one downside is the smell. It&#x27;s supposed to smell fruity, but it smells more like plastic than any real fruit or perfume.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Ive never done any waxing before on my own or a salon. I decided to try this one and I think I made good choice.&lt;br /&gt;Im not going to lie, it hurt...A Lot. But it wasnt as bad as I thought. It was really easy to get the wax correct temp in microwave. It applied easily. I didnt get completely finished and wax started to get to cool to use but I decided to stop for first day.&lt;br /&gt;I have about half the container left and I think it should easily reheat to wax again.&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a great product and definitely worth a try to save a lot of money from salon.&lt;br /&gt;My technique was not the best but I think it will get a lot better and quicker with time. I also recommend watching a youtube video if you&#x27;ve never done this that helped me.</li>
            <li> The first thought for this review is really the PAIN factor, it&#x27;s really unbearable, I don&#x27;t know if I was doing it wrong, but it did remove the hair on the area which I applied it on. To be honest, I&#x27;ve only used it that one time, because aside from the pain, it&#x27;s also extremely messy to use on my own, it gets all over the place, my fingers, also be advised that if you&#x27;re wearing nail polish, you&#x27;ll need to remove them afterwards if you accidentally gets it on your hands/fingers/nails because no matter how you scrubbed, it just kind of bind with my nail polish and I had to re-do them which is a total bummer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten several Brazilians at salons, and purchased this when the lady I usually go see ($20) went out of business. I just can&#x27;t afford the $50 or $60 price tag at other places around town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it once, but I was pretty pleased with the product. Most of the problems were due to me just being messy and inexperienced, but I think the more frequently I do this, the more streamlined the whole process will become. I loved not having to mess with strips, and the was was very effective at removing bikini line hair. (Note: I did *not* do a Brazilian on myself. Just the line.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a few pointers:&lt;br /&gt;- Make sure you have baby oil. I had sticky residue on my fingers that wouldn&#x27;t wash off with soap and water for about a half day afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;- Consider wearing gloves to prevent your fingers from getting too sticky to function&lt;br /&gt;- Apply some Bacitracin ointment afterwards. I usually get VERY irritated skin after waxing/shaving, but I used this and had no problems.</li>
            <li> I have been using the surgi wax brazilian kit off and on for a couple of years. I thought I would try something else, and I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll go back.  As with other waxes I&#x27;ve tried, you have to heat it longer than it says.  I feel like it held the hair much better than other waxes and came off cleaner.  I also think it hurt less than surgi wax.  The scent isn&#x27;t nearly as strong as I thought it would be...but who needs good smelling wax? I would reccomend this!</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you know how to wax properly. I was licensed so this wasn&#x27;t much of a challenge for me. If you&#x27;ve never waxed before it could be very messy and time consuming. If you follow the directions and put down an old sheet (even for the experienced)with practice it works great and goes a long way. Just remember you can not do large strips, one inch in with and go from there, it took me a little getting use to. If you master the technique its worth the money</li>
            <li> This was my first time doing a Brazilian wax and my first time using hard wax. I used to use shaving cream and razors, but it irritated my skin and made it itchy. Then I used an epilator, but that wasn&#x27;t too clean and it was unbearably painful. Finally I resorted to trying hard wax. I first purchased this one based on some youtube reviews and several of them recommended this. I got mine at Rite Aid, even though it is a bit more expensive than amazon, but at least I had it right away.&lt;br /&gt;After researching a whole lot on the whole process and reading the instructions, I went on ahead! BUT! IT IS SO PAINFUL!!! It is my first time and I know first times usually are more painful, then as the root grows weaker, waxing is easy, but sometimes it wouldn&#x27;t rip clean and would end up in clumps and I would end up tweezing the hair under the piece of wax to free myself from pain. Pulling downward was a lot better than upward, but many people recommend going up against the direction of the hair. Sometimes it would come clean, sometimes there would be several pieces of hair still left, and I would just tweeze them out. It is quite messy, and I don&#x27;t know where the mango and peach scent is, but I don&#x27;t smell it. It just smells like plastic with a hint of something else. I used a total of 4 hours to just wax my face, armpits, and bikini area. I really hope it gets shorter when I&#x27;m more experienced. It doesn&#x27;t seem to grab onto short pieces of hair too well though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit after using product twice:&lt;br /&gt;After using this twice, I can say that this is a nice product. I was more skilled at using it after two times and the hair is thinner and easier and not painful to wax off now. Just remember to exfoliate! Other than that, no complaints.</li>
            <li> As the headline notes, it does the trick but is very messy. Also took awhile to get all the hairs. I think I&#x27;ll stick with salon waxing in the future - especially if you have a reasonably-priced local waxer.</li>
            <li> in a word, this product is awful! it took forever to get the thing at just the right consistency. and then once you do that, you have very little time to get it on you before it stiffens up in mid-air. and the mess is annoying! i tried out a couple of strips on my legs to see how it worked first, but i can&#x27;t imagine going straight to my private area with all the stringy waxy mess! don&#x27;t know how others managed it, but it&#x27;s not for me. i like the original NAD&#x27;s product, tho tried this one since you didn&#x27;t need backing strips. anyway - very disappointed. i&#x27;ll just keep going to my wax lady.</li>
            <li> its a good product, it worked. make sure you go in the direction of the hairs for it to work perfectly.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than 5 times.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with this.&lt;br /&gt;It removes my hair very clear.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s painful at first time, but when it gets used to it doesn&#x27;t feel that much pain like first time.</li>
            <li> I loved the green Nads that came off with water but cannot seem to find it. So I tried this. The sticks they provide are small Popsicle sticks. Way to small for this. It&#x27;s hard to get the wax on to be thick enough to rip it off. After trying to apply twice and only getting a thin layer I gave up. Went out and bought Sally Hansen lavender wax. Worked great.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so hard to melt in the microwave. Don&#x27;t even bother; it&#x27;s a waste!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a stripless wax before this one so I can&#x27;t compare it to others, but I like this wax.  It takes a little while to get your technique down, but when you do, it&#x27;s pretty easy to spread it on and rip it off cleanly.  Compared to using a sugar wax on my bikini area, it leaves fewer ingrown hairs and takes the hair off more easily, and I don&#x27;t think it hurts as much.  It will break off midway through ripping if it gets too cool, too thin, or if you don&#x27;t brace yourself and rip it off fast.  The scent is almost undetectable, which I found a little disappointing.  I also dislike having to reheat the wax while waxing but that is just the nature of the product.  It would probably be a good product to try if you don&#x27;t have a wax warmer and want to try a hard wax.  I wish it came with wider applicators instead of just popsicle sticks, but they are still workable since you don&#x27;t want to lay down too much wax when doing a brazilian anyway.  Finally, I think this item is a bit overpriced considering you can only get one or two waxes out of it.</li>
            <li> Love it u have to get it just right but when you do it works perfect. Worth the buy online or in the store if you can find it.</li>
            <li> This was the first wax that I tried. Although I was satisfied the first time around, I decided to try other products before returning to this one. I tried Sally Hanson, Avon, and even CVS store branded wax (dear god was that a mistake). I can honestly say that out of all of the ones I&#x27;ve tried, nads was the best experience. One of the best things I like about nads is that it always remains somewhat pliable; other brands (Sally Hansen) of hardwax become completely solid too quickly (this is really bad for newbies; they tend to take longer in between strips). As such, Nads is great for newbies as well as experienced home waxers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sidenote:&lt;br /&gt;I recommend purchasing a sensitive skin soft-wax for after-use on (and ONLY) the upper bikini line. Hard wax removes coarse hair, and it will not remove all hair on the bikini line (another method is tweezing, but I find using soft wax the day after using hard wax much easier).</li>
            <li> Sure beats traditional wax that gets burning hot. This wax is simple, you just microwave and your good to go, no dumb heating pot is necessary or waxing strips, so this makes it all the more simple. Great product Nad&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING! I used to get waxed at a salon for $30. The lady always did a great job, but I moved. Resorted to other methods. Finally built up the courage to try waxing myself and I am so glad I did! The wax takes longer to melt than it says in the instructions (I think mine took about three minutes). Application was slightly messy, but nothing some old newspapers can&#x27;t fix. Believe it or not, ripping this wax off BARELY hurts. And I&#x27;m talking about the \\&quot;inner bits\\&quot; if you know what I mean. If you&#x27;ve ever been waxed with strips you know how bad that part is, and this wax barely made me flinch. The only thing I wish was that it came with more sticks (they give you two) and that the wax stayed at the proper temp longer. All in all I would definitely recommend this if you are interested in DIY waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: after using this a few times, I must agree with other reviewers that it does get quite annoying running to the microwave several times for one job. I&#x27;d recommend this as an intro wax to see if you like hard wax before making a bigger investment. I will definitely be purchasing a warmer.</li>
            <li> This wax works great for DIY upper lips, brows and other small areas. Microwavable, easy to apply and remove, no strips needed, no mess creator. I love the fact that even in the morning ,when running out of time to get ready, if I find some shoots in the upper lips, I can get rid of them in approx 5 minutes (2 min heating + 1 min applying + half a sec waiting for it to dry +and removing takes another minute). This explains the ease of using it, and why it makes me re-buy it each time :)</li>
            <li> good product!!! Thanks</li>
            <li> This stuff gets the job done...if you follow the directions exactly. I accidently put too much on at once and left it on too long and I ended up spending an hour trying to get the wax off with scissors, vasaline, and pain. There were a few small patches I was able to do with only a little pain and those ended up being free of hair for about a month and that is why I am giving this product 2 starts instead of 1. But trying to do the entire area with this was a huge hassle and literal pain that took up more than an hour of my day to produce hardly any results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten a professional Brazilian a couple times before and I honestly think spending the $50 to have a professional get it done perfectly in 15 minutes is 100% worth it and spending $7 buying a do-it-yourself kit is 0% worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the original Nad&#x27;s gel since it came out, literally.  I went to buy my refill like normal and to my horror, no one carries it anymore; only available online, if that.  So, I ventured out and bought this today and after one use, I am sold.  I am shocked at how fast and easy it really is to use.  It even cut my time in half because it got the really thin hairs that the old gel couldn&#x27;t get and some are super thin and really light (been waxing for over 15 years).  I no longer need my tweezers. YAY!  As for the smell, it in no way smells like mango or has a fruity odor like the original.  This smells like wax.  I am so unbelievably happy that I found something that actually worked! I only wish they had a bigger size.</li>
            <li> I have used traditional waxes at home in the past, as well as gone to the salon. By saying this product doesn&#x27;t work, is an understatement. I think there is another comment somewhere that says it breaks off before you can remove any hair, and that pretty much sums it up. If you do manage to keep some of the hard wax intact, it just doesn&#x27;t remove the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could give this a zero star, I would.</li>
            <li> I would have chosen &amp;#34;I love it&amp;#34; but who really &amp;#34;loves&amp;#34; having the hair in your privates ripped out by lukewarm wax? This product works as described and I have been able to modify my &amp;#34;nether hair&amp;#34; to my satisfaction several times with the amount in the package. I also have used an epillator and I have to say that having the hair ripped out in chucks is &amp;#34;easier&amp;#34; than having it yanked out in swipes of a small machine. Still, both require a certain amount of time before the nerves endings in the area give up screaming and settle down to a general howl. After the numbness kicks in its not so bad. I would say that my partner and I both enjoy the results, but in all honestly the smoothness is something _I_ enjoy, for heightening sensitivity of that area.</li>
            <li> I had done a lot of research before trying my first at home bikini wax. Having heard wonderful things, I gave this product a try...Unfortunately it has almost completely turned me off of bikini waxing. For some reason, the wax seemed to be almost too sticky. I tried heating it for longer and shorter periods of time, letting it set longer (the instructions recommend 30 seconds and I found myself waiting much longer), using powder, etc. What I found was it was too painful and sticky to remove the wax no matter what I tried. The wax would not only stick to my hair but also my skin and was much too painful to remove in some areas. In others, the pain level was more than okay, but the wax would only grab on to a few hairs and I was left patchy, red and very very uncomfortable. I was determined to like it, but gave it a go twice and found myself in the same predicament both times. I am very disappointed</li>
            <li> In theory it may work great, but I&#x27;ll stick with the professionals for waxing. I could not seem to make it work as directed.</li>
            <li> Buying more, will keep on hand</li>
            <li> I have never had a Brazilian wax because I don&#x27;t feel comfortable baring myself to strangers. I have been using an electric shaver but the frequency of use is annoying and not as smooth as waxing as far as I can tell. I read all the reviews/suggestions. I spent the extra $40 for a wax pot and this stuff worked REALLY well. Of course, I couldn&#x27;t manage the very sensitive areas because it hurts! And if you don&#x27;t pull it off in the 30-60 second window suggested then the wax gets hard and becomes really painful to remove. I am going to try the pre-wax numbing cream next time and I hope I can do a more thorough job. Very pleased with the results though.  Very smooth, very few hairs left behind. Do your research-follow the per and post wax directions you find on-line!</li>
            <li> I should have just paid a professional, this stuff is a mess</li>
            <li> I have used many other hot waxes before and I love this one! A recently purchased Nair one I tossed in the trash can after half an application as it left everything there and left me with sticky underarms but this Nads one is fantastic. Its slightly more expensive but so worth the convenience compared to purchasing 2 or 3 others that all suck!</li>
            <li> My first use of this product was great! However, when I used it the second time I feel as if the &amp;#34;stickiness&amp;#34; of the wax reduced. It wasn&#x27;t picking up all the hair. The wax thickens pretty quickly which makes application more difficult because it&#x27;s a goopy consistency instead of a smooth liquid. I&#x27;m thinking I need to heat it up a lot more then wait for it cool down. I heat it in 1 minute increments. Wax a quarter coin size portion at a time is a tip I learned!</li>
            <li> I have gotten professional bikini waxes before, but decided to try it at home because of the cost. My first attempt was a bit of a fail. I thought the wax was too sticky to grab a hold of so I couldn&#x27;t get a good pull.&lt;br /&gt;Second time around I decided to use a little ice to harden the wax a bit and it really helped!! Just hold the ice on the wax you&#x27;ve applied for about 5 seconds and it&#x27;s then plenty hard to get a grip on.  I also used a small, 1&amp;#34; spatula to apply as opposed to the Popsicle sticks which are just too small. The spatula puts on a wider strip of wax and really speeds up the time it takes!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I was super excited to try this stuff out but EXTREMELY disappointed.  I don&#x27;t know how they get away with selling it! First of all, I don&#x27;t think this stuff would melt on the surface of the Sun, let alone my microwave.  I nuked it for almost 6 straight minutes and it was still solid! By the time I could get even a little bit of it to melt, it solidified instantly. Didn&#x27;t remove a SINGLE hair. Worthless.</li>
            <li> this product does not work well, the nads wax is just too soft. I have very course hair that is thick and it just did not cure fast enough and wasnt strong enough to get my hair pulled from the root. I would suggest using the Gigi brazilian wax, I like that one MUCH better</li>
            <li> This is my second reorder on this product.  It does not smell like peaches, more like chemicals but if you can get past that, it does work pretty nicely.  The first time I used it, it took me an hr to find the right rhythm, thereafter was much easier.  I def recommend taking a few advils before you start, so as you stave off the pain and you&#x27;ll probably need to reheat as you&#x27;re going.  I did purchase separate wooden spatulas too because they only give you 2.  I was able to get 3 uses out of 1 kit at $10, that&#x27;s $3.33 each wax, compared to the $75 waxes (tip included) I was getting at the salon, what a HUGE saving!  I will be doing all of my own waxes from now on.  I would definitely recommend this to other users.</li>
            <li> Works great. Fast &amp; easy</li>
            <li> I have waxed at home many times prior to trying this product. I used surgi wax in the past and it works great for brazillian waxing. But i ran out and ulta did not have it in stock, so decided to try this instead. The wax is very sticky and messy. It left.wax on my skin and redness and irritation. I even started peeling some skin down there afterward. I had to use baby oil to remofe the wax and exfoliate the peeling off. Then i applied petrolium jelly on it and it heeled up after a few days. Never will i use this brand again!</li>
            <li> I thought this wax was very difficult to use, I could not get the end to curl up. I think backing strips would be helpful. I just made a complete mess when I used this. Also the area I was able to wax broke out a few days after I waxed, even though I exfoliated a day before use.</li>
            <li> Been using for last 2 years. At first, trick was to peel off when it had cooled down to just the right temp. Tried it on my legs first. Then ended up waxing them with it too. I use it everywhere, ie legs, bikini, underarms, etc.</li>
            <li> I have worked with many waxes but I could not get a good one for my underarms and this one did the trick instantly. I am so excited to have it around. Haven&#x27;t ventured down south with it yet but I&#x27;m sure it will work just as well. I absolutely recommend this product 100%.</li>
            <li> Followed the instructions. I had to reheat the bowl three times, I didn&#x27;t anticipate that. (Considering your doing a bikini or a Brazilian wax &amp; your microwave is in the kitchen and your bedroom is upstairs and I am married with children). I would probably boil water if I tried it again and sit it in there to reduce the reheating. Next, you should wear finger condoms or something because it took more than some oil to get the wax off. I decided I&#x27;m just going to go professional.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great! Just heat it in the microwave, apply it to the area and when it cools and hardens, rip it off! It does not stick too much to the skin so it removes fairly easily taking off all that stubborn hair with it.</li>
            <li> Love it. Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> These work amazingly. Definitely works, but hurts like a m.f.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, It only took three or four hairs. The stickers are the worse part. You have so much wax but the other stuff isn&#x27;t really quality type. I guess what I would advise for someone that&#x27;s looking for a wax kit to expect only the wax and you&#x27;ll have to buy all the tools separately. The wax smelled good.. Only good thing.</li>
            <li> This wax is good. Not too sticky and does not get too hard. Still not my ideal wax, but it will do.</li>
            <li> When I first put this product in the microwave I followed all the instructions but the microwave started to spark and it scared me. so I put a small bowl of water in there with it so the microwave would not freak out and the wax heated up just fine. For the second use I tried the same method to reheat it but the wax never melted again, it was almost like plastic.&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, the product worked well the first time but is not reusable. Yes it hurts like a mother but it&#x27;s worth it. I am planning on investing in a small wax heater for my future waxing needs.</li>
            <li> I have tried waxing my legs, underarms and bikini areas several different times over the last twenty years.  This is hands down the best quality wax I have found.  It goes on thick enough and sticky enough that when you pull on it, the hair comes up.  It just has a really good consistency for waxing.  It was easier to clean up than other brands of wax - especially sugar based waxes.  For clean up, this just needed to cool and it came right up.  The wax is a bright red color making it easy to see where it dripped or where you applied it.&lt;br /&gt;The directions said to heat for about 90 seconds for a full container.  I am not sure what my microwave wattage is, but I had to microwave it about 2 min 30 sec.  It is also important to make sure that the hair is about 1/4 inch long, and that if you are new to waxing you try doing really small inch long sections until you get the hang of it.  Be sure to read the directions, start with small areas, and hold the skin taut.  This cost a lot less than professional waxing, and was the best home kit I have found.  I very well may use this for my legs and underarms next summer.  The wax is good enough quality that I think it would work anywhere - that is why it is being marketed and packaged for one of the most difficult areas to wax.</li>
            <li> it does exactly what i says. its a little messy i suggest using a towel/cloth you wont use again. sometimes its a little hard to rip off though.</li>
            <li> Worked significantly better than I could have imagined</li>
            <li> The sender was great the product not so much. This product did not perform as effectively as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> *i bought this product for Brazilian waxing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I decided one day that I don&#x27;t want to pay anyone for my Brazilian waxes anymore and that it was simple enough to myself. WRONG. I&#x27;ve done bikini waxing using soft wax on myself before and have used hard wax on others (I&#x27;m a licensed esthetician)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all of my experience and training, I thought it wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal to try and do my own. It was horrible. Not only did it take forever (15min total with varying intervals) for the wax to heat to a consistency to be applied, but it wouldn&#x27;t go on smoothly. Then when I attempted to pull the wax, it broke off. Long story short, I had to use oil, scissors, a mirror and my mom to get the wax off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never again. I DO NOT recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a decent product that really delivers. But PLEASE follow my advice: if you have not had a professional Brazilian done within the past 6 weeks or so, do not attempt to do one DIY! I promise you, on a 1-10 scale it will be a pain of about 9 for your first wax, (or for a wax you get after shaving inbetween waxes) so get it done at a salon! Your very next wax (DIY or professionally) will be nothing compared to the previous wax and you&#x27;ll have a much more pleasant time waxing at home. I swear, it was like a 3/10. Don&#x27;t take any shaving breaks inbetween waxing, or else you&#x27;ve gone through all that pain for nothing - you have to keep waxing to weaken the follicle and it won&#x27;t hurt so damn much! You have to use it the right way though, I apply a thin, quarter sized amount at a time, let it cool for 20-30 seconds, pull skin taught and then COMMIT to pulling it off, in the right direction. Ain&#x27;t no big thang! Just keep in mind that if you use oil on your fingertips to keep wax from sticking, your waxing area is going to get greasy soon from touching it so much and may prevent the wax from adhering. I like the fruity scent and the color of the wax, can be a bit drippy, but it&#x27;s freakin melted wax, what do you expect? For $10 I&#x27;m extremely satisfied, totally going to keep self-waxing!</li>
            <li> Although it is a really good product and it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as others that I have tried in the past, it&#x27;s hard not to messed up with it and I had sticky pieces of wax everywhere (my hands, the bathroom floor, my bikini area...). I recommend some experience before using it</li>
            <li> It works as expected although it&#x27;s pretty painful and causes a great deal of apprehension. Maybe will work well for your legs, or a mans back, lol?</li>
            <li> The product does takes a long time to get the wax to the right consistency, however, it does what the makers say- remove thick hair smoothly. Although it is a bit messy, and quite painful, it leaves the targeted area smooth and hair free is long lasting.</li>
            <li> The best wax, but I do not like the smell. Smells good but too strong for me.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  Nearly pain free.  Will most likely buy this again when i need it.  This product appeals to me for not needing strips.</li>
            <li> Second time purchasing this item never will i stop lol. Love it soo much gets the job done!</li>
            <li> Love it. Works like how it&#x27;s suppose to and gets most of my hair off.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong-the product works!  It is just the running back and forth to keep it soft enough to apply without burning yourself and you waste so much of it-I am not sure I will get 2 full uses out of 1 container.  It was getting comical of undressing-doing a few strips-then rerobing, running to kitchen to nuke.  Run back because it started to cool-unrobe...REPEAT!  You get the picture..I will probably buy again because it worked-but will have to be careful when I do this.  Home alone would work better!!</li>
            <li> I was so surprised that you don&#x27;t need cloths to use this version!! Love that! Only thing is.....don&#x27;t try to go too crazy i.e. Brazilian...hurts too much on that sensitive area. Pay the pros to do that. It&#x27;s really only good for a nice bikini clean up on aisle 4. Anymore, and I guarantee you will be sad... and sore.</li>
            <li> So hard to find the microwaveable wax any more so was happy to be able to get it.  Works so much better than other types of wax.</li>
            <li> Everything listed came in my purchase. I was having trouble with microwaving the wax because I did not want to make it too hot or I be burn. So it took a couple of try&#x27;s to make the wax fit for my skin. I love the shapes that came a long with the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let the wax set then pull like it said and &amp;#34;OUCH.&amp;#34; I was bad in pain level. It remove most of the hair from the bikini region. I notice that when I tried to cover a larger region of maybe 4inches or more... it got harder because it was wider and pain level was another big &amp;#34;ouchy&amp;#34; Then if i only did small areas of waxing, my fingers got sticky and plus the wax cooled down, so i would have to keep microwaving the wax. What a hasel to look and feel my best lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to purchase Nad&#x27;s Brazilian Wax because I&#x27;ve purchase the Nads brand before and they work great...especially with out all the heating up. Plus, you can use the same wax strip over and over. It was so easy then. Yet, it was not messy. I think I prefer going back to the original Nad&#x27;s wax.</li>
            <li> awesome!! but OMG waxing is sooo painful, lol. but great product, works beautifully</li>
            <li> Nad&#x27;s Brazilian wax is the best. It doesn&#x27;t pull your skin, just your hair and i&#x27;m a big wimp when it comes to wax hair remover. I&#x27;ve  using this product about 3 times and notice the hair that does grow back, is much thinner. I heat it up in the microwave, then set the plastic pot of hot wax on a small plate, on top of my beverage warmer to keep it hot. This comes with a wood spatula(a popsicle stick works too), wax, and instructions.&lt;br /&gt;  Even tho it is bikini wax, i have used it on my upper lip, and it works wonderfully there also, with no red bumps, rash, or itching.</li>
            <li> smells good, real wax, does not irritate my skin, does not suffocate me compared to the gigi brazilian hard wax made in china, i dont trust products from china anymore, as much as i can avoid it, I WILL.. this wax is made in the AUSTRALIA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the whole jar didnt melted in 90 seconds, it takes about 7 minutes for the whole jar to melt, i have to do 2 minutes at a time, and pause for 2 minutes before i heat it again the 2nd time, 3rd and 4th for a minute, then i can start waxing, once it starts to thicken id put it back for 2 minutes and it melts pretty good, then use it again until it starts to thicken again, i keep doing this process until im done waxing.. will definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I was a bit scared  to try this because I had all ready tried a few other waxes  that where horrible! But I decided to order it and I am so glad I did! It is the best! Super easy to use, way better than the wax you have to use with strips! Buy this, read the instructions, and you won&#x27;t regret  it! :-)</li>
            <li> Was not as easy to rip off as strip hot wax. And it did not tear off in one piece.</li>
            <li> I have used the wax stripes before,The nads natural hair removal gel and i liked them but when I saw this it just seemed like it would be so much easier.  After trying it a few different times on both sides I gave up and decided this product was garbage.  It missed so many hairs. At first it would brake off but then I realized I did it wrong and let it harden too long. Okay next time I didn&#x27;t, still missed so many hairs, so annoying I would not waste my money or time with this product again. So glad it was only $13.</li>
            <li> This is the best wax I&#x27;ve ever used, but I wish more came in that little container! I would use this sparingly if you buy it. You only need a thin layer.</li>
