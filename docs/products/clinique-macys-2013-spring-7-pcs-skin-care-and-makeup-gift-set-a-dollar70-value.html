            <li>The variety of items was great and the bags are useful and cute as ever!</li>
            <li>It arrived very quickly, and she loved it.</li>
            <li>Chose it because I thought it was suitable for my skin type, and because he had a nude color lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;However came the violet color of lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;I can not use any of these products.&lt;br /&gt;Chris</li>
            <li>and since they are very light in color would end up with marks from pens, etc.  </li>
            <li>I love the products in this Clinique skin care set.</li>
            <li>This is a more cost-effective way for her to experiment with different shades to find what&#x27;s best for her</li>
            <li>What a fantastic bargain!</li>
            <li>Would recommend this with so many products.</li>
            <li>And the extender doesn&#x27;t work to get more to come out.</li>
            <li>wherever I go its in my bag!!!!It&#x60;my top one indication.</li>
            <li>I love this bag as well as the products inside of it.</li>
            <li>Because if sensitive skin I cannot use any kind of makeup except Clinque and this was a great deal.  </li>
            <li>The bags are okay</li>
            <li>i have sensitive skin, I love the products, the colors stayed true all day, the moisturizers are awesome, my skin feels so much better, my daughters love them also</li>
            <li>Very quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>will take its a joke or was free if you give it to them</li>
            <li>Bought it as a gift but ended up keeping it as it looked so cheap.</li>
            <li>the size of the samples are perfect and you can try them before you actually buy the real size.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I expected, I am very happy with this, thank you so much for such a great JOB!!</li>
            <li>Clinique is always worth it!</li>
            <li>so I am in for a fun evening!</li>
            <li>They are excellent products but a very small size</li>
            <li>Lipstick is very pretty on my AA lips.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price alone.</li>
            <li>The product is a great trial pack for my young teenage daughter.</li>
            <li>worth it&lt;</li>
            <li>Another reviewer was right.</li>
            <li>I love clinique products period its light and safe and very comfortable to wear it matches up to any expensive product</li>
            <li>I always liked Clinique mascara, but my order is almost dry.</li>
            <li>I got my teen started on Clinique skincare at the first sign of problem skin, and buying up these kits is a great way to get her products at basically the price I&#x27;d pay in the store, but then to get a few cool extras for myself!</li>
            <li>The two carrying cases are perfect for purses and for other needs - carrying medication or other makeup.</li>
            <li>The makeup bag was even a larger size than most.</li>
            <li>Nice little set of clinique stuff.</li>
            <li>I purchased it for the mascara, but I haven&#x27;t worn it much.  </li>
            <li>So much for getting the violet</li>
            <li>I love these little gifts that they give with purchase.  </li>
            <li>Always a great deal with Clinique.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li>They are just right for travel and to tuck into your purse for daily use.</li>
            <li>I always buy Clinique when they have their gift with purchase because it gives me new products to try.  </li>
            <li>Like a sample set to see if this is a brand you would be interested in purchasing again, yet affordable enough for gift giving.</li>
            <li>So many cosmetic gift bags have only one or two item you actually want, and the rest are their products you would not normally use;  </li>
            <li>A bunch of OLD samples -</li>
            <li>2 Make up bags, and all these Clinique products that I can use daily for AT LEAST 2 months, I would say that this is a well deserving product.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>It was everything I expected for a decent price.  </li>
            <li>I would order these great travelkits again, but disappointed with color.</li>

            <li> Sent it to my mom as a little thinking of you present.</li>
            <li> The lipstick is way too dark.</li>
            <li> Too dark for me.  </li>
            <li> Cheap and small cosmetic bag, ugly lipstick color,</li>
            <li> and i am super disappointed</li>
            <li> Lets say it takes 2-4 weeks to see improvement in your skin, well the portion sizes are too small-</li>
            <li> I ordered this product, however, I was never able to &amp;#34;choose&amp;#34; the color.  </li>
            <li> so small i cant believe how small these bottles are</li>
            <li> Not appropriate as a gift.</li>
            <li> items very small.  </li>
            <li> hopefully the mascara is black and not some random color as well.</li>
            <li> These products were not good for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I got the color \\&quot;shy\\&quot; which is not a good color on me with my skin tone.</li>
            <li> This was very small, I knew when I bought it that it wasn&#x27;t going to contain a lot of items, but it looked sad and small when I took it out of the box.</li>
            <li> Basically, this item is useless.</li>
            <li> Disappointing....</li>
            <li> Disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Highly disappointed when it&#x27;s advertised as  &amp;#34;Color Choice Violet or Nude&amp;#34;.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> EXCELENTE PRODUCTO,, LO UNICO MALO ES EL TAMAÑO.</li>
            <li> Really nice kit.  the size of the samples are perfect and you can try them before you actually buy the real size.</li>
            <li> I love clinique products period its light and safe and very comfortable to wear it matches up to any expensive product</li>
            <li> I love the products in this Clinique skin care set. They are all excellent products and reminded me why I used Clinique in the first place. The two carrying cases are perfect for purses and for other needs - carrying medication or other makeup. I really believe I got a great deal for the price!!</li>
            <li> 2 Make up bags, and all these Clinique products that I can use daily for AT LEAST 2 months, I would say that this is a well deserving product.</li>
            <li> Lipstick is very pretty on my AA lips. I purchased it for the mascara, but I haven&#x27;t worn it much.  Spring colors, but I can wear the lipstick anytime.  It&#x27;s worth the price alone. It serves the purpose. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I have used Clinique for several years.  I love these little gifts that they give with purchase.  They are just right for travel and to tuck into your purse for daily use.</li>
            <li> i wish the bottles were bigger than a sample size. Lets say it takes 2-4 weeks to see improvement in your skin, well the portion sizes are too small- you have a week tops before you run out of anti aging or spot correcter lotions and serums offered.</li>
            <li> The product is a great trial pack for my young teenage daughter. This is a more cost-effective way for her to experiment with different shades to find what&#x27;s best for her</li>
            <li> The description says repair wear laser serum is included but my gift set came without that. That was the one item I specifically wanted to try in this package and it&#x27;s not even included even though the description states it&#x27;s included and the picture shows it.</li>
            <li> What a fantastic bargain! I got my teen started on Clinique skincare at the first sign of problem skin, and buying up these kits is a great way to get her products at basically the price I&#x27;d pay in the store, but then to get a few cool extras for myself!</li>
            <li> They are excellent products but a very small size</li>
            <li> All your favorite products together in a beautiful makeup bag and it also has a smaller companion bag!  Really good price !</li>
            <li> Chose it because I thought it was suitable for my skin type, and because he had a nude color lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;However came the violet color of lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;I can not use any of these products.&lt;br /&gt;Chris</li>
            <li> Nice little set of clinique stuff. Like a sample set to see if this is a brand you would be interested in purchasing again, yet affordable enough for gift giving.</li>
            <li> My wife is a Clinic fan and loved it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product, however, I was never able to &amp;#34;choose&amp;#34; the color.  I thought maybe before checkout; nope. Maybe I would receice an email; nope. So much for getting the violet me wife wanted.  Instead, she got the nude color by default.  Highly disappointed when it&#x27;s advertised as  &amp;#34;Color Choice Violet or Nude&amp;#34;.  Who chooses, the employee? I know the consumer doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase.  I like the try the travel size of any product before I purchase it and these will definitely be on list.</li>
            <li> It was everything I expected for a decent price.  Would recommend this with so many products.</li>
            <li> Always a great deal with Clinique.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> I ordered this product a couple of months ago. Did not open the pouch until recently. Another reviewer was right. The lipstick is way too dark. It&#x27;s definitely not my color. The eyeliner tip broke after a couple of uses. And the extender doesn&#x27;t work to get more to come out. Basically, this item is useless. I always liked Clinique mascara, but my order is almost dry. I definitely don&#x27;t recommend this gift set if you&#x27;re not willing to get whatever they can send you.</li>
            <li> These products were not good for my skin.  I suggest you try this out in the store with store samples.</li>
            <li> so small i cant believe how small these bottles are&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not worth it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;people will take its a joke or was free if you give it to them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it was for my mum and i am super disappointed</li>
            <li> good product, good and excellent quality</li>
            <li> I&#x60;m a Clinique big fan and this kit is my number...wherever I go its in my bag!!!!It&#x60;my top one indication.</li>
            <li> Excellent service. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Awesome Value for fantastic products.definitelyordering more!!</li>
            <li> Best item yet. The colors of the eyeshadow were perfect for my eyes and the lip balm is great. The Happy cologne smells so good, everyone comments on it.</li>
            <li> a product that meets all my expectations</li>
            <li> This is a great collection of usable items.  So many cosmetic gift bags have only one or two item you actually want, and the rest are their products you would not normally use;  not so in this.  The makeup bag was even a larger size than most.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I expected, I am very happy with this, thank you so much for such a great JOB!!</li>
            <li> Not appropriate as a gift. Got dissappointed by the &amp;#34;too small&amp;#34; size of all the products and return policy is not favourable.</li>
            <li> I got this because I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Clinique.  I mostly wanted the lip color \\&quot;Bamboo Pink\\&quot;, unfortunately I didn&#x27;t get that color when I opened my package. I got the color \\&quot;shy\\&quot; which is not a good color on me with my skin tone. Disappointing....hopefully the mascara is black and not some random color as well.</li>
            <li> This was very small, I knew when I bought it that it wasn&#x27;t going to contain a lot of items, but it looked sad and small when I took it out of the box. I was planning on giving this as a gift, but felt like I needed to supplement something else.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.  Cheap and small cosmetic bag, ugly lipstick color, items very small.  Bought it as a gift but ended up keeping it as it looked so cheap.</li>
            <li> i have sensitive skin, I love the products, the colors stayed true all day, the moisturizers are awesome, my skin feels so much better, my daughters love them also</li>
            <li> How can you be selling this product when this was given away as a gift when you bought clinique products at Macy&#x27;s?  How can AMAZON allow this to happen?  This is a SHAME!!!</li>
            <li> I asked for the nude color and got violet.  Too dark for me.  I would order these great travelkits again, but disappointed with color.</li>
            <li> I love this bag as well as the products inside of it. Definitely a great purchase. Everyone compliments me on this bag.</li>
            <li> The variety of items was great and the bags are useful and cute as ever! Clinique is always worth it!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.  Very quick delivery.  However, product was damaged. Eyeshadow was busted which was a bummer.</li>
            <li> Because if sensitive skin I cannot use any kind of makeup except Clinque and this was a great deal.  I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Great gift, also very cheap.</li>
            <li> I always buy Clinique when they have their gift with purchase because it gives me new products to try.  I just got it an hour ag so I am in for a fun evening!</li>
            <li> A bunch of OLD samples -</li>
            <li> Purchased this for the products, not the bags.  The Clinique products are excellent.  The bags are okay but too big to be used in a purse and since they are very light in color would end up with marks from pens, etc.  Will probably give them away.</li>
            <li> kit maravilhoso,preço otimo</li>
            <li> Sent it to my mom as a little thinking of you present. It arrived very quickly, and she loved it. Especially loved the make up bags.</li>
