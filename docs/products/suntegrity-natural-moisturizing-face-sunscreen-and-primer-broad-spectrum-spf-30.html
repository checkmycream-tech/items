            <li>And I must say that I am a happy customer.  </li>
            <li>Great sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy I&#x27;ve discovered Suntegrity.</li>
            <li>It has also done a great job keeping me &amp;#34;not tanned&amp;#34; on my face.</li>
            <li>I was able to get rid of it with blotting papers, but I&#x27;m still searching for that perfect primer that stops all the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found it in EWG&#x27;s database and bought it after seeing the good reviews here.</li>
            <li>LOVED the smell of this.</li>
            <li>I bought this item because it received a good rating on the EWG&#x27;s sunscreen guide.</li>
            <li>It just feels good on my face, neck and décolleté.</li>
            <li>It sounded perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty happy with this.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this sunscreen!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>The Suntegrity Skincare with an SPF30 is my favorite sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li>This product makes me feel better when i wear it because is smells soooo good...</li>
            <li>It has a beautifully smooth texture and a wonderful light scent that absorbs evenly, leaving my skin feeling well nourished and protected.</li>
            <li>I came across Suntegrity on Amazon along with some others but decided to go with this one, as I liked the reviews.</li>
            <li>have to be honest, bc</li>
            <li>(indeed, I did not experience any reactions).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s moisturizing, which is nice if you want to skip a step (i.e., not apply a separate moisturizer before your sunscreen).</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have much of an oil problem, this could be perfect for you.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the antioxidant stuff they put in this cream will help improving my skin or not; but I am very happy with an all-natural, effective, and non-greasy sunscreen for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s an excellent product that I would recommend to anyone looking for good sun protection.</li>
            <li>This is the best one I&#x27;ve tried so far and will recommend this sunscreen to all my friends.</li>
            <li>It has a light citrus smell to it (which smells good and neutral).</li>
            <li>and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Uses combo of ZnO and TiO, not water resistant(suntegrity is not water resistant either), more hazardous according to ewg, not hydrating(could be a + for some people) and costs more.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased as it has a nice light tangerine scent, feels great on my skin and rubs in very well.</li>
            <li>It has a very light almost citrus scent, which I love.  </li>
            <li>(though I&#x27;ll probably keep an eye out for more budget-friendly equivalents)</li>
            <li>And i love the smell.  </li>
            <li>Finally, and best of all, it hasn&#x27;t caused me to breakout!    </li>
            <li>I love that it is non-greasy and does not feel \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; on my skin.</li>
            <li>Skin feels better after wearing it.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve mentioned it feels more chewy at application and feels more hydrating, although that stickiness goes away.</li>
            <li>With suntegrity, skin got way~ better after using this product.</li>
            <li>and I really love many things about it.  </li>
            <li>It smells amazing, goes on smooth and silky, and doesn&#x27;t make my face break out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m REALLY glad I did.  </li>
            <li>now I feel confident it will be a lifetime.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it smells.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simply the best!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT....</li>
            <li>I am a runner and it does not drip into my eyes during exercise, which I love.  </li>
            <li>Many of my fellow runners refuse to put sunblock on their foreheads because their eyes end up burning.  </li>
            <li>I just ordered more because I don&#x27;t want to run out.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks smooth and glowing, and it smells citrus-y!  </li>
            <li>If money were no object, I would use this all the time, but mostly I use Alba Botanica sunblock for the face.</li>
            <li>Second, it smells great - a nice, light and refreshing citrus-y smell.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s effective, evens out my fair skin, doesn&#x27;t break me out, moisturizes without becoming greasy, and the ingredients are safe enough to use during pregnancy &amp; breastfeeding.  </li>
            <li>Non comedonic, oil free and acne and rosascia gets better.</li>
            <li>Received a free sample after winning a contest, but as soon as I started using it, I went to the website and purchased the body one as well.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and the way it goes on smoothly</li>
            <li>This is a great natural sunscreen if you&#x27;re outdoors a lot of the time.</li>
            <li>and I used to think they worked fine until I tried Suntegrity.</li>
            <li>Blue lizard face is actually pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>My aunt and grandmother had melanoma and I go to great lengths to protect my skin with only the finest products.</li>
            <li>Fourth, it feels great going on your skin.</li>
            <li>It is light.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly without looking chalky and stays on throughout my workouts.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin that&#x27;s prone to breakouts, and this sunscreen was fantastic.</li>
            <li>company needs to come up with a fragrance free version.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible in a healthy sunscreen, so it&#x27;s about as good as it&#x27;s going to get,</li>
            <li>the most natural, yet still effective ingredients</li>
            <li>When it comes to protection from the sun and skin cancer, the investment is worth it!</li>
            <li>There are other brands out there that claim a \\&quot;face and body\\&quot; product, but this is superior to all of them!.</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the perfect everyday sunscreen, but it works well under makeup regardless!</li>
            <li>I was thus excited to receive a sample of this as a freebie in a box with an online order -- sunscreen, moisturizer, and primer in one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Suntegrity product not being water resistant can be a good thing since you can just wash it off with daily cleanser at the end of the day without using oil-based cleanser to remove water</li>
            <li>Love the gentle orange creamsicle scent as well.</li>
            <li>I already have some kind of dry eye syndrome which gets better with allergy med and eyedrop.</li>
            <li>I like the container and how it dispenses, and the sunscreen itself is nicely creamy and easy to rub in (unlike some that require a lot of massaging to eliminate the white cream appearance).  </li>
            <li>At first application I used way too much---so it felt greasy and the citrus scent was annoyingly strong.</li>
            <li>When I found out that the Skin Deep Cosmetics Database had rated this product so positively, it made me even more confident to use it!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this sunscreen that carries with it such a beautiful message.</li>
            <li>Most natural sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried are really greasy or don&#x27;t rub in very well, plus they really don&#x27;t smell all that great.</li>
            <li>I use Clinique mild cleanser and that didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>I do however make sure I use an oil make-up remover, and exfoliate regularly to make sure I get all of it off in the evening.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Scent is mild and not intoxicating</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d had high hopes for a quality sunblock that would leave a MATTE finish for smooth, easy makeup application afterward.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m sure most other people will be fine.</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is the packaging - a very interesting and uniquely-functioning and shaped bottle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Burnout face spf 32 applied very light, non-greasy, and non sticky at the time of application with great feeling but left somewhat dry feeling as if skin is being pulled.</li>
            <li>I quickly went on the market and started researching a good product that was as natural as possible and cruelty free.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely fantastic and a must have for anyone who wants to protect their skin from the sun.    </li>
            <li>My 7 and 8 year old kids love this stuff too</li>
            <li>(Dior, Chanel, FRESH, and so on).  </li>
            <li>Also, I have a highly sensitive sense of smell and love the scent.</li>
            <li>I just wish it absorbed quicker.</li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone, especially those who prefer their products vegan and cruelty free : )</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it for the quality of the product and my peace of mind.</li>
            <li>Make sure you re-apply frequently.</li>
            <li>The price was well worth the investment.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s a natural product but would not buy it again.</li>
            <li>Quality product, I&#x27;ve gone through most of the SPF 30 natural and organic moisturizers on the market</li>
            <li>As well, in the evening after work, I am adamant about washing my face and exfoliating, making sure my skin is cleared of all residue.</li>
            <li>When it comes to my face, I only use high quality, good ingredients and Suntegrity</li>
            <li>I like the way it dispenses, just the right amount, so I am never wasting it.  </li>
            <li>As a foundation primer, I&#x27;d say it was above average but not the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>However, if the container was clear or there was some mechanism for telling how much was left in the package, then I would be extremely happy and wholeheartedly give it that 5 rating.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t overpowering, but it smelled kind of like citrus-flavoured candies, i.e. sweeter and more subtle than fresh</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to smells, it has a strong citrus scent.  </li>
            <li>But when I used lesser amount the second time, the result was great.</li>
            <li>As with many mineral sunscreens, it did not absorb perfectly into the skin but left a slight white layer on my face.</li>
            <li>Shiseido urban would be good only if someone wants lighter product that is non-comedonic and light to feeling.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite facial sunblock yet:  </li>
            <li>I now use a light-coverage foundation instead of a medium-coverage one - my skin has improved that much!</li>
            <li>The product was like marshmallow- kinda gooey and sticky at first.</li>
            <li>Suntegrity has a different texture and feels more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Shiseido urban sunscreen doesn&#x27;t seem to have anything better.</li>
            <li>So I resorted to using body wash on my face first to remove it, then using my face wash.  </li>
            <li>I wear this sunscreen daily under my makeup, and I love it.</li>
            <li>Yes, he did survive but I am checked twice a year to make sure I do not suffer from the same type of cancer.</li>
            <li>As a redhead  who spent the majority of my young adulthood basking in the sun for that perfect tan, I have suffered in my later years with pre-cancerous moles removed from my face, neck &amp; chest.</li>
            <li>It made any flakiness even more obvious.</li>
            <li>I was encouraged after reading reviews that this was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I love it but the big container is pretty wasteful.</li>
            <li>It stays put and it helps that it is chemical free and natural.</li>
            <li>The last bonus is that this product has encouraged a healthy skin habit: using sunscreen daily, even when it&#x27;s cloudy out :)</li>
            <li>The minerals BLOCK the sun and harmful rays, while, the chemical sunscreens break them down...which can in turn be MORE harmful than the actual sun.</li>
            <li>I also used it on my arms, where it seemed to work pretty well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The strength of this product is in the fact that it can replace so many different products (sunscreen, moisturizer, primer).</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and soaks in more quickly than other natural products I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I tried to love this because it makes EWG&#x27;s safe sunscreen list, but it is just not suitable for use under makeup.</li>
            <li>That one has better UVB coverage(higher spf), similar UVB coverage, and very water resistant.</li>
            <li>I live in a sunny and humid climate and have been searching forever for an effective sunblock that I&#x27;m not sensitive to.</li>
            <li>All reviews were positive and the mission of the company resonated with me(i.e.</li>
            <li>so Suntegrity is less hazardous according to ewg.</li>
            <li>It actually goes on pretty matte and has a light citrus scent.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product before it changed its name (directly through their site using a coupon from Lucky Magazine) and had already noticed the \\&quot;primer\\&quot; feature.  </li>
            <li>(bc any less, it wouldn&#x27;t be an effective block).</li>
            <li>and it certainly does the job.  </li>
            <li>This applies very very white but gets absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying a lot of sunscreens from the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s list of recommended sunscreens ([ ... ] ), and have been having a hard time finding a good face moisturizer that I&#x27;d wear every day.  </li>
            <li>But the sticky feeling goes away very soon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only $17 for 5oz of oil free and moisturizing sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin very moisturized yet not sticky or greasy at all.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li>It was much better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>It stays tacky and sticky the whole time and never seems to absorb into my skin.  </li>
            <li>It feels very moisturizing yet isn&#x27;t oily.  </li>
            <li>I probably going switch over to the Suntegrity&#x27;s Tinted Moisturizer because the sample worked very well for me.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The story of Suntegrity is very dear to my heart as my father also had melanoma.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stress enough how important this product is.</li>
            <li>I really did want a moisturizing sunscreen, and although it seems to moisturize, it&#x27;s not the type of luxurious moisturizer where you feel that your face just drinks it up.  </li>
            <li>, I expected a much better product for this price.</li>
            <li>It is definitely light weight and does not turn your face white, but it causes me to breakout.</li>
            <li>I found the Suntegrity line after much research.  </li>
            <li>This product&#x27;s fragrance/perfume really bothers me all day.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and most sunscreens make my face red, swollen, and itchy.</li>
            <li>Most products make me itch or break out; many are too heavy for the temperature and humidity, and they often leave a grey or whitish cast on my skin.</li>
            <li>I became really aware of how white cast this product left me when I ran out one day and decided to use the sample tube of Suntegrity Tinted Moisturizer and realized I looked so much better.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Based on another review, I&#x27;ve started buying Suntegrity skincare for body which is only $24 and works just as well (and may be a little thinner which is good).  </li>
            <li>Better than burnout face spf32, blue lizard, shiseido urban sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It also uses better ingredient than blue lizard face(uses ZnO and octinoxate while suntegrity only uses ZnO).</li>
            <li>I quickly then realized the importance of daily sun-screen as opposed to the just sun-screen needed when \\&quot;going out in the sun\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I also have combination skin with a particularly oily T-zone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li>I started using this Suntegrity sunscreen as it came highly recommended by my aesthetician.</li>
            <li>I tried Suntegrity because it was so highly rated by EWG.  </li>
            <li>the zinc oxide level is high, it is going to feel heavier than a chemical sunscreen, but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and find that my skin looks clearer and better (hyperpigmentation from exposure to the sun has decreased significantly).</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent, it dissipates quickly, so it isn&#x27;t a big problems--kind of orangey.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, wait about 6 minutes until this is fully absorbed before you apply any final products on your skin.</li>
            <li>The only disadvantage is the price, but for me it&#x27;s worth it to be done with the drama of my two year quest to find a natural moisturizer/sunscreen!</li>
            <li>At first, I was scared of the white tint that it leaves on the skin when first applying (because of the zinc) but your skin soaks it in quickly and leaves behind a smooth (almost pore-less) appearance...</li>
            <li>The body version (All Natural Moisturizing Body Protection contains FYI EXACTLY THE SAME INGREDIENTS as the face version (excluding grapefruit extract) and is just as gentle on the face.  </li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>has a relatively high SPF, and that it goes on fairly clear (unlike some mineral sunblocks).</li>
            <li>So I rate this higher than blue lizard.</li>
            <li>so now I use it prior to my jogs - since it does stay on pretty well with sweat.</li>
            <li>sure if it&#x27;s due to high ZnO, but eyes get a bit dry and itchy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a long time for an all-natural, chemical free daily face lotion with SPF.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen is not as thick as most of the others and rubs in pretty well, so doesn&#x27;t leave your face all ghostly white or greasy.  </li>
            <li>For me it&#x27;s almost as nice as Suntegrity, safe for your skin, and much less expensive.</li>
            <li>First, I love that it contains no harsh or unnecessary chemicals (take a look at its ranking on the EWG sunscreen report - it rates a 1 out of 10 in possible toxicity, with 1 being the absolute lowest).</li>
            <li>Saw this natural sunscreen on the EWG list as it was rated #1 and thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li>It takes about 20 seconds longer than my old face lotion to rub in, which is no problem for me.  </li>
            <li>But when I tried Suntegrity face sunscreen, I changed my habits completely.</li>
            <li>All its ingredients are natural as well....</li>
            <li>I have naturally oily skin and suntegrity does not break me out.  </li>
            <li>I bought so far probably 10 of them.  </li>
            <li>I have adult acne prone skin and this product has NOT made me break out.</li>
            <li>All Natural Moisturizing Body Protection SPF 30 (4oz) 118ml]]</li>
            <li>I am fragrance sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have been insistent upon using the most natural ingredients in and on my body now for the last few years.  </li>
            <li>Only problem is its high price and lasts about 3-4 months.  </li>
            <li>The sunscreen is fantastic, but you get such a small amount for the cost, especially considering how much you&#x27;re supposed to use every day!</li>
            <li>The packaging is solid, but I wish I could see how much product is left so that I can repurchase accordingly.</li>
            <li>However, like every natural face sunscreen, leaves me with a white cast.  </li>
            <li>Thank you Suntegrity for an all natural daily, moisturizing sun protector!  </li>
            <li>I spent the whole day out at the lake with nothing but this on my face, I went swimming &amp; everything, and didn&#x27;t get a bit burned.</li>
            <li>The cost is high, but if you use it primarily for your face, it will last a long time - a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, isn&#x27;t thick, does not leave a greasy or white shine, serves as a primer, and pairs well with mineral make-up.</li>
            <li>And for the money, I expected the product to live up to the description.</li>
            <li>Because of this and the high price I will probably try some other products before I&#x27;d consider buying this again.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen takes a few minutes to &#x27;soak&#x27; in, meaning that it goes one pretty white.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t see how much product is left, and now when I press on the pump it stays stuck down.</li>
            <li>This is not a big deal for me, since I&#x27;m pretty pale, but it is something to keep note of if you have darker skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s readily absorbable, hardly any smell, is soft and feels silky as I glide it on.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> And I must say that I am a happy customer.  </li>
            <li> Great sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy I&#x27;ve discovered Suntegrity.</li>
            <li> It has also done a great job keeping me &amp;#34;not tanned&amp;#34; on my face.</li>
            <li> I was able to get rid of it with blotting papers, but I&#x27;m still searching for that perfect primer that stops all the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found it in EWG&#x27;s database and bought it after seeing the good reviews here.</li>
            <li> LOVED the smell of this.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because it received a good rating on the EWG&#x27;s sunscreen guide.</li>
            <li> It just feels good on my face, neck and décolleté.</li>
            <li> It sounded perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty happy with this.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this sunscreen!  </li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> The Suntegrity Skincare with an SPF30 is my favorite sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li> This product makes me feel better when i wear it because is smells soooo good...</li>
            <li> It has a beautifully smooth texture and a wonderful light scent that absorbs evenly, leaving my skin feeling well nourished and protected.</li>
            <li> I came across Suntegrity on Amazon along with some others but decided to go with this one, as I liked the reviews.</li>
            <li> have to be honest, bc</li>
            <li> (indeed, I did not experience any reactions).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s moisturizing, which is nice if you want to skip a step (i.e., not apply a separate moisturizer before your sunscreen).</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have much of an oil problem, this could be perfect for you.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the antioxidant stuff they put in this cream will help improving my skin or not; but I am very happy with an all-natural, effective, and non-greasy sunscreen for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s an excellent product that I would recommend to anyone looking for good sun protection.</li>
            <li> This is the best one I&#x27;ve tried so far and will recommend this sunscreen to all my friends.</li>
            <li> It has a light citrus smell to it (which smells good and neutral).</li>
            <li> and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Uses combo of ZnO and TiO, not water resistant(suntegrity is not water resistant either), more hazardous according to ewg, not hydrating(could be a + for some people) and costs more.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased as it has a nice light tangerine scent, feels great on my skin and rubs in very well.</li>
            <li> It has a very light almost citrus scent, which I love.  </li>
            <li> (though I&#x27;ll probably keep an eye out for more budget-friendly equivalents)</li>
            <li> And i love the smell.  </li>
            <li> Finally, and best of all, it hasn&#x27;t caused me to breakout!    </li>
            <li> I love that it is non-greasy and does not feel \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; on my skin.</li>
            <li> Skin feels better after wearing it.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve mentioned it feels more chewy at application and feels more hydrating, although that stickiness goes away.</li>
            <li> With suntegrity, skin got way~ better after using this product.</li>
            <li> and I really love many things about it.  </li>
            <li> It smells amazing, goes on smooth and silky, and doesn&#x27;t make my face break out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m REALLY glad I did.  </li>
            <li> now I feel confident it will be a lifetime.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it smells.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply the best!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT....</li>
            <li> I am a runner and it does not drip into my eyes during exercise, which I love.  </li>
            <li> Many of my fellow runners refuse to put sunblock on their foreheads because their eyes end up burning.  </li>
            <li> I just ordered more because I don&#x27;t want to run out.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks smooth and glowing, and it smells citrus-y!  </li>
            <li> If money were no object, I would use this all the time, but mostly I use Alba Botanica sunblock for the face.</li>
            <li> Second, it smells great - a nice, light and refreshing citrus-y smell.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s effective, evens out my fair skin, doesn&#x27;t break me out, moisturizes without becoming greasy, and the ingredients are safe enough to use during pregnancy &amp; breastfeeding.  </li>
            <li> Non comedonic, oil free and acne and rosascia gets better.</li>
            <li> Received a free sample after winning a contest, but as soon as I started using it, I went to the website and purchased the body one as well.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and the way it goes on smoothly</li>
            <li> This is a great natural sunscreen if you&#x27;re outdoors a lot of the time.</li>
            <li> and I used to think they worked fine until I tried Suntegrity.</li>
            <li> Blue lizard face is actually pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> My aunt and grandmother had melanoma and I go to great lengths to protect my skin with only the finest products.</li>
            <li> Fourth, it feels great going on your skin.</li>
            <li> It is light.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly without looking chalky and stays on throughout my workouts.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin that&#x27;s prone to breakouts, and this sunscreen was fantastic.</li>
            <li> company needs to come up with a fragrance free version.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible in a healthy sunscreen, so it&#x27;s about as good as it&#x27;s going to get,</li>
            <li> the most natural, yet still effective ingredients</li>
            <li> When it comes to protection from the sun and skin cancer, the investment is worth it!</li>
            <li> There are other brands out there that claim a \\&quot;face and body\\&quot; product, but this is superior to all of them!.</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the perfect everyday sunscreen, but it works well under makeup regardless!</li>
            <li> I was thus excited to receive a sample of this as a freebie in a box with an online order -- sunscreen, moisturizer, and primer in one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Suntegrity product not being water resistant can be a good thing since you can just wash it off with daily cleanser at the end of the day without using oil-based cleanser to remove water</li>
            <li> Love the gentle orange creamsicle scent as well.</li>
            <li> I already have some kind of dry eye syndrome which gets better with allergy med and eyedrop.</li>
            <li> I like the container and how it dispenses, and the sunscreen itself is nicely creamy and easy to rub in (unlike some that require a lot of massaging to eliminate the white cream appearance).  </li>
            <li> At first application I used way too much---so it felt greasy and the citrus scent was annoyingly strong.</li>
            <li> When I found out that the Skin Deep Cosmetics Database had rated this product so positively, it made me even more confident to use it!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this sunscreen that carries with it such a beautiful message.</li>
            <li> Most natural sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried are really greasy or don&#x27;t rub in very well, plus they really don&#x27;t smell all that great.</li>
            <li> I use Clinique mild cleanser and that didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I do however make sure I use an oil make-up remover, and exfoliate regularly to make sure I get all of it off in the evening.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Scent is mild and not intoxicating</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d had high hopes for a quality sunblock that would leave a MATTE finish for smooth, easy makeup application afterward.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m sure most other people will be fine.</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is the packaging - a very interesting and uniquely-functioning and shaped bottle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Burnout face spf 32 applied very light, non-greasy, and non sticky at the time of application with great feeling but left somewhat dry feeling as if skin is being pulled.</li>
            <li> I quickly went on the market and started researching a good product that was as natural as possible and cruelty free.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely fantastic and a must have for anyone who wants to protect their skin from the sun.    </li>
            <li> My 7 and 8 year old kids love this stuff too</li>
            <li> (Dior, Chanel, FRESH, and so on).  </li>
            <li> Also, I have a highly sensitive sense of smell and love the scent.</li>
            <li> I just wish it absorbed quicker.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone, especially those who prefer their products vegan and cruelty free : )</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it for the quality of the product and my peace of mind.</li>
            <li> Make sure you re-apply frequently.</li>
            <li> The price was well worth the investment.  </li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s a natural product but would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Quality product, I&#x27;ve gone through most of the SPF 30 natural and organic moisturizers on the market</li>
            <li> As well, in the evening after work, I am adamant about washing my face and exfoliating, making sure my skin is cleared of all residue.</li>
            <li> When it comes to my face, I only use high quality, good ingredients and Suntegrity</li>
            <li> I like the way it dispenses, just the right amount, so I am never wasting it.  </li>
            <li> As a foundation primer, I&#x27;d say it was above average but not the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> However, if the container was clear or there was some mechanism for telling how much was left in the package, then I would be extremely happy and wholeheartedly give it that 5 rating.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t overpowering, but it smelled kind of like citrus-flavoured candies, i.e. sweeter and more subtle than fresh</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to smells, it has a strong citrus scent.  </li>
            <li> But when I used lesser amount the second time, the result was great.</li>
            <li> As with many mineral sunscreens, it did not absorb perfectly into the skin but left a slight white layer on my face.</li>
            <li> Shiseido urban would be good only if someone wants lighter product that is non-comedonic and light to feeling.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite facial sunblock yet:  </li>
            <li> I now use a light-coverage foundation instead of a medium-coverage one - my skin has improved that much!</li>
            <li> The product was like marshmallow- kinda gooey and sticky at first.</li>
            <li> Suntegrity has a different texture and feels more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Shiseido urban sunscreen doesn&#x27;t seem to have anything better.</li>
            <li> So I resorted to using body wash on my face first to remove it, then using my face wash.  </li>
            <li> I wear this sunscreen daily under my makeup, and I love it.</li>
            <li> Yes, he did survive but I am checked twice a year to make sure I do not suffer from the same type of cancer.</li>
            <li> As a redhead  who spent the majority of my young adulthood basking in the sun for that perfect tan, I have suffered in my later years with pre-cancerous moles removed from my face, neck &amp; chest.</li>
            <li> It made any flakiness even more obvious.</li>
            <li> I was encouraged after reading reviews that this was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I love it but the big container is pretty wasteful.</li>
            <li> It stays put and it helps that it is chemical free and natural.</li>
            <li> The last bonus is that this product has encouraged a healthy skin habit: using sunscreen daily, even when it&#x27;s cloudy out :)</li>
            <li> The minerals BLOCK the sun and harmful rays, while, the chemical sunscreens break them down...which can in turn be MORE harmful than the actual sun.</li>
            <li> I also used it on my arms, where it seemed to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The strength of this product is in the fact that it can replace so many different products (sunscreen, moisturizer, primer).</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and soaks in more quickly than other natural products I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I tried to love this because it makes EWG&#x27;s safe sunscreen list, but it is just not suitable for use under makeup.</li>
            <li> That one has better UVB coverage(higher spf), similar UVB coverage, and very water resistant.</li>
            <li> I live in a sunny and humid climate and have been searching forever for an effective sunblock that I&#x27;m not sensitive to.</li>
            <li> All reviews were positive and the mission of the company resonated with me(i.e.</li>
            <li> so Suntegrity is less hazardous according to ewg.</li>
            <li> It actually goes on pretty matte and has a light citrus scent.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product before it changed its name (directly through their site using a coupon from Lucky Magazine) and had already noticed the \\&quot;primer\\&quot; feature.  </li>
            <li> (bc any less, it wouldn&#x27;t be an effective block).</li>
            <li> and it certainly does the job.  </li>
            <li> This applies very very white but gets absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying a lot of sunscreens from the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s list of recommended sunscreens ([ ... ] ), and have been having a hard time finding a good face moisturizer that I&#x27;d wear every day.  </li>
            <li> But the sticky feeling goes away very soon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only $17 for 5oz of oil free and moisturizing sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin very moisturized yet not sticky or greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> It was much better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> It stays tacky and sticky the whole time and never seems to absorb into my skin.  </li>
            <li> It feels very moisturizing yet isn&#x27;t oily.  </li>
            <li> I probably going switch over to the Suntegrity&#x27;s Tinted Moisturizer because the sample worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The story of Suntegrity is very dear to my heart as my father also had melanoma.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stress enough how important this product is.</li>
            <li> I really did want a moisturizing sunscreen, and although it seems to moisturize, it&#x27;s not the type of luxurious moisturizer where you feel that your face just drinks it up.  </li>
            <li> , I expected a much better product for this price.</li>
            <li> It is definitely light weight and does not turn your face white, but it causes me to breakout.</li>
            <li> I found the Suntegrity line after much research.  </li>
            <li> This product&#x27;s fragrance/perfume really bothers me all day.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and most sunscreens make my face red, swollen, and itchy.</li>
            <li> Most products make me itch or break out; many are too heavy for the temperature and humidity, and they often leave a grey or whitish cast on my skin.</li>
            <li> I became really aware of how white cast this product left me when I ran out one day and decided to use the sample tube of Suntegrity Tinted Moisturizer and realized I looked so much better.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Based on another review, I&#x27;ve started buying Suntegrity skincare for body which is only $24 and works just as well (and may be a little thinner which is good).  </li>
            <li> Better than burnout face spf32, blue lizard, shiseido urban sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It also uses better ingredient than blue lizard face(uses ZnO and octinoxate while suntegrity only uses ZnO).</li>
            <li> I quickly then realized the importance of daily sun-screen as opposed to the just sun-screen needed when \\&quot;going out in the sun\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I also have combination skin with a particularly oily T-zone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I started using this Suntegrity sunscreen as it came highly recommended by my aesthetician.</li>
            <li> I tried Suntegrity because it was so highly rated by EWG.  </li>
            <li> the zinc oxide level is high, it is going to feel heavier than a chemical sunscreen, but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and find that my skin looks clearer and better (hyperpigmentation from exposure to the sun has decreased significantly).</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent, it dissipates quickly, so it isn&#x27;t a big problems--kind of orangey.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, wait about 6 minutes until this is fully absorbed before you apply any final products on your skin.</li>
            <li> The only disadvantage is the price, but for me it&#x27;s worth it to be done with the drama of my two year quest to find a natural moisturizer/sunscreen!</li>
            <li> At first, I was scared of the white tint that it leaves on the skin when first applying (because of the zinc) but your skin soaks it in quickly and leaves behind a smooth (almost pore-less) appearance...</li>
            <li> The body version (All Natural Moisturizing Body Protection contains FYI EXACTLY THE SAME INGREDIENTS as the face version (excluding grapefruit extract) and is just as gentle on the face.  </li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> has a relatively high SPF, and that it goes on fairly clear (unlike some mineral sunblocks).</li>
            <li> So I rate this higher than blue lizard.</li>
            <li> so now I use it prior to my jogs - since it does stay on pretty well with sweat.</li>
            <li> sure if it&#x27;s due to high ZnO, but eyes get a bit dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a long time for an all-natural, chemical free daily face lotion with SPF.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen is not as thick as most of the others and rubs in pretty well, so doesn&#x27;t leave your face all ghostly white or greasy.  </li>
            <li> For me it&#x27;s almost as nice as Suntegrity, safe for your skin, and much less expensive.</li>
            <li> First, I love that it contains no harsh or unnecessary chemicals (take a look at its ranking on the EWG sunscreen report - it rates a 1 out of 10 in possible toxicity, with 1 being the absolute lowest).</li>
            <li> Saw this natural sunscreen on the EWG list as it was rated #1 and thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> It takes about 20 seconds longer than my old face lotion to rub in, which is no problem for me.  </li>
            <li> But when I tried Suntegrity face sunscreen, I changed my habits completely.</li>
            <li> All its ingredients are natural as well....</li>
            <li> I have naturally oily skin and suntegrity does not break me out.  </li>
            <li> I bought so far probably 10 of them.  </li>
            <li> I have adult acne prone skin and this product has NOT made me break out.</li>
            <li> All Natural Moisturizing Body Protection SPF 30 (4oz) 118ml]]</li>
            <li> I am fragrance sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have been insistent upon using the most natural ingredients in and on my body now for the last few years.  </li>
            <li> Only problem is its high price and lasts about 3-4 months.  </li>
            <li> The sunscreen is fantastic, but you get such a small amount for the cost, especially considering how much you&#x27;re supposed to use every day!</li>
            <li> The packaging is solid, but I wish I could see how much product is left so that I can repurchase accordingly.</li>
            <li> However, like every natural face sunscreen, leaves me with a white cast.  </li>
            <li> Thank you Suntegrity for an all natural daily, moisturizing sun protector!  </li>
            <li> I spent the whole day out at the lake with nothing but this on my face, I went swimming &amp; everything, and didn&#x27;t get a bit burned.</li>
            <li> The cost is high, but if you use it primarily for your face, it will last a long time - a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, isn&#x27;t thick, does not leave a greasy or white shine, serves as a primer, and pairs well with mineral make-up.</li>
            <li> And for the money, I expected the product to live up to the description.</li>
            <li> Because of this and the high price I will probably try some other products before I&#x27;d consider buying this again.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen takes a few minutes to &#x27;soak&#x27; in, meaning that it goes one pretty white.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t see how much product is left, and now when I press on the pump it stays stuck down.</li>
            <li> This is not a big deal for me, since I&#x27;m pretty pale, but it is something to keep note of if you have darker skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s readily absorbable, hardly any smell, is soft and feels silky as I glide it on.</li>
            <li> I have searched high and low for a natural and non nano-particle, with at least 20% zinc oxide  </li>
            <li> It does take a little longer to rub in, but it definitely absorbs completely and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy</li>
            <li> while I put it on, then I tried 100% Pure, which I still like, but it felt heavier than the Suntegrity, and their packaging would always break down after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey, but because of its uniqueness on each of these points, I consider it money well spent for daily use here in SoCal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, but it moisturizes and keeps my face protected from the sun all day long.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this means the bottle is empty because I can&#x27;t see into it or open it in any way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only glad I had a $15 gift card, so at least I didn&#x27;t pay full price for a disappointing failure.</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be dry, and as a moisturizer this doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> I notice that using the regular sunscreen makes my dark circles look darker.  </li>
            <li> Third, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always careful to gently cleanse my skin and let it dry before applying a thin layer of suncreen.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and have had a hard time trying to find a sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  </li>
            <li> And, as I stated above, a little goes a long way so this seemingly small bottle should last quite some time.    </li>
            <li> I like that the active ingredient is zinc oxide, which is less likely to cause any allergic or sensitivity reactions than chemical sunscreens</li>
            <li> Have to be careful when traveling with it.</li>
            <li> Also a few minutes after application it feels somewhat sticky at the same time.</li>
            <li> Remember, skin needs to breathe, so use minimal cleaning products, cosmetics, and sunscreen/moisturizers).</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way, I use less than a pea size for my entire face.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-A little dollop goes a long way&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I won&#x27;t use that product due to</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy like a lot of other facial sunscreens, it doesn&#x27;t smell like the usual sunscreen (it has a citrusy smell), and it absorbs well</li>
            <li> Not exactly flattering...  </li>
            <li> It was not greasy (so I can use my moisturizer, then this sunscreen, and then wear my usual mineral make-up); it doesn&#x27;t leave white streaks, and the citrus scent goes away after a while.</li>
            <li> If you use other products in your regimen, mix equal parts together with this  product and apply as usual.</li>
            <li> The product itself looks thick and heavy but goes on clear and gives my skin a dewy finish.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It tends to be a little greasy for face, so be careful to use sparingly and rub in thoroughly&lt;br /&gt;-Must</li>
            <li> I am light-olive complected and struggle with dark undereye circles.  </li>
            <li> I really do not like wearing face sunscreen because it feels heavy</li>
            <li> hands down.  </li>
            <li> And I was not very happy with this SUPER expensive sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and only a little is needed.  </li>
            <li> My nose is irritated and I have a slight headache from it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to waste it,</li>
            <li> It is heavy duty</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it was thick and left me looking like a ghost (white face).  </li>
            <li> use a face oil, serum, moisturizer then Suntegrity underneath my make-up, and it&#x27;s not too heavy.</li>
            <li> I have pale skin and a family history of skin cancer (basal cell).</li>
            <li> I have been using high-SPF foundations in lieu of a plain sunscreen</li>
            <li> The way the bottle is made, it&#x27;s difficult to figure out when I&#x27;m running low and need to reorder.  </li>
            <li> And it burns your eyes making it not safe for the eye area.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is expensive, but it lasts me 6 months with daily use.</li>
            <li> Even if I use just a small amount.  </li>
            <li> I did get a small amount of shine on my nose and forehead about halfway through the day.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s weird feeling of sticky but dry</li>
            <li> It goes on thick.  </li>
            <li> NOT a good use under any makeup.  </li>
            <li> In addition, it is so VERY hard to wash off.  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t broken out once in the 3 months</li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t contain harsh, potentially dangerous chemicals,</li>
            <li> I found that is the secret to using a mineral based sunblock, if I don&#x27;t want my pores to get clogged.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m disappointed that I cannot use it everyday like I had planned.</li>
            <li> This was expensive, but I wanted a chemical-free sunscreen for my trip to India.</li>
            <li> to be annoyed and unhappy.</li>
            <li> other reviewers have commented, the bottle design is terrible.</li>
            <li> I try to stay out of the sun, but sometimes that&#x27;s impossible (walking the dog or driving to work, for example).</li>
            <li> I wanted this to work soooooo badly.  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a year and have not been disappointed (or sunburned!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed</li>

            <li> This is my favorite facial sunblock yet:  it&#x27;s effective, evens out my fair skin, doesn&#x27;t break me out, moisturizes without becoming greasy, and the ingredients are safe enough to use during pregnancy &amp; breastfeeding.  It&#x27;s pricey, but because of its uniqueness on each of these points, I consider it money well spent for daily use here in SoCal. (though I&#x27;ll probably keep an eye out for more budget-friendly equivalents)</li>
            <li> I LOVE this sunscreen!  And i love the smell.  Product ships in a timely manner and my bottle seems to last for quite some time.  My 7 and 8 year old kids love this stuff too which is great so that i don&#x27;t have to fight with them to apply it each morning! This product makes me feel better when i wear it because is smells soooo good...i just feel uplifted!</li>
            <li> I live in a sunny and humid climate and have been searching forever for an effective sunblock that I&#x27;m not sensitive to. Most products make me itch or break out; many are too heavy for the temperature and humidity, and they often leave a grey or whitish cast on my skin. I have tried almost every sunblock out there - from the drugstore variety (aveeno, neutrogena) to the ones from high-end cosmetic lines (Dior, Chanel, FRESH, and so on).  I have been using high-SPF foundations in lieu of a plain sunscreen and I used to think they worked fine until I tried Suntegrity. The product itself looks thick and heavy but goes on clear and gives my skin a dewy finish. It&#x27;s not sticky, and works wonderfully as a primer for my foundation. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and find that my skin looks clearer and better (hyperpigmentation from exposure to the sun has decreased significantly). I now use a light-coverage foundation instead of a medium-coverage one - my skin has improved that much! Overall it&#x27;s an excellent product that I would recommend to anyone looking for good sun protection.</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it every day without fail. My aunt and grandmother had melanoma and I go to great lengths to protect my skin with only the finest products. I discovered Suntegrity after extensive research on EWG. I am particularly impressed with the richness of the face protection. Also, I have a highly sensitive sense of smell and love the scent. I highly recommend this product to everyone. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I started using this Suntegrity sunscreen as it came highly recommended by my aesthetician. First, I love that it contains no harsh or unnecessary chemicals (take a look at its ranking on the EWG sunscreen report - it rates a 1 out of 10 in possible toxicity, with 1 being the absolute lowest). Second, it smells great - a nice, light and refreshing citrus-y smell. Third, a little goes a long way. Fourth, it feels great going on your skin. Fifth, it absorbs well and it leaves your skin feeling great. Finally, and best of all, it hasn&#x27;t caused me to breakout!    Yes, it&#x27;s pricey, but as Benjamin Franklin said, \\&quot;an ounce of prevention...\\&quot; When it comes to protection from the sun and skin cancer, the investment is worth it! And, as I stated above, a little goes a long way so this seemingly small bottle should last quite some time.    The only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is the packaging - a very interesting and uniquely-functioning and shaped bottle. Have to be careful when traveling with it.</li>
            <li> Saw this natural sunscreen on the EWG list as it was rated #1 and thought I would give it a try. And I must say that I am a happy customer.  Most natural sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried are really greasy or don&#x27;t rub in very well, plus they really don&#x27;t smell all that great. Not the case here!  I was very pleased as it has a nice light tangerine scent, feels great on my skin and rubs in very well. This is the best one I&#x27;ve tried so far and will recommend this sunscreen to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It has a beautifully smooth texture and a wonderful light scent that absorbs evenly, leaving my skin feeling well nourished and protected. I love that it is non-greasy and does not feel \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; on my skin. I highly recommend this sunscreen that carries with it such a beautiful message. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen. Better than burnout face spf32, blue lizard, shiseido urban sunscreen. The product was like marshmallow- kinda gooey and sticky at first. I felt like I was putting melted orange-cream-ice cream-scented marshmallow on my face. But the sticky feeling goes away very soon. Also, white color dissipates almost 30 seconds later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burnout face spf 32 applied very light, non-greasy, and non sticky at the time of application with great feeling but left somewhat dry feeling as if skin is being pulled. Also a few minutes after application it feels somewhat sticky at the same time. Blue lizard face is actually pretty awesome. It&#x27;s only $17 for 5oz of oil free and moisturizing sunscreen. This applies very very white but gets absorbed quickly. Leaves skin very moisturized yet not sticky or greasy at all. Skin feels better after wearing it. Suntegrity has a different texture and feels more moisturizing. As I&#x27;ve mentioned it feels more chewy at application and feels more hydrating, although that stickiness goes away. With suntegrity, skin got way~ better after using this product. Non comedonic, oil free and acne and rosascia gets better. So I rate this higher than blue lizard. It also uses better ingredient than blue lizard face(uses ZnO and octinoxate while suntegrity only uses ZnO). Shiseido urban sunscreen doesn&#x27;t seem to have anything better. Uses combo of ZnO and TiO, not water resistant(suntegrity is not water resistant either), more hazardous according to ewg, not hydrating(could be a + for some people) and costs more. Shiseido urban would be good only if someone wants lighter product that is non-comedonic and light to feeling. You can apply make up immediately on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suntegrity product not being water resistant can be a good thing since you can just wash it off with daily cleanser at the end of the day without using oil-based cleanser to remove water resistant products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say shiseido ultimate water-resistant sunscreen is something different. That one has better UVB coverage(higher spf), similar UVB coverage, and very water resistant. It still uses combo of ZnO16% , TiO, and Oxticnoxate(chemical) instead of only ZnO so Suntegrity is less hazardous according to ewg. I&#x27;d only use shiseido ultimate face sunscreen for beach or sport use. Burnout face spf 32 is also water resistant but I won&#x27;t use that product due to it&#x27;s weird feeling of sticky but dry feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if it&#x27;s due to high ZnO, but eyes get a bit dry and itchy. I already have some kind of dry eye syndrome which gets better with allergy med and eyedrop. But it doesn&#x27;t go away when I wear this. But I&#x27;m sure most other people will be fine. Not water resistant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a long time for an all-natural, chemical free daily face lotion with SPF.  This one is perfect!!  It&#x27;s lightweight, but it moisturizes and keeps my face protected from the sun all day long.  It also doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen.  It has a very light almost citrus scent, which I love.  It takes about 20 seconds longer than my old face lotion to rub in, which is no problem for me.  I also have very sensitive skin and I haven&#x27;t broken out once in the 3 months I&#x27;ve been using this.  Would highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I tried Suntegrity because it was so highly rated by EWG.  It was much better than I expected.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy like a lot of other facial sunscreens, it doesn&#x27;t smell like the usual sunscreen (it has a citrusy smell), and it absorbs well so my face doesn&#x27;t have that white ghostly look.  Altho a bit on the pricey side, it lasts quite a while; I use it every day under my make-up.  The way the bottle is made, it&#x27;s difficult to figure out when I&#x27;m running low and need to reorder.  I&#x27;m happy I&#x27;ve discovered Suntegrity.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and have had a hard time trying to find a sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  Tried this under the recommendations of the EWG.  And I was not very happy with this SUPER expensive sunscreen.  It goes on thick.  It goes on white. If you are sensitive to smells, it has a strong citrus scent.  And it burns your eyes making it not safe for the eye area.  In addition, it is so VERY hard to wash off.  I use Clinique mild cleanser and that didn&#x27;t work.  So I resorted to using body wash on my face first to remove it, then using my face wash.  It stays tacky and sticky the whole time and never seems to absorb into my skin.  NOT a good use under any makeup.  I didn&#x27;t want to waste it, so now I use it prior to my jogs - since it does stay on pretty well with sweat.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen takes a few minutes to &#x27;soak&#x27; in, meaning that it goes one pretty white.  The white does go away.  It has a light citrus smell to it (which smells good and neutral). I just wish it absorbed quicker.</li>
            <li> Loved this product! Received a free sample after winning a contest, but as soon as I started using it, I went to the website and purchased the body one as well. Would recommend to anyone, especially those who prefer their products vegan and cruelty free : )</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for around 10 months and I really love many things about it.  The scent is awesome.  It feels very moisturizing yet isn&#x27;t oily.  However, like every natural face sunscreen, leaves me with a white cast.  I became really aware of how white cast this product left me when I ran out one day and decided to use the sample tube of Suntegrity Tinted Moisturizer and realized I looked so much better.  I am light-olive complected and struggle with dark undereye circles.  I notice that using the regular sunscreen makes my dark circles look darker.  Not exactly flattering...  I probably going switch over to the Suntegrity&#x27;s Tinted Moisturizer because the sample worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> I wear this sunscreen daily under my makeup, and I love it. I found it in EWG&#x27;s database and bought it after seeing the good reviews here. I&#x27;ve used it for a year and have not been disappointed (or sunburned!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is expensive, but it lasts me 6 months with daily use. Definitely worth it for the quality of the product and my peace of mind.</li>
            <li> I really do not like wearing face sunscreen because it feels heavy and my make up does not blend as well. But when I tried Suntegrity face sunscreen, I changed my habits completely. This is the best sunscreen I have used. It is light. It lasts all day... and it smells delicious. All its ingredients are natural as well.... best sunscreen!!!</li>
            <li> I have done a lot of research on \\&quot;safe\\&quot; sunscreen and between my family members and I, we have tried several brands. This product is wonderful for your face. It smells amazing, goes on smooth and silky, and doesn&#x27;t make my face break out. There are other brands out there that claim a \\&quot;face and body\\&quot; product, but this is superior to all of them!. Make sure you re-apply frequently. The cost is high, but if you use it primarily for your face, it will last a long time - a little goes a long way. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Recently I was diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma and had to have it removed from my face.  I quickly then realized the importance of daily sun-screen as opposed to the just sun-screen needed when \\&quot;going out in the sun\\&quot;.  I quickly went on the market and started researching a good product that was as natural as possible and cruelty free.  I came across Suntegrity on Amazon along with some others but decided to go with this one, as I liked the reviews. The price was well worth the investment.  I&#x27;m REALLY glad I did.  While I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about 2-weeks now I feel confident it will be a lifetime.  I love the way it smells.  It&#x27;s thick and only a little is needed.  After I put it on, my face doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all, but moisturized and well protected for the entire day.      Thank you Suntegrity for an all natural daily, moisturizing sun protector!  I can&#x27;t wait to tell my dermatologist about it.</li>
            <li> The story of Suntegrity is very dear to my heart as my father also had melanoma. Yes, he did survive but I am checked twice a year to make sure I do not suffer from the same type of cancer. To protect myself I use Suntegrity EVERY DAY. It&#x27;s absolutely fantastic and a must have for anyone who wants to protect their skin from the sun.    I can&#x27;t stress enough how important this product is.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and most sunscreens make my face red, swollen, and itchy. This product doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all, and it seems to protect me well from the sun-exposure. At first application I used way too much---so it felt greasy and the citrus scent was annoyingly strong. But when I used lesser amount the second time, the result was great. It was not greasy (so I can use my moisturizer, then this sunscreen, and then wear my usual mineral make-up); it doesn&#x27;t leave white streaks, and the citrus scent goes away after a while. I don&#x27;t know if the antioxidant stuff they put in this cream will help improving my skin or not; but I am very happy with an all-natural, effective, and non-greasy sunscreen for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> As a redhead  who spent the majority of my young adulthood basking in the sun for that perfect tan, I have suffered in my later years with pre-cancerous moles removed from my face, neck &amp; chest. The outdoors is my gym, as I walk or cycle almost daily. The Suntegrity Skincare with an SPF30 is my favorite sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used! It goes on smoothly without looking chalky and stays on throughout my workouts. Makeup can be applied over it without it getting \\&quot;glumpy\\&quot;. It&#x27;s simply the best!</li>
            <li> This was expensive, but I wanted a chemical-free sunscreen for my trip to India. I have oily skin that&#x27;s prone to breakouts, and this sunscreen was fantastic. It does take a little longer to rub in, but it definitely absorbs completely and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVED the smell of this. It wasn&#x27;t overpowering, but it smelled kind of like citrus-flavoured candies, i.e. sweeter and more subtle than fresh fruit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have commented, the bottle design is terrible. You can&#x27;t see how much product is left, and now when I press on the pump it stays stuck down. I don&#x27;t know if this means the bottle is empty because I can&#x27;t see into it or open it in any way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I&#x27;d buy this again for a beach vacation or as daily wear during the summer months when I&#x27;m outdoors during the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying a lot of sunscreens from the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s list of recommended sunscreens ([ ... ] ), and have been having a hard time finding a good face moisturizer that I&#x27;d wear every day.  This sunscreen is not as thick as most of the others and rubs in pretty well, so doesn&#x27;t leave your face all ghostly white or greasy.  For that reason, it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve tried.  I really did want a moisturizing sunscreen, and although it seems to moisturize, it&#x27;s not the type of luxurious moisturizer where you feel that your face just drinks it up.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible in a healthy sunscreen, so it&#x27;s about as good as it&#x27;s going to get, I suspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on another review, I&#x27;ve started buying Suntegrity skincare for body which is only $24 and works just as well (and may be a little thinner which is good).  I&#x27;d recommend getting that instead.</li>
            <li> Leaves a white residue on my face. Even if I use just a small amount.  I love that it&#x27;s a natural product but would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Like others, I also found this sunscreen on the EWG site.  I was looking for a moisturizing sunscreen that would also improve my skin.  I have naturally oily skin and suntegrity does not break me out.  It actually goes on pretty matte and has a light citrus scent.  A small amount goes a long way, I use less than a pea size for my entire face.  I can wear foundation over it with no problem.  I also like that it has antioxidants and no harmful ingredients since it is going on my face.  The packaging is solid, but I wish I could see how much product is left so that I can repurchase accordingly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of different facial sunscreens and recently switched to this one.  While I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent, it dissipates quickly, so it isn&#x27;t a big problems--kind of orangey.  I like the container and how it dispenses, and the sunscreen itself is nicely creamy and easy to rub in (unlike some that require a lot of massaging to eliminate the white cream appearance).  While I could change in the future, I like this one and will likely stay with it for some time because I like to use stuff off the EWG list and it is working well.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because it received a good rating on the EWG&#x27;s sunscreen guide. I like that it doesn&#x27;t contain harsh, potentially dangerous chemicals, has a relatively high SPF, and that it goes on fairly clear (unlike some mineral sunblocks). However, I will probably not buy it again. My skin tends to be dry, and as a moisturizer this doesn&#x27;t cut it. It made any flakiness even more obvious. Because of this and the high price I will probably try some other products before I&#x27;d consider buying this again.</li>
            <li> I tried to love this because it makes EWG&#x27;s safe sunscreen list, but it is just not suitable for use under makeup. The white cast does *not* go away, so I look ghostlike even after applying foundation over this product. This is yet another facial sunscreen that will be used only on my neck, arms, and hands.</li>
            <li> Very greasy and heavy. Leaves the whitish residue on the skin. If applied under makeup it makes your face to look as you have a mask. I was very disappointed, I expected a much better product for this price.</li>
            <li> I was encouraged after reading reviews that this was exactly what I was looking for. It is definitely light weight and does not turn your face white, but it causes me to breakout. It lasts all day, and does not appear greasy but I&#x27;m disappointed that I cannot use it everyday like I had planned.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.... Best sunscreen out there hands down.  I am a chemist and know my chemistry.  The ingredient list is so impressive and so good for your skin.  I bought so far probably 10 of them.  Only problem is its high price and lasts about 3-4 months.  When it comes to my face, I only use high quality, good ingredients and Suntegrity is the one!</li>
            <li> Ugh--expensive and you can&#x27;t rub it in enough to get rid of the ghostly haze it leaves on the face.  Feeling duped!</li>
            <li> I found out about this product while reading the EWG&#x27;s page.  It is rated #1 and it certainly does the job.  I love the scent and the way it goes on smoothly and it makes my skin feel great!  I am a runner and it does not drip into my eyes during exercise, which I love.  Many of my fellow runners refuse to put sunblock on their foreheads because their eyes end up burning.  It is not an issue with Suntegrity.  The only reason it doesn&#x27;t get a 5 rating is the packaging.  I cannot tell how close I am to being out of it.  I just ordered more because I don&#x27;t want to run out.  I like the way it dispenses, just the right amount, so I am never wasting it.  However, if the container was clear or there was some mechanism for telling how much was left in the package, then I would be extremely happy and wholeheartedly give it that 5 rating.</li>
            <li> This works wonderfully.  It smells terrific but is not overpowering.  It goes on smoothly and soaks in more quickly than other natural products I have tried.  This is my 3rd order of this product - please keep carrying it Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love it but the big container is pretty wasteful.</li>
            <li> This is a great natural sunscreen if you&#x27;re outdoors a lot of the time. I found that is was absolutely perfect for the summertime. I spent the whole day out at the lake with nothing but this on my face, I went swimming &amp; everything, and didn&#x27;t get a bit burned. It stays put and it helps that it is chemical free and natural. It is heavy duty so I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the perfect everyday sunscreen, but it works well under makeup regardless!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d had high hopes for a quality sunblock that would leave a MATTE finish for smooth, easy makeup application afterward. NOT what I got. And for the money, I expected the product to live up to the description. I&#x27;m only glad I had a $15 gift card, so at least I didn&#x27;t pay full price for a disappointing failure.</li>
            <li> It just feels good on my face, neck and décolleté. It&#x27;s readily absorbable, hardly any smell, is soft and feels silky as I glide it on. If you use other products in your regimen, mix equal parts together with this  product and apply as usual. Otherwise, wait about 6 minutes until this is fully absorbed before you apply any final products on your skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this product before it changed its name (directly through their site using a coupon from Lucky Magazine) and had already noticed the \\&quot;primer\\&quot; feature.  As soon as I put this on my skin, I notice a difference!  My skin looks smooth and glowing, and it smells citrus-y!  At first, I was scared of the white tint that it leaves on the skin when first applying (because of the zinc) but your skin soaks it in quickly and leaves behind a smooth (almost pore-less) appearance... LOVE this product!  An added bonus is the fact that it is all-natural, no chemicals, and not tested on animals.  When I found out that the Skin Deep Cosmetics Database had rated this product so positively, it made me even more confident to use it!  The last bonus is that this product has encouraged a healthy skin habit: using sunscreen daily, even when it&#x27;s cloudy out :)</li>
            <li> Quality product, I&#x27;ve gone through most of the SPF 30 natural and organic moisturizers on the market and this is by far the best. It goes on smooth, isn&#x27;t thick, does not leave a greasy or white shine, serves as a primer, and pairs well with mineral make-up. The only disadvantage is the price, but for me it&#x27;s worth it to be done with the drama of my two year quest to find a natural moisturizer/sunscreen!</li>
            <li> I wanted this to work soooooo badly.  Unfortunately it was thick and left me looking like a ghost (white face).  I tried a second time but had to give up and return it.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful sunscreen. I have searched high and low for a natural and non nano-particle, with at least 20% zinc oxide  (bc any less, it wouldn&#x27;t be an effective block). I used to use OrigSprout tahitian SPF, but it would pill while I put it on, then I tried 100% Pure, which I still like, but it felt heavier than the Suntegrity, and their packaging would always break down after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to be honest, bc the zinc oxide level is high, it is going to feel heavier than a chemical sunscreen, but bc I am allergic (and develop hives) to those, I have to choose mineral sunscreens. The minerals BLOCK the sun and harmful rays, while, the chemical sunscreens break them down...which can in turn be MORE harmful than the actual sun. So sticking to a mineral sunblock is better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a face oil, serum, moisturizer then Suntegrity underneath my make-up, and it&#x27;s not too heavy. I have adult acne prone skin and this product has NOT made me break out. It has also done a great job keeping me &amp;#34;not tanned&amp;#34; on my face. I do however make sure I use an oil make-up remover, and exfoliate regularly to make sure I get all of it off in the evening. I found that is the secret to using a mineral based sunblock, if I don&#x27;t want my pores to get clogged. Love the gentle orange creamsicle scent as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would last me a while, but I was out of it in a month. The sunscreen is fantastic, but you get such a small amount for the cost, especially considering how much you&#x27;re supposed to use every day! If money were no object, I would use this all the time, but mostly I use Alba Botanica sunblock for the face. For me it&#x27;s almost as nice as Suntegrity, safe for your skin, and much less expensive.</li>
            <li> I have pale skin and a family history of skin cancer (basal cell). I try to stay out of the sun, but sometimes that&#x27;s impossible (walking the dog or driving to work, for example). So I wear sunscreen even during the winter, even on days I&#x27;m not planning to spend a lot of time outside. I also have combination skin with a particularly oily T-zone. I was thus excited to receive a sample of this as a freebie in a box with an online order -- sunscreen, moisturizer, and primer in one. It sounded perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty happy with this. As with many mineral sunscreens, it did not absorb perfectly into the skin but left a slight white layer on my face. This is not a big deal for me, since I&#x27;m pretty pale, but it is something to keep note of if you have darker skin. I also used it on my arms, where it seemed to work pretty well. I like that the active ingredient is zinc oxide, which is less likely to cause any allergic or sensitivity reactions than chemical sunscreens (indeed, I did not experience any reactions).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s moisturizing, which is nice if you want to skip a step (i.e., not apply a separate moisturizer before your sunscreen). As a foundation primer, I&#x27;d say it was above average but not the best I&#x27;ve used. I did get a small amount of shine on my nose and forehead about halfway through the day. I was able to get rid of it with blotting papers, but I&#x27;m still searching for that perfect primer that stops all the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strength of this product is in the fact that it can replace so many different products (sunscreen, moisturizer, primer). If you don&#x27;t have much of an oil problem, this could be perfect for you.</li>
            <li> I have been insistent upon using the most natural ingredients in and on my body now for the last few years.  I found the Suntegrity line after much research.  All reviews were positive and the mission of the company resonated with me(i.e. the founder started the company after her mother had skin cancer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick points:&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Scent is mild and not intoxicating&lt;br /&gt;-A little dollop goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;-Does not clog pores&lt;br /&gt;-Only the most natural, yet still effective ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Price $$$&lt;br /&gt;-It tends to be a little greasy for face, so be careful to use sparingly and rub in thoroughly&lt;br /&gt;-Must reapply immediately after swimming&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***IMPORTANT NOTE***&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the body version of Suntegrity&#x27;s sunscreen [[ASIN:B003O9KGMG Suntegrity All Natural Moisturizing Body Protection SPF 30 (4oz) 118ml]] and have used it on both my body and face, for every day use and for at the beach.  The body version (All Natural Moisturizing Body Protection contains FYI EXACTLY THE SAME INGREDIENTS as the face version (excluding grapefruit extract) and is just as gentle on the face.  The body version is about FOUR TIMES CHEAPER than the face version and just as effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$45 for 50.27ml (face) versus $29  118ml (body).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:. BODY MOISTURIZER SUNCREEN &gt;  FACE SUNSCREEN&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Last note: Often times our pores become clogged not because of the sunscreen, but because we have not cleaned our skin thoroughly before applying the suncreen. I&#x27;m always careful to gently cleanse my skin and let it dry before applying a thin layer of suncreen.  As well, in the evening after work, I am adamant about washing my face and exfoliating, making sure my skin is cleared of all residue. Remember, skin needs to breathe, so use minimal cleaning products, cosmetics, and sunscreen/moisturizers).</li>
            <li> I am fragrance sensitive. I took a chance. I lost. This product&#x27;s fragrance/perfume really bothers me all day. My nose is irritated and I have a slight headache from it. All throughout my day the smell keeps alerting me to its presence and it&#x27;s not good.&lt;br /&gt;This company needs to come up with a fragrance free version. This one is annoying.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s a big price tag  to be annoyed and unhappy.</li>
