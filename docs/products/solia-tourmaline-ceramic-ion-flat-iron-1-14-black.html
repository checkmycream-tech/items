            <li>but it&#x27;s not the best one I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>

            <li>The reason why it&#x27;s the best is because 1) it leaves my hair very smooth, shiny, and sleek</li>

            <li>/&gt;Now to compare, I loved my Chi, felt it was a quality product</li>

            <li>The Solia does a good job of straightening my hair without damaging it.</li>
            <li>Loved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have been a Chi girl over 20 years, loved the price for the Solia.  </li>
            <li>Frankly I didn&#x27;t notice that it was that good of an iron to begin with.</li>
            <li>Heats quickly and straightens beautifully!</li>
            <li>But best of all, my hair has never looked so straight and so shiny!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>and I always love to keep a spare around so, I will buy another!</li>
            <li>Love the temp adjustment feature!</li>
            <li>Also I love the temperature settings that get up to 450 degrees because I need a lot of heat!</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t know how I could have got a better deal!</li>
            <li>Buying another one for sure!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect and the plates are blue, my favorite color :D</li>
            <li>; it&#x27;s one of the most used presents I&#x27;ve gotten!</li>
            <li>My hair prefers to be blow-dried and/or straightened {it&#x27;s more pleasantly manageable when it is}.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve dropped them plenty of times and it&#x27;s amazingly durable.</li>
            <li>I put it between 300 and 370 and the results were amazing.</li>
            <li>It is an amazing straightener.</li>
            <li>amazingly well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works, and it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>liked this product</li>
            <li>She did like this prodyct, but told me it felt kind ofcheap.  </li>
            <li>As nice as a Chi...</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>I own a babybliss</li>
            <li>Heats fast and works great!</li>
            <li>I have kind of frizzy wavy hair</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t come with its own sleeve or case for travel.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>and it is really nice.</li>
            <li>It looks nice, too.</li>
            <li>my hair will still look nice and shiny; 3) it doesn&#x27;t fry up my hair,  </li>
            <li>great flat iron with a great price.  </li>
            <li>When I first began using the Solia, I did not use a heat protectant with it, and experienced many split ends, and a bit of breakage.</li>
            <li>I loved it because it never gave me any heat damage, was easy to use, and genuinely straightened my hair without me having to turn it up to 1200 degrees (exaggeration).</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Okay I will admit it:</li>
            <li>Love these straightners.</li>
            <li>My wife says; \\&quot;I have to say this is one of the best iron I have ever purchased .It&#x27;s such an amazing quality ,it works smoothly and incredibly .I&#x27;m completely satisfied by its work.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brand for many years now.</li>
            <li>so I love that I can adjust the heat setting.</li>
            <li>of these irons are way better than any drug store or discount store iron I have tried but over all the Solia is way better for me.</li>
            <li>but it also works better in comparison to the CHI.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Before I returned it though, I decided to try one more thing.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s not completely horrible.</li>
            <li>Mine finally died.. looked for the best one I could find.  </li>
            <li>It is also doing a lot more damage to my hair.</li>
            <li>Yes, it did do some damage to my hair in the form of split ends, but I probably could have prevented that by being more diligent in using more product on my hair to protect it.  </li>
            <li>I had switched years ago from the 1.5 that I used to love to the 1.0.</li>
            <li>Your Flat-iron is better than any I&#x27;ve had (at 450 degrees.)</li>
            <li>Others (names excluded) say they heat to (450, for the straightening process) but for whatever reason yours did a better job for me on this treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li>The solia is much cheaper and it is great.</li>
            <li>Work fabulously!  </li>
            <li>I love them both</li>
            <li>I love the adjustable heat settings.</li>
            <li>I bought it off of Folica, but the price seems to be better here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>19.00 bucks which I gladly paid.</li>
            <li>KUDOS TO FOLICA&#x27;S OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I have become hooked on the Sedu Argan Oil polishing treatment that makes my hair look so much better than it</li>
            <li>she seems to love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What I absolutely love about this straightener is how shiny and smooth my hair looks!</li>
            <li>Many ceramic irons were priced hirer</li>
            <li>(So I have not tried any of the more premium/expensive models like the Chi, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I am glad I decided to change and hope this will be my brand for awhile.</li>
            <li>Even though I love Amazon, I did get it cheaper at Folica.com with their discount.</li>
            <li>It straightens my hair in one stroke, when most irons I&#x27;ve tried wont.</li>
            <li>SOLIA doesn&#x27;t have any of those drawbacks, so for that reason, I LOVE the Solia.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and the product is great.  </li>
            <li>Better than my chi</li>
            <li>Love, love, love.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>this iron reaches the ideal temperature quickly, does not damage the hair and leaves it healthy and very smooth, really recommend it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best flat iron I have ever used, and it stands up to the Texas humidity</li>
            <li>One of the best flat irons i ever owned.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever tried, ( and I&#x27;ve tried a lot)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for 4-5 years, and it&#x27;s still in great shape and working like new!</li>
            <li>Best flat iron!</li>
            <li>Best flat iron I&#x27;ve purchased yet!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will update this review as my use continues, but for me, this is as good as some of the pricier models if not better and toy save a good chunk of change in the process!!</li>
            <li>8+ years is a pretty good life for a straightener</li>
            <li>I get tons of compliments on how healthy, soft and great</li>
            <li>I was so happy to buy a straightener with such great reviews and ranked higher then a Chi.</li>
            <li>This is worth every penny, I love it!</li>
            <li>Purchase, and enjoy :]</li>
            <li>It transformed my waves into straight sleek hair, and the results lasted all day (through 100 degree heat and a good level of humidity</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s still incredibly frizzy before I flat iron it).</li>
            <li>Also wanted one that the temperature dial wouldn&#x27;t change easily by my hand as I used it.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to straighten with--not cumbersome or clunky at all.    </li>
            <li>this is the absolute best by far</li>
            <li>It gives a lot of heat and is easy to handle.</li>
            <li>I bought it from Folica about 7 years ago, and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine</li>
            <li>and I would always straighten the majority of my hair, besides the fine hair that&#x27;s close to my scalp, at 450 degrees.)  </li>
            <li>Having fine hair, I need a lower (200 degree) setting for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who has fine or chemically treated hair.</li>
            <li>and she said it still works fine).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another good thing about it, is that it get hot, but I can get right to the roots without burning myself.</li>
            <li>it better come out looking fabulous and quickly.</li>
            <li>Now I know what a huge difference it makes.</li>
            <li>Her hair is nice and shiny afterwards and she really enjoys it.  </li>
            <li>Solia  goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>It pulls hair evenly through it and it is light weight.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair really smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>there is humidity somewhere on planet Earth, time to frizz!\\&quot; hair, and this straightener makes it silky smooth.</li>
            <li>However I don&#x27;t feel my hair looks as smooth as I would like.</li>
            <li>No breakage &amp; always leaves my hair shiny &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>I had purchased and returned two irons prior to taking a chance on the Solia and I am so happy that I did.  </li>
            <li>the cheap stuff from the drugstore will do.</li>
            <li>; 2) the hair stays smooth for hours without need for touch up - if I press it in the morning, go out for the day, come home,</li>
            <li>Compact design, thermostat control, heats quickly, genuine product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been all over the US and Europe with me, and I never had any issues with it until now - the light doesn&#x27;t blink and it doesn&#x27;t stay hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this flat iron works great and the benefit it has over others I&#x27;ve purchased (including another $150 model that fell apart) is the temperature control.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product and DEFINITELY worth the price!</li>
            <li>Great flat iron for the price.</li>
            <li>My hair dresser said they were both great flat irons and to just buy the cheaper one.  </li>
            <li>We are extremely happy with the Solia Tourmaline Ceramic Ion Flat Iron.  </li>
            <li>This is a great flat iron.</li>
            <li>This flat iron worked great until it stopped working.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried almost every professional straightener and this one doesn&#x27;t compare to any of them, mostly because this one leaves your hair very smooth and straight for days!!!</li>
            <li>but I figured I would give it a try anyways; it was completely worth the investment!  </li>
            <li>Solid piece to own until it breaks!</li>
            <li>I had the original Chi before this and it had no temp adjustment.</li>
            <li>It has been worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I originally bought it because I was torn between a Sedu and the Solia.  </li>
            <li>Gets hot pretty fast &amp; the heat pouch is great.</li>
            <li>You can get it fixed but it&#x27;ll cost you more to fix it and ship it, more then its worth!</li>
            <li>If you air dry your hair then use this, its great.</li>
            <li>The dial and &amp;#34;on/off&amp;#34; switch are just kind of &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;, I&#x27;ve owned cheaper straighteners with dials or digital temperature settings that were a bit better.</li>
            <li>So far this is one of the best flat irons I have had.  </li>
            <li>Does a great job straightening on the first go, especially for my hair.</li>
            <li>The plates are really smooth and it has a good long cord.</li>
            <li>straight considering i have curly curly hair :]</li>
            <li>I have been very please for many years.</li>
            <li>I have had mine for at least 5 years and it is still the best one I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Think I found the sweet spot there.</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>This is a good iron--my hair definitely looks healthier since I started using it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, that being said, this is a fantastic flat iron and is exceptional at straightening, putting waves/curls in longer hair (mine is right at waist-length), smoothing/de-frizzing, and adding a fabulous shine.</li>
            <li>, I can honestly say that this is a great flat iron and not only is it cheaper</li>
            <li>I asked around and some other friends said they were happy with their Solias as well.</li>
            <li>When my mother came over, she wanted to try them because she&#x27;s also looking for a good flat iron.</li>
            <li>And it is quick, too.</li>
            <li>I have been a loyal user since 2010.  </li>
            <li>However, since I work rather quickly while doing my hair and am accustomed to dealing with heat</li>
            <li>I do quick touch ups on day 2, and it still looks like day 1.</li>
            <li>It does however get my hair very straight!</li>
            <li>and this makes it very straight and silky feeling!  </li>
            <li>This flat iron is great for straightening hair but for me it did not keep my hair straight.</li>
            <li>The new one appears to be lighter and it feels better while using it.  </li>
            <li>Shipped fast, easy transaction.</li>
            <li>I will say at first I didn&#x27;t LOVE it so much, however....</li>
            <li>n sleek and polished in a very natural, not over the top way.</li>
            <li>these days will last that long, so I am more than happy with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I straighten those fine hairs at 300 degrees because anything any hotter will make them stick out straight.  </li>
            <li>like I&#x27;ve experienced with other higher end straighteners.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair smooth and shiny and straight.</li>
            <li>It makes the hair really silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>my fiance old remington did better job than this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far this is an ok Iron.</li>
            <li>I pretty much love everything about the straightener, including the long chord the movable plates to prevent tangling and the sleek easy to clean design.</li>
            <li>I no longer use my Solia now, because I&#x27;m natural, and wear my hair curly, but my mother and sister both love it now.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find it to be near as good as my old Chi that I had for years.  </li>
            <li>After almost four months, we&#x27;ve started using it more frequently.</li>
            <li>Yes, I could find something cheaper but it is worth it to splurge for quality, durability, and reliability.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the $$.</li>
            <li>Flat iron works good for now, heats up really fast.</li>
            <li>It gets hot quickly and does not pull my hair.  </li>
            <li>SUPER FAST!</li>
            <li>This definitely is an amazing flat iron.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&amp;#34;That&#x27;s a nice flat iron,&amp;#34</li>
            <li>What I like most about this iron is that you don&#x27;t need high temperatures to get the hair straight (unlike cheaper or drugstore brands).  </li>
            <li>It always seemed to happen right after the year warranty expires too.</li>
            <li>It also helps a ton to use some sort of serum or spray conditioner right before you use these.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m bummed, but hey, we learn right?</li>
            <li>Glides right through hair and keeps it&lt;br /&gt;Straight.</li>
            <li>My hair curls very easily with any curling iron, but for some reason, this flat iron would not hold a curl.  </li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and maintains heat very well.</li>
            <li>I have tried a few different brands of hair straighteners over the years and this is one I find works the best.  </li>
            <li>It has kept working for all of these years as i have used it constantly, still performing superbly to straighten those tight curls!</li>
            <li>My roommates and friends always borrowed it when getting ready, even if they had their own flat iron.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t put much product, if any, in my hair so its all about how I blow-dry and how the straightener treats my hair!</li>
            <li>More recently I owned the Sedu.</li>
            <li>Very comparable to the Chi in my opinion!</li>
            <li>but I dropped it one too many times and it broke last weekend.</li>
            <li>but since the highest temperature is not that hot it didn&#x27;t burn anything it was sitting on.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The irons didn&#x27;t seem to get hot and the ends would NOT curl.</li>
            <li>This was my never fail hair straightener, I knew I could always count on it to get the job done.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Better luck next time. :)</li>
            <li>Gets the job done fast!</li>
            <li>My first straightener was a cheapie with metal plates.</li>
            <li>like I want but other than that I love it!</li>
            <li>I love that the Solia goes all the way up to 450 degrees, but I only needed to set it to 350-375 degrees.</li>
            <li>my hair is straight and shiny!</li>
            <li>Heat nice but not what I expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this exact straightener for over 7 years and the paddles just broke.</li>
            <li>I was searching for a quality iron after my old (and cheap)</li>
            <li>ordered the red (my favorite color)</li>
            <li>This iron does the trick to get the hair straight!</li>
            <li>It worked for 1 year and 1 week exactly.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several different flat irons and this is the best.</li>
            <li>I bought this straightener after much research on finding the right product for me.</li>
            <li>My original review stands true, that I can&#x27;t touch-up my hair after a week, but if you actually wrap your hair every night like I should be doing then you won&#x27;t have a problem.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that is very wavy in most areas and slightly curly in others.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>Love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>Top quality flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I love this flat Iron it leaves my hair just like it says, silky.</li>
            <li>I have had this flat iron for more than 8 years.</li>
            <li>Love my flat iron.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>My favorite flat iron.</li>
            <li>This is my all-time favorite flat iron/hair straightener.</li>
            <li>Ok so I loveeee these flat irons!</li>
            <li>but I remembered why I loved the (larger than 1&amp;#34; but smaller than 2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Please remember to use a heat protectant with this flat iron, or it will most certainly cause damage.</li>
            <li>This was also pretty good, did the job, but lasted less than 18 months before the cord issues meant that the power went on and off, so completely unacceptable for the price point!</li>
            <li>I waited 3 days once to wash my hair and it was still as straight as it was the first day.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast &amp; stays hot.</li>
            <li>When I first used it, the heat settingwas at 370, but that was too much for me.  </li>
            <li>Heats up fast and straightens on the first pass.</li>
            <li>The product meets all my expectations: heats up quickly and  irons quickly and smoothly (only need to pull iron over each section 1 time!).</li>
            <li>The straightener heated up to way past what it normally would on the temperature dial before it finally died, and it most conveniently died when I was straightening the most fine pieces of my hair.  </li>
            <li>It heats up fast, doesn&#x27;t tug at my hair, and gets my hair straight on the first pass.</li>
            <li>This iron&#x27;s plates have remained smooth, held no build-up, and provided even and consistent heat distribution for the entire 2 years that I have owned it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I was open to trying new things.</li>
            <li>When I put the straightener on those fine pieces, my hair started smoking and instantly became crunchy.  </li>
            <li>This is a sturdy product, has a lot of different heat settings and heats up quickly!</li>
            <li>Curls your hair very well though</li>
            <li>but I have a lot of it - so plenty of fly-aways, some frizz, and its VERY tolerant against heat and products.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>After sleeping, my hair was still remarkably straight which was an added bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very comparable to the Chi in my opinion!and toy</li>
            <li>Hair stays straight during humid weather and silky.</li>
            <li>... Leads me to believe that this company has used a system to game the google search results so that nothing but great reviews PPP up when looking for how to fix this straightener made of brittle plastic.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>My hair stayed straight for days in the Florida humidity, with the Sedu</li>
            <li>Bought this for my daughter who has really curly hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair was already straight, but the ends were messed up and needed a touch up.</li>
            <li>I have my hair cut in layers and it really brought that cut out.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron, works really well and makes my hair feel amazingly soft!  </li>
            <li>The adjustable temperature dial is very helpful for when i want to do touchups.</li>
            <li>That really is a difference</li>
            <li>My hair is so much smoother...</li>
            <li>heats up fast leaving a sleek looking hairstyle.</li>
            <li>If I were to use the Solia at a lower temperature say 410F, my hair wouldn&#x27;t get straight in 1 to 2 passes.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>gets it really straight and shiny.</li>
            <li>It straightens and curls hair really well.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The ceramic plates are really the way to go--metal destroys your hair.</li>
            <li>I have really wavy hair</li>
            <li>- of course now she spends another 30 minutes in the bathroom getting ready every morning</li>
            <li>/&gt;the tempreture can also be adjusted which i like very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does not meet my expectations, it remains straight hair</li>
            <li>It does really well on my daughters hair without drying it out and breaking it off.</li>
            <li>My hair holds curl well and does not like to stay straight on humid days.</li>
            <li>I really like the temperature control.</li>
            <li>Not curly, not spiraled, just straight up nappy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Heats very quickly&lt;</li>
            <li>I really think they were counterfeit items.</li>
            <li>It still takes several passes on my hair to get it really smooth, but it eventually gets there.</li>
            <li>There was no shine or real smoothness</li>
            <li>This flat iron works well on fine hair and has an adjustable heat setting.  </li>
            <li>I have retired the first iron and just ordered a new one as a replacement</li>
            <li>Bought this for my daughter in early Jan 2015  after seeing other reviews and also it was cheaper than the kind that is demonstrated inside malls from a kiosk.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to use it, so I only used it on part of my hair.</li>
            <li>and I received a flat iron pouch and a 2 yr warranty for free.</li>
            <li>I have owned other top brand&lt;br /&gt;Flat</li>
            <li>For the price it is amazing for the long lasting quality results.</li>
            <li>At first I was so excited when I got it, then I started using and realized it was just the same as my old Remington straightener..</li>
            <li>I would still highly recommend it to those who wish for straight hair.</li>
            <li>This is an expensive straightener, but I couldn&#x27;t enjoy it more!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair pretty soft after I use it</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve left them on for a full day before,</li>
            <li>I have to take a few more passes through my hair than I would like, since that&#x27;s why I bought a new straightener in the first place.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this straightener for more than 8 years and it only just recently broke.</li>
            <li>another reason why I was replacing my older one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cord is nice and long, but not so long that you&#x27;ll be tripping over it.     </li>
            <li>If you care for it, it will not fail you - let it cool, gently \\&quot;fold\\&quot; the cord in the same pattern it came \\&quot;folded\\&quot; in and put it back in the box for storage.</li>
            <li>I was highly upset and was looking for ways to return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ive had my straightener for 5 years now, and having dense curly hair has always required me to have a high quality straightener.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this straightener.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>I would highly suggest investing in this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have occasionally met marginally better flat irons, in upscale salons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first flat iron and the first couple of times I used it, I was scared of burning off or permanently straightening my hair, so I underestimated the amount of heat I would need and set it at about 310, 320.</li>
            <li>This flat iron worked fine for the first few months, but then the cord was constantly in a knot, no matter how many times I untangled it.  </li>
            <li>These felt a little more bulky and heavier.</li>
            <li>Now that&#x27;s old school customer service there!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Easier to clean, sedu just a wipe with a dry cloth, Solia needed a cleaning iron solution</li>
            <li>It really does bring out your hairs natural moisture.</li>
            <li>They have to ask the client how they normally wear their hair and when I say I straighten it, they are in some disbelief -</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know how well the product will hold up or how long it will last (although my friend has had her for many years</li>
            <li>I was an occasional user and never dropped it and rarely traveled with it.</li>
            <li>(I used to work in a salon), this is not such an issue for me, but would likely be for some people with more sensitive fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hair came out nearly bone-straight, ultra shiny after only one pass-through, and I discovered my hair&#x27;s true length.</li>
            <li>combined this iron with a good heat protectant spray, and worked with small strands of hair at a time, so that definitely helped the results.</li>
            <li>The sedu requires retouch every 2-3 hours for me at least, if I don&#x27;t do touch ups - and honestly who has the time during the day?</li>
            <li>The iron still only gets 4 stars because now I feel like I won&#x27;t be able to touch it up after a week, I&#x27;ll have no choice but to use my old flat iron for that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The reviews seemed good, the price point a little kinder and after my short lived Sedu experience, I was skeptical of paying a high price for a straightener again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to be fair, at the time of writing this review I have owned this just one week, but so far, I am a fan!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t complain much because it did serve me well in the 3 years that I used it, but I would have rather kept those pieces of hair in tact without them being super crunchy due to the high heat.  </li>
            <li>than you normally might if you have sensitive fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 1/2 Stars!</li>
            <li>I comfortably straighten my transitioning 4a/b African-American hair at a temperature no higher than 360 degrees.  </li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t think I can live without it.</li>
            <li>I decided to try a new brand</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m shopping around for a new iron but think I may just get another Solia</li>
            <li>in the day, it was the cheaper kind you buy at the drug store, but in the last few years I have now been the owner of the Chi, the Sedu and now this -</li>
            <li>and I managed to straighten my long hair in remarkably quick time; the design made it comfortable to hold and one swipe down my hair was all it</li>
            <li>The outside middle gets very hot, more than it should since that&#x27;s where one&#x27;s fingers typically would be when holding this.</li>
            <li>other thing I love is that over the last 2-years I have started chemically-straightening my hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how hot it must have gotten, but I hadn&#x27;t done anything different with it that I&#x27;ve done in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m natural (4a/3c) and it still doesn&#x27;t give me any heat damage!</li>
            <li>This flat iron seemd to great for those with thin hair or finer hair.</li>
            <li>This was my go-to for so long, I think I&#x27;m going to have to run right out and get a new one.</li>
            <li>Her hair is never dry and coarse after using this and the temperature setting makes it easy to make her hair different levels of straightness.</li>
            <li>I first purchased this Solia flat iron about 8 years ago, based on a recommendation from a friend.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t straighten it well enough, yet temps higher than that really damage my strands to the point where the ends feel brittle, also the results at higher temps don&#x27;t last long anyway.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday at only 320-360 heat and my hair does not feel brittle or dry, it stays moist (using only a dab of Crisco as heat protectant lol); 4) the size allows me to do curls and flips for versatility.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t tried any others, but I&#x27;d say if you&#x27;re a 4B girl looking for her first good flat iron, you can&#x27;t go wrong with the Solia for this price range.</li>
            <li>just recently did I notice that the heat in it had started to fade a little, not too many products</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t mind it so much if I didn&#x27;t have to keep straightening my hair (sometimes 3 extra times a day).</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;ve had to pass it twice near the scalp and once through to the ends and it will do the job.</li>
            <li>No complaints so far.</li>
            <li>I have to take much smaller strands of hair and go much slower.  </li>
            <li>my old one.   </li>
            <li>Also, if you are looking to CURL your hair with this, you cannot do so very well because the outside doesn&#x27;t heat up a lot.</li>
            <li>And it stays straight the next day  if I don&#x27;t shower that night)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t turn off automatically like my old one.  </li>
            <li>My daughter completely abhors her curly hair, so I made her deal that I would straighten her hair every 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>When I got the Solia, I was surprised at how it didn&#x27;t pinch my hair like the Chi did.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, does not work nearly as good as my Chi.  </li>
            <li>I have had it for 3 years now and use it about every other day because when it straightens my hair it does exactly what I dreamed it would!</li>
            <li>#34;how much would a flat iron like that</li>
            <li>I absolutely adored my Solia flat iron when I was using it!</li>
            <li>Not sure if it was finally dropped too many times or the cat getting a hold of the cord</li>
            <li>It works great on my thick, wavy hair and takes less time to straighten than my old flat iron.</li>
            <li>My hair does not look dead or dry, it has a healthy look.</li>
            <li>would give this flat iron 5 stars if the outside didn&#x27;t get as surprisingly hot as it does.</li>
            <li>The damage done to my hair was drastically reduced when I began using a heat protectant, just know that no heat protectant will fully protect you from damage 100%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Solia, however, is a top-of-the-line flat iron made with tourmaline, and ceramic, which is much less damaging than most cheaply-made flat irons.</li>
            <li>and there wasn&#x27;t enough time to get a new one.</li>
            <li>I only bought a new one because I went to Europe and my plug converter fried it.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t keep my hair straight very long.</li>
            <li>It only takes one swipe to get my hair bone straight, Solia it took around 3&lt;br /&gt;- Short time to straighten hair, Solia took about 10 min.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s sturdy, heats up quickly (30 seconds), and straightens in just a few swipes without frying, snagging, or damaging hair.</li>
            <li>needless to say this is a FANTASTIC STRAIGHTENER!!</li>
            <li>My only complaint is I don&#x27;t love the way it curls, but I am new to this flat iron, so I may just need to get used to it being different from my old one.</li>
            <li>but Solia wins by a little.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m on Amazon now shopping for a new flat iron, I will NOT be buying a Solia.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve taken this curling iron everywhere, tossed it into bags, dropped it, and have generally been unloving and unkind.</li>
            <li>However, last week it completely stopped working for no reason.</li>
            <li>Apparently it is.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to go ahead and buy another solia even though my Sedu is only a couple months old.</li>
            <li>For the price I expected it to work much longer than a year.</li>
            <li>I bought this flat iron because after 4 years my CHI finally gave out, I read a few reviews and figured that this would do just fine</li>
            <li>I used this flat iron once a week, and with proper care, my hair stayed straight the entire week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had professional dryers, but never thought it mattered with a flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I did a lot of research before buying this flat iron after my old Chi broke.</li>
            <li>First major issue with this iron, is that it snagged my hair a few times.</li>
            <li>This iron takes twice as long to straighten my hair as my old one did.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s pretty heavy...</li>
            <li>I decided since I was beginning a new  journey towards healthier hair, I would invest in a quality professional straightening iron to (hopefully) straighten my hair with less damage.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for short and long hair, as I&#x27;ve used it when I had chin length hair and currently have thick, wavy, long hair past my belly button.  </li>
            <li>My hair type...long, very thick, wavy, very frizzy, and a lot of it (like Julia Roberts when she first came on the scene)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s VERY thick, no relaxer, although its pretty straight on</li>
            <li>love the pressure-sensitive mechanism that causes the plates to cushion down in case you press too hard.</li>
            <li>My hair was extremely shiny and soft, and laid down exactly how I wanted it.</li>
            <li>I have very course black hair and the Solia</li>
            <li>definitely worth the money - it does in 10 min what lesser flat irons took me a half an hour to do!</li>
            <li>For years, I thought Chi was the only way to go, but there are a lot of other high quality options on the market now.</li>
            <li>Sedu, Solano, Babyliss, Chi, Sally brands, Remington, ConAir, and those crappy ones they sell at booths in the shopping mall (listed in order from good to bad)</li>
    </ol>

            <li> but it&#x27;s not the best one I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a good straightener</li>
            <li> I LOVED it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now to compare, I loved my Chi, felt it was a quality product</li>
            <li> loved my Solia but after 3 years the plates unattached.</li>
            <li> I loved it</li>
            <li> I loved this straightener too....</li>
            <li> Good buy.</li>
            <li> and I loved it, until it died.</li>
            <li> This one had good reviews, so I decided to get it.</li>
            <li> Loved it when I got it...</li>
            <li> Really good.</li>
            <li> I read good reviews on Solia and Hai</li>
            <li> it was good</li>
            <li> The Solia does a good job of straightening my hair without damaging it.</li>
            <li> Loved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have been a Chi girl over 20 years, loved the price for the Solia.  </li>
            <li> Frankly I didn&#x27;t notice that it was that good of an iron to begin with.</li>
            <li> Heats quickly and straightens beautifully!</li>
            <li> But best of all, my hair has never looked so straight and so shiny!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> and I always love to keep a spare around so, I will buy another!</li>
            <li> Love the temp adjustment feature!</li>
            <li> Also I love the temperature settings that get up to 450 degrees because I need a lot of heat!</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know how I could have got a better deal!</li>
            <li> Buying another one for sure!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect and the plates are blue, my favorite color :D</li>
            <li> ; it&#x27;s one of the most used presents I&#x27;ve gotten!</li>
            <li> My hair prefers to be blow-dried and/or straightened {it&#x27;s more pleasantly manageable when it is}.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dropped them plenty of times and it&#x27;s amazingly durable.</li>
            <li> I put it between 300 and 370 and the results were amazing.</li>
            <li> It is an amazing straightener.</li>
            <li> amazingly well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works, and it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> liked this product</li>
            <li> She did like this prodyct, but told me it felt kind ofcheap.  </li>
            <li> As nice as a Chi...</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> I own a babybliss</li>
            <li> Heats fast and works great!</li>
            <li> I have kind of frizzy wavy hair</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t come with its own sleeve or case for travel.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> and it is really nice.</li>
            <li> It looks nice, too.</li>
            <li> my hair will still look nice and shiny; 3) it doesn&#x27;t fry up my hair,  </li>
            <li> great flat iron with a great price.  </li>
            <li> When I first began using the Solia, I did not use a heat protectant with it, and experienced many split ends, and a bit of breakage.</li>
            <li> I loved it because it never gave me any heat damage, was easy to use, and genuinely straightened my hair without me having to turn it up to 1200 degrees (exaggeration).</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> Okay I will admit it:</li>
            <li> Love these straightners.</li>
            <li> My wife says; \\&quot;I have to say this is one of the best iron I have ever purchased .It&#x27;s such an amazing quality ,it works smoothly and incredibly .I&#x27;m completely satisfied by its work.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for many years now.</li>
            <li> so I love that I can adjust the heat setting.</li>
            <li> of these irons are way better than any drug store or discount store iron I have tried but over all the Solia is way better for me.</li>
            <li> but it also works better in comparison to the CHI.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before I returned it though, I decided to try one more thing.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not completely horrible.</li>
            <li> Mine finally died.. looked for the best one I could find.  </li>
            <li> It is also doing a lot more damage to my hair.</li>
            <li> Yes, it did do some damage to my hair in the form of split ends, but I probably could have prevented that by being more diligent in using more product on my hair to protect it.  </li>
            <li> I had switched years ago from the 1.5 that I used to love to the 1.0.</li>
            <li> Your Flat-iron is better than any I&#x27;ve had (at 450 degrees.)</li>
            <li> Others (names excluded) say they heat to (450, for the straightening process) but for whatever reason yours did a better job for me on this treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li> The solia is much cheaper and it is great.</li>
            <li> Work fabulously!  </li>
            <li> I love them both</li>
            <li> I love the adjustable heat settings.</li>
            <li> I bought it off of Folica, but the price seems to be better here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> 19.00 bucks which I gladly paid.</li>
            <li> KUDOS TO FOLICA&#x27;S OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I have become hooked on the Sedu Argan Oil polishing treatment that makes my hair look so much better than it</li>
            <li> she seems to love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What I absolutely love about this straightener is how shiny and smooth my hair looks!</li>
            <li> Many ceramic irons were priced hirer</li>
            <li> (So I have not tried any of the more premium/expensive models like the Chi, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I am glad I decided to change and hope this will be my brand for awhile.</li>
            <li> Even though I love Amazon, I did get it cheaper at Folica.com with their discount.</li>
            <li> It straightens my hair in one stroke, when most irons I&#x27;ve tried wont.</li>
            <li> SOLIA doesn&#x27;t have any of those drawbacks, so for that reason, I LOVE the Solia.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and the product is great.  </li>
            <li> Better than my chi</li>
            <li> Love, love, love.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> this iron reaches the ideal temperature quickly, does not damage the hair and leaves it healthy and very smooth, really recommend it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best flat iron I have ever used, and it stands up to the Texas humidity</li>
            <li> One of the best flat irons i ever owned.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever tried, ( and I&#x27;ve tried a lot)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for 4-5 years, and it&#x27;s still in great shape and working like new!</li>
            <li> Best flat iron!</li>
            <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve purchased yet!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will update this review as my use continues, but for me, this is as good as some of the pricier models if not better and toy save a good chunk of change in the process!!</li>
            <li> 8+ years is a pretty good life for a straightener</li>
            <li> I get tons of compliments on how healthy, soft and great</li>
            <li> I was so happy to buy a straightener with such great reviews and ranked higher then a Chi.</li>
            <li> This is worth every penny, I love it!</li>
            <li> Purchase, and enjoy :]</li>
            <li> It transformed my waves into straight sleek hair, and the results lasted all day (through 100 degree heat and a good level of humidity</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s still incredibly frizzy before I flat iron it).</li>
            <li> Also wanted one that the temperature dial wouldn&#x27;t change easily by my hand as I used it.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to straighten with--not cumbersome or clunky at all.    </li>
            <li> this is the absolute best by far</li>
            <li> It gives a lot of heat and is easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I bought it from Folica about 7 years ago, and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine</li>
            <li> and I would always straighten the majority of my hair, besides the fine hair that&#x27;s close to my scalp, at 450 degrees.)  </li>
            <li> Having fine hair, I need a lower (200 degree) setting for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who has fine or chemically treated hair.</li>
            <li> and she said it still works fine).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another good thing about it, is that it get hot, but I can get right to the roots without burning myself.</li>
            <li> it better come out looking fabulous and quickly.</li>
            <li> Now I know what a huge difference it makes.</li>
            <li> Her hair is nice and shiny afterwards and she really enjoys it.  </li>
            <li> Solia  goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> It pulls hair evenly through it and it is light weight.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair really smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> there is humidity somewhere on planet Earth, time to frizz!\\&quot; hair, and this straightener makes it silky smooth.</li>
            <li> However I don&#x27;t feel my hair looks as smooth as I would like.</li>
            <li> No breakage &amp; always leaves my hair shiny &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> I had purchased and returned two irons prior to taking a chance on the Solia and I am so happy that I did.  </li>
            <li> the cheap stuff from the drugstore will do.</li>
            <li> ; 2) the hair stays smooth for hours without need for touch up - if I press it in the morning, go out for the day, come home,</li>
            <li> Compact design, thermostat control, heats quickly, genuine product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been all over the US and Europe with me, and I never had any issues with it until now - the light doesn&#x27;t blink and it doesn&#x27;t stay hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this flat iron works great and the benefit it has over others I&#x27;ve purchased (including another $150 model that fell apart) is the temperature control.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product and DEFINITELY worth the price!</li>
            <li> Great flat iron for the price.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser said they were both great flat irons and to just buy the cheaper one.  </li>
            <li> We are extremely happy with the Solia Tourmaline Ceramic Ion Flat Iron.  </li>
            <li> This is a great flat iron.</li>
            <li> This flat iron worked great until it stopped working.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost every professional straightener and this one doesn&#x27;t compare to any of them, mostly because this one leaves your hair very smooth and straight for days!!!</li>
            <li> but I figured I would give it a try anyways; it was completely worth the investment!  </li>
            <li> Solid piece to own until it breaks!</li>
            <li> I had the original Chi before this and it had no temp adjustment.</li>
            <li> It has been worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I originally bought it because I was torn between a Sedu and the Solia.  </li>
            <li> Gets hot pretty fast &amp; the heat pouch is great.</li>
            <li> You can get it fixed but it&#x27;ll cost you more to fix it and ship it, more then its worth!</li>
            <li> If you air dry your hair then use this, its great.</li>
            <li> The dial and &amp;#34;on/off&amp;#34; switch are just kind of &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;, I&#x27;ve owned cheaper straighteners with dials or digital temperature settings that were a bit better.</li>
            <li> So far this is one of the best flat irons I have had.  </li>
            <li> Does a great job straightening on the first go, especially for my hair.</li>
            <li> The plates are really smooth and it has a good long cord.</li>
            <li> straight considering i have curly curly hair :]</li>
            <li> I have been very please for many years.</li>
            <li> I have had mine for at least 5 years and it is still the best one I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Think I found the sweet spot there.</li>
            <li> I love it so much</li>
            <li> This is a good iron--my hair definitely looks healthier since I started using it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, that being said, this is a fantastic flat iron and is exceptional at straightening, putting waves/curls in longer hair (mine is right at waist-length), smoothing/de-frizzing, and adding a fabulous shine.</li>
            <li> , I can honestly say that this is a great flat iron and not only is it cheaper</li>
            <li> I asked around and some other friends said they were happy with their Solias as well.</li>
            <li> When my mother came over, she wanted to try them because she&#x27;s also looking for a good flat iron.</li>
            <li> And it is quick, too.</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal user since 2010.  </li>
            <li> However, since I work rather quickly while doing my hair and am accustomed to dealing with heat</li>
            <li> I do quick touch ups on day 2, and it still looks like day 1.</li>
            <li> It does however get my hair very straight!</li>
            <li> and this makes it very straight and silky feeling!  </li>
            <li> This flat iron is great for straightening hair but for me it did not keep my hair straight.</li>
            <li> The new one appears to be lighter and it feels better while using it.  </li>
            <li> Shipped fast, easy transaction.</li>
            <li> I will say at first I didn&#x27;t LOVE it so much, however....</li>
            <li> n sleek and polished in a very natural, not over the top way.</li>
            <li> these days will last that long, so I am more than happy with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I straighten those fine hairs at 300 degrees because anything any hotter will make them stick out straight.  </li>
            <li> like I&#x27;ve experienced with other higher end straighteners.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair smooth and shiny and straight.</li>
            <li> It makes the hair really silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> my fiance old remington did better job than this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far this is an ok Iron.</li>
            <li> I pretty much love everything about the straightener, including the long chord the movable plates to prevent tangling and the sleek easy to clean design.</li>
            <li> I no longer use my Solia now, because I&#x27;m natural, and wear my hair curly, but my mother and sister both love it now.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it to be near as good as my old Chi that I had for years.  </li>
            <li> After almost four months, we&#x27;ve started using it more frequently.</li>
            <li> Yes, I could find something cheaper but it is worth it to splurge for quality, durability, and reliability.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the $$.</li>
            <li> Flat iron works good for now, heats up really fast.</li>
            <li> It gets hot quickly and does not pull my hair.  </li>
            <li> SUPER FAST!</li>
            <li> This definitely is an amazing flat iron.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#34;That&#x27;s a nice flat iron,&amp;#34</li>
            <li> What I like most about this iron is that you don&#x27;t need high temperatures to get the hair straight (unlike cheaper or drugstore brands).  </li>
            <li> It always seemed to happen right after the year warranty expires too.</li>
            <li> It also helps a ton to use some sort of serum or spray conditioner right before you use these.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m bummed, but hey, we learn right?</li>
            <li> Glides right through hair and keeps it&lt;br /&gt;Straight.</li>
            <li> My hair curls very easily with any curling iron, but for some reason, this flat iron would not hold a curl.  </li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and maintains heat very well.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different brands of hair straighteners over the years and this is one I find works the best.  </li>
            <li> It has kept working for all of these years as i have used it constantly, still performing superbly to straighten those tight curls!</li>
            <li> My roommates and friends always borrowed it when getting ready, even if they had their own flat iron.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t put much product, if any, in my hair so its all about how I blow-dry and how the straightener treats my hair!</li>
            <li> More recently I owned the Sedu.</li>
            <li> Very comparable to the Chi in my opinion!</li>
            <li> but I dropped it one too many times and it broke last weekend.</li>
            <li> but since the highest temperature is not that hot it didn&#x27;t burn anything it was sitting on.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The irons didn&#x27;t seem to get hot and the ends would NOT curl.</li>
            <li> This was my never fail hair straightener, I knew I could always count on it to get the job done.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Better luck next time. :)</li>
            <li> Gets the job done fast!</li>
            <li> My first straightener was a cheapie with metal plates.</li>
            <li> like I want but other than that I love it!</li>
            <li> I love that the Solia goes all the way up to 450 degrees, but I only needed to set it to 350-375 degrees.</li>
            <li> my hair is straight and shiny!</li>
            <li> Heat nice but not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this exact straightener for over 7 years and the paddles just broke.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a quality iron after my old (and cheap)</li>
            <li> ordered the red (my favorite color)</li>
            <li> This iron does the trick to get the hair straight!</li>
            <li> It worked for 1 year and 1 week exactly.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several different flat irons and this is the best.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener after much research on finding the right product for me.</li>
            <li> My original review stands true, that I can&#x27;t touch-up my hair after a week, but if you actually wrap your hair every night like I should be doing then you won&#x27;t have a problem.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that is very wavy in most areas and slightly curly in others.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> Top quality flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I love this flat Iron it leaves my hair just like it says, silky.</li>
            <li> I have had this flat iron for more than 8 years.</li>
            <li> Love my flat iron.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> My favorite flat iron.</li>
            <li> This is my all-time favorite flat iron/hair straightener.</li>
            <li> Ok so I loveeee these flat irons!</li>
            <li> but I remembered why I loved the (larger than 1&amp;#34; but smaller than 2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Please remember to use a heat protectant with this flat iron, or it will most certainly cause damage.</li>
            <li> This was also pretty good, did the job, but lasted less than 18 months before the cord issues meant that the power went on and off, so completely unacceptable for the price point!</li>
            <li> I waited 3 days once to wash my hair and it was still as straight as it was the first day.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast &amp; stays hot.</li>
            <li> When I first used it, the heat settingwas at 370, but that was too much for me.  </li>
            <li> Heats up fast and straightens on the first pass.</li>
            <li> The product meets all my expectations: heats up quickly and  irons quickly and smoothly (only need to pull iron over each section 1 time!).</li>
            <li> The straightener heated up to way past what it normally would on the temperature dial before it finally died, and it most conveniently died when I was straightening the most fine pieces of my hair.  </li>
            <li> It heats up fast, doesn&#x27;t tug at my hair, and gets my hair straight on the first pass.</li>
            <li> This iron&#x27;s plates have remained smooth, held no build-up, and provided even and consistent heat distribution for the entire 2 years that I have owned it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I was open to trying new things.</li>
            <li> When I put the straightener on those fine pieces, my hair started smoking and instantly became crunchy.  </li>
            <li> This is a sturdy product, has a lot of different heat settings and heats up quickly!</li>
            <li> Curls your hair very well though</li>
            <li> but I have a lot of it - so plenty of fly-aways, some frizz, and its VERY tolerant against heat and products.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> After sleeping, my hair was still remarkably straight which was an added bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very comparable to the Chi in my opinion!and toy</li>
            <li> Hair stays straight during humid weather and silky.</li>
            <li> ... Leads me to believe that this company has used a system to game the google search results so that nothing but great reviews PPP up when looking for how to fix this straightener made of brittle plastic.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> My hair stayed straight for days in the Florida humidity, with the Sedu</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter who has really curly hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair was already straight, but the ends were messed up and needed a touch up.</li>
            <li> I have my hair cut in layers and it really brought that cut out.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron, works really well and makes my hair feel amazingly soft!  </li>
            <li> The adjustable temperature dial is very helpful for when i want to do touchups.</li>
            <li> That really is a difference</li>
            <li> My hair is so much smoother...</li>
            <li> heats up fast leaving a sleek looking hairstyle.</li>
            <li> If I were to use the Solia at a lower temperature say 410F, my hair wouldn&#x27;t get straight in 1 to 2 passes.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> gets it really straight and shiny.</li>
            <li> It straightens and curls hair really well.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> The ceramic plates are really the way to go--metal destroys your hair.</li>
            <li> I have really wavy hair</li>
            <li> - of course now she spends another 30 minutes in the bathroom getting ready every morning</li>
            <li> /&gt;the tempreture can also be adjusted which i like very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does not meet my expectations, it remains straight hair</li>
            <li> It does really well on my daughters hair without drying it out and breaking it off.</li>
            <li> My hair holds curl well and does not like to stay straight on humid days.</li>
            <li> I really like the temperature control.</li>
            <li> Not curly, not spiraled, just straight up nappy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Heats very quickly&lt;</li>
            <li> I really think they were counterfeit items.</li>
            <li> It still takes several passes on my hair to get it really smooth, but it eventually gets there.</li>
            <li> There was no shine or real smoothness</li>
            <li> This flat iron works well on fine hair and has an adjustable heat setting.  </li>
            <li> I have retired the first iron and just ordered a new one as a replacement</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter in early Jan 2015  after seeing other reviews and also it was cheaper than the kind that is demonstrated inside malls from a kiosk.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to use it, so I only used it on part of my hair.</li>
            <li> and I received a flat iron pouch and a 2 yr warranty for free.</li>
            <li> I have owned other top brand&lt;br /&gt;Flat</li>
            <li> For the price it is amazing for the long lasting quality results.</li>
            <li> At first I was so excited when I got it, then I started using and realized it was just the same as my old Remington straightener..</li>
            <li> I would still highly recommend it to those who wish for straight hair.</li>
            <li> This is an expensive straightener, but I couldn&#x27;t enjoy it more!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair pretty soft after I use it</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve left them on for a full day before,</li>
            <li> I have to take a few more passes through my hair than I would like, since that&#x27;s why I bought a new straightener in the first place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener for more than 8 years and it only just recently broke.</li>
            <li> another reason why I was replacing my older one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cord is nice and long, but not so long that you&#x27;ll be tripping over it.     </li>
            <li> If you care for it, it will not fail you - let it cool, gently \\&quot;fold\\&quot; the cord in the same pattern it came \\&quot;folded\\&quot; in and put it back in the box for storage.</li>
            <li> I was highly upset and was looking for ways to return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ive had my straightener for 5 years now, and having dense curly hair has always required me to have a high quality straightener.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this straightener.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I would highly suggest investing in this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have occasionally met marginally better flat irons, in upscale salons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my first flat iron and the first couple of times I used it, I was scared of burning off or permanently straightening my hair, so I underestimated the amount of heat I would need and set it at about 310, 320.</li>
            <li> This flat iron worked fine for the first few months, but then the cord was constantly in a knot, no matter how many times I untangled it.  </li>
            <li> These felt a little more bulky and heavier.</li>
            <li> Now that&#x27;s old school customer service there!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Easier to clean, sedu just a wipe with a dry cloth, Solia needed a cleaning iron solution</li>
            <li> It really does bring out your hairs natural moisture.</li>
            <li> They have to ask the client how they normally wear their hair and when I say I straighten it, they are in some disbelief -</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how well the product will hold up or how long it will last (although my friend has had her for many years</li>
            <li> I was an occasional user and never dropped it and rarely traveled with it.</li>
            <li> (I used to work in a salon), this is not such an issue for me, but would likely be for some people with more sensitive fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hair came out nearly bone-straight, ultra shiny after only one pass-through, and I discovered my hair&#x27;s true length.</li>
            <li> combined this iron with a good heat protectant spray, and worked with small strands of hair at a time, so that definitely helped the results.</li>
            <li> The sedu requires retouch every 2-3 hours for me at least, if I don&#x27;t do touch ups - and honestly who has the time during the day?</li>
            <li> The iron still only gets 4 stars because now I feel like I won&#x27;t be able to touch it up after a week, I&#x27;ll have no choice but to use my old flat iron for that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The reviews seemed good, the price point a little kinder and after my short lived Sedu experience, I was skeptical of paying a high price for a straightener again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to be fair, at the time of writing this review I have owned this just one week, but so far, I am a fan!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t complain much because it did serve me well in the 3 years that I used it, but I would have rather kept those pieces of hair in tact without them being super crunchy due to the high heat.  </li>
            <li> than you normally might if you have sensitive fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 1/2 Stars!</li>
            <li> I comfortably straighten my transitioning 4a/b African-American hair at a temperature no higher than 360 degrees.  </li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t think I can live without it.</li>
            <li> I decided to try a new brand</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m shopping around for a new iron but think I may just get another Solia</li>
            <li> in the day, it was the cheaper kind you buy at the drug store, but in the last few years I have now been the owner of the Chi, the Sedu and now this -</li>
            <li> and I managed to straighten my long hair in remarkably quick time; the design made it comfortable to hold and one swipe down my hair was all it</li>
            <li> The outside middle gets very hot, more than it should since that&#x27;s where one&#x27;s fingers typically would be when holding this.</li>
            <li> other thing I love is that over the last 2-years I have started chemically-straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how hot it must have gotten, but I hadn&#x27;t done anything different with it that I&#x27;ve done in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m natural (4a/3c) and it still doesn&#x27;t give me any heat damage!</li>
            <li> This flat iron seemd to great for those with thin hair or finer hair.</li>
            <li> This was my go-to for so long, I think I&#x27;m going to have to run right out and get a new one.</li>
            <li> Her hair is never dry and coarse after using this and the temperature setting makes it easy to make her hair different levels of straightness.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this Solia flat iron about 8 years ago, based on a recommendation from a friend.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t straighten it well enough, yet temps higher than that really damage my strands to the point where the ends feel brittle, also the results at higher temps don&#x27;t last long anyway.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday at only 320-360 heat and my hair does not feel brittle or dry, it stays moist (using only a dab of Crisco as heat protectant lol); 4) the size allows me to do curls and flips for versatility.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried any others, but I&#x27;d say if you&#x27;re a 4B girl looking for her first good flat iron, you can&#x27;t go wrong with the Solia for this price range.</li>
            <li> just recently did I notice that the heat in it had started to fade a little, not too many products</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t mind it so much if I didn&#x27;t have to keep straightening my hair (sometimes 3 extra times a day).</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;ve had to pass it twice near the scalp and once through to the ends and it will do the job.</li>
            <li> No complaints so far.</li>
            <li> I have to take much smaller strands of hair and go much slower.  </li>
            <li> my old one.   </li>
            <li> Also, if you are looking to CURL your hair with this, you cannot do so very well because the outside doesn&#x27;t heat up a lot.</li>
            <li> And it stays straight the next day  if I don&#x27;t shower that night)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t turn off automatically like my old one.  </li>
            <li> My daughter completely abhors her curly hair, so I made her deal that I would straighten her hair every 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> When I got the Solia, I was surprised at how it didn&#x27;t pinch my hair like the Chi did.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, does not work nearly as good as my Chi.  </li>
            <li> I have had it for 3 years now and use it about every other day because when it straightens my hair it does exactly what I dreamed it would!</li>
            <li> #34;how much would a flat iron like that</li>
            <li> I absolutely adored my Solia flat iron when I was using it!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was finally dropped too many times or the cat getting a hold of the cord</li>
            <li> It works great on my thick, wavy hair and takes less time to straighten than my old flat iron.</li>
            <li> My hair does not look dead or dry, it has a healthy look.</li>
            <li> would give this flat iron 5 stars if the outside didn&#x27;t get as surprisingly hot as it does.</li>
            <li> The damage done to my hair was drastically reduced when I began using a heat protectant, just know that no heat protectant will fully protect you from damage 100%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Solia, however, is a top-of-the-line flat iron made with tourmaline, and ceramic, which is much less damaging than most cheaply-made flat irons.</li>
            <li> and there wasn&#x27;t enough time to get a new one.</li>
            <li> I only bought a new one because I went to Europe and my plug converter fried it.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t keep my hair straight very long.</li>
            <li> It only takes one swipe to get my hair bone straight, Solia it took around 3&lt;br /&gt;- Short time to straighten hair, Solia took about 10 min.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s sturdy, heats up quickly (30 seconds), and straightens in just a few swipes without frying, snagging, or damaging hair.</li>
            <li> needless to say this is a FANTASTIC STRAIGHTENER!!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is I don&#x27;t love the way it curls, but I am new to this flat iron, so I may just need to get used to it being different from my old one.</li>
            <li> but Solia wins by a little.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m on Amazon now shopping for a new flat iron, I will NOT be buying a Solia.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve taken this curling iron everywhere, tossed it into bags, dropped it, and have generally been unloving and unkind.</li>
            <li> However, last week it completely stopped working for no reason.</li>
            <li> Apparently it is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to go ahead and buy another solia even though my Sedu is only a couple months old.</li>
            <li> For the price I expected it to work much longer than a year.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron because after 4 years my CHI finally gave out, I read a few reviews and figured that this would do just fine</li>
            <li> I used this flat iron once a week, and with proper care, my hair stayed straight the entire week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had professional dryers, but never thought it mattered with a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before buying this flat iron after my old Chi broke.</li>
            <li> First major issue with this iron, is that it snagged my hair a few times.</li>
            <li> This iron takes twice as long to straighten my hair as my old one did.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s pretty heavy...</li>
            <li> I decided since I was beginning a new  journey towards healthier hair, I would invest in a quality professional straightening iron to (hopefully) straighten my hair with less damage.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for short and long hair, as I&#x27;ve used it when I had chin length hair and currently have thick, wavy, long hair past my belly button.  </li>
            <li> My hair type...long, very thick, wavy, very frizzy, and a lot of it (like Julia Roberts when she first came on the scene)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s VERY thick, no relaxer, although its pretty straight on</li>
            <li> love the pressure-sensitive mechanism that causes the plates to cushion down in case you press too hard.</li>
            <li> My hair was extremely shiny and soft, and laid down exactly how I wanted it.</li>
            <li> I have very course black hair and the Solia</li>
            <li> definitely worth the money - it does in 10 min what lesser flat irons took me a half an hour to do!</li>
            <li> For years, I thought Chi was the only way to go, but there are a lot of other high quality options on the market now.</li>
            <li> Sedu, Solano, Babyliss, Chi, Sally brands, Remington, ConAir, and those crappy ones they sell at booths in the shopping mall (listed in order from good to bad)</li>
            <li> If you are in the market for a high-quality flat iron, I highly recommend this one--just remember to hold it further down toward the bottom</li>
            <li> After a big big big research for flat irons I decided to buy this solia, and I wasn&#x27;t wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have try other irons even so called professional and they pull my hair.</li>
            <li> Leave&#x27;s my hair soft, shiny, and straighter than any other iron i have used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using that same flat iron almost every day since purchasing it and</li>
            <li> and she replaced hers with the same flat iron.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this flat iron job only lasted like 30 min before it begin to frizz all over again.&lt;br /&gt;used</li>
            <li> Another plusis that I can start the iron in the middle of a chunk of hair and it won&#x27;t leave a dent like cheaper flat irons do.</li>
            <li> If I ever need to purchase another flat iron, I will definitely be buying a Solia.</li>
            <li> I have been using the HAI 1 1/4 flat iron for the last 15 years.</li>
            <li> I got this flat iron in 2004 as a present and it has worked fantastically until a couple weeks ago.</li>
            <li> But I was wrong, I have been using this product about 5 times a week for a month and THE LONG TIME EFFECT is such a better result then</li>
            <li> The price tag was a little high for my college student budget at the time</li>
            <li> I once left it on a plastic bag which burned the plastic onto the black shell, but didn&#x27;t stick to the blue plates, rendering it hideous but still completely usable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It heats up evenly, and always has, and it&#x27;s hot enough to straighten my thick, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> but it probably depends on hair type, for me i have medium length, wavy thick hair, so I have more hair to go through and just evey other section I set it down to re-heat..</li>
            <li> The plates clamp down evenly with little pressure, and for whatever bizarre reason, the plates have never ever collected that insidious hairspray residue, which cakes onto most heated styling appliances, and is almost impossible to take off.</li>
            <li> and I thought this 1-1/4&amp;#34; iron would shorten my styling time but in fact i&#x27;m spending the same amount of time doing my hair now as with my previous iron (KQC Professional X Heat 1&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I have African american hair and with chi irons it would always dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron through another online retailer a couple of weeks ago.</li>
            <li> The Solia Tourmaline Ceramic Flat Iron!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have now had these flat irons for almost 3 years.</li>
            <li> ordered this flat iron on a Friday and got it on Monday.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a flat iron for a while, I like that this one has heat settings that you can adjust.  </li>
            <li> My mom purchased this flat iron for my when I was in 6th grade.</li>
            <li> I have never had a flat iron before.  </li>
            <li> I have been using a flat iron for about 7 years.  </li>
            <li> Let me say that I&#x27;ve realized, if given the choice, I would give up the Flat Iron, but...</li>
            <li> I just have a problem with frizz/flyaway after flat ironing.</li>
            <li> It has an extra long cord for ease of use.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron 8 years ago, before college.</li>
            <li> I would never spend that amount of money on a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have had my Solia flat iron for 10 YEARS</li>
            <li> and I have not noticed a difference with a Tourmaline Ceramic flat iron.</li>
            <li> When I finish using these flat irons</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on flat irons after my Chi broke</li>
            <li> i used to just lay my flat iron on my vanity, forgetting that i shouldnt do that</li>
            <li> I researched flat irons for a month before settling on this one to try.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron after a friend recommended it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had the sedu, chi, fhi, ghd and this flat iron</li>
            <li> I have owned a multitude of flat irons:</li>
            <li> In contrast, the Sedu which is probably the biggest competitor does not provide results that are as long lasting.</li>
            <li> I needed a replacement flat iron (and two fhi&#x27;s) and was persuaded by reviews to try this Solia.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong; it does the job fine enough.</li>
            <li> With these flat irons I only need to use very minimal oil in my hair prior to straightening it.</li>
            <li> I am a very tough grader and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the outside of the tongs gets very hot.</li>
            <li> I have very thick wavy hair and with the HAI, I had to pass thru several times to get it straight and with the Solia I only have to pass it thru twice.</li>
            <li> This flat works wonders!!!</li>
            <li> and I would recommend to anyone with long, curly hair.</li>
            <li> of strange for a product so well recommended.</li>
            <li> , I have used this iron with and without the oil, and even without the oil it has given my hair a silky-smooth appearance that is not natural to my hair.</li>
            <li> and I suspect I&#x27;ll have this iron for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> I have very wavy, thick, \\&quot;oh my god</li>
            <li> Now my previous iron (KQC) only went up to 410F and took basically the same amount of time and passes to straighten my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li> I usually always had one extra on hand just in case, but the last two I ordered from Amazon just did not last</li>
            <li> The cord is very long</li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> I use this quite often and have had it a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for a new one now, and am seriously considering buying the same one again!!!</li>
            <li> This product made my hair straight after use, but the next morning became frizzy and every time after that got worse.</li>
            <li> The outside black covering around the ceramic iron only gets warm, not hot, so if (in the rare and terrible occasion that) a small child reaches up and just touches the outside, they will not be burned.</li>
            <li> As long as it doesn&#x27;t break I don&#x27;t care very much about this, but it&#x27;s definitely the part of the straightener I would be wary of having issues after years of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus, they simply did not produce the end result that I was looking for... left my hair feeling somewhat hard even though I only put heat protectant on them.</li>
            <li> The iron&#x27;s on/off switch is loose and it doesn&#x27;t stay on anymore without having to wiggle the switch.  </li>
            <li> Well, this morning I turned my straightener down to 300 degrees and left it alone for about 5 minutes while I finished doing my makeup.  </li>
            <li> I previously had a Solia that broke at about 2 years though (one of the plates stopped heating up), so that&#x27;s the only downside I can think of.</li>
            <li> I feel guilty for even asking, like I&#x27;m cheating on the Solia which has been loyal to me for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My other flat iron was half the price of this one, and lasted twice as long.  </li>
            <li> Standard flat irons without temperature controls usually feature 400 degree temperature which is damaging to my hair.  </li>
            <li> A little heavier than my last one, but works well.</li>
            <li> I ordered a black flat iron and received a pink one.</li>
            <li> HUGE disappointment.</li>
            <li> I used this at least 1-2 times per week for nearly 8 years.</li>
            <li> The only complaint that I have about this straightener is that when it finally quit (which it did this morning), it did so with a bang.  </li>
            <li> and I was really curious if it were better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After ten years I am now having some trouble with the wiring where I have to have it sit still to heat up</li>
            <li> I have had this straightener (the pink one) for 3 years.  </li>
            <li> I have only used it for a few months</li>
            <li> now i&#x27;ll continue to test it out on a few different hair types and update you guys in time.</li>
            <li> It heats up to 400+ degrees, and it has a wide variety of settings for all hair types.</li>
            <li> /&gt;hope is last for a few years.</li>
            <li> It works as expected.</li>
            <li> And, unfortunately, when it comes to flat irons/straighteners, you really can&#x27;t test it out before buying without being unsanitary.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly thick hair that I blow dry to get slightly straightened</li>
            <li> Work extremely well</li>
            <li> Over the past 10 or so years, I&#x27;ve only had to replace it once.</li>
            <li> The first one still works but there is something wrong with the cord and it shuts off.  </li>
            <li> and I still use it every other day.</li>
            <li> Never pulled out hair or got snagged like some other hair straighteners I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I find that no matter what product i use in my hair this still slides through my hair and doesn&#x27;t get stuck like other irons.  </li>
            <li> The Solia, just like any other heated hair appliance, will cause heat damage to your hair if it is not used correctly.</li>
            <li> I have been using this flat iron for the past year.</li>
            <li> The plates are thin (compared to previous flat irons I&#x27;ve owned that have each lasted me 4+ years), and the plastic housing feels fragile.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that there&#x27;s no auto-off feature</li>
            <li> It was not worth the price.</li>
            <li> It took a while to get my thick hair done because I had to go over each section multiple times.</li>
            <li> Solia seems to have this down pack.</li>
            <li> I went online and found out it happened to a lot of other ppl too!</li>
            <li> The plates touch, with the Sedu there is a slight gap</li>
            <li> but she would have preferred the black one.</li>
            <li> I rate these so, so, maybe because I am biased to the previous brand of iron I owned.</li>
            <li> Previous reviews helped me select this product.  </li>
            <li> It pulled out half of my hair and they were stuck to the plates, melting in front of my eyes.</li>
            <li> I can straighten my hair faster and with less passes.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is there is no auto-off, and at this price that&#x27;s just ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I guess the first time I tried to use it my hair was just too dirty.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too expensive to last only a year, and feel it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> came home last night and looked at the flat iron and saw that the plates had melted off even after I had unplugged it...very scary.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using a smoothing serum afterward just to add a little shine and holding power, plus it smooths it out from the heat damage (let&#x27;s face it, no matter what straightener you use, there will be heat damage).     </li>
            <li> I do find that I have to go over a few pieces of hair a few times, but the straightening lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> the company actually stood behind its product one would think this wouldn&#x27;t be necessasary.</li>
            <li> It took a couple weeks to get back in the game</li>
            <li> It fried my hair and made it fluffy.     </li>
            <li> It broke after a few months, and I got this one as a replacement.</li>
            <li> I did have to pay for the round trip shipping which totaled approx.</li>
            <li> like I had a nicely-done Dominican blowout for a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did my daughters hair in half the time it usually take me.</li>
            <li> I have had this flat iron for approximately 6 months.</li>
            <li> If the flat iron were to fall on tiled or hardwood floors, game over.</li>
            <li> and my daughter has extremely curly thick hair</li>
            <li> I was not easy on it either - lots of travel, lots of drops.</li>
            <li> There are probably less expensive ones out there that do the same thing.</li>
            <li> - my hair will become fluffy, a little frizzy, and dull with no shine.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick hair with a slight wave that drives me nuts.</li>
            <li> if not more so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why it stopped working.  </li>
            <li> I already had the small one</li>
            <li> day this flat iron fails me I will mourn it and bury it in a cemetery.</li>
            <li> and then I have been skeptical on spending a lot of money on a flat iron.</li>
            <li> unfortunately I dropped it and the cord came loose...</li>
            <li> Plus you have to squeeze too hard to ensure an even heat.</li>
            <li> at least not yet.</li>
            <li> but I never really liked it.  </li>
            <li> I have had this straightener for at least 5 or 6 YEARS.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> The HSI didn&#x27;t work on my thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have horribly frizzy hair and it stays straight!!!</li>
            <li> Plates are small but does the job with one pass if you have thin hair like mine.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I passed these on to my sister and found my previous brand on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I plugged it in to use it, let it heat up, and picked it up to start straightening and instead, it seriously burnt my hair.</li>
            <li> It will get the job done and wasn&#x27;t bad enough</li>
            <li> I got this bad girl last summer (June 2012)</li>
            <li> I have very very thick Sicilian hair</li>
            <li> I have thin hair</li>
            <li> I was sad not to get a heat pouch though.</li>
            <li> or it was just time for it go, but I&#x27;m so sad that I have to replace it!</li>
            <li> im really disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Horrible was frying my hair</li>
            <li> Also, worst of all the Sedu fries my hair, at 320-360</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this flat iron works great and the benefit it has over others I&#x27;ve purchased (including another $150 model that fell apart) is the temperature control. love it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work and wouldn&#x27;t hold a curl.  My hair curls very easily with any curling iron, but for some reason, this flat iron would not hold a curl.  It would curl, and fall out after 10 minutes.  I returned it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good straightener but it&#x27;s not the best one I&#x27;ve ever had. It makes my hair pretty soft after I use it but it doesn&#x27;t keep my hair straight very long. Curls your hair very well though</li>
            <li> I have had this flat iron for approximately 6 months. I LOVED it. However, last week it completely stopped working for no reason. It was on one minute and then suddenly shut off mid hair styling... now it won&#x27;t turn back on. HUGE disappointment.</li>
            <li> Works as described.  No issues.</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron through another online retailer a couple of weeks ago. The nutshell: It&#x27;s going back. I just don&#x27;t feel like its construction is solid, and thus it won&#x27;t hold up over the years. The plates are thin (compared to previous flat irons I&#x27;ve owned that have each lasted me 4+ years), and the plastic housing feels fragile. If the flat iron were to fall on tiled or hardwood floors, game over. Don&#x27;t get me wrong; it does the job fine enough. It just doesn&#x27;t feel well made.</li>
            <li> I also didnt receive the pouch, but this is the best straightener Ive ever owned.  Definitely tops Chi and if you can remember Tru Ceramic Pro.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener after much research on finding the right product for me. I have had it for 3 years now and use it about every other day because when it straightens my hair it does exactly what I dreamed it would! I haven&#x27;t had ANY problems with it, its very easy to take care of and boy did I take care of it! If you care for it, it will not fail you - let it cool, gently \\&quot;fold\\&quot; the cord in the same pattern it came \\&quot;folded\\&quot; in and put it back in the box for storage. My friends ditched their straighteners and asked to borrow mine! My hair stylists said my hair was in great condition! I&#x27;m a hair model too and the several different stylists I work with also compliment my hair&#x27;s condition! They have to ask the client how they normally wear their hair and when I say I straighten it, they are in some disbelief - I don&#x27;t put much product, if any, in my hair so its all about how I blow-dry and how the straightener treats my hair! My hair prefers to be blow-dried and/or straightened {it&#x27;s more pleasantly manageable when it is}. I&#x27;ve used friends&#x27; straighteners that are similar - also to 400 degrees, or with ceramic plates, and NONE compare! They straighten my hair, yes, but they don&#x27;t LAST and they don&#x27;t have the forgiveness of the tilting PLATES, nor do they have ION technology that this has to promote health despite the heat. My hair is fine but I have a lot of it - so plenty of fly-aways, some frizz, and its VERY tolerant against heat and products. This works!! My hair is defined, beautifully controlled - and I receive SO many compliments! haha needless to say this is a FANTASTIC STRAIGHTENER!! Purchase, and enjoy :]</li>
            <li> Okay I will admit it: With that kinda curly, kinda wavy hair that is never one thing or another; I have been on a quest to find the perfect hair straightener and well as products to complement the process ever since I was a teen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back in the day, it was the cheaper kind you buy at the drug store, but in the last few years I have now been the owner of the Chi, the Sedu and now this - The Solia Tourmaline Ceramic Flat Iron!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to compare, I loved my Chi, felt it was a quality product and it did a great job - it lasted a good three plus years with a lot of use when the fuse blew and that was that! More recently I owned the Sedu. This was also pretty good, did the job, but lasted less than 18 months before the cord issues meant that the power went on and off, so completely unacceptable for the price point! I also had to go over my hair several times in some cases to achieve the desired effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time I decided to try the Solia. The reviews seemed good, the price point a little kinder and after my short lived Sedu experience, I was skeptical of paying a high price for a straightener again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to be fair, at the time of writing this review I have owned this just one week, but so far, I am a fan! The design and quality of the product seem very similar to the Chi! This is a sturdy product, has a lot of different heat settings and heats up quickly! But best of all, my hair has never looked so straight and so shiny! It transformed my waves into straight sleek hair, and the results lasted all day (through 100 degree heat and a good level of humidity I might add). After sleeping, my hair was still remarkably straight which was an added bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size of this is just perfect - 1 1/4 inches and I managed to straighten my long hair in remarkably quick time; the design made it comfortable to hold and one swipe down my hair was all it took!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review as my use continues, but for me, this is as good as some of the pricier models if not better and toy save a good chunk of change in the process!! Very comparable to the Chi in my opinion!and toy save a good chunk of change in the process!! Very comparable to the Chi in my opinion!</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.  It gets hot quickly and does not pull my hair.  I especially like the floating plates.  The swivel cord is also a plus.  I do find that I have to go over a few pieces of hair a few times, but the straightening lasts all day.  I am a very tough grader and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the outside of the tongs gets very hot.</li>
            <li> This product is great, I am not a hairstylist at all but whn i do my hair it dosnt come out as well as when others do it, but this straightner leaves my hair straight considering i have curly curly hair :]</li>
            <li> So far this is one of the best flat irons I have had.  Hair stays straight during humid weather and silky.</li>
            <li> definitely worth the money - it does in 10 min what lesser flat irons took me a half an hour to do!</li>
            <li> ... Leads me to believe that this company has used a system to game the google search results so that nothing but great reviews PPP up when looking for how to fix this straightener made of brittle plastic.&lt;br /&gt;If the company actually stood behind its product one would think this wouldn&#x27;t be necessasary. Apparently it is.</li>
            <li> Great results! My hair type curl to frizzy depending on the humidity. When I use this product it keeps my hair under control!</li>
            <li> Love these straightners. Work extremely well and I would recommend to anyone with long, curly hair.</li>
            <li> My wife says; \\&quot;I have to say this is one of the best iron I have ever purchased .It&#x27;s such an amazing quality ,it works smoothly and incredibly .I&#x27;m completely satisfied by its work.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only brand I will buy, even over Chi. These last me years! Shipped fast, easy transaction.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for many years now. I have thick, curly hair. Over the past 10 or so years, I&#x27;ve only had to replace it once. Does a great job straightening on the first go, especially for my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron. I have thin hair so I love that I can adjust the heat setting.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this Solia flat iron about 8 years ago, based on a recommendation from a friend.  The price tag was a little high for my college student budget at the time but I figured I would give it a try anyways; it was completely worth the investment!  I&#x27;ve been using that same flat iron almost every day since purchasing it and just recently did I notice that the heat in it had started to fade a little, not too many products these days will last that long, so I am more than happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without hesitation I have retired the first iron and just ordered a new one as a replacement, here&#x27;s to hoping it lasts me another 8 years!</li>
            <li> My hair type...long, very thick, wavy, very frizzy, and a lot of it (like Julia Roberts when she first came on the scene)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved my Solia but after 3 years the plates unattached. It scared me because it happened while straightening my hair. I decided to try the Sedu because I thought it would last longer and I was really curious if it were better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SOLIA PROS&lt;br /&gt;- Swivel cord never got tangled, I have to battle the Sedu every use&lt;br /&gt;- It got hotter&lt;br /&gt;- My hair stayed straight for days in the Florida humidity, with the Sedu I have to keep straightening though the day.&lt;br /&gt;- It was easier for me to maneuver&lt;br /&gt;- The plates touch, with the Sedu there is a slight gap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SEDU PROS&lt;br /&gt;- It only takes one swipe to get my hair bone straight, Solia it took around 3&lt;br /&gt;- Short time to straighten hair, Solia took about 10 min. more&lt;br /&gt;- Easier to clean, sedu just a wipe with a dry cloth, Solia needed a cleaning iron solution&lt;br /&gt;- Lighter&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t pull my hair, with the Solia my hair did get caught once in a while&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both of these irons are way better than any drug store or discount store iron I have tried but over all the Solia is way better for me. I&#x27;m going to go ahead and buy another solia even though my Sedu is only a couple months old. I wouldn&#x27;t mind it so much if I didn&#x27;t have to keep straightening my hair (sometimes 3 extra times a day). If I don&#x27;t have time to keep straightening, I have to keep rubber bands in my purse to put my hair up. That&#x27;s a big problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I learned...IF IT&#x27;S NOT BROKE DON&#x27;T FIX IT.</li>
            <li> 2nd one I buy.  The first one still works but there is something wrong with the cord and it shuts off.  I&#x27;ve had it for about 5 years.  Just had to replace it.  The new one appears to be lighter and it feels better while using it.  I bought one for my sister a while back and she replaced hers with the same flat iron.</li>
            <li> im really disappointed with this product. my fiance old remington did better job than this one.&lt;br /&gt;this flat iron job only lasted like 30 min before it begin to frizz all over again.&lt;br /&gt;used a paul mitchell to redo the job...no frizz in 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;Kind of strange for a product so well recommended.</li>
            <li> I got this for Christmas about 5 years ago. It is the best straightner I&#x27;ve ever had. I loved it but I dropped it one too many times and it broke last weekend. :( I&#x27;m looking for a new one now, and am seriously considering buying the same one again!!!</li>
            <li> Solid piece to own until it breaks! After the 2 year warranty expired, the product stopped working! This is  NOT the iron you have for years!</li>
            <li> Horrible was frying my hair</li>
            <li> Top quality flat iron.  Works great on my hair.  Have no issues.</li>
            <li> I loved this straightener too....when it worked!! I had it for a year and then out of no where it just stopped working!! I went online and found out it happened to a lot of other ppl too! It always seemed to happen right after the year warranty expires too. You can get it fixed but it&#x27;ll cost you more to fix it and ship it, more then its worth! But I still find myself wanting to buy another one, thats how well it worked. I&#x27;ve tried almost every professional straightener and this one doesn&#x27;t compare to any of them, mostly because this one leaves your hair very smooth and straight for days!!! I waited 3 days once to wash my hair and it was still as straight as it was the first day.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter who has really curly hair.  She has used it for over a year now, around 2-5 times per week (depending on her mood).  Her hair is nice and shiny afterwards and she really enjoys it.  Good buy.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron because after 4 years my CHI finally gave out, I read a few reviews and figured that this would do just fine, I can honestly say that this is a great flat iron and not only is it cheaper but it also works better in comparison to the CHI.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: I have now had these flat irons for almost 3 years. They still perform as though they are brand-new. I&#x27;ve dropped them plenty of times and it&#x27;s amazingly durable. My original review stands true, that I can&#x27;t touch-up my hair after a week, but if you actually wrap your hair every night like I should be doing then you won&#x27;t have a problem. It also helps a ton to use some sort of serum or spray conditioner right before you use these. The only complaint I have is that there&#x27;s no auto-off feature and I&#x27;ve left them on for a full day before, but since the highest temperature is not that hot it didn&#x27;t burn anything it was sitting on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL: I am african-american with native-american like hair. It&#x27;s VERY thick, no relaxer, although its pretty straight on it&#x27;s own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this flat iron on a Friday and got it on Monday. I was really excited to use it, so I only used it on part of my hair. My hair was already straight, but the ends were messed up and needed a touch up. The irons didn&#x27;t seem to get hot and the ends would NOT curl. When my mother came over, she wanted to try them because she&#x27;s also looking for a good flat iron. It didn&#x27;t work well for her either. I was highly upset and was looking for ways to return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I returned it though, I decided to try one more thing. I went to wash my hair, I blow dryed it, and tried the irons again. I was VERY pleased! It only took about 15 minutes (used to take 45 with shoulder-length hair). My hair was extremely shiny and soft, and laid down exactly how I wanted it. I have my hair cut in layers and it really brought that cut out. I guess the first time I tried to use it my hair was just too dirty. The iron still only gets 4 stars because now I feel like I won&#x27;t be able to touch it up after a week, I&#x27;ll have no choice but to use my old flat iron for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another good thing about it, is that it get hot, but I can get right to the roots without burning myself. Another plusis that I can start the iron in the middle of a chunk of hair and it won&#x27;t leave a dent like cheaper flat irons do. Cheaper flat irons also produce a LOT of steam and makes the room smell like its burning, but with this flat iron there was barely any smoke and it didn&#x27;t burn my hair at all. VERY PLEASED!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a flat iron for a while, I like that this one has heat settings that you can adjust.  The cord is very long and I do not find that it gets tangled or knotted up.  It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair and slides very nice.  The only con I have is that it does not automatically shut off.</li>
            <li> Ether than the chi. I have horribly frizzy hair and it stays straight!!! Love it! This is the second tine I have purchased it in 6 years. It straightens faster than my chi.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener for more than 8 years and it only just recently broke. It&#x27;s fixable in my opinion because its just the cord that broke and it was probably my fault to begin with. I have very very thick Sicilian hair that&#x27;s sometimes wavy, sometimes curly but always frizzy. This was my never fail hair straightener, I knew I could always count on it to get the job done. Except for recently, obviously, but I think 8+ years is a pretty good life for a straightener and I intend on getting another one as soon as possible.</li>
            <li> Got this iron in 2 days.. SUPER FAST! I love this flat iron, works really well and makes my hair feel amazingly soft!  Totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a gift for a friend. She said she likes it but thinks she prefers her Chi over this iron.</li>
            <li> I ordered a black flat iron and received a pink one. I could not return it as it was a present and there wasn&#x27;t enough time to get a new one. My grandaughter was happy to receive the gift but she would have preferred the black one.</li>
            <li> My mom purchased this flat iron for my when I was in 6th grade. I am now 21 and I still use it every other day. I LOVE this flat iron. After ten years I am now having some trouble with the wiring where I have to have it sit still to heat up but I will be purchasing another one.</li>
            <li> So far this is an ok Iron. I had the original Chi before this and it had no temp adjustment. I do like that i can change the temp. There are probably less expensive ones out there that do the same thing. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference or improvment of my hair bc of the tourmaline and ceramic Ion. at least not yet.</li>
            <li> I have never had a flat iron before.  Did a lot of research to find one that wouldn&#x27;t damage my hair.  Also wanted one that the temperature dial wouldn&#x27;t change easily by my hand as I used it.  This works great and has exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I had a chi iron for about 4 years and I loved it, until it died. This one had good reviews, so I decided to get it. It has been worth every penny! I love it. It is nicer than my chi and does a great job. It leaves my hair smooth and shiny and straight. And it is quick, too.</li>
            <li> I love this flat Iron it leaves my hair just like it says, silky. My hair does not look dead or dry, it has a healthy look. I have try other irons even so called professional and they pull my hair. Solia  goes on smooth. I have been very please for many years. My daughter introduce me to Solia.</li>
            <li> It works, and it&#x27;s nice. It&#x27;s not as great as I thought it would be based on all the reviews from Folica.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, oh well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does what it does--straightens. And it&#x27;s not completely horrible. I have to take a few more passes through my hair than I would like, since that&#x27;s why I bought a new straightener in the first place. And it&#x27;s pretty heavy... another reason why I was replacing my older one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m bummed, but hey, we learn right? And, unfortunately, when it comes to flat irons/straighteners, you really can&#x27;t test it out before buying without being unsanitary. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better luck next time. :)</li>
            <li> I have had this flat iron for more than 8 years. It has been great! It is just now starting to break a bit, but it has lasted me for 8 years with almost daily use!</li>
            <li> I have been using a flat iron for about 7 years.  Mine finally died.. looked for the best one I could find.  This iron takes twice as long to straighten my hair as my old one did.  It is also doing a lot more damage to my hair.</li>
            <li> My Solia just died its final death and I felt compelled to leave a review in honor of its memory. I used this at least 1-2 times per week for nearly 8 years. That&#x27;s some longevity! Never pulled out hair or got snagged like some other hair straighteners I&#x27;ve used. This was my go-to for so long, I think I&#x27;m going to have to run right out and get a new one. I just don&#x27;t think I can live without it.</li>
            <li> LOVEE THIS PRODUCT! Makes my hair look n sleek and polished in a very natural, not over the top way. Heating temperature can be adjusted depending on look youre going for. Ever since Ive been using ths straightener Ive been getting compliments on my hair ^_^</li>
            <li> I bought this item in August 2012 and used it three times a week until it stopped working a year later.&lt;br /&gt;I liked this product but it&#x27;s too expensive to last only a year, and feel it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> She did like this prodyct, but told me it felt kind ofcheap.  At the end of the day, though, it got the job done!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had professional dryers, but never thought it mattered with a flat iron.  Now I know what a huge difference it makes. This iron glides through my hair and I never notice any &amp;#34;burnt hair&amp;#34; smell at all.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I have tried several different flat irons and this is the best. The HSI didn&#x27;t work on my thick wavy hair. The SOLIA makes my hair straighter, shinier and smoother then any blowout! I have had mine for at least 5 years and it is still the best one I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I rate these so, so, maybe because I am biased to the previous brand of iron I owned. These felt a little more bulky and heavier. I am not a fan of the dial version temperature controls though they are placed in a rather convenient location. Plus, they simply did not produce the end result that I was looking for... left my hair feeling somewhat hard even though I only put heat protectant on them. Needless to say, I passed these on to my sister and found my previous brand on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have had this straightener (the pink one) for 3 years.  It has always straightened my hair to my satisfaction.  (I have wavy, frizzy hair and I would always straighten the majority of my hair, besides the fine hair that&#x27;s close to my scalp, at 450 degrees.)  Yes, it did do some damage to my hair in the form of split ends, but I probably could have prevented that by being more diligent in using more product on my hair to protect it.  The only complaint that I have about this straightener is that when it finally quit (which it did this morning), it did so with a bang.  I straighten those fine hairs at 300 degrees because anything any hotter will make them stick out straight.  Well, this morning I turned my straightener down to 300 degrees and left it alone for about 5 minutes while I finished doing my makeup.  When I put the straightener on those fine pieces, my hair started smoking and instantly became crunchy.  The straightener heated up to way past what it normally would on the temperature dial before it finally died, and it most conveniently died when I was straightening the most fine pieces of my hair.  I can&#x27;t complain much because it did serve me well in the 3 years that I used it, but I would have rather kept those pieces of hair in tact without them being super crunchy due to the high heat.  Even if it did try to burn my hair off, I would still recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Ive had my straightener for 5 years now, and having dense curly hair has always required me to have a high quality straightener. It has kept working for all of these years as i have used it constantly, still performing superbly to straighten those tight curls! The adjustable temperature dial is very helpful for when i want to do touchups. I pretty much love everything about the straightener, including the long chord the movable plates to prevent tangling and the sleek easy to clean design. For the price it is amazing for the long lasting quality results.</li>
            <li> I will say at first I didn&#x27;t LOVE it so much, however.... I gave it time bc I had switched years ago from the 1.5 that I used to love to the 1.0. That really is a difference and if you want to do curls or waves you have to know how to handle the unit. It took a couple weeks to get back in the game but I remembered why I loved the (larger than 1&amp;#34; but smaller than 2&amp;#34;) unit. I have my FARRAH FAWCETT wave back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I love is that over the last 2-years I have started chemically-straightening my hair. Let me say that I&#x27;ve realized, if given the choice, I would give up the Flat Iron, but... in combo, they are THE BEST! Your Flat-iron is better than any I&#x27;ve had (at 450 degrees.) Others (names excluded) say they heat to (450, for the straightening process) but for whatever reason yours did a better job for me on this treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy &amp; satisfied with the results and I always love to keep a spare around so, I will buy another!</li>
            <li> I just received this iron today. It&#x27;s okay, I just have a problem with frizz/flyaway after flat ironing. It does however get my hair very straight! Maybe I should try some goo anti frizz serum after... Then I will come back and edit this post.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast &amp; stays hot. Gets the job done fast! As nice as a Chi...if not more so. Nice product.</li>
            <li> Loved it when I got it...unfortunately I dropped it and the cord came loose...it still worked though!!  But I knew its time was coming to an end eventually and did not want a shock while using it.  Tried to replace it with 2 different brands...sent both replacements back and ordered another Solia.  My hair is so much smoother...even with the humidity in Hawaii.</li>
            <li> Daughter (22) loves this straightener! She&#x27;s had a lot of straighteners and says this one is the best.</li>
            <li> Best flat iron! I have very long hair and this makes it very straight and silky feeling!  I find that no matter what product i use in my hair this still slides through my hair and doesn&#x27;t get stuck like other irons.  I use this quite often and have had it a very long time.  It has an extra long cord for ease of use.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is exactly what I was looking for.  It pulls hair evenly through it and it is light weight.  I am especially pleased with the temperature control feature.  Having fine hair, I need a lower (200 degree) setting for my hair.  Standard flat irons without temperature controls usually feature 400 degree temperature which is damaging to my hair.  I recommend this to anyone who has fine or chemically treated hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered mine from folica.com because they had a sale and I received a flat iron pouch and a 2 yr warranty for free. It cost me $67. I couldnt wait to use them.  I used kerastase nectar thermique and redken heat glide  as heat protectors. when I was done , it looked like I had been to a salon. I know a lot of people like to compare the solia and the sedu but the solia is it for me.  I dont have to look elsewhere because it gets the job done.  I have never used the sedu but i dont feel i have to.  The solia is much cheaper and it is great. I couldnt stop staring at my hair. BTW, I am African American.  When I first used it, the heat settingwas at 370, but that was too much for me.  I put it between 300 and 370 and the results were amazing.</li>
            <li> Really good. heats up fast leaving a sleek looking hairstyle.</li>
            <li> I have one and got my daughter one!  Work fabulously!  Love the temp adjustment feature!</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron 8 years ago, before college. It heats up evenly, and always has, and it&#x27;s hot enough to straighten my thick, frizzy hair. The plates clamp down evenly with little pressure, and for whatever bizarre reason, the plates have never ever collected that insidious hairspray residue, which cakes onto most heated styling appliances, and is almost impossible to take off. I have never cleaned it. I don&#x27;t think I will ever have to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve taken this curling iron everywhere, tossed it into bags, dropped it, and have generally been unloving and unkind. I once left it on a plastic bag which burned the plastic onto the black shell, but didn&#x27;t stick to the blue plates, rendering it hideous but still completely usable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have occasionally met marginally better flat irons, in upscale salons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;That&#x27;s a nice flat iron,&amp;#34; I&#x27;ll say, and timidly ask, &amp;#34;how much would a flat iron like that cost?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hundreds of dollars sometimes. I would never spend that amount of money on a flat iron. I feel guilty for even asking, like I&#x27;m cheating on the Solia which has been loyal to me for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day this flat iron fails me I will mourn it and bury it in a cemetery.</li>
            <li> I own a babybliss but I never really liked it.  I read good reviews on Solia and Hai so I decided to buy both of themand I love them both but Solia wins by a little.</li>
            <li> Love my flat iron. It leaves my hair really smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> I purchased this iron based on the recommendation of a friend. I have only used it for a few months so I don&#x27;t know how well the product will hold up or how long it will last (although my friend has had her for many years and she said it still works fine). The product meets all my expectations: heats up quickly and  irons quickly and smoothly (only need to pull iron over each section 1 time!).</li>
            <li> First major issue with this iron, is that it snagged my hair a few times. This happens if any strands get caught in the corners of the plates. This now means that I have to part my hair in smaller sections to iron.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is hip length and I thought this 1-1/4&amp;#34; iron would shorten my styling time but in fact i&#x27;m spending the same amount of time doing my hair now as with my previous iron (KQC Professional X Heat 1&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;m multiracial with frizzy wavy hair. In order to straighten my hair, I&#x27;ve had to set the iron to the highest temperature 450F and i&#x27;ve had to pass it twice near the scalp and once through to the ends and it will do the job. Now my previous iron (KQC) only went up to 410F and took basically the same amount of time and passes to straighten my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Both irons are Tourmaline Ceramic; I&#x27;m just a bit puzzled as to the temperature setting on the Solia... it&#x27;s supposed to be hotter than my KQC but it didn&#x27;t feel that way based on the fact that i&#x27;m passing both irons through my hair the same number of times for it to be straightened. If I were to use the Solia at a lower temperature say 410F, my hair wouldn&#x27;t get straight in 1 to 2 passes.&lt;br /&gt;For now i&#x27;ll continue to test it out on a few different hair types and update you guys in time.</li>
            <li> My only issue with this item is that it&#x27;s too short. I&#x27;m used to the 5in. one by baby bliss so I gave this one to my daughter and ordered another bb. Plus you have to squeeze too hard to ensure an even heat.</li>
            <li> I have very course black hair and the Solia gets it really straight and shiny. I did my daughters hair in half the time it usually take me.</li>
            <li> It straightens and curls hair really well. I love the adjustable heat settings. It does the job well. No complaints so far.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter and she loved it! She uses it daily and loves the way her hair looks! Very happy with this purchase. Order arrived on time and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Works great. Previous reviews helped me select this product.  Thanks</li>
            <li> This is an EXCELLENT straightener and I would recommend it to everyone.    My first straightener was a cheapie with metal plates. It fried my hair and made it fluffy.     It broke after a few months, and I got this one as a replacement. I&#x27;ve had it for 4-5 years, and it&#x27;s still in great shape and working like new! The ceramic plates are really the way to go--metal destroys your hair. It heats up quickly and maintains heat very well. It&#x27;s simple to use and it&#x27;s easy to straighten with--not cumbersome or clunky at all.    I have very wavy, thick, \\&quot;oh my god there is humidity somewhere on planet Earth, time to frizz!\\&quot; hair, and this straightener makes it silky smooth. There is no burnt-hair-smell after using it, and I don&#x27;t get the \\&quot;fried ends\\&quot; look. I would recommend using a smoothing serum afterward just to add a little shine and holding power, plus it smooths it out from the heat damage (let&#x27;s face it, no matter what straightener you use, there will be heat damage).     It heats up to 400+ degrees, and it has a wide variety of settings for all hair types. The cord also swivels so there is no stress on where the cord attaches to the straightener itself because it just rotates instead of pulling and tugging. The cord is nice and long, but not so long that you&#x27;ll be tripping over it.     This is a fantastic product and DEFINITELY worth the price! I will be buying another one if and when my current one ever dies.</li>
            <li> The iron&#x27;s on/off switch is loose and it doesn&#x27;t stay on anymore without having to wiggle the switch.  I have to keep checking if it turned off while I am doing my hair.  I was an occasional user and never dropped it and rarely traveled with it.</li>
            <li> This flat works wonders!!! Great flat iron for the price. I had a CHI for 6 yrs until it went out and then I have been skeptical on spending a lot of money on a flat iron. I&#x27;ve looked at the Solia for awhile and decided to make the purchase after reading reviews. The only con is that I do have to go over my hair a few times to get it straight like I want but other than that I love it!</li>
            <li> I have had my Solia flat iron for 10 YEARS and it still works amazing!! I bought mine back in 2003 around the same time as I bought a CHI. I thought the CHI would be an upgrade, but my CHI has sat in a closet for ten years as a backup if my Solia ever stops working. It is an amazing straightener. It heats up fast, doesn&#x27;t tug at my hair, and gets my hair straight on the first pass. I have naturally curly thick hair that I blow dry to get slightly straightened (it&#x27;s still incredibly frizzy before I flat iron it). The CHI constantly gets hair stuck in it, which it then breaks. If I ever need to purchase another flat iron, I will definitely be buying a Solia. I bought it off of Folica, but the price seems to be better here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have really wavy hair and it does a great job at straightening. However I don&#x27;t feel my hair looks as smooth as I would like.</li>
            <li> Heats fast and works great! I like the swivel cord and the different settings. My only complaint is I don&#x27;t love the way it curls, but I am new to this flat iron, so I may just need to get used to it being different from my old one.</li>
            <li> My daughter says it works great - of course now she spends another 30 minutes in the bathroom getting ready every morning</li>
            <li> I bought this item two years ago. I absolutely love this flat iron. Two days after the two year warranty expired, it quit working. Folica, still honored the warranty and replaced it!! Now keep in mind that the manufacturer only guarantees this product for ONE year, the SECOND year was at Folica&#x27;s expense and they still replaced it. I did have to pay for the round trip shipping which totaled approx. 19.00 bucks which I gladly paid. They could have said no, since technically, it was expired by two days. Instead they said since it was so close they would honor this one time exchange. Now that&#x27;s old school customer service there!! KUDOS TO FOLICA&#x27;S OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> When my Chi straightener died after 6 years, I decided to try another brand and chose a Solia iron because of the reviews.  Unfortunately, does not work nearly as good as my Chi.  It takes forever for my ultra-thick wavy hair to straighten and I have not noticed a difference with a Tourmaline Ceramic flat iron.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adored my Solia flat iron when I was using it! I bought it from Folica about 7 years ago, and it is still going strong. I used this flat iron once a week, and with proper care, my hair stayed straight the entire week. I love that the Solia goes all the way up to 450 degrees, but I only needed to set it to 350-375 degrees. Regarding hair type, my hair is somewhere in the 3b-c area. It can straighten, curl, and even wave your hair. It&#x27;s the best flat iron I have ever used, and it stands up to the Texas humidity amazingly well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE BEWARE: The Solia, just like any other heated hair appliance, will cause heat damage to your hair if it is not used correctly. Please remember to use a heat protectant with this flat iron, or it will most certainly cause damage. When I first began using the Solia, I did not use a heat protectant with it, and experienced many split ends, and a bit of breakage. The damage done to my hair was drastically reduced when I began using a heat protectant, just know that no heat protectant will fully protect you from damage 100%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Solia, however, is a top-of-the-line flat iron made with tourmaline, and ceramic, which is much less damaging than most cheaply-made flat irons. I no longer use my Solia now, because I&#x27;m natural, and wear my hair curly, but my mother and sister both love it now. I would still highly recommend it to those who wish for straight hair. Simply amazing!</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.  It is the best.  I originally bought it because I was torn between a Sedu and the Solia.  My hair dresser said they were both great flat irons and to just buy the cheaper one.  I have been a loyal user since 2010.  I only bought a new one because I went to Europe and my plug converter fried it.</li>
            <li> Flat iron works good for now, heats up really fast. does not pull my hair like the cheaper ones do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the tempreture can also be adjusted which i like very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hope is last for a few years.</li>
            <li> *4 1/2 Stars*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give this flat iron 5 stars if the outside didn&#x27;t get as surprisingly hot as it does. The outside middle gets very hot, more than it should since that&#x27;s where one&#x27;s fingers typically would be when holding this. However, since I work rather quickly while doing my hair and am accustomed to dealing with heat (I used to work in a salon), this is not such an issue for me, but would likely be for some people with more sensitive fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, that being said, this is a fantastic flat iron and is exceptional at straightening, putting waves/curls in longer hair (mine is right at waist-length), smoothing/de-frizzing, and adding a fabulous shine. This iron&#x27;s plates have remained smooth, held no build-up, and provided even and consistent heat distribution for the entire 2 years that I have owned it. I have become hooked on the Sedu Argan Oil polishing treatment that makes my hair look so much better than it actually is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of note, I have used this iron with and without the oil, and even without the oil it has given my hair a silky-smooth appearance that is not natural to my hair. If you are in the market for a high-quality flat iron, I highly recommend this one--just remember to hold it further down toward the bottom than you normally might if you have sensitive fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 1/2 Stars!</li>
            <li> Ok so I loveeee these flat irons! Where do I start.  It really does bring out your hairs natural moisture. I have African american hair and with chi irons it would always dry out my hair. With these flat irons I only need to use very minimal oil in my hair prior to straightening it. When I finish using these flat irons my hair is straight and shiny!</li>
            <li> she seems to love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;what else can I say about it. I am a guy. She wanted this one because &amp;#34;bla bla bla&amp;#34; and I got it for her.</li>
            <li> Does not meet my expectations, it remains straight hair and I do not lose the waves. Heat nice but not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I have been using this flat iron for the past year. It worked great and I had no complaints until yesterday. I plugged it in to use it, let it heat up, and picked it up to start straightening and instead, it seriously burnt my hair. It pulled out half of my hair and they were stuck to the plates, melting in front of my eyes. I looked at the iron and it started smoking!!!! I immediately unplugged the unit, threw my hair in a pony tail and went to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came home last night and looked at the flat iron and saw that the plates had melted off even after I had unplugged it...very scary. I don&#x27;t know how hot it must have gotten, but I hadn&#x27;t done anything different with it that I&#x27;ve done in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on Amazon now shopping for a new flat iron, I will NOT be buying a Solia.</li>
            <li> I bought this December 2013 it was good but now the plug has a short in it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter in early Jan 2015  after seeing other reviews and also it was cheaper than the kind that is demonstrated inside malls from a kiosk. This definitely is an amazing flat iron.  My daughter can go from bedhead to sleek in about 5 min. No flyaways. Would def recommend.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on flat irons after my Chi broke and I had to replace it.  The newer Chi&#x27;s didn&#x27;t have very good reviews, but this one had really good reviews.  I don&#x27;t find it to be near as good as my old Chi that I had for years.  I have to take much smaller strands of hair and go much slower.  I also have to run it on a lower temperature than what the Chi runs on or it burns my hair, even with heat protectant spray.  It will get the job done and wasn&#x27;t bad enough I wanted to go through the hassle of a return so I kept it, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> We are extremely happy with the Solia Tourmaline Ceramic Ion Flat Iron.  It does really well on my daughters hair without drying it out and breaking it off.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to buy a straightener with such great reviews and ranked higher then a Chi. At first I was so excited when I got it, then I started using and realized it was just the same as my old Remington straightener.. But I was wrong, I have been using this product about 5 times a week for a month and THE LONG TIME EFFECT is such a better result then my old one.   Well there is some bummers about this product though. It tends to re-heat a lot but it probably depends on hair type, for me i have medium length, wavy thick hair, so I have more hair to go through and just evey other section I set it down to re-heat.. Thats not much of a big deal  for me though. Also, if you are looking to CURL your hair with this, you cannot do so very well because the outside doesn&#x27;t heat up a lot. But that&#x27;s why the sell curling irons..!    What I absolutely love about this straightener is how shiny and smooth my hair looks! And it stays straight the next day  if I don&#x27;t shower that night) Also I love the temperature settings that get up to 450 degrees because I need a lot of heat! I was sad not to get a heat pouch though. Next time is I was to order is though I would get it from Folica with the 2 year warranty just in case!</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before buying this flat iron after my old Chi broke. For years, I thought Chi was the only way to go, but there are a lot of other high quality options on the market now. I asked around and some other friends said they were happy with their Solias as well. I have fine hair that is very wavy in most areas and slightly curly in others. My hair holds curl well and does not like to stay straight on humid days. The Solia does a good job of straightening my hair without damaging it. I really like the temperature control. I&#x27;m glad I was open to trying new things.</li>
            <li> Great bang for the buck. Many ceramic irons were priced hirer but I don&#x27;t know how I could have got a better deal!</li>
            <li> I bought this about a year ago. One of the best flat irons i ever owned. No breakage &amp; always leaves my hair shiny &amp; smooth. Gets hot pretty fast &amp; the heat pouch is great. i used to just lay my flat iron on my vanity, forgetting that i shouldnt do that lol... so that helps a lot. If you air dry your hair then use this, its great. if your trying to touch up your hair, it works. Solia seems to have this down pack. i would def byuy this again.</li>
            <li> ...I never regret reaching for my Solia. I got this bad girl last summer (June 2012) and since then I&#x27;ve only used her 3 times. About my hair: kinky, 4B, C, D whatever. Not curly, not spiraled, just straight up nappy. This is my first flat iron and the first couple of times I used it, I was scared of burning off or permanently straightening my hair, so I underestimated the amount of heat I would need and set it at about 310, 320. Still: only had to pass through the strands one time, no pulling or overheating, and my hair came out shiny and looking like I had a nicely-done Dominican blowout for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This week I tried again, and went to 390. Think I found the sweet spot there. Hair came out nearly bone-straight, ultra shiny after only one pass-through, and I discovered my hair&#x27;s true length. Loved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the pressure-sensitive mechanism that causes the plates to cushion down in case you press too hard. Definitely saves you from overheating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I combined this iron with a good heat protectant spray, and worked with small strands of hair at a time, so that definitely helped the results. Haven&#x27;t tried any others, but I&#x27;d say if you&#x27;re a 4B girl looking for her first good flat iron, you can&#x27;t go wrong with the Solia for this price range. Works great.</li>
            <li> I researched flat irons for a month before settling on this one to try. It works great on my thick, wavy hair and takes less time to straighten than my old flat iron. I&#x27;ve been recommending this one to friends.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different brands of hair straighteners over the years and this is one I find works the best.  I have kind of frizzy wavy hair and my daughter has extremely curly thick hair and it works great for both of us.  I highly recommend this straightener.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair straight after use, but the next morning became frizzy and every time after that got worse.</li>
            <li> This flat iron worked fine for the first few months, but then the cord was constantly in a knot, no matter how many times I untangled it.  It was a weekly battle trying to keep the cord untangled.  Then it just stopped working after 15 months.  It would not turn on at all.  I only used it for about 5 minutes each day.  It was not worth the price. My other flat iron was half the price of this one, and lasted twice as long.  I definitely will not buy this product again, nor would I recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t turn off automatically like my old one.  HATING that feature!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this exact straightener for over 7 years and the paddles just broke. Buying another one for sure!</li>
            <li> This is my second one. I will never buy another type. Heats up fast and straightens on the first pass.</li>
            <li> Leave&#x27;s my hair soft, shiny, and straighter than any other iron i have used. Compared to all the others I have tried with Chi... this is the absolute best by far</li>
            <li> I ordered this last year when I was relaxing my hair. I loved it because it never gave me any heat damage, was easy to use, and genuinely straightened my hair without me having to turn it up to 1200 degrees (exaggeration). Now I&#x27;m natural (4a/3c) and it still doesn&#x27;t give me any heat damage! It&#x27;s perfect and the plates are blue, my favorite color :D</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener after owning a standard store-bought $30-$40 range straighteners. (So I have not tried any of the more premium/expensive models like the Chi, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;- Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;- Heats very quickly&lt;br /&gt;- I can straighten my hair faster and with less passes. I also noticed it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;snag&amp;#34; quite as often. My hair feels softer and straighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;- (This didn&#x27;t matter to me, but might matter to some) doesn&#x27;t come with its own sleeve or case for travel.&lt;br /&gt;- The dial and &amp;#34;on/off&amp;#34; switch are just kind of &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;, I&#x27;ve owned cheaper straighteners with dials or digital temperature settings that were a bit better. As long as it doesn&#x27;t break I don&#x27;t care very much about this, but it&#x27;s definitely the part of the straightener I would be wary of having issues after years of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this straightener!</li>
            <li> I was searching for a quality iron after my old (and cheap) Revlon went out.  I decided since I was beginning a new  journey towards healthier hair, I would invest in a quality professional straightening iron to (hopefully) straighten my hair with less damage.  I had purchased and returned two irons prior to taking a chance on the Solia and I am so happy that I did.  What I like most about this iron is that you don&#x27;t need high temperatures to get the hair straight (unlike cheaper or drugstore brands).  I comfortably straighten my transitioning 4a/b African-American hair at a temperature no higher than 360 degrees.  The plates heat evenly and I have no problems curling under or creating flips.  Though I&#x27;ve only had this iron for seven months, it seems to be well-made and I suspect I&#x27;ll have this iron for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> I have been using the HAI 1 1/4 flat iron for the last 15 years. I usually always had one extra on hand just in case, but the last two I ordered from Amazon just did not last and in fact the one I just threw away both plates were burnt. I really think they were counterfeit items. I decided to try a new brand and I am so glad I did. The Solia is awesome. I have very thick wavy hair and with the HAI, I had to pass thru several times to get it straight and with the Solia I only have to pass it thru twice. I cannot smell my hair burning like before and my hair looks so shiny after I am done and not frizzy like it was starting to look with my last iron.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the red (my favorite color) and it is really nice. I love it so much I just ordered another one today so I can have a backup just in case. I am glad I decided to change and hope this will be my brand for awhile. Even though I love Amazon, I did get it cheaper at Folica.com with their discount.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these &amp; my girls are very happy with the product. Would definitely order this straightener again.</li>
            <li> It gives a lot of heat and is easy to handle. It is safer than others I&#x27;ve tried. It works as expected.</li>
            <li> Works great. It straightens my hair in one stroke, when most irons I&#x27;ve tried wont. The temp is adjustable, which is another feature I like.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron after a friend recommended it. I have extremely thick hair with a slight wave that drives me nuts. This iron does the trick to get the hair straight! You must use some sort of a heat protectant when you use it. must. must. must. must. the cheap stuff from the drugstore will do.</li>
            <li> This is a great flat iron. It makes the hair really silky and smooth. My hair is some what between a 3A and 3C and I&#x27;ve had the sedu, chi, fhi, ghd and this flat iron but I found that the fhi works best. This flat iron seemd to great for those with thin hair or finer hair. This flat iron is great for straightening hair but for me it did not keep my hair straight.</li>
            <li> Amazing! My daughter completely abhors her curly hair, so I made her deal that I would straighten her hair every 2 weeks. After almost four months, we&#x27;ve started using it more frequently. Her hair is never dry and coarse after using this and the temperature setting makes it easy to make her hair different levels of straightness. The outside black covering around the ceramic iron only gets warm, not hot, so if (in the rare and terrible occasion that) a small child reaches up and just touches the outside, they will not be burned. Best flat iron I&#x27;ve purchased yet!</li>
            <li> This is a good iron--my hair definitely looks healthier since I started using it.  It still takes several passes on my hair to get it really smooth, but it eventually gets there. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is there is no auto-off, and at this price that&#x27;s just ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this iron for over 5 years and it&#x27;s still working great. It looks nice, too. I will definitely be buying another if it ever conks out.</li>
            <li> I had a Chi but it broke after 3-4 years.  When I got the Solia, I was surprised at how it didn&#x27;t pinch my hair like the Chi did.  Works great!</li>
            <li> I have owned a multitude of flat irons: Sedu, Solano, Babyliss, Chi, Sally brands, Remington, ConAir, and those crappy ones they sell at booths in the shopping mall (listed in order from good to bad) but Solia is the best. The reason why it&#x27;s the best is because 1) it leaves my hair very smooth, shiny, and sleek; 2) the hair stays smooth for hours without need for touch up - if I press it in the morning, go out for the day, come home, my hair will still look nice and shiny; 3) it doesn&#x27;t fry up my hair,  I use it everyday at only 320-360 heat and my hair does not feel brittle or dry, it stays moist (using only a dab of Crisco as heat protectant lol); 4) the size allows me to do curls and flips for versatility. In contrast, the Sedu which is probably the biggest competitor does not provide results that are as long lasting. The sedu requires retouch every 2-3 hours for me at least, if I don&#x27;t do touch ups - and honestly who has the time during the day? - my hair will become fluffy, a little frizzy, and dull with no shine. Also, worst of all the Sedu fries my hair, at 320-360 it doesn&#x27;t straighten it well enough, yet temps higher than that really damage my strands to the point where the ends feel brittle, also the results at higher temps don&#x27;t last long anyway. SOLIA doesn&#x27;t have any of those drawbacks, so for that reason, I LOVE the Solia. I previously had a Solia that broke at about 2 years though (one of the plates stopped heating up), so that&#x27;s the only downside I can think of.</li>
            <li> Compact design, thermostat control, heats quickly, genuine product.  Plates are small but does the job with one pass if you have thin hair like mine. Haven&#x27;t dropped it yet cannot comment on durability.  Have been a Chi girl over 20 years, loved the price for the Solia.  Get it!</li>
            <li> I needed a replacement flat iron (and two fhi&#x27;s) and was persuaded by reviews to try this Solia.  I like everything about it except that the  on/off is in between the two pieces.  Heats quickly and straightens beautifully!</li>
            <li> I got this flat iron in 2004 as a present and it has worked fantastically until a couple weeks ago. Not sure if it was finally dropped too many times or the cat getting a hold of the cord or it was just time for it go, but I&#x27;m so sad that I have to replace it! It&#x27;s been all over the US and Europe with me, and I never had any issues with it until now - the light doesn&#x27;t blink and it doesn&#x27;t stay hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s sturdy, heats up quickly (30 seconds), and straightens in just a few swipes without frying, snagging, or damaging hair. My roommates and friends always borrowed it when getting ready, even if they had their own flat iron. It&#x27;s great for short and long hair, as I&#x27;ve used it when I had chin length hair and currently have thick, wavy, long hair past my belly button.  I get tons of compliments on how healthy, soft and great my hair looks after it&#x27;s been straightened, and it stays that way all day despite humidity.  I do quick touch ups on day 2, and it still looks like day 1. I use a heat protectant spray or Argan oil with it and any hair styling tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m shopping around for a new iron but think I may just get another Solia; it&#x27;s one of the most used presents I&#x27;ve gotten! Would highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> The rubber on the sides of the plates caught on and pulled my hair so I had a pile of hair on my lap at the end. Frankly I didn&#x27;t notice that it was that good of an iron to begin with. It took a while to get my thick hair done because I had to go over each section multiple times. I ended up returning because if I&#x27;m going to be damaging my hair it better come out looking fabulous and quickly. There was no shine or real smoothness like I&#x27;ve experienced with other higher end straighteners.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews before deciding on this Iron, the wires in my Chi fried so it was time to move away from the almighty CHI! This is worth every penny, I love it!</li>
            <li> This is an expensive straightener, but I couldn&#x27;t enjoy it more! Straightens my curls in a snap with one stroke! I would highly suggest investing in this. It does not come with any added bag or accessories as some people assume (I dont know why...), but still a great buy!</li>
            <li> This flat iron worked great until it stopped working.  It worked for 1 year and 1 week exactly.  I unplugged it yesterday, and when I plugged it in today, it just didn&#x27;t turn on.  I&#x27;m not sure why it stopped working.  For the price I expected it to work much longer than a year.</li>
            <li> After a big big big research for flat irons I decided to buy this solia, and I wasn&#x27;t wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever tried, ( and I&#x27;ve tried a lot) I personally recommend the 1-1/4&amp;#34; size, I think is faster, it works perfectly ,  this iron reaches the ideal temperature quickly, does not damage the hair and leaves it healthy and very smooth, really recommend it</li>
            <li> This flat iron works well on fine hair and has an adjustable heat setting.  No complaints, just wish it had an automatic off in case you rush out the door and leave the iron plugged in.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and the product is great.  I had to do some research on the best brands and here it is.  The price was great too.</li>
            <li> I have had this straightener for at least 5 or 6 YEARS. It is wonderful - zero complaints! I was not easy on it either - lots of travel, lots of drops. It just recently died though, so I am purchasing another one. Yes, I could find something cheaper but it is worth it to splurge for quality, durability, and reliability.</li>
            <li> A little heavier than my last one, but works well. I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> My favorite flat iron. I already had the small one so it was a no-brainer when I wanted a larger one. It&#x27;s worth the $$.</li>
            <li> This is my all-time favorite flat iron/hair straightener. Glides like silk, has a variety of settings and is a joy to work with. Straightens my hair beautifully!</li>
            <li> great flat iron with a great price.  Better than my chi that finally bit the dust</li>
            <li> Love, love, love.  Does a great job straightening my hair with one pass and it has temperature control.  The plates are really smooth and it has a good long cord.</li>
