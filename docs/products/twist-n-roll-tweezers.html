    <ol>

            <li>Amazing product!</li>
            <li>Its good for in between waxing touch ups, but I still need to wax also.</li>

            <li>I like this product it is good to use in between waxing.</li>
            <li>So good</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Works just as good and in the privacy in my own home..</li>
            <li>So I went on a hunt for something better, and this is it!</li>
            <li>And i&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with the results!  </li>
            <li>I love mine!</li>
            <li>Much better than waxing!</li>
            <li>I keep it handy and twist and roll every couple of days.  </li>
            <li>It works fairly well, give it a try and its cheap!</li>
            <li>The not so good points are that it does hurt (stinging) but now that I have most of the hair removed and am just doing the upkeep</li>
            <li>good points are the price was great, the ease of use is awesome and the removal of my facial fuzz is easy.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this is perfect.  </li>
            <li>The hair I am trying to remove is very fine.  </li>
            <li>I have been okay waxing and tweezing</li>
            <li>I love this product, hurts a bit</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t see that it works any better.</li>
            <li>It works best on peach-fuzz hair, not coarse hair.</li>
            <li>Well let me say, I am pleased beyond expectations.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is so much better.</li>
            <li>I love this product although it can hurt to use</li>
            <li>This way I keep my face nice and clean.  </li>
            <li>so I always have a nice clean face.  </li>
            <li>It takes a while to get use to and you really have to get a &#x27;technique&#x27; for it, but once you get how it works, you&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li>Other than that i&#x27;m very happy with the product, I will be keeping this on me and in the event that I lose it..</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use while watching TV, couldn&#x27;t be simpler.</li>
            <li>I am so over the waxing and bleaching of my facial hair that I thought for this great price</li>
            <li>must find the right speed and it yanks out more hair at once.  </li>
            <li>Used to give this kind of tweezer 4 stars, but I&#x27;ve discovered the one Amazon sells that is held in one (blue with squeeze handle), and I like it better than the ones that require both hands.</li>
            <li>I have a high pain tolerance, and I haven&#x27;t yet been able to successfully use it more than a few times before stopping from the pain.</li>
            <li>I happened across a shop that did threading hair removal and found that it was a quick way to remove a lot of facial hair with a nice smooth finish.  </li>
            <li>The Twist N Roll does a good enough job, but it takes a lot of practice to find the correct angle, amount of bend and speed to get it to work right.</li>
            <li>So amazing - even the heaviest, coarse hair is almost gone.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand how anyone finds this thing useful.  </li>
            <li>but you kind of expect it when your buying a product that removes facial hair</li>
            <li>I use a hot towel to help ease the pain.  </li>
            <li>I have facial hair on my upper lip and very coarse hair on my chin, since having my son the hair got thicker and started growing more, it seemed the more I waxed and tweezed the more that grew.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use the hot towel &amp; had no break outs.</li>
            <li>My daughter got higher price product</li>
            <li>let me try the product that looks exactly like the pricier ones.</li>
            <li>I love it because I don&#x27;t have to wait to go back to have the hair removed, I can do it at home whenever I have some hairs</li>
            <li>Basically it is only good for the upper lip...</li>
            <li>I think these are way better than shaving by a long ways.</li>
            <li>I am waiting to see if I grow a dark heavy beard from using this product, LOL!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t the &#x27;bearded lady&#x27; b4 &amp; certainly hope I&#x27;m not one after using this.</li>
            <li>Could you imagine how much that would hurt?</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t work that well.  </li>
            <li>i bought a 2nd one for a friend who uses it on her whole face and LOVES it!!!</li>
            <li>overall a decent product, not too thrilled not dissapointed i am in the middle with this one</li>
            <li>Watch the video and see how easy it is to remove those wild facial hairs.</li>
            <li>I would recommend you buy it here at Amazon, as I first purchased it directly from Grace Harvest and paid $15 for it.  </li>
            <li>but you can always go over with it until satisfied or i just get my tweezers out for those few hairs.</li>
            <li>It hurts like your using a normal tweezers.      </li>
            <li>The tool is really not hard to use, and can be done without even looking in a mirror.</li>
            <li>It takes a bit of practice, but I do notice that it removes the hair from the root and all kinds of hairs right from the fine ones to the thick ones.  </li>
            <li>It works the same way as threading and leaves the same smooth finish.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Overall, Its ok and i would recommend it to other people.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is so small and handy that if I am on the computer or watching TV, I will use product and I am distracted enough and yet getting the job done.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit tricky to nail down the proper finger-control to get this working correctly, but once you do, it&#x27;okay.  </li>
            <li>It seems like it works just as well as the others, while I may end up getting one of the more expensive ones down the road, this one is amazing.</li>
            <li>I have had facial hair for my whole adult life and have tried almost everything.  </li>
            <li>I have used it on my chin so far, and some on my upperlip, but not my eye brows yet</li>
            <li>A complete waxing/threading of my face costs $30.00.</li>
            <li>and also it does leave you a little red the first time but it dissapears quickly.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s co-worker has beautiful skin &amp; she told us this was her little secret.</li>
            <li>, i&#x27;m not sure that i can maneuver it well enough to shape my eye brows, maybe after some more use of it.</li>
            <li>I was my face with a small brush to make sure that my facial skin gets exfoliated so it does not allow ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>That i&#x27;m not so use to, because it has always been waxed off at once where it hurt anyways, or when tweezing, those hairs are so light and hard to see I never tweezed them.</li>
            <li>Works great, though is painful.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t completely remove all the facial hair but, it takes the majority off.</li>
            <li>The result is that you are sometimes left with snapped hair which can feel rough when you run your fingers through your skin surface ( i tried using it on the higher part of my cheecks).</li>
            <li>I then did laser for about 3 years which was fairly effective but expensive.  </li>
            <li>This also made it very painfull as it tugs at a lot of other hairs, but doesn&#x27;t pull them out.</li>
            <li>oh and it does hurt the first time, it made my eyes water a little bit, but if i can tolerate it, anyone can.</li>

            <li> Being a busy mother, I do not want to have to sit with a mirror and tweezers plucking every other day and waxing every week or so...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to pinpoint certain hairs</li>
            <li> The reviews I read prior to purchasing this product made me hopeful that it would deliver the expected results.  </li>
            <li> I wish I would have bought this a LONG time ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried removing it  slowly because there was so much area to cover.</li>
            <li> the price is reasonable, seeing as it is supposed to last at least a year if you take care of it, but i think it can last longer unless you mess with it a lot.</li>
            <li> The upper lip is the most painful for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The spring is just not strong enough to get enough hairs.</li>
            <li> what is there to loose besides [$...]</li>
            <li> It is like a loose spring that does not grab nor pluck out unwanted hair.  </li>
            <li> you can get this down, sit in front of the t.v, outside while children play...</li>
            <li> I bought this little tool since it was only about [...] bucks including shipping.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s because it pulls out some hairs but breaks off other hairs.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> It is a little painful especially when you first start using it.</li>
            <li> It hurts a little bit and it does what is says and pulls the hairs from the root.  </li>
            <li> and you get used to it after a few times.</li>
            <li> I watched a few on youtube before buying..</li>
            <li> It took a few times to get the hang of it, but it does work.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It requires several passes to get all the hairs of an area, often leaving a few behind still.</li>
            <li> I think people that give a bad review don&#x27;t know how to use it right.</li>
            <li> but it gets expensive and time extensive.</li>
            <li> The discomfort is so small</li>
            <li> I noticed that you can&#x27;t roll too faster or too slow,</li>
            <li> I did and still sometimes do get those red itchy bumps that I always got when waxed or threaded but not nearly as many or as bad.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to get it to work well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was not happy with these tweezers.</li>
            <li> It is less painful than waxing and does not damage your skin.  </li>
            <li> it does not work on the other parts of my face:(</li>
            <li> I found this product painful and difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just doing it wrong, but it seems to pull hair painfully, then break it off at the point the spring is pinching.</li>
            <li> It has been sitting in the junk drawer ever since the disappointing day it arrived in the mail.</li>
            <li> Very expensive and not permanent hair removal.  </li>
            <li> I then tried tweezing for a while until it got so bad that I just couldn&#x27;t keep up anymore.  </li>
            <li> Of course it is painful because it is pulling out the hairs.. basically trapping the hairs in a coil and pulling them out (Genius!)</li>
            <li> I also hated to have to wait between appointments and would have hair growth that looked unsightly before going for another appointment.  </li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s very painful.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> i decided to look up and easier way to pluck hairs out rather than the time consuming plucking, and i came accross this item on the internet. i found it on amazon and decided to try it. the price is reasonable, seeing as it is supposed to last at least a year if you take care of it, but i think it can last longer unless you mess with it a lot. it does pluck out the hairs, but i found that it doesnt do too well on finer hairs and does miss some, hence the four stars. but you can always go over with it until satisfied or i just get my tweezers out for those few hairs. overall a decent product, not too thrilled not dissapointed i am in the middle with this one but i will continue to use it. oh and it does hurt the first time, it made my eyes water a little bit, but if i can tolerate it, anyone can. and you get used to it after a few times. i no longer feel the pain from it. and also it does leave you a little red the first time but it dissapears quickly. if you are deciding on this product i would reccomend you try it. what is there to loose besides [$...] bucks and some hair.</li>
            <li> My friend let me borrow her twist n roll and I&#x27;m going to purchase one myself.  It pulls out a lot of hair at once and gets them by the root.  I use a hot towel to help ease the pain.  I noticed that you can&#x27;t roll too faster or too slow, must find the right speed and it yanks out more hair at once.  It hurts like your using a normal tweezers.      I used it on my upper lip and my cheeks.    Don&#x27;t use it on your eyelids to do your eyebrows.  There are people who have gotten their eyelashes stuck in the spring.  Could you imagine how much that would hurt?</li>
            <li> I was not happy with these tweezers. I had to use them on the same spot several times and it only got 2 or 3 hairs at a time. This also made it very painfull as it tugs at a lot of other hairs, but doesn&#x27;t pull them out. The spring is just not strong enough to get enough hairs. It would be easier to use regular tweezers.</li>
            <li> I have facial hair on my upper lip and very coarse hair on my chin, since having my son the hair got thicker and started growing more, it seemed the more I waxed and tweezed the more that grew. I have been okay waxing and tweezing but it gets expensive and time extensive. Being a busy mother, I do not want to have to sit with a mirror and tweezers plucking every other day and waxing every week or so... So I went on a hunt for something better, and this is it! Amazing product! I saw the others, but opted for this one because it was cheaper.. And i&#x27;m glad I did! It seems like it works just as well as the others, while I may end up getting one of the more expensive ones down the road, this one is amazing. It takes a while to get use to and you really have to get a &#x27;technique&#x27; for it, but once you get how it works, you&#x27;re good. (WATCH THE VIDEOS ON IT!) I watched a few on youtube before buying.. you can get this down, sit in front of the t.v, outside while children play... anywhere you are comfy and do this. I don&#x27;t even feel the need to see in the mirror before/after i&#x27;m doing it. It has not irritated me at all, nor has it left any redness for me. Of course it is painful because it is pulling out the hairs.. basically trapping the hairs in a coil and pulling them out (Genius!) But since i&#x27;m SO use to waxing and tweezing anyways, It don&#x27;t affect me any.. I have used it on my chin so far, and some on my upperlip, but not my eye brows yet, i&#x27;m not sure that i can maneuver it well enough to shape my eye brows, maybe after some more use of it. However on my upper lip, it was pulling hairs around my lip line (YOWCH!) That i&#x27;m not so use to, because it has always been waxed off at once where it hurt anyways, or when tweezing, those hairs are so light and hard to see I never tweezed them. Other than that i&#x27;m very happy with the product, I will be keeping this on me and in the event that I lose it.. I will be back!! Already suggested it to my girlfriends!</li>
            <li> I think these are way better than shaving by a long ways.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used tweezers and ladies razors for years.  The hair on my chin was getting ahead of me and was so embarrassing.  After looking on-line at this tool for several months, I finally ordered one.  Wow!  So amazing - even the heaviest, coarse hair is almost gone.  I&#x27;ve tried removing it  slowly because there was so much area to cover. I am so pleased with the results!  The tool is really not hard to use, and can be done without even looking in a mirror.</li>
            <li> Works great, though is painful.  It removes several hairs at once.  The pain is similar to what you feel when you pluck hairs, only you are pulling out several hairs at one time.  It is less painful than waxing and does not damage your skin.  I have sensitive skin and this is perfect.  I would recommend you buy it here at Amazon, as I first purchased it directly from Grace Harvest and paid $15 for it.  Save money by ordering through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this product, hurts a bit but you get used to the pinch feeling. Ordering another for my mother.</li>
            <li> Product does work, but it doesnt remove all the hair in the area compeltely like waxing does.  Its good for in between waxing touch ups, but I still need to wax also.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me. I wanted to like it and gave it several chances but it only grabbed a hair here and there...thats it. Read directions twice and the reviews on here for tips but it still did not work like it says it does.  I will just stick to tweezing.</li>
            <li> I am waiting to see if I grow a dark heavy beard from using this product, LOL! The discomfort is so small I don&#x27;t know why people complain!! Tweezing is not painless, but as with this product it is tolerable. I didn&#x27;t use the hot towel &amp; had no break outs. When u feel the &#x27;sensation&#x27; u know the hair is being removed! I wasn&#x27;t the &#x27;bearded lady&#x27; b4 &amp; certainly hope I&#x27;m not one after using this. I had a post menapausal mustache &amp; peach fuzz on my face that seems to be increasing with age &amp; life changes. It is so easy to use while watching TV, couldn&#x27;t be simpler. My daughter&#x27;s co-worker has beautiful skin &amp; she told us this was her little secret. If u use, esp. mineral make-up, u will notice u are using about 1/3 the amt after ur hair removal. Just don&#x27;t get too close to ur eyebrows because it will snatch them out too! I am very pleased with this product. Everyone of my GFs have asked me to order them one, so my skin must look good. My daughter got higher price product but I don&#x27;t see that it works any better. Time will tell.</li>
            <li> Used to go get threaded until I discovered this. Works just as good and in the privacy in my own home..</li>
            <li> I like this product it is good to use in between waxing. It is a little painful especially when you first start using it. It doesn&#x27;t completely remove all the facial hair but, it takes the majority off.</li>
            <li> I found this product painful and difficult to use. Maybe I&#x27;m just doing it wrong, but it seems to pull hair painfully, then break it off at the point the spring is pinching. I have a high pain tolerance, and I haven&#x27;t yet been able to successfully use it more than a few times before stopping from the pain.</li>
            <li> It took a few times to get the hang of it, but it does work.  I keep it handy and twist and roll every couple of days.  This way I keep my face nice and clean.  The only place I do not seem to get it to work well is for my eyebrows, you need a regular tweezer for that.  This tool paid for itself in one application.  A complete waxing/threading of my face costs $30.00.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit tricky to nail down the proper finger-control to get this working correctly, but once you do, it&#x27;okay.  It works best on peach-fuzz hair, not coarse hair.</li>
            <li> This thing works - it does pull out hairs. However, it&#x27;s very painful. Then, several days after using this thing, you get tons of ingrown hairs. I think it&#x27;s because it pulls out some hairs but breaks off other hairs. I won&#x27;t ever use it again because of the ingrown hairs it creates.</li>
            <li> I bought this little tool since it was only about [...] bucks including shipping. I also bought this to use on my face and it does work with thicker and longer hairs. It hurts a little bit and it does what is says and pulls the hairs from the root.  The only downside I found with this item was that it tends to miss the thinner hairs. Not only that but it also snaps the the thinner hairs instead of yanking them out from the root. The result is that you are sometimes left with snapped hair which can feel rough when you run your fingers through your skin surface ( i tried using it on the higher part of my cheecks). Overall, Its ok and i would recommend it to other people. It works fairly well, give it a try and its cheap!</li>
            <li> It is very hard to get it to work well.&lt;br /&gt;It requires several passes to get all the hairs of an area, often leaving a few behind still.</li>
            <li> I bought a bunch of these and gave it to all my friends . Watch the video and see how easy it is to remove those wild facial hairs.</li>
            <li> The reviews I read prior to purchasing this product made me hopeful that it would deliver the expected results.  I don&#x27;t understand how anyone finds this thing useful.  It is like a loose spring that does not grab nor pluck out unwanted hair.  It has been sitting in the junk drawer ever since the disappointing day it arrived in the mail.</li>
            <li> Basically it is only good for the upper lip...it does not work on the other parts of my face:(</li>
            <li> I am so over the waxing and bleaching of my facial hair that I thought for this great price let me try the product that looks exactly like the pricier ones. Well let me say, I am pleased beyond expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good points are the price was great, the ease of use is awesome and the removal of my facial fuzz is easy. The not so good points are that it does hurt (stinging) but now that I have most of the hair removed and am just doing the upkeep it is so much better. I did and still sometimes do get those red itchy bumps that I always got when waxed or threaded but not nearly as many or as bad. The upper lip is the most painful for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is so small and handy that if I am on the computer or watching TV, I will use product and I am distracted enough and yet getting the job done. I wish I would have bought this a LONG time ago.</li>
            <li> I think people that give a bad review don&#x27;t know how to use it right. I love mine! I only have to use it like every two weeks. Much better than waxing!</li>
            <li> Still have to get my eyebrows done at the mall but i save $5 every time i use this b/c it works GREAT on my lip!!  Hurts like hell, but so does the tread, treading or waxing!!  I HIGHLY recommend it! So good i bought a 2nd one for a friend who uses it on her whole face and LOVES it!!!</li>
            <li> The hair I am trying to remove is very fine.  The Twist N Roll does a good enough job, but it takes a lot of practice to find the correct angle, amount of bend and speed to get it to work right.</li>
            <li> I have had facial hair for my whole adult life and have tried almost everything.  I did electrolysis for about 10 years.  Very expensive and not permanent hair removal.  I then tried tweezing for a while until it got so bad that I just couldn&#x27;t keep up anymore.  I then did laser for about 3 years which was fairly effective but expensive.  When I stopped going, the hair all came back again so it is obvious that this is not permanent hair either.  I also hated to have to wait between appointments and would have hair growth that looked unsightly before going for another appointment.  I happened across a shop that did threading hair removal and found that it was a quick way to remove a lot of facial hair with a nice smooth finish.  My daughter pointed out this produce as it says &amp;#34;threading hair removal&amp;#34; so I thought I would give it a try.  It works the same way as threading and leaves the same smooth finish.  I love it because I don&#x27;t have to wait to go back to have the hair removed, I can do it at home whenever I have some hairs so I always have a nice clean face.  It takes a bit of practice, but I do notice that it removes the hair from the root and all kinds of hairs right from the fine ones to the thick ones.  The hair can be just peaking through and the tool will remove them when they are very short.  I was my face with a small brush to make sure that my facial skin gets exfoliated so it does not allow ingrown hairs.  I would recommend this tool for facial hair removal to everyone!</li>
            <li> I love this product although it can hurt to use but you kind of expect it when your buying a product that removes facial hair</li>
            <li> Used to give this kind of tweezer 4 stars, but I&#x27;ve discovered the one Amazon sells that is held in one (blue with squeeze handle), and I like it better than the ones that require both hands. The one-handed hair remover with the squeeze handle catches finer hairs than the ones requiring both hands.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t work that well.  It&#x27;s hard to pinpoint certain hairs and I have to go over the same ones over and over until finally it gets it.  Tweezing takes like a fourth of the time and works just as well.  Not worth it.</li>
